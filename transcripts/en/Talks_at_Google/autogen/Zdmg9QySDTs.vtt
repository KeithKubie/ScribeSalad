00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.450
MALE SPEAKER: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.620
Today for the Talks
at Google series,

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.300
we have with us Lauren Mayberry,
the lead singer of the band

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.620
Chvrches, as well as the
rest of the band, who

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.740
will be playing a
musical set at the end.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.243
Coming onto this scene--

00:00:19.243 --> 00:00:20.602
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.140
coming onto the scene two years
ago with their song "Lies,"

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.250
their subsequent single
"The Mother We Share,"

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.299
as well as their debut album,
"The Bones of What you Believe"

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.530
helped propel Chvrches
to the top five

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.400
of BBC'S Sound of 2013, an
award-winning appearance

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.424
at South by Southwest,
and a worldwide tour.

00:00:42.424 --> 00:00:43.965
Please join me in
welcoming Chvrches.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.070
Now most recently, I think
a lot of the audience

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.530
was expecting to see you
guys at Outside Lands,

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.080
but I hear there
was a little issue--

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.160
LAUREN MAYBERRY: Don't bring
it up, don't bring it up.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.868
MALE SPEAKER: No?

00:01:01.868 --> 00:01:02.369
OK.

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:04.368
LAUREN MAYBERRY: We're
still quite sad about it,

00:01:04.368 --> 00:01:05.180
to be honest.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.930
MALE SPEAKER: From
what I heard, it

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.334
was the airport's fault, so--

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:08.250
LAUREN MAYBERRY: Yeah.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.137
It was a catalogue of
disasters within an airport,

00:01:12.137 --> 00:01:13.970
and then there was quite
upsetting bit where

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.690
me and Martin got on
the plane and could

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.480
see everybody else at the gate,
but they wouldn't let them

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.987
on the plane even though we
could see them out the window.

00:01:20.987 --> 00:01:22.820
And then we sat on the
runway for 45 minutes

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.320
while they offloaded
all their bags,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.800
but they weren't
allowed in the pit.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.090
This is very upsetting.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.890
But it's OK.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.157
We're going to try and get
a show in San Francisco

00:01:33.157 --> 00:01:35.240
at the start of the next--
shh, don't tell anyone.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.282
We haven't figured out
exactly when yet, but shh.

00:01:37.282 --> 00:01:38.823
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
I think we're all

00:01:38.823 --> 00:01:40.560
looking forward to it, then.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.200
AUDIENCE: Is this
live streaming?

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.940
LAUREN MAYBERRY: No, it's OK.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.774
We don't know when.

00:01:44.774 --> 00:01:45.440
It might happen.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.670
We hope it'll happen.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.330
MALE SPEAKER: All
right, so a year ago,

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.140
you wrote an article
for "The Guardian"

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.410
about the perils of
being a front woman

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.300
in a band in the
social media age.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.290
Now, as a band born
on the internet,

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.130
I take it that social
media and being

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.190
able to communicate
with your fans

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.610
is incredibly
important to you guys.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.460
But at the same time, this
also opened up some avenues

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.659
for abusive comments well beyond
just normal musical criticism.

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:15.200
Could you talk a
little bit about how

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.200
you guys use social
media to interact

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.850
with fans and the
experiences that

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.730
led you to write that
article for "The Guardian"?

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.190
LAUREN MAYBERRY:
Yeah, I guess for us,

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.370
we came about getting signed
in a reasonably orthodox way.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.699
We didn't go about
the traditional tour

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:34.490
the UK for however many
years and then tour

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.794
Europe, and so on.

00:02:35.794 --> 00:02:37.710
We came to a lot of
people's attention because

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.470
of online streaming and
blogs, and people just passing

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.640
the songs to each other
on social networks.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.290
We operated unsigned
for quite a long time

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.530
and it was just important for us
to use those things as a medium

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.700
to communicate with people,
get them information.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.830
I grew up in the MSN era of
being on band message boards

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.280
and street teams and things like
that, so from my point view,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.960
social networks for us are
like online street teams.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.910
There's been definitely
overwhelmingly

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.350
positive parts of that
for us, but because we

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.360
oversee that
ourselves, I suppose

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.230
when you're logging to
do all those things,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.710
sometimes you get a little rape
threat over your breakfast,

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.555
and that's fine.

00:03:21.555 --> 00:03:23.052
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:23.052 --> 00:03:26.670
Well, it's not fine,
I guess is the point.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.640
We posted this screen grab of
an example that we got sent,

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.560
and it wasn't even something
terribly, terribly offensive.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.000
I was like, this
is just generally

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.370
the tone of some of this stuff.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.222
Please stop.

00:03:37.222 --> 00:03:39.180
And then "The Guardian"
gave us the opportunity

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.270
to expand on it a bit.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.240
I think the response was
generally positive to us

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.168
from people in bands or
people we meet at shows,

00:03:48.168 --> 00:03:50.670
but I don't know if
it changed the world

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.310
in any revolutionary way.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.530
But speaking about it is
probably quite helpful,

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.680
and then figuring out that other
people actually agree with you

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.054
and the world
isn't actually just

00:03:58.054 --> 00:04:00.710
full of horrible,
abusive internet trolls.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.820
It's good to know.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.390
MALE SPEAKER: YouTube just
recently changed its policy

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.180
on allowing anonymous
names for leaving comments.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.590
You can now leave a
comment anonymously.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.720
I want to know your opinion
on whether that will affect

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.459
anything, or is this
something that's

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.120
going to happen regardless of
if people's names are associated

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.200
with their messages?

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.500
LAUREN MAYBERRY: So they
can now leave a message?

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.800
MALE SPEAKER: Now they can
leave them anonymously.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.290
LAUREN MAYBERRY: I've never
actually left a comment

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.820
on YouTube in my
life ever, so I'm

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.890
like oh, that would be
a weird thing to do.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.049
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:35.049 --> 00:04:35.840
Yeah, I don't know.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.040
I guess I was thinking
about this earlier,

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.954
but for me, it's about personal
responsibility, and then

00:04:43.954 --> 00:04:45.120
who is responsible for that?

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.100
If people are posting
abusive things,

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.620
who's the fall guy for that?

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.810
Is the social networks,
or is it the person,

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.750
or should law enforcement
be talking about that?

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.030
Who is responsible?

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.630
I think where people
are allowed to be

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.590
anonymous means that
they feel like there's

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.960
less of a fallout or something.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.160
I feel like to an extent, when
people are on the internet--

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.712
no offense, because I know
you guys are the internet--

00:05:09.712 --> 00:05:12.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.319
there's a certain level of
where you're removed from that,

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:17.610
so maybe you don't feel as
much personal responsibility

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:18.151
or something.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.160
I'm not sure.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.949
I'm worried about that.

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:23.490
MALE SPEAKER: You
also talk about one

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.640
of this problem stemming from
kind of a lack of empathy

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.840
on the side of the people
who are leaving the comments.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.440
Here at Google, we have
a very global reach,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.810
and I was wondering if there's
any suggestions you have

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.210
for either Google or really the
industry in general about how

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.630
to promote a sense of
empathy in our applications.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.270
We're really changing the
way that people interact,

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.100
bringing it online, and
it'd be great to bring

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.580
that sense of well-being that
we have in real life online.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.500
LAUREN MAYBERRY:
Yeah, I guess anything

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.720
like that is probably
helpful, I think--

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.950
trying to change the
tone of conversations.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.990
But in my mind, it's
the stuff that we've

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.170
received is just a more
exaggerated version of what

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.580
happens in real life.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.260
It's the chicken and
egg thing for me.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.050
Does that reflect society,
or does the society

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.000
reflect-- it's kind
of hard to tell which.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.797
I don't think that threatening
and abusive exists only online.

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:22.880
People probably wouldn't
say as much of that right

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.851
to your face, but
then there's a reason

00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:27.350
why people think it's OK to say
those things because there's

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.780
a certain thread
throughout society that

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.349
makes people think that's fine.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.890
It's not like the
only time ever I've

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.050
had anybody say anything
offensive or sexist

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.640
to me is in this
band on the internet.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.170
That happens to
people all the time.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.262
I was coming out of
a subway in Glasgow

00:06:40.262 --> 00:06:42.220
and somebody-- it was
the last subway at night,

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.725
and someone showed me
his penis and said,

00:06:44.725 --> 00:06:46.600
do you think you're too
good for it, darling?

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.980
Which is funny now,
maybe, but at the time,

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.760
I was like 21 coming
home from work,

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.760
and I was like, it's not
funny when you're there

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.935
on the receiving end
of that, so to speak.

00:06:56.935 --> 00:06:59.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:00.640
What do you say?

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:04.650
I'm like 5'2.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.940
It was like 11:30 at night.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.106
He's a massive guy and had
two other mates with him.

00:07:08.106 --> 00:07:10.794
What am I supposed
to do about that?

00:07:10.794 --> 00:07:12.710
Maybe he goes around
leaving horrible comments

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:13.340
on the internet.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:13.881
I don't know.

00:07:13.881 --> 00:07:15.600
Or maybe he's busy
doing it in real life.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.010
It's hard to say.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.480
MALE SPEAKER: It seemed
like-- obviously, you

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.787
chose to speak up.

00:07:22.787 --> 00:07:24.620
Part of the article was
that you're not just

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.790
going to "deal with
it" as a lot of people

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:31.140
told you to do when you
wrote the article originally.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.730
What side of the problem do
you think stems from, say,

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.080
other female celebrities or
other women in general just

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.579
kind of dealing with it?

00:07:39.579 --> 00:07:41.870
Because I feel like people
wouldn't tell you to do that

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.950
if it wasn't-- a majority of the
people were just dealing with

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.140
it, so to speak.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.250
What problems stem from that?

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.990
LAUREN MAYBERRY: Well, I guess
the thing that was confusing

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:57.930
for me was that most people
were supportive of what we were

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:00.430
saying, but there was a definite
strain in the conversation

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.620
where people were
saying that the onus is

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.580
on us to accept it
and deal with it.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.540
That to me is just a follow up
from a victim-blaming culture

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.040
where people are like, well,
it's up to you to deal with it.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.630
It's not up to those people
to not behave like that.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.620
It's up to you to suck
it up and deal with it.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.329
I was like, it's bad.

00:08:20.329 --> 00:08:22.370
It's awful if that's
happening to you when you're

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:24.078
using the internet in
a personal capacity

00:08:24.078 --> 00:08:26.700
because everyone has the right
to use the internet to seek out

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.632
knowledge and do nice
stuff on the internet.

00:08:30.632 --> 00:08:32.090
I was like, this
is something we're

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:33.673
doing in the course
of our employment.

00:08:33.673 --> 00:08:37.150
So if I want to be in a band
and have a social network,

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.470
then I need to accept that?

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:44.609
I think that's a pretty
confusing way to look at it.

00:08:44.609 --> 00:08:46.150
Also, I suppose
probably a lot people

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.381
don't want to talk about that
because I think it paints you

00:08:49.381 --> 00:08:51.130
in a certain light or
something like that.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.109
But for me, these are things
that we think personally

00:08:54.109 --> 00:08:55.900
anyway, and it's
something you're coming up

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.626
against in your day-to-day
job and your day-to-day life.

00:08:59.626 --> 00:09:01.000
I don't really
see why you should

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.970
have to sacrifice doing
things that you would normally

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:07.620
do in order to appease what I
hope is a minority of people.

00:09:09.835 --> 00:09:12.210
MALE SPEAKER: At least in
terms of the Google properties,

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.320
we can detect and
delete comments

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.540
that would be considered
abusive pretty easily.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.900
But at the same time, obviously
you wouldn't see them then,

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.295
and that would give you
some sense of relief.

00:09:23.295 --> 00:09:25.920
Do you think it's only going to
encourage the problem if people

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.500
feel like they can
leave these comments

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.041
and they're actually going to
be deleted before they show up?

00:09:30.041 --> 00:09:37.291
So that generates anger and mean
harboring feelings towards you

00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:38.540
on the side of the commenters.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.270
Do you think deleting
these comments would

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.911
help fix the
problem, or is it--?

00:09:44.911 --> 00:09:45.410
do

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.729
LAUREN MAYBERRY: I don't know.

00:09:47.729 --> 00:09:49.270
I thought about it
a lot when we were

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.160
trying to figure out
how to deal with it.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.190
I was like, yes, it
does make me feel better

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.550
if I don't see any
of these things.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.460
But then I was like,
the option then

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.918
in order to not
see those things is

00:09:58.918 --> 00:10:01.420
to not partake in that part
of the job and not do that.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:07.250
I guess that always gets
guess my back quite a lot

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.060
when people bring up the
freedom of speech thing.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.690
I'm like, well, freedom
of hateful speech--

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.320
is that allowed?

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.112
I think there is a
freedom of speech issue,

00:10:16.112 --> 00:10:18.570
but from my point of view, it's
not the commenter's freedom

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.132
of speech, it's our
freedom of speech

00:10:20.132 --> 00:10:21.590
to go about doing
what we're doing.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:22.965
And in order to
do that, then you

00:10:22.965 --> 00:10:26.890
have to accept someone
talking to you like that.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.515
Yet whenever people
bring up the, yeah,

00:10:28.515 --> 00:10:30.639
but I can say what I want
because it's a free world

00:10:30.639 --> 00:10:32.203
and I'm on the internet.

00:10:32.203 --> 00:10:34.370
I'm like, you're free
to say what you want

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.460
but not be a prick.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.835
I feel like that should be
like-- you need to write that

00:10:38.835 --> 00:10:41.380
into the European
Convention on Human Rights.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:45.190
Freedom of speech, brackets,
but not if you're prick.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.780
I don't know.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:48.710
How do you change it?

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:52.330
I think it's great that
companies like yourselves

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.520
are trying to make a statement
on something like that.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.580
But I feel like there's
probably quite a long way

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.400
to go before it trickles
down into actual day-to-day

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.450
attitudes.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.875
MALE SPEAKER: You talked
about the story you had

00:11:04.875 --> 00:11:07.350
of experiencing this
in real life, as well.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:10.880
Would you consider these abuse
of comments online an evolution

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.730
of catcalling and other
street harassment,

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.610
or is this its own
separate thing?

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.110
LAUREN MAYBERRY: I
think it probably

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:23.304
evolves from the
same beginning point.

00:11:23.304 --> 00:11:24.720
That made no sense,
that sentence.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.820
They come from the
same starting point,

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.600
I think, the same
kind of attitude

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.660
that if a woman is
in a public place,

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:36.285
then she's automatically opening
herself up to these things.

00:11:36.285 --> 00:11:40.630
The distance created between
people on the internet

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.050
helps people.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.444
I've never had anyone
say to my face,

00:11:44.444 --> 00:11:46.610
you think this is rape
culture-- you won't know this

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:47.820
until I come around
and rape you,

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.250
but they do it on the internet.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.070
If someone said that
to me in real life,

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:52.029
I would be very alarmed
and you would obviously

00:11:52.029 --> 00:11:53.111
report them to the police.

00:11:53.111 --> 00:11:55.240
But if it's on the internet,
then people are like,

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.389
oh, it's the internet.

00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:57.430
It's harmless, it's fine.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.460
I'm like, hmm?

00:11:59.460 --> 00:11:59.960
Is it?

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.250
MALE SPEAKER: Either before
you wrote the article

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:09.000
or afterwards, did you have any
mentors either in the industry

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.990
or in your life that
had previous experience

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.830
with something like this and
were able to help walk you

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.080
through it, or is that something
that you think maybe the music

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.240
industry or things in general
need to have accessible?

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:30.837
LAUREN MAYBERRY: I didn't speak
to anyone about it in that way.

00:12:30.837 --> 00:12:33.170
There's always people I've
admired in terms of musicians

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.150
and how they conduct
themselves professionally

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.530
and things like
that, but I guess

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.595
it would've been good if
there was a how-to guide where

00:12:40.595 --> 00:12:41.970
you could be like,
what was this?

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:45.140
Like OK, scroll to that
page, and then oh right, OK.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.130
Just ignore it, OK.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:48.750
I don't know.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:54.210
I guess that's probably why it
was so confusing, I suppose,

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:57.490
because we're really
supportive of each other.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:59.064
I'm the only woman in this band.

00:12:59.064 --> 00:13:01.230
I've always been in bands
with very supportive guys,

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.420
but I've always been the
only female in those bands,

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.090
so people can
empathize with you.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.910
I guess it's not as
threatening because it's not

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:11.310
directed at them.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.972
I don't know.

00:13:13.972 --> 00:13:15.570
I'm not sure.

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:18.590
Like, women experience
that on some level

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.330
at some point in their
lives, definitely.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.910
So I guess maybe you learned
from the textbook of life

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:23.490
or something.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.621
I'm not sure.

00:13:25.621 --> 00:13:27.620
MALE SPEAKER: Have you
found that these problems

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:31.600
have stemmed from any specific
social networks in general,

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.410
or is it kind of a
broad thing that you've

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:34.880
experienced everywhere?

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.736
Like, is it harder to be a prick
in 140 characters on Twitter?

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:41.860
LAUREN MAYBERRY: Sometimes
they're quite inventive,

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:42.360
I suppose.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.987
I would say the worst
one is Facebook.

00:13:47.987 --> 00:13:50.320
Which is strange to me, because
there's technically more

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.903
anonymity on Twitter
because you don't

00:13:51.903 --> 00:13:53.180
need to use your real name.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.860
If your account
gets deleted, you

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.569
can make another one
however many hours later,

00:13:57.569 --> 00:13:59.110
whereas I suppose
with Facebook, they

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.910
want you to use your real
name if you do, I don't know.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:08.259
That's definitely where most
of the comments were coming in.

00:14:08.259 --> 00:14:10.050
And also because we
still had at that point

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.230
the direct message
function on, which

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.280
is another further
removal for those people.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.500
They're like, we are
contacting you on the internet

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.041
and it can't be seen
by other people,

00:14:20.041 --> 00:14:22.580
so I can say it directly to
you, whatever I wish to say.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.800
Obviously, we figured out
how to turn that off now.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.940
So that's much better.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.640
Even now, if you post-- I think
I reshared an article that

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:36.110
was on Mic website and
it was about an advert

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.790
in "Sound on Sound" that
was advertising microphones.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:42.160
It was like a naked
woman from the side

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.963
and you could see her
ass and stuff in it.

00:14:44.963 --> 00:14:46.546
To me, I was like,
that's not-- what's

00:14:46.546 --> 00:14:48.230
that got to do with
advertising microphones?

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:49.900
But it was a really
interesting article

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:54.090
that the guy who used
to run [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.600
and then underneath it, people
were just like shut up and go

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.340
back to doing what you're
supposed to be doing.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.200
I don't want to read this.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.410
I want to come here
and listen to music.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.100
I don't want-- why are you
talking about this shit?

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:02.930
It's not relevant.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.596
I was like, that
article is about music.

00:15:04.596 --> 00:15:05.790
I think it's relevant.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.310
But seeing it all kind of
unfold again, you're like,

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:09.080
I'll let it go.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.786
That's fine.

00:15:10.786 --> 00:15:12.160
I guess the good
thing for us now

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.840
is that if people know
where we stand on it,

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.631
they kind of self-police
a little bit more.

00:15:15.631 --> 00:15:17.150
So rather than us
having to go in

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.760
and being like, ban user,
oh dear, and go through,

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.540
people have more of a
discussion about it,

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.097
so I guess that's positive.

00:15:24.097 --> 00:15:25.930
But I don't really know
how much that really

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.500
changes people's
minds about things.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.600
MALE SPEAKER: Do you do
you ever respond directly

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.800
to these comments?

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.350
Maybe in the beginning when you
first started receiving them,

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.090
or do you generally
just try to steer clear?

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.540
Basically, any advice
you'd have for people

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.907
who receive these
sort of things.

00:15:42.907 --> 00:15:45.240
LAUREN MAYBERRY: I think it's
a difficult line to tread,

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.184
because my instinct tells me
that every time somebody says

00:15:48.184 --> 00:15:49.600
that, then if you
were threatened,

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.830
then you need to go
in on the offensive

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.120
and just call people out on it.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.930
But I suppose I've got
quite a busy day most days,

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:01.870
and I also don't have
a huge amount of time

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:05.426
to troll through and be like,
oh great, that's happened.

00:16:05.426 --> 00:16:06.550
What would your mother say?

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.500
Things like that.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.210
I guess it's just trying to
gauge it on a day-to-day basis.

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:15.590
I think before we made
any comment on it,

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.890
it was taking quite
a personal toll

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.820
to constantly be the person
that has to be like no, stop it.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.250
No, stop it.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.166
It got to the point where
I was like, I'm just

00:16:24.166 --> 00:16:26.180
going to delete the
comments and ban the users,

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:30.430
but you can't ban people from
life, so that's a problem.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:31.775
That sounds really totalitarian.

00:16:31.775 --> 00:16:33.650
I'm like, get them all
and put them in a bin,

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.800
but I don't mean that.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.070
MALE SPEAKER: In the article
you tread pretty lightly

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:40.340
around the word feminist.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:45.210
You treat it as if maybe
there's some connotations

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.530
that you don't want to
associate with yourself.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:49.780
You make a comment that you
don't hate men in general.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.970
That you're speaking
feminism in terms

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.200
of equality for the sexes.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.855
Do you think that the term in
general has become unfriendly?

00:17:00.977 --> 00:17:03.060
LAUREN MAYBERRY: I think
the start of the sentence

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.462
says, "I am a
feminist" because I am.

00:17:05.462 --> 00:17:06.836
And I feel like
all the caveats I

00:17:06.836 --> 00:17:08.839
put in after that were
to counter what people

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:10.190
say to you when you say that.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.564
They're like oh,
so you hate men.

00:17:11.564 --> 00:17:13.000
Oh, well, all
these other things.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:13.810
No, I don't know.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:15.288
That's just a
stereotype that has

00:17:15.288 --> 00:17:17.579
been made to discredit what
people are saying about it,

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.599
I think.

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:21.890
I have no problem identifying
as that because to me,

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:25.829
it means somebody who seeks
equality between all people.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:29.650
It's not about making
women better than men.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.300
A white middle class woman's
agenda shouldn't be about that.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:36.330
It should be about generally
society being a bit less shit

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.609
sometimes.

00:17:38.609 --> 00:17:40.650
I think there's loads of
great examples of people

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:44.310
who are making something like
that more accessible to people.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:48.620
Because I guess for me, I
learned about it through music.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.420
And then I figured out what
those people are reading

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.040
and who they were
influenced by, and that's

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:58.850
how I got into feminist
literature and stuff.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:01.839
It can feel academic and
strange in that regard.

00:18:01.839 --> 00:18:04.380
I think the internet has been
really helpful for that, things

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:10.830
like Feministing and Jezebel and
stuff making it more not even

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.090
necessarily pop
culture-based, but just more

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:16.640
conversational and hopefully
more representative

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.190
of more peoples, because it's
about your everyday issues.

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:22.440
It shouldn't just be in a
book in a library somewhere.

00:18:25.677 --> 00:18:27.760
MALE SPEAKER: What prompted
me to reach out to you

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.060
guys in the first
place was an article

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.750
I read in the January issue
of "Pacific Standard."

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.970
It's about a
writer, Amanda Hess,

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:41.260
who covers her experiences
with these comments.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:45.150
She talks about how she receives
these comments where people

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.390
are threatening to come
to her house, which,

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.290
if it had happened in
a real life experience,

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:51.870
if you went to the
police with that,

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.860
they would get a
restraining order.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.270
They'd take some sort of action.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.380
But because she received these
comments on the internet,

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.950
the police brushed it off.

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:02.697
They acted as if it
wasn't important.

00:19:02.697 --> 00:19:04.530
They told her to get
back in touch with them

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.900
if someone actually
shows up, which

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.950
seems like there's a lot of
room for something bad to happen

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:10.610
there.

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:14.590
Do you think as we transition
to more digital interactions

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:18.620
that we risk losing some of
the standards and etiquette

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.080
that we've built
up over the years

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.890
and that some of the
safety might disappear

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:27.530
as these things go online?

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:28.780
LAUREN MAYBERRY: I don't know.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:32.030
I guess that as
technology develops

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.960
and society changes,
then laws need

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.440
to adapt to cater for that.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.840
I suppose right now is
a pretty big gray area

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.960
because if they're
like no physical threat

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.031
has happened upon you, then
what can the police really do

00:19:47.031 --> 00:19:47.530
about it?

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:50.230
But then I just think it
adds to the people feeling

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:54.030
more alone and more
vulnerable and more isolated.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:20:00.190
I suppose the thing with that
is even if-- Amanda Hess,

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:01.190
you can find her online.

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:02.200
She's very well known.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.150
But even if it was like a
conventional stalking thing,

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:06.640
the victim still
doesn't have-- I

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.830
think that's what she
says in the piece.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.371
The victim doesn't
have the anonymity

00:20:09.371 --> 00:20:11.650
of the person
that's abusing them

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.300
because they are the known
person whether they are

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.150
a well-known person or
just-- you don't have

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.240
to be a journalist or
in a band or whatever

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.770
to encounter that kind of stuff.

00:20:23.904 --> 00:20:25.570
Something needs to
be done to figure out

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:28.180
what to do about that,
but who knows what it is?

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.480
I don't.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.272
MALE SPEAKER: We'll
try to figure that out.

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:32.521
LAUREN MAYBERRY: Yeah, please.

00:20:32.521 --> 00:20:34.710
You guys in charge of
the internet, so go fix.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:35.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.270
MALE SPEAKER: I'd like
to open the questions up

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:39.450
to the audience.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.120
There's a microphone back there.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.642
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:20:48.642 --> 00:20:50.850
I feel like we spoke a lot
about policing and things,

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:54.520
but even with police, bad
things still happen, right?

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.280
Bullying in playgrounds, for
example, is physical abuse.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.863
We can police it as much as we
can, but the police don't stop.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.480
Under the assumption
that-- not an assumption,

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:08.050
but this is emotional abuse--
being emotionally abused,

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:11.735
the parallel would be
a physical body guard.

00:21:11.735 --> 00:21:13.360
As a celebrity, as
a well-known person,

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.943
you have a body guard
who protects you

00:21:14.943 --> 00:21:17.050
as you move around
the physical world.

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:19.850
Do you think an emotional
bodyguard for you

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:22.350
on the internet is a
reasonable response?

00:21:24.644 --> 00:21:27.310
LAUREN MAYBERRY: I think that if
it existed, that would be nice,

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:30.410
but it's pretty abstract.

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:35.500
I guess you have to
do that job yourself.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:40.237
I think it's like separating
the personal anguish-- sounds

00:21:40.237 --> 00:21:47.210
really pathetic, but anguish--
from the professional side,

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:49.990
so trying not to make a
knee jerk emotional response

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:54.180
to something, and then
just do the block user,

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.902
go through that process.

00:21:56.902 --> 00:21:59.360
I suppose it's more difficult
to deal with because it's not

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.640
like a tangible, physical thing.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.150
There's no way of putting
somebody bigger in the middle

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:07.730
because there really isn't that.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:08.820
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.670
LAUREN MAYBERRY: That
was a hard question.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:12.960
I wasn't prepared for that.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.930
AUDIENCE: Hi, so I just want
to switch gears a little bit.

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:17.490
But I had a question
for you guys.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:22.450
You mentioned at the beginning
how your band started off

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:25.500
with the music blogs and social
media spreading your name.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.410
And even the way
you spell it, you

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:31.640
did it specifically so that you
can stand out on the internet.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.350
How do you see the
music industry and bands

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:38.150
that you see coming up
that are just starting out

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:41.720
utilizing these blogs and
social media and the internet

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.870
more so now, maybe, in the past?

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:47.570
Do you see that
increasing given the rise

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:51.770
of how many people are plugged
in in the digital age nowadays?

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:55.050
Is that something that you
guys support and promote,

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:58.380
or is it more so band
by band and however

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.900
they want to spread their name?

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.586
LAUREN MAYBERRY: For me, I
guess it's a case-by-case basis.

00:23:05.586 --> 00:23:07.210
The blueprint that
works for one person

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:10.820
won't work for somebody else.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.350
I think certainly
for me, I remember

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:15.522
being in bands pre
having a Myspace.

00:23:15.522 --> 00:23:16.980
That was quite
interesting when you

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.830
didn't have to put your
posters on Myspace.

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.669
I guess you just promoted
it in different ways.

00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:26.960
I suppose now it's kind of
unorthodox if a band doesn't

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.710
have a Facebook page
and things like that.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:30.270
I think those things
are definitely

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.490
important tools for us to
communicate with people,

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:35.462
but I've always been the
person in the band that

00:23:35.462 --> 00:23:37.910
runs social networks for
bands when I've been in them,

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:40.190
and I tried just as hard
at the social networks

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:43.700
for my other bands,
but they didn't

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.542
connect to people
in the same way.

00:23:45.542 --> 00:23:48.000
I like to believe it's about
the content as well as the way

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.370
that we pitched it.

00:23:51.897 --> 00:23:53.480
Generally speaking,
the music industry

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.240
is probably having
to adapt a lot

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.272
to incorporate all
these new technologies.

00:23:58.272 --> 00:23:59.980
I think for a long
time, people were just

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.430
trying to sound like
the little Dutch boy

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:04.140
with his finger
in the dam being--

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:08.110
I don't know if that
metaphor makes sense here--

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:10.774
and then just saying no
to the progress because it

00:24:10.774 --> 00:24:12.440
was changing the way
the industry works,

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.567
but I feel like you
can't stop that process.

00:24:15.567 --> 00:24:16.650
It's just going to happen.

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:18.780
The way that labels
and things operate

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.040
and the way that
even radio and things

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.966
that will have to
change because you

00:24:23.966 --> 00:24:25.440
can't stop the internet now.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.749
It's too late.

00:24:27.749 --> 00:24:29.540
A lot of good things
have come out of that.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:30.914
Without the
internet, we wouldn't

00:24:30.914 --> 00:24:34.390
have been able to cover as much
ground as quickly as we have,

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:39.640
and it makes it a lot more
democratic in some ways.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.450
If you have a certain
amount of technology,

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:43.160
you can make things at
home in your bedroom

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.080
and share them online.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.280
You don't necessarily have to go
through that filter of getting

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.970
the guy in the suit
to listen to it

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:51.590
and sign off on it before
you can release it.

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.470
You can self-release
on the internet.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:55.362
That's pretty powerful.

00:24:55.362 --> 00:24:56.070
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.414
LAUREN MAYBERRY: These are hard.

00:25:00.414 --> 00:25:01.914
I looked at the
sheet earlier, and I

00:25:01.914 --> 00:25:04.160
was like, yeah, that's fine.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.731
Coming from left
field, I don't know.

00:25:05.731 --> 00:25:07.230
MALE SPEAKER: I
have a few questions

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:10.740
from some of the people
streaming this, as well.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.670
What are the most
effective actions

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:16.677
you've seen men take to
combat misogyny online?

00:25:16.677 --> 00:25:18.760
LAUREN MAYBERRY: I think
that's an interesting one

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:23.295
because when men speak
to other men about it,

00:25:23.295 --> 00:25:25.670
I think sometimes I've seen
that be a lot more effective.

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.040
Because when I talk about
it, people could be like,

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.040
oh well, she's saying
that because she's a woman

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:30.805
or because she's a
feminist and blah,

00:25:30.805 --> 00:25:32.679
blah, blah, and
it's personal to her

00:25:32.679 --> 00:25:34.220
and I don't agree
with that argument.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:36.070
But it's easier to
discredit me that way

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:40.350
than it is to a man
who's saying that you.

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:45.330
For me, I've gone to meetings
of feminist groups in Glasgow

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:46.740
and then been like, not for me.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:49.190
Because one of the
conversations was-- it

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:50.957
was a feminist book
groups at university.

00:25:50.957 --> 00:25:52.540
One conversations
was whether we could

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.480
read books that were written
about feminism by men.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.420
I was like, that's
completely backwards.

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.330
I don't want to sit here and
be a part of that conversation

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:00.871
because it's not a
conversation to be

00:26:00.871 --> 00:26:02.970
had in a room full of
people who already agree.

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:06.470
It should be a conversation
that's everyone's having.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.532
I think if everybody
can be involved

00:26:08.532 --> 00:26:10.490
in trying to make society
a tiny, tiny bit less

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:12.400
rubbish sometimes, then
that would be good.

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:16.930
MALE SPEAKER: This is from Eric.

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.900
Would you use something like a
spam filter that automatically

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.760
labeled aggressive emails?

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.540
And more generally,
what do you think

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.340
about the role of technology
in reducing online misogyny?

00:26:30.795 --> 00:26:32.550
LAUREN MAYBERRY: A
spam filter is probably

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:36.110
useful insofar as then you
wouldn't see as much of it,

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:39.670
but it doesn't necessarily
deal with the root problem,

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:42.610
because it's a way of
you dealing with it

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:44.566
rather than going to
where it originated

00:26:44.566 --> 00:26:46.690
and trying to stop it
happening in the first place.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.409
For me, technology
has been really useful

00:26:55.409 --> 00:26:56.950
because we've traveled
so much and it

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:59.491
enables me to keep in touch with
people and work on the move.

00:26:59.491 --> 00:27:02.120
And the same way it
does for everybody--

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.690
just simple tiny things that
make the day easier and better,

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:10.910
and I think that's a
really powerful thing.

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.260
I don't want to make it
sound like I'm poo-pooing

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:15.468
the internet or anything,
because I'm definitely not.

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:20.300
I don't know about
technology necessarily,

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.460
but what we're talking
about the internet

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:26.270
has definitely opened up a
conversation about feminism

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.542
and misogyny-- yes,
it's probably spiked it

00:27:28.542 --> 00:27:31.410
a little bit, as well, but if
people are talking about it

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.820
in the same form, then
that's probably a good thing.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.901
I feel you should
grade all my answers.

00:27:36.901 --> 00:27:39.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:42.200
MALE SPEAKER: We have
a music one as well.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.120
Where you stand on subscription
music services given

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.050
that many prominent artists
have spoken out against them?

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:50.092
What you think we could
do to improve relations

00:27:50.092 --> 00:27:50.925
with music creators?

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:58.020
LAUREN MAYBERRY: That's a
pretty controversial topic.

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.130
I think that every artist
is completely entitled

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:01.760
to have an opinion on it.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.820
For us, it's more
difficult to be

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:07.716
very strident about that stuff
because without streaming

00:28:07.716 --> 00:28:09.840
services and the internet,
probably people wouldn't

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.370
have heard as much
about our band.

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:15.860
There was a gaff the other
day where the songs came off

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:18.100
Spotify in Mexico, and
people got very upset.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:22.180
I'm like well, sorry,
go back and fix it.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.790
I suppose that's weird in a
way because then you're like,

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:27.066
oh, well you don't
have my album?

00:28:27.066 --> 00:28:28.470
You can't just listen to it?

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:32.230
But then it's just a product
of the time, to an extent.

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:35.140
I didn't grow up in an
era where the musician

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.160
was that prominent.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:42.740
I remember getting one-- I've
only illegally downloaded

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:43.734
one thing.

00:28:43.734 --> 00:28:45.275
That was during the
time period where

00:28:45.275 --> 00:28:47.400
you'd to leave the computer
on for like three days.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:50.320
I remember having to
debate with my mom

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.470
whether we would turn
the computer off,

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:52.886
and I was like,
it's almost there.

00:28:52.886 --> 00:28:53.930
It's almost there.

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:57.700
It was just because I couldn't
physically get the song.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.600
I think it was like a Letters
to Cleo cover of Cheap Trick

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.030
or something that was in the
film, and I really wanted it,

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:06.170
but I couldn't get it.

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:10.300
I can't relate a huge amount to
music streaming in that sense,

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:16.189
but I guess it's about
making all that stuff fairer

00:29:16.189 --> 00:29:18.730
on the artist, because somebody
somewhere is making money off

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:20.229
of those things,
but it's definitely

00:29:20.229 --> 00:29:22.730
not the people who make
the content that's on it.

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:29.630
I guess if there was a way of
making those streams somehow

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:33.110
feeding the gain back
to the people who've

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:37.440
paid in time and money to make
that because at end of the day,

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.460
someone is trying to make
a living off doing that.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.300
I don't know how to fix it.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.670
I don't know what to do.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:47.617
MALE SPEAKER: Audience question.

00:29:47.617 --> 00:29:49.200
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about what

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.790
you see the role of the
rest of the online community

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.360
is in combating misogyny.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:58.286
Because sometimes people say, if
you comment defending someone,

00:29:58.286 --> 00:29:59.660
that brings more
attention to it.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:02.800
Do you think that there's a role
that everyone on the internet

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:06.789
can play in defending women,
defending people in general,

00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:08.080
against these kind of comments?

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.190
Do you think that
brings more attention

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:12.242
to it in a positive
way, or do you

00:30:12.242 --> 00:30:14.510
think that hurts the
cause by recycling back

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:16.140
the focus to those
negative comments?

00:30:20.367 --> 00:30:22.450
LAUREN MAYBERRY: Maybe I'm
an antagonistic person,

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:25.740
but for me, I was like, the
ignoring it thing-- like,

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:30.850
when you're a kid, and your
mom was like, just ignore them,

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:34.952
I don't think that theory works
here because if you ignore it,

00:30:34.952 --> 00:30:37.410
then people aren't going to be
like oh, they're ignoring me

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:39.150
because I've done
something really offensive.

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:41.150
They're going to think
that you're ignoring them

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:43.310
in an oh well, fair enough way.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.620
If people can be respectful
of each other, obviously,

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.710
I'm not saying you should go
and be a horrible, awful person

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:56.670
in return, because then
that's just an eye for an eye.

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:59.140
If people can call each
other out on those things,

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.980
then that's useful.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.210
Also, even in the last
year, 18 months or whatever,

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:07.720
I've noticed loads more
stuff about feminism

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.699
in the mainstream media.

00:31:10.699 --> 00:31:12.740
Is that a trend of what
people are writing about,

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:15.040
or are they just more
willing to talk about it

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.079
and more people are
thinking about it?

00:31:17.079 --> 00:31:17.620
I'm not sure.

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:18.250
I hope so.

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:22.080
But hopefully it
won't disappear again,

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.307
like feminism is the new
black, and then it's gone.

00:31:25.307 --> 00:31:26.140
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:31.810
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:35.080
You mentioned that you like
Feministing and Jezebel,

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:40.160
and I see them sort of as a
more palatable or relatable form

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.290
of feminism, especially
for our generation,

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:44.990
which I think is changing a lot.

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:47.340
What about them do
you really like,

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.310
and how do you think people
can pull elements of that

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:54.480
into their own content that
they're creating online?

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.500
LAUREN MAYBERRY: That's
an interesting question.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.070
For me, people like
Jessica Valenti

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:02.610
are really important voices
because she's obviously

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:05.680
very intelligent and has studied
the academic side of all this

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.280
so she knows all the
theories and she knows all

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.370
the texts that you
should check out.

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:13.670
I think the fact that she's
taking that and putting it

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:16.520
in a real life situation, and
the tone in which she writes

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.900
is really relatable, and
she's talking about things

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.552
that we've all experienced.

00:32:21.552 --> 00:32:23.260
I think Feministing
is really interesting

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.600
because they talk about high
court rulings on things,

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.340
but then they also
have opinion pieces

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:32.820
on things that are
happening in pop culture

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.750
and things that are being
talked about in the news.

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:39.310
I think just having that kind
of dialogue is really helpful.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:42.159
It feels like a nice,
quite a useful community,

00:32:42.159 --> 00:32:44.450
rather than somebody telling
you things and being like,

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:45.340
you think this.

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:49.780
People raise questions and
accept comment in return.

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:53.840
That just makes you
think about stuff.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.215
Certainly, when
I was growing up,

00:32:55.215 --> 00:32:59.024
I didn't really
have a huge number

00:32:59.024 --> 00:33:01.190
of friends that would be
interested in the same kind

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:02.620
of things.

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:04.583
I think only within the
last few years really

00:33:04.583 --> 00:33:09.630
have I found as many
like-minded women.

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:13.760
We make the joke that I started
a women's collective in Glasgow

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.170
to make more friends--
to make more friends who

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:17.480
agreed with me.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:21.534
But I think that has been very
important because it's just

00:33:21.534 --> 00:33:23.200
a thing we have where
we run live events

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.780
and have a radio show and
podcast and things just

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:30.114
focusing on women, arts, and
music, and things like that.

00:33:30.114 --> 00:33:31.780
For me, that feels
like a positive thing

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:34.279
to do because otherwise, I feel
like I'm constantly thinking

00:33:34.279 --> 00:33:37.590
about the negative things--
the horrible things that

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:40.490
are happening and constantly
happen on all levels.

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:43.020
I want to try and change
the dialog in my mind

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.345
and make it something more
positive and having people

00:33:46.345 --> 00:33:47.970
to talk to about that
is pretty helpful

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:49.761
so you don't feel like
you're the only one.

00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:51.310
You're like, is that fine?

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:52.550
Am I overreacting?

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:54.410
No, no, it's fine.

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:56.310
Yeah, community is key.

00:33:58.462 --> 00:34:00.670
MALE SPEAKER: Do we have
any more audience questions?

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:08.710
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:11.780
So I remember a while
ago, a comedian once

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.929
that there's a strong power
in comedy in communication,

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:17.810
especially when it
comes to tough topics.

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:20.260
It's something along the
lines of if I make you laugh,

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.969
maybe you won't be as
threatened or defensive.

00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:25.010
Sometimes I think about
that with music, as well.

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:27.420
So I wondered if
you ever addressed

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.810
these kinds of tough
topics in your music,

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:31.560
or maybe you already have.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.965
Your lyrics are a bit cryptic.

00:34:32.965 --> 00:34:33.929
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:34.887
LAUREN MAYBERRY: Sorry.

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:41.980
When we write music,
for me, I just

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:45.409
write about personal
perspective,

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:47.150
whether that's on
personal events that

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:49.066
have happened to you or
a personal perspective

00:34:49.066 --> 00:34:52.194
on something that's
happening externally.

00:34:52.194 --> 00:34:53.860
I suppose the lyrics
are pretty cryptic,

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.010
so you probably can
tell from any of that.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:01.480
I guess the personal is
political to an extent.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.414
The political is
personal and vice versa.

00:35:04.414 --> 00:35:06.330
There's probably elements
of that in the stuff

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:08.996
that we are writing about, but I
don't think there's necessarily

00:35:08.996 --> 00:35:10.420
any anthems in
the same way there

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.168
is on a Le Tigre
record or something.

you for coming today.

We're back.

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:39.710
And this time, you guys
get to actually speak.

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:40.409
So that's nice.

have a microphone.

LAUREN MAYBERRY: Ian never
gets-- we don't let him speak.

00:35:46.628 --> 00:35:47.940
IAIN COOK: Shall we?

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.442
LAUREN MAYBERRY: Yes, we
are a band called Chvrches.

We are going to play
a couple more songs.

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:19.210
I feel I'm not terribly good at
public speaking, to be honest.

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:21.065
It makes me quite worried.

00:40:21.065 --> 00:40:24.550
So if there's more vibrato in
the voice than anticipated,

00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:28.259
it's just left over from that.

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:30.050
IAIN COOK: Me, I'm just
looking for someone

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:31.800
that will let me go
on one of your slides.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.955
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:33.955 --> 00:40:34.705
That's all I want.

00:40:34.705 --> 00:40:37.474
If there's anyone in this
room-- and there's more of you

00:40:37.474 --> 00:40:39.970
than I expected--
so surely, someone

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:42.790
can make it happen for me.

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:44.590
I've come all the way
here from Scotland.

00:45:21.426 --> 00:45:22.842
We're going to
play one more song,

00:45:22.842 --> 00:45:24.270
and then we're going to go.

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:25.936
I need to rehydrate
because I've sweated

00:45:25.936 --> 00:45:27.170
a lot during this experience.

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:29.530
But it's OK.

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:30.475
It's not your fault.

00:45:30.475 --> 00:45:32.400
It's just psychology.

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.575
But thank you again
for having us.

00:45:34.575 --> 00:45:36.075
Thank you for letting
people look us

00:45:36.075 --> 00:45:41.290
up on you, which has
been very helpful to us.

IAIN COOK: One thing
is if you're all

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:47.080
here, who's running
the internet?

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:50.132
I'm kind of a bit
worried about that.

you for having us,

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:54.550
and for letting us come and
chat a bit, stuff like that,

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:58.010
because I think it's really
awesome of you guys to do that

00:45:58.010 --> 00:46:01.425
and make it be less of a
marginalized thing, and thanks.
