1
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.800
And we're alive.
How are you sir?
How are you?
Good to see you again.

2
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.360
I'm thrilled to be here.
Thanks for doing this,
man.
Thanks for having,

3
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.930
I know I should tell people before we get started,

4
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.970
I did not know when I asked you to come back on that you were heavily involved

5
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:22.350
in this whole vaccine debate.

6
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.620
What I wanted to have you on to talk about is tropical diseases because a,

7
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.220
I remember when we did that Scifi show,
um,

8
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.570
you explained to me that some ungodly percentage of people that live in tropical

9
00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:36.060
climates are infected by parasites.
That's right.
Well,

10
00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:40.080
my day job is developing vaccines for tropical diseases.

11
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:43.200
We developed the vaccines no one else will make because they're for the world's

12
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:45.840
poorest people,
so that we call them tropical diseases,

13
00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:50.210
but there really are diseases of poverty.
The vaccine issue,
the,

14
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.050
the advocacy issue around vaccines and autism is kind of a new thing that I got

15
00:00:55.051 --> 00:01:00.051
drawn into just because I'm a parent of an adult daughter with autism and I make

16
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:03.450
vaccines.
So it was a natural that I'd get drawn into it.
Yeah.

17
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.840
So when I said that you were going to come on,

18
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.100
then I got inundated by people that are,
you know,
the,

19
00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:15.090
the vaccine thing is such a polarizing issue.
Yeah.
It's awful.

20
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.180
And so many people seem to think they absolutely know what causes what,

21
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.560
especially when it comes to something like autism,
which is a,

22
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.330
it's a huge issue in this country.

23
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.290
It's a huge issue around the world and it doesn't,
didn't use to seem to be,

24
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.010
the question is,
was that because it was undiagnosed?

25
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.200
Was that because it just,
there's,
it's more prevalent today.
What do you think,

26
00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:42.730
what is your take on that?
I don't think we really know.
Um,

27
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.870
one thing's for sure we're diagnosing people with autism who we diagnosed as

28
00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:51.390
something else in the past,
you know,
whether it was,
you know,

29
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.100
really horrible diagnosis,
we'd use pejorative terms like mental retardation.

30
00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.110
It's a matter of Jamie
just telling the clock was off.
Oh,
okay.

31
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.190
Sorry.
Sorry.
Should we start again?
No,
no,
no.
It's okay.
He was just saying,

32
00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:07.420
he was just telling me that there are clock is screwed up because of the

33
00:02:07.421 --> 00:02:11.570
daylight savings time.
Sorry.
Totally unrelated to what you're selling.

34
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.810
Countries clack is screwed up because of daylight savings.
Yeah.
Right.
Um,
so,

35
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.480
so we don't know.
We don't,
well,
you know,

36
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.020
one thing is clear that the number of diagnoses is going up,

37
00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:26.040
but part of that is because what we used to call pejorative,

38
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:30.150
things like mental retardation now get thrown into the autism category.

39
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.290
The other thing not to do it absolutely.
You know,
so,
well,
you know,

40
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.820
now we call it as part of the autism spectrum.
Um,
we also,

41
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.540
because autism often has a lot of associated intellectual disabilities.

42
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:47.040
Not always,
but sometimes the other is that,
um,

43
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.620
can I pause,
is that based on a APP aptitude tests?
Like how do,

44
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.970
how do they decide,
how do they decide what's autism?

45
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.170
They have a list of diagnostic categories,
but it's not crazy.

46
00:02:58.171 --> 00:03:01.760
It's not like you can someone if they test positive for a disease.
That's right.

47
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.160
That's right.
Well,
although it,
you know,

48
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.660
one of the interesting side pieces to this is,
you know,
the,

49
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.680
there's a group of people out there who self identified themselves as the

50
00:03:12.681 --> 00:03:17.681
autistics and they get very resentful or hurt when they're called a disease or

51
00:03:19.011 --> 00:03:20.990
disorder that in because they say,
well,

52
00:03:20.991 --> 00:03:24.020
we're not an epidemic where we're a person and they,

53
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.840
it's part of this whole neurodiversity movement,

54
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.170
which is quite an interesting neurodiversity movement,
right?

55
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.330
They say their neurodiverse that they,
you know,

56
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.900
maybe think differently from others and they respond differently than others,

57
00:03:35.901 --> 00:03:40.370
but they're not quote abnormal.
And I think they have a good argument.
Hmm.

58
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.140
Um,
I heard a crazy argument once with someone that was,
so,

59
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.350
the point is that it's,
you know,
the,
the impairment like Rachel,
my daughter,

60
00:03:48.351 --> 00:03:53.270
it's not so much for autism that,
uh,
uh,
torture,
you know,

61
00:03:53.271 --> 00:03:58.271
ability to have partners or to have a meaningful career.

62
00:03:58.341 --> 00:04:01.320
It's the fact that she has profound in hurricanes,

63
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.250
profound intellectual disability that goes along with it.
Um,

64
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.310
I forgot what I was going to say.
So when,

65
00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:11.910
when they did say that people have,

66
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.250
there's a spectrum,
right?

67
00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:18.720
And some people who are autistic have an incredible abilities.
That's right.

68
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.330
They have incredible mathematical abilities,
musical abilities,

69
00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:24.810
language abilities.
And then some people do not.

70
00:04:24.811 --> 00:04:28.460
And some people have legitimate issues.
Yeah.
With the Rachel's case,
my daughter,

71
00:04:28.461 --> 00:04:31.580
it's a,
she has a pretty good verbal Iq,
80,
90,

72
00:04:31.581 --> 00:04:35.000
but she has a very low performance Iq in 40.
She can't do simple math.

73
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.460
She can't count money.
Uh,
fortunately,

74
00:04:37.461 --> 00:04:41.180
goodwill industries came to her rescue in our rescue and now she works there two

75
00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:42.810
hours a day sorting clothes and,

76
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.170
and that's been really meaningful for her to get a paycheck.
Great.

77
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.160
Even if it's minimum wage.
Yeah.
Right.

78
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.760
Just to do something to feel right and feel part of the mix.
That's huge.

79
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.700
That's huge for everyone.
Wraps a lute.
Absolutely.
Um,
but so there's no,
uh,

80
00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:58.120
there's,

81
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.720
it's not like you could test positive for syphilis or you can test positive for

82
00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:04.750
the flu.
Right.
Although now,
you know,
as I say,
you know,

83
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.730
so that's why I don't like using those,
those terms because it,

84
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.980
it puts people on the autism spectrum as though they have a disease or the
store,

85
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.680
which I don't like to do.
But if it is a disorder,
well,
you know,

86
00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:21.910
now we know there are 99 genes that are linked to autism,

87
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.940
but why is it a bad thing to say that you have a disorder if it's just a

88
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:28.930
disorder?
When people have disorders,
what's the fact?
Well,
you know,

89
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.180
a lot of the individuals in that,

90
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.990
at that self identify themselves as the autistics don't like to think of

91
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:39.010
themselves as a disorder.
They like to think of the cells is different,
different,

92
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.680
but not necessarily as a disorder.
Right.

93
00:05:41.681 --> 00:05:44.050
But that doesn't help us when we're trying to discuss it.
Does it?
Yeah,

94
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.710
it gets very,
it's,
it's hard.
It gets hard to talk about it.
Well,
it also,
they're,

95
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.390
they're trying to stop you from talking about it in a certain fashion,

96
00:05:50.391 --> 00:05:53.960
which is actually accurate.
Right.
When they have an issue,

97
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.430
there is an issue to say there's no issue.
It's kind of,
it's,
I mean,

98
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:01.730
there's a reason why so many people are so concerned about autism and vaccines

99
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:02.960
and just autism in general,

100
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.670
whether it's environmental pollution factor as well that they like to do is they

101
00:06:06.671 --> 00:06:11.480
like to make the distinction between autism,
that nerve,
a diversity thing,

102
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.560
and actually having intellectual disabilities that go along with it.
Okay.

103
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.300
And maybe it's a bit of semantics also,

104
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:22.301
but they feel strongly about right now if we don't know what causes autism that

105
00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:27.590
we do,
we do well.
We're getting there very closely.
So we've now,

106
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.040
there is a very important paper produced,
uh,
uh,

107
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.340
written by group at the broad institute at Harvard,
Mit,

108
00:06:34.341 --> 00:06:38.690
which is one of the premiere genetics genomics organizations in the country.

109
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.040
And they've now identified 99 genes.
It's a,
it's a huge team of scientists,

110
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:46.550
not only at the brode,
including piece scientists at Baylor College of Medicine,

111
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:50.240
99 genes involved in autism,

112
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.500
all involved in early fetal development,

113
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.270
early brain development in the first and second trimester of pregnancy.

114
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.750
So now we're starting to really get our arms around what autism is.

115
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.470
And that's one of the things I talk about in the book.
I mean we,

116
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.960
we have learned so much in the last couple of years about autism,

117
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.760
how it begins early fetal development well before kids ever receive vaccines.

118
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.420
And that's one of the reasons I say vaccines did not cause Rachel's autism

119
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.690
vaccines don't cause autism because autism is already underway in early or early

120
00:07:22.971 --> 00:07:23.780
brain development.

121
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.780
Is it possible that some people have this tendency towards autism and it's

122
00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:32.210
exacerbated by vaccines?
I don't think so.
Um,

123
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.590
I think what happens is the sequence of events happens,

124
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.870
uh,
during pregnancy,

125
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:44.030
but the full clinical expression of autism often doesn't happen until 18 or 19

126
00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:45.740
months of age.
Like Rachel for instance,

127
00:07:45.741 --> 00:07:48.800
wasn't actually diagnosed until 19 months of age.

128
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:54.220
And there's some fabulous studies now showing that that clinical expression of

129
00:07:54.651 --> 00:07:58.960
autism actually coincides with a big increase in the icts,

130
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.380
in the volume of the brain.

131
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:04.910
You can actually show on cereal magnet magnetic resonance imaging,

132
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:09.620
serial Mri,
how the brain starts to,
the brain volume starts to increase.

133
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.700
And that's very important because parents will often remember,

134
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:17.960
oh my kid got vaccinated are on 18 months of age or 15 months of age and want to

135
00:08:17.961 --> 00:08:18.794
link the two.

136
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.630
But now you can go back to six months of age and this is studies done at the

137
00:08:23.631 --> 00:08:27.380
University of North Carolina Chapel Hill showing so that you can do an Mri at

138
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:32.381
six months of age and they can predict now with they say with 90% accuracy which

139
00:08:32.611 --> 00:08:35.920
of the kids will go on to develop autism and then you can take it.

140
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.670
What are they seeing?
What?
What are they saying?
They can see I have,

141
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.860
you have to go,
we can go into detail in the paper,

142
00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:46.490
but they can see certain things on signatures on Mri that tells them that this

143
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:49.030
kid is going to go on to develop.

144
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.860
So in fact there is a way to test positive for autism.

145
00:08:51.861 --> 00:08:54.650
Then with this serial Mris,
that's what they think.
Right?

146
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:59.400
And now we have the 99 genes so we can even take it back further by doing what's

147
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:02.940
called whole exome sequencing,
sequencing,
all the DNA,

148
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.210
all the express DNA of an individual.

149
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.560
And in Rachel's case we did that and we actually found a mutation in a gene

150
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:13.140
controlling a neuronal connections,

151
00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:17.100
which makes a lot of sense if you think about what autism of course.
So,

152
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.750
so there is a way to,

153
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:23.040
to show whether children will be more likely to develop autism and there's

154
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:23.953
either,
there is a way to,

155
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:28.320
to look at their brain through Fmrp at a very early age and,

156
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.840
and also do the Elsa do genetic sequence.

157
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:35.730
So it's not simply a matter of how they perform on cognitive tests.
That's right.

158
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.420
That's right.
We're getting much better at getting our arms around the diagnosis.

159
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:43.140
Why do you think there's so many people that have these anecdotal stories of

160
00:09:43.141 --> 00:09:44.940
their child getting vaccinated?

161
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:49.020
Especially large doses of vaccines when they hit them with like 10 in a row and

162
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:52.050
then all of a sudden or meters,
measles,
mumps and rebellions,

163
00:09:52.051 --> 00:09:53.730
the one that gets repeated over and over again.

164
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.540
That's the one that made my child have autism.
I've heard that so many times,

165
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.350
and I've heard it from friends from friends that have children that have autism,

166
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:05.250
they had a child,
their child got the measles,
mumps,
rubella shot,

167
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:08.880
and then immediately there was a very distinct change in the child's behavior.

168
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.060
Well,
no question.
When you get the measles,
mumps,
rubella vaccine,

169
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.700
many times kids cry and things like that.

170
00:10:14.701 --> 00:10:18.930
And then autism will then begin sometime between the first and second year of

171
00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:21.690
life.
So it's logical to want to connect the two.

172
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.920
But now we know it's not even plausible because we know that if you go back to

173
00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:29.310
that an MRI at six months of age or go back prenatally,

174
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.820
we can even determine which kids are going to go on to develop autism.

175
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:33.683
So even though,

176
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:39.070
and that complementing it complementing it are massive epidemiologic studies

177
00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:43.740
done on over 1 million kids that in fact a new paper was just released this week

178
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:49.130
showing that kids who get the Mrr get the MMR vaccine are no more likely to get

179
00:10:50.401 --> 00:10:54.240
autism than kids who don't,
who don't get the MMR vaccine.

180
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.490
And the converse is also true.

181
00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:01.170
Kids on the autism spectrum are no more of likely to have gotten the MMR vaccine

182
00:11:01.171 --> 00:11:05.370
and kids not on the autism spectrum.
Okay.
So,
so it's the combination of that,

183
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.880
those big studies of over 1 million kids together with knowing what autism is,

184
00:11:11.581 --> 00:11:16.550
that completely rules out the possibility.
Right.
So these genes,
excuse me,
the,

185
00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:21.551
and the issue with these genes and then the ability to scan the brain with the

186
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.900
serial Mri and the,

187
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.480
so you can tell which children have the propensity.

188
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:32.310
Is it possible that children have all these issues and then do not get autism or

189
00:11:32.311 --> 00:11:36.630
do 100% of those children with those issues get autism?
That's a good question.

190
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.600
Uh,
I don't know.
I'm a vaccine scientists.
I'm,
you know,
the,

191
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.490
they're not about the rate.
Well,
well,

192
00:11:41.491 --> 00:11:43.440
I'm a biologist on the vaccine scientists who,

193
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:48.300
who's really tried to do a deep dive and autism doing research on the book

194
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.700
versus Human Development.
Right,
right,
right.
Okay.
So,
um,

195
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.770
so what you're saying though is that if a child does not have these mutations

196
00:11:56.771 --> 00:12:01.540
and does not have these issues that are present and during serial Mri that they

197
00:12:01.541 --> 00:12:03.850
will not go on to develop autism.
Is that true?

198
00:12:03.851 --> 00:12:05.540
As far as we can tell as far as we can tell.

199
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:10.950
So children without those issues who get vaccinated have have no problems,

200
00:12:12.911 --> 00:12:17.390
which most children have no problems.
Right?
Yeah.
I mean the,
you know,

201
00:12:17.391 --> 00:12:22.370
we've learned a lot about the risk of vaccines and the numbers are

202
00:12:22.371 --> 00:12:23.420
extraordinary.
I mean,

203
00:12:23.421 --> 00:12:28.421
the risk of a severe adverse event happening after getting a vaccine is roughly

204
00:12:29.391 --> 00:12:33.680
on the order of one in a million between,
between one in 1,000,001 in 10 billion.

205
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.540
Um,
so,
and I found an Internet report wants,

206
00:12:37.541 --> 00:12:41.510
is it the light likelihood of getting struck by lightening is one in 700,000.

207
00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.291
So it's,
you know,

208
00:12:42.291 --> 00:12:46.430
the likelihood of having a severe event after a vaccine is your best odds are

209
00:12:46.431 --> 00:12:51.180
better,
uh,
of getting struck by lightning than,
and when you say severe event,

210
00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.190
what do you mean by severe event though?
Oh,
well,

211
00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:58.160
which is actually a table that's put out by the national vaccine,

212
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:02.510
uh,
compensation act.
Um,
that includes,
um,
uh,

213
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:07.880
shoulder injury,
uh,
that's one,
uh,
encephalitis and say shoulder injury.

214
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:11.110
Yeah,
that's actually on from the actual injection point put,
getting,

215
00:13:11.111 --> 00:13:13.070
injecting it in the wrong place.
Oh,

216
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:17.840
so it goes into the joint or something like that?
Yeah.
Is that common?
No.
No.

217
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.790
So there,

218
00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:24.740
there have been issues where children have adverse effects and reactions to

219
00:13:24.741 --> 00:13:28.670
vaccines.
What do you attribute those to?
But when you know,
one in a million,

220
00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.820
I think,
you know,
in some cases,
biological variability,

221
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.400
I think in some cases inadvertently,
if it's a live virus vaccine,

222
00:13:35.401 --> 00:13:37.200
like the measles,
mumps,
rubella vaccine,

223
00:13:37.201 --> 00:13:40.980
and you have an underlying immune deficiency that wasn't picked up before,

224
00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:45.360
then that virus can replicate better,
but very rare things like that.
Right.

225
00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.740
So as far as,
you know,

226
00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:52.310
children who are healthy,
who get a vaccine,
it's,

227
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:57.320
it's not biologically possible for them to develop these traits,

228
00:13:57.321 --> 00:14:01.550
these mutations in the genes and these issues that you see present as best we

229
00:14:01.551 --> 00:14:03.650
can tell.
Right now that seems to be the case,
right?

230
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:08.430
As best you could tell right now,
it's a great thing to say I,

231
00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:13.070
but for people that are like,
hmm.
On the outside,
like what does that mean?

232
00:14:13.071 --> 00:14:14.090
I'm not a doctor,

233
00:14:14.091 --> 00:14:17.780
I'm not smart enough to understand what doctor Hotez is saying right here.

234
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:21.470
What is he saying best as we can tell?
How much can we tell?
So here's what we,

235
00:14:21.471 --> 00:14:23.940
we can tell.
Okay.
No,
um,

236
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:28.710
studies of 1 million children that there's no link between vaccines and autism.

237
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.810
That's number one.
And,
and so let me Parse,
how did they,
let me,

238
00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.610
let me Parse this out in two bits.
So there's,

239
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.390
there's the studies on a 1 million children showing that vaccines do not cause

240
00:14:39.391 --> 00:14:40.590
autism.
That's part one.

241
00:14:40.591 --> 00:14:43.860
The second is the epidemic that I'll do and then I'll do a deeper dive on each

242
00:14:43.861 --> 00:14:44.310
of them.

243
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:48.750
The second part shows not only is their massive evidence that there's no link

244
00:14:48.751 --> 00:14:53.600
between vaccines and autism,
there's no,
because we know so much about autism,

245
00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:57.200
how it begins in pregnancy.
Okay.
So let's go back to the first part.

246
00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.080
The first part is studies in over 1 million children.

247
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:03.950
One of the things that the anti vaccine lobby does is they played this game of

248
00:15:03.951 --> 00:15:06.180
what I want,
if not really a game,
but what they call,

249
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.190
what they do is play this kind of a thing of vaccine whack-a-mole.

250
00:15:10.191 --> 00:15:14.750
Because at first they alleged it was the MMR vaccine and that came out out of

251
00:15:14.751 --> 00:15:19.340
the study that was published in the Lancet in 1998 then another group came along

252
00:15:19.341 --> 00:15:22.280
and said,
no,
no,
no,
we didn't mean the MMR vaccine.
We meant the thigh.

253
00:15:22.281 --> 00:15:27.281
Marisol preservative that used to be in vaccine and the scientific community not

254
00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:31.610
only debunked,
the MMR linked,
they debunked the thigh,
Marisol Ling.

255
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.660
Then the anti vaccine lobby came along and said,
no,
no,
we didn't mean that.

256
00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:37.640
We're spacing vaccines too close together.

257
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.760
Then they changed it to get around again a saying,

258
00:15:40.761 --> 00:15:43.600
now it's the alum or aluminum in vaccines.
So,

259
00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:48.080
and then each time the scientific community responds with massive epidemiologic

260
00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:50.540
studies showing there's absolutely none of those things that are true.

261
00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:54.740
And do you think that it's just when you look at,

262
00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.290
say if there's one in a million that has an issue with this and there's,

263
00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.670
and it's not autism by the way.

264
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:06.160
So whatever those issues are that they hear these stories and these stories do

265
00:16:06.951 --> 00:16:10.910
accumulate because there's 300 plus million people in this country and over 10,

266
00:16:10.911 --> 00:16:13.790
20 years of one in a million,

267
00:16:13.791 --> 00:16:18.791
you develop a significant history of cases where children did have issues with

268
00:16:19.821 --> 00:16:20.654
vaccines.

269
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:25.730
So these people hear about these stories and people are terrified.

270
00:16:25.731 --> 00:16:27.830
Obviously you're,
I have children,

271
00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:32.030
you become very over protective of your children.
You worry a lot.

272
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.800
And then you also don't know,
like,

273
00:16:33.801 --> 00:16:36.230
why do they get so many shots all in a row like that?

274
00:16:36.231 --> 00:16:39.590
Why does the baby get 10 shots in a day?
That seems crazy.
Well,

275
00:16:39.591 --> 00:16:41.480
they don't get 10 shots in a day.
Most of them,

276
00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.660
most of the vaccines are now combined.
So for instance,

277
00:16:44.661 --> 00:16:49.340
in one vaccine we can vaccinate against Diptheria Pertussis,

278
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.930
tetanus,
polio,
uh,

279
00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.910
haemophilus influenza type B,
which is a terrible cause of meningitis.

280
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.220
And in some cases not even hepatitis.

281
00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:04.240
So one shot is protected for all these combined,

282
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:07.010
and there's all sorts of studies showing that it's safe to combine them.

283
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:11.360
And that's fantastic.
Now you can vaccinate with one shot against six diseases.

284
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.820
So,
and these are life threatening disease,
right?

285
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:18.260
So the only concern is the child's immune system when they're bombarded with

286
00:17:18.261 --> 00:17:19.094
this one.

287
00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:23.330
So a lot of times it causes them as it'd be tired or they gets sick.

288
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.790
Like the apprentice Demian system is not bombarded.

289
00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:28.700
I think that's another kind of a misnomer that the,

290
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:32.360
or a misunderstanding that's put out by the anti vaccine lobby.

291
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.120
Remember the child's gut,

292
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.760
the intestines and the respiratory tree is,

293
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.660
is this or Oregon's of antigen presentation.

294
00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:46.400
A baby on average has exposed to hundreds of new antigens every day.

295
00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:50.630
So the idea that you're going to quote overwhelm the immune system with a

296
00:17:50.631 --> 00:17:54.410
vaccine against six diseases just doesn't make any sense.
Again,

297
00:17:54.411 --> 00:17:58.760
this is all phony baloney stuff put out by the anti vaccine lobby.
