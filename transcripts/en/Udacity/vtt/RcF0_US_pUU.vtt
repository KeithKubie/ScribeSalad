00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.110
So that's a little
background out of the way.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.180
Now you can probably see where
I'm heading with all this.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.970
Someone who can't see the screen,

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.010
can't access the visual
information in the interface.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.280
And someone who is using voice control
relies on the voice control software

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.710
being able to interact
with the web page.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.680
So we need to make sure that
information is expressed in a way which

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.310
is flexible enough to be accessed
programatically by assistive technology.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.320
Which can then create an alternative
user interface to suit its users needs.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.330
We refer to this as expressing
the semantics of an element.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.500
The Web AIM checklist explicitly calls
this outing guideline 4.1, saying name,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.550
role, value, markup is used in a way
that facilitates accessibility.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.730
Okay, that's kind of terse.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.280
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
go into a bit more detail.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.640
For all user interface
components the name and

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.900
role can be programmatically determined.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.840
States, properties and

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.060
values that can be set by the user
can be programmatically set.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.910
So what are name role and value?

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.280
And how can we make sure that they can
be programmatically determined and set?

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.670
To answer that, we're going to start off
by trying things out from the point of

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.580
view of someone using
assistive technology.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.160
Just before we jump into that I want
to quickly mention that in this course

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.320
we will be working mostly
with screen readers.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.880
But a lot of the work we do
to support screen readers

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.380
also benefits users who use
other assistive technologies.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.610
Things like voice control and

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.280
switch control use the same
programmatically expressed semantics.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.480
In the introduction we had a first
look at using a screen reader.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.290
Now were going to try using
one without any access to

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.840
the web pages visible interface
