00:00:01.467 --> 00:00:02.869
For the last like week,
I've been trying to find

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:04.537
the original R.
Kelly video and ...

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:06.172
I can't find it.
I can't find it.

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:07.173
Well, it's pretty ...
It's child ...

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:09.008
It is child pornography.

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:10.877
But that's what I don't ...
I thought the whole ...

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:12.845
Christine just got your
fucking house put on a list.

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:14.180
I thought ... It's so funny
when you look at it, too.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.981
It's like person.

00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:18.618
You try to put girl or child but
you're like, "pees on a person."

00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:20.953
You just got ...
You're going the long way.

00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:22.955
I'm going to be shaking my head
wrapped in a blanket

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:24.490
while they're carting
Christine off, like,

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.492
"I had no idea
the person she was."

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:28.528
"Mr. Oakerson,
this woman's a monster."

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:31.731
"You have a computer filled
with child pornography."

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:33.833
Goes, "Christine,
I would have never ...

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:35.401
I have a daughter."

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:36.835
"We're going to have to
[crosstalk 00:00:35]."

00:00:36.835 --> 00:00:38.771
Yeah. Well ...
"I left her alone with her."

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:40.607
"I've left her alone ...
I think now of the things

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:42.341
I've done to her
that I don't even know."

00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:45.078
"I have a daughter to call
and apologize to."

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:50.349
Oh, wow. That's creepy, dude.

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:51.951
He was 27 and she was 15?

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.419
Yeah, she ...

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:55.254
Yeah. In this interview,
they say she ...

00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:57.357
She goes, "Oh, we don't talk
about my age. It's a secret."

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:58.858
Because I think
she was like 13 here.

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:00.359
What the fuck?

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.861
She started coming around him
when she was 12.

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:03.329
Because she ...
Yeah, because she was 12.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.763
She was 15
when they got married.

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:06.599
The song ...
Her first song is called "Age

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:08.301
Ain't Nothing But A Number,"
that I think he wrote.

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:09.835
Yeah, I remember that.
Of course he wrote that.

00:01:09.835 --> 00:01:11.704
That's like pen ...
are you kidding me?

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:13.205
He fucking ... the second they
started banging, I got a song.

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:14.574
This is crazy.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:16.275
It was probably already
in his diary.

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:17.911
Like read this.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.979
It's just about her
wanting to fuck an older guy.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.480
That's what the song's about.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.949
It's her trying to seduce
an older guy

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:24.350
and telling him
it's okay to fuck her.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.485
Didn't she die at 15?

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:28.021
No. She died at like-

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:32.091
31 I think.
21 ... she was dating Dave Dash.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:33.292
Oh, that's right. Okay.

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:35.027
She died in a plane cra ... No.

00:01:35.027 --> 00:01:38.064
Wasn't she promoting
Queen of the Damned

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:39.598
or whatever when it happened?

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:43.202
Yeah, it was like overseas
[crosstalk 00:01:42].

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:44.437
22. In 2001.

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:47.173
Hawaii maybe.
She was so hot.

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:48.407
Yeahs he was.

00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:49.842
But when she became a woman.

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:51.678
Yeah, when she became
[crosstalk 00:01:51]

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:53.345
No, but I'm saying,
everything I was watching

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:55.114
yesterday
when they were showing her,

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:57.349
she's like a pretty young girl,
but she looks kind of 15.

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:00.652
If Chapelle's show was 2003,
we've been laughing at piss

00:02:00.652 --> 00:02:02.788
and R. Kelly for 16 years
[crosstalk 00:02:03].

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:04.857
That's crazy. Is he going to get
a plaque at one point?

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:06.526
He should.

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:08.294
Like a welcome to 20 years of
laughing at piss and R. Kelly.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:11.530
Well they say that they were
on the tour bus and hit ...

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:14.601
you've been on a tour bus
and stuff before.

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:15.935
What are you saying,
that I've been pissed on?

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:17.603
No the back door is ...

00:02:17.603 --> 00:02:20.340
when you hit bumps, like doors
fly around sometimes and shit.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.708
And like the back door
flew open,

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:23.176
they said he was
just fucking Aaliyah.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:24.610
Jesus.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.279
Like the background singer girls
were all like,

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:27.747
"He was just fucking her,"
and everyone's like,

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:29.682
"Oh, come on."
Then they got married.

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:31.551
And then that got
annulled immediately.

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:33.218
Well it got annulled because
she put on the marriage

00:02:33.218 --> 00:02:34.753
certificate that she was 18.

00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:37.056
She was not 18.
She was 15. There was no parent.

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:38.524
Fucking 15.

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:39.958
But her uncle, I'm trying
to figure out

00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.960
where her parents were
in this whole thing

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.629
because her uncle's the one
that brought her around R. Kelly

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.431
in the first place.
They worked together.

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:46.632
I didn't know that at all.

00:02:46.632 --> 00:02:48.034
But this dude went for it all.

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:50.203
He had a background singer
named Sparkle

00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:52.372
who did a song with him,

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:53.940
like they did a duet song at
one point when he brought up ...

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.109
But they all say
he was abusive ...

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.878
Oh I know, it's like she looks
like a Sparkle by the way.

00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:01.914
He got abusive and shitty
to everybody,

00:03:01.914 --> 00:03:04.016
like really treats them
very bad,

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:05.785
controlling as shit, which ...

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.122
So he's not only a monster,

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:11.156
but he's an asshole
on top of being a monster?

00:03:11.156 --> 00:03:12.825
He's an asshole and monster,

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:14.694
and I mean a monster
in the sense that he'd also ...

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.629
he was like controlling
and bullying

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.330
and putting all these weird
rules and curfews

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.100
on his background singer,
that Sparkle chick or whatever.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.371
And then pissing on her niece,
is the girl from the video.

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:27.172
Now didn't he have-

00:03:27.172 --> 00:03:31.077
And his bass player's daughter.
This guy had no scruples at all.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.612
Wait, he pissed on his
bass player's daughter?

00:03:33.612 --> 00:03:34.947
I mean I assume he pissed on ...

00:03:34.947 --> 00:03:36.682
I don't think
he had one piss girl.

00:03:36.682 --> 00:03:38.184
Does he mark is territory?

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:39.485
I think he always pissed
on them probably.

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:40.919
He's very wolf with that.

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.121
Yeah, he brought up
piss pretty quick

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:43.822
I assume to every girl.

00:03:43.822 --> 00:03:45.691 align:start position:0%
Guys, I hate to say this, but
we have to dismiss this in court

00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:49.429
because he goes by wolf law.
It's a pack mentality.

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:51.097
It's whoever has
the highest piss.

00:03:51.097 --> 00:03:52.297
I'm sorry.

00:03:52.297 --> 00:03:53.899
What's the pH level on that?

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:56.168
That piss is fucking acidic
as shit.

00:03:56.168 --> 00:03:58.304
Check the pH on that shit.

00:03:58.304 --> 00:04:01.473
It sounds a little cute
when we just keep saying,

00:04:01.473 --> 00:04:03.242
even though
it's a creepy thing,

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:05.478
it's like he was pissing
on them, but also fucking them.

00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:06.946
Also fucking the children.

00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:08.380
It's true,
and here's what sounds

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.049
[crosstalk
00:04:08].

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.750
She's right though.
The piss was just foreplay.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.219
We have to understand that.

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:14.386
I don't know, can you pee
and then fuck?

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:15.855
But here's the thing,

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:17.723
I don't think he fucks
the girl in the video.

00:04:17.723 --> 00:04:19.125
I think it's just the piss
[crosstalk 00:04:18]

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:21.027
I can't even piss with a boner.

00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:22.795
Yeah ... true.
You're just going everywhere.

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:24.663
Yeah just piss and just jizz.

00:04:24.663 --> 00:04:26.966
Oh dude. Can you imagine
finding that out?

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:28.700
Like dad, I've got
to tell you something.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.302
He goes, what's up baby?

00:04:30.302 --> 00:04:31.704
Yeah, you know your cash cow?

00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:33.239
That had that feature?
We had to bite it.

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:34.807
You know Uncle Robo?

00:04:35.307 --> 00:04:40.579
The lead singer of Queensryche,
I believe the story only because

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:43.415
I met the girl
who was a wacker, his daughter.

00:04:44.016 --> 00:04:49.122
His daughter was fucking
his guitar player.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.656
Sick.

00:04:50.656 --> 00:04:51.957
And got pregnant,
but make sure I got this right

00:04:51.957 --> 00:04:53.692
Christine,
got pregnant by-

00:04:53.692 --> 00:04:54.927
What a rockin' baby. Am I right?

00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:56.695
Yeah, it's a cool kid already.

00:04:56.695 --> 00:05:00.232
She got pregnant by him,
and then started ...

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.501
oh no, I'm sorry.
So that's right.

00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:05.437
So she started fucking
the guitar player.

00:05:05.437 --> 00:05:06.972
Is this Silent Lucidity?
Yeah.

00:05:06.972 --> 00:05:09.142
It's the only
Queensryche song I know.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.643
No, you know other ones.

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.712
Dude, but walking past
the classic rock station

00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:14.847
for five years in Tucson,
and just hear like,

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:20.285
"It's 96.1 KLPX with
Queensryche's Silent Lucidity.

00:05:20.285 --> 00:05:27.526
And you're like, hush now ...
Emotional Queensryche.

00:05:27.526 --> 00:05:29.228
It's a ballad really.

00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:31.097
His daughter,
lead singer's daughter,

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:34.534
started fucking a guitar player
and was really into ...

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:37.369
maybe even married him?
And he goes ...

00:05:38.537 --> 00:05:40.940
he was touring solo
or maybe it's Queensryche,

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.077
but he goes, "All right,
I'll make him a guitar player."

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:46.612
So he becomes a guitar player,
you got a guitar player,

00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:48.547
and now you got to hire
a guitar tech.

00:05:49.014 --> 00:05:51.217
So she starts
fucking his guitar tech.

00:05:51.217 --> 00:05:55.087
Oh boy. Well he's tuning her up.
Did you get that on tape

00:05:55.087 --> 00:05:57.756
when I connected
perfectly with that joke?

00:05:57.756 --> 00:06:01.393
But here's the best part of it.
Then he goes ...

00:06:02.094 --> 00:06:04.396
she got together ...
the girl got pregnant

00:06:04.396 --> 00:06:06.132
by the guitar tech
or something, whatever it is.

00:06:06.132 --> 00:06:08.100
So then the merch guy's in it.
No.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.102
Oh god, I thought you were
going to say that.

00:06:10.102 --> 00:06:12.038
Then the lead singer goes,
"All right,

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:14.773
well you're going to be
the father of my grandkids,

00:06:14.773 --> 00:06:17.376
so you're in the" ...
So these guys got to play ...

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:19.244
there's two guitar players
on either side of him

00:06:19.244 --> 00:06:20.746
are two guys
that plugged his daughter.

00:06:20.746 --> 00:06:22.447
It's so weird.

00:06:22.447 --> 00:06:24.383
Hilarious. Just the thought
of playing Silent Lucidity

00:06:24.383 --> 00:06:26.819
while you stare across the stage
at the guy that took your women,

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:28.253
you're like ...

00:06:28.253 --> 00:06:30.356
And look at her dad singing.
You go ...

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.891
And her dad's looking at them
going like,

00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:34.493
"I bet you guys have
all fucked my daughter

00:06:34.493 --> 00:06:36.963
to this song at some point."
You freaky weirdos.

00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:38.931
It's actually about her.

00:06:40.565 --> 00:06:42.835
Ah dude, that's so funny
when they're just fucking death

00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:45.203
staring each other,
and then he sees them and smile.

00:06:45.203 --> 00:06:46.872
They go ...

00:06:46.872 --> 00:06:48.908
Yeah, they probably didn't have
a lot of motivation

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:51.210
to keep going
as a band after that.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.247
By the way, by the way this song
might be about her.

00:06:55.247 --> 00:06:56.949
It might actually be about ...
could be.

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:59.385
Dude, that's so funny.
What a weird ...

00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:01.453
and then she's just in the
audience with her lighter up.

00:07:01.453 --> 00:07:04.356
She's going, "It's about me
and I fucked two-thirds of that,

00:07:04.356 --> 00:07:06.759
and one of them,
I'm made from his cum."

00:07:09.027 --> 00:07:11.864
"There is a petri dish
of my puss up on that stage."

00:07:11.864 --> 00:07:13.432
Does she know which one
is the dad?

00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:16.436
The thing that made it
and the things that ate it.

00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:20.406
She goes,
"Yeah that's my proud papa

00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:25.978
and flanking him
is the dick that I take."

00:07:25.978 --> 00:07:29.014
He goes, "Hey pop,
this isn't the first time

00:07:29.014 --> 00:07:30.816
those guys been either side

00:07:30.816 --> 00:07:32.651
of the Queensryche family,
know what I'm saying?"

00:07:32.651 --> 00:07:34.152
Get it, mom got a piece, too.

00:07:34.152 --> 00:07:35.954
"All right guys.
Let's play the songs."

00:07:35.954 --> 00:07:37.423
Come on.
We're professionals here.

00:07:37.423 --> 00:07:38.791
We're professionals.

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:40.359
Let's get it together guys.
Guys-

00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:42.962
"I get it. You all fucked
my daughter, ha-ha."

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:44.597
Guys, this carnival means ...

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:46.165
Chuckle, chuckle, okay, okay.

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:47.933
We've done it a million times
with this joke.

00:07:47.933 --> 00:07:50.569
"All right, we get it,
my daughter's fertile.

00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:52.371
She likes guitar."
Guys ...

00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:55.674
"The time on the tour bus
when the bathroom fell open

00:07:55.674 --> 00:07:57.576
and we were all banging.
I remember."

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.646
"All right guys, I get it,
another one on old Jeff.

00:08:01.646 --> 00:08:03.349
Okay, okay."

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:06.018
But this state fair
isn't going to rock itself.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.555
There's a quarter-filled
amphitheater

00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:12.225
waiting for us guys.

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:13.926
Apathetic casino crowd.

00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:15.594
I'll tell you something, though.

00:08:15.594 --> 00:08:21.199
Liberty, Ohio tonight has
the better part of 170 people

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:23.201
waiting to hear
Silent Lucidity.

00:08:23.201 --> 00:08:25.905
God dammit, we're going to
play that and five other songs.

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:28.307
And the two guys
that thought it was

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:29.875
Queens of the Stone Age
who leave.

00:08:29.875 --> 00:08:31.576
"Should we open with new stuff?

00:08:31.576 --> 00:08:33.478
I'm just kidding.
We know we don't have any."

00:08:33.478 --> 00:08:36.348
"Can you guys unplug from my
daughter for a second and ..."

00:08:36.848 --> 00:08:38.918
Plug into the ol' amp.

00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:42.121
So R. Kelly
fucked his band-mate's kids?

00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:45.591
So this guy was just
a fucking straight up monster.

00:08:46.358 --> 00:08:48.493
He's compelled to do it,
and he's a predator.

00:08:48.493 --> 00:08:51.863
But he's definitely
a fucking sickness.

00:08:51.863 --> 00:08:54.667
But didn't he also have
a walk-in closet

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:56.468
of either kiddie porn or porn,

00:08:56.468 --> 00:08:59.705
and then most of it was
completely disgusting or ...

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:01.306
It's very possible.

00:09:01.306 --> 00:09:02.607
They went into his ...
I don't know if they went to-

00:09:02.607 --> 00:09:04.142
Like Al Capone's vault?

00:09:04.142 --> 00:09:05.878
Yeah, it would be weird
if it was on Cribs.

00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:07.312
"That's my kiddie porn room."

00:09:07.312 --> 00:09:09.348
And he goes,
"Oh, this shit right here,

00:09:09.348 --> 00:09:11.183
man you're going to love,
that's a sauna in the bathroom.

00:09:11.183 --> 00:09:12.651
Now this closet,

00:09:12.651 --> 00:09:14.520
that's where I keep
all my kids getting fucked."

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.021
"This faucet's solid gold.

00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:17.923
You ever see a 8-year-old
get pissed on?"

00:09:17.923 --> 00:09:19.691
And he goes,
"Oh, I got some Thai stuff

00:09:19.691 --> 00:09:22.427
that is definitely illegal."
He goes, "They don't even

00:09:22.427 --> 00:09:24.930
allow it over there
and they got no rules."

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.400
Dude, he hung out
at high schools.

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:30.803
Dude, you get out,
and you're like,

00:09:30.803 --> 00:09:32.204
"I am fucking stressed
about the SATs ...

00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:33.672
is that R. Kelly?
"

00:09:33.672 --> 00:09:35.207
Yeah. I mean a particular

00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:37.375
[crosstalk 00:09:37]
high school.

00:09:37.375 --> 00:09:39.311
"Is that R. Kelly
in the parking lot?"

00:09:39.311 --> 00:09:41.313
He's just sitting there
guzzling a gallon of water.

00:09:41.313 --> 00:09:44.216
Yeah, and he goes, "Ha-ha,
just Gatorade. Electrolytes."

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:46.685
Dude, all these teenagers
that he got pregnant and fucked,

00:09:46.685 --> 00:09:48.354
all of them ...

00:09:48.354 --> 00:09:51.890
it was always a situation like,
he was just at the mall.

00:09:52.357 --> 00:09:54.393
And they show him
going to the mall being like,

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:56.394
all right, we're at the mall,
let's see if we can lay low.

00:09:56.394 --> 00:09:59.131
But he's going to the mall
to see if 16-year-old girls,

00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:01.000
17-year-old girls
come up to him.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.368
And then he goes and has ...
it's the same move.

00:10:03.368 --> 00:10:05.371
He has people come back,
it's always girls that think

00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:07.372
they're going to be
back-up singers

00:10:07.372 --> 00:10:09.241
or have a chance
at their career,

00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:11.043
and they go and they're so ...
and you see this ...

00:10:11.043 --> 00:10:13.579
what's leading up to,
I saw a later episode,

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:15.381
I don't know much
of the middle of it,

00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:17.215
but a later episode
there's a family

00:10:17.215 --> 00:10:20.118
still looking for their daughter
who's with him.

00:10:20.118 --> 00:10:23.922
And her whole thing at first
was getting very mad

00:10:23.922 --> 00:10:26.391
when her parents followed her
to the hotel one time

00:10:26.391 --> 00:10:28.193
when she was 14 or 15.

00:10:28.193 --> 00:10:29.694
Holy shit.

00:10:29.694 --> 00:10:31.563
She came downstairs yelling
at them, "Like this is ...

00:10:31.563 --> 00:10:33.265
he's going to make me famous,
he's going to ...

00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:35.000
we've always talked about this.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.035
He's going to help
my singing career."

00:10:37.035 --> 00:10:39.004
So the parents start going like,

00:10:40.005 --> 00:10:41.707
"Maybe this is just business
or whatever,"

00:10:41.707 --> 00:10:44.010
and he's got her.
Fucking crazy.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.246
Dude, what an absolute
piece of shit.

00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:49.415
Can you imagine him just
hanging out at the mall, though?

00:10:49.415 --> 00:10:51.250
Like he's just trying
to lay low,

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.586
but he's pretending
to try on hats at Oshkosh.

00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:55.521
He's got to keep dodging
kiosk people.

00:10:55.521 --> 00:10:56.688
He just walks right-

00:10:56.688 --> 00:10:58.157
All these kiosk people are like,

00:10:58.157 --> 00:10:59.892
"Hey, you need a holder
for your phone?"

00:10:59.892 --> 00:11:02.528
He goes, "It's cool.
I'm walking through the mall."

00:11:02.528 --> 00:11:06.531
You just hear him go, "Ugh,"
outside of Forever 21.

00:11:07.532 --> 00:11:10.135
Yeah, he walks by Talbot's
and gets nauseous.

00:11:10.969 --> 00:11:12.738
"That's old lady shit."

00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:15.975
He's hiding inside
the shirt racks of Justice.

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:18.276
He goes, "Mmm."

00:11:18.276 --> 00:11:20.245
"Hey, what's up? They say
low rise is back in."

00:11:20.245 --> 00:11:23.782
He goes, "I'm was just looking
to purchase an American Girl

00:11:23.782 --> 00:11:26.852
for a lucky little lady."
He's outside the doll store.

00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:29.087
"Who wants a doll?"

00:11:29.087 --> 00:11:32.758
"I'm buying toys for everybody,
not the boys.

00:11:32.758 --> 00:11:34.426
Definitely not the boys.

00:11:34.426 --> 00:11:36.328
Definitely not the little girls
that I won't fuck.

00:11:36.328 --> 00:11:37.930
What's that?
Is this on? God dammit."

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.832
"Girl you want to go home
and play?"

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:43.269
He would just hang out
at the mall. What a-

00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:47.072
We'll get into it more.
Let's take our last break here.

00:11:47.072 --> 00:11:48.973
Because I'll tell you what's-

00:11:48.973 --> 00:11:50.676
Way to piss on the memento.
I'm kidding. You're doing great.

00:11:50.676 --> 00:11:52.077
What we looked up
what was fun yesterday,

00:11:52.077 --> 00:11:53.445
but I'm bummed you missed it

00:11:53.445 --> 00:11:55.213
because you would have
really enjoyed,

00:11:55.213 --> 00:11:58.016
is at one point,
a later episode,

00:11:58.016 --> 00:12:00.619
when R. Kelly's ex-wife
was leaving him,

00:12:01.186 --> 00:12:02.788
she describes
what she does with ...

00:12:02.788 --> 00:12:04.623
on the domestic abuse website.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:08.260
And there's a bunch of questions
they ask you, like 17.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.729
Oh I watched the Insta story.

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.363
She goes 17 questions,
and she goes,

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.865
"and there was only three things
he had not done to me."

00:12:13.865 --> 00:12:15.234
So we went on it.

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:16.535
Me and Christine
go back and forth.

00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:17.736
We were both abused.

00:12:17.736 --> 00:12:19.204
By each other?

00:12:19.204 --> 00:12:20.606
We were both abused
by each other, yeah.

00:12:20.606 --> 00:12:21.907
You guys both were abused
by each other?

00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:23.842
Yeah, we're dual-abusive.

00:12:23.842 --> 00:12:25.610
[crosstalk 00:12:23]

00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:31.350
We're not violent and we never
break up a thousand times.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.719
Then why are we stopping
this train guys?

00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:35.620
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
So it's fine.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.190
So once in a while I hit her
with the practice chucks?

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.691
Small price.
Small price to pay.

00:12:39.691 --> 00:12:41.694
On Tuesdays, I feel worthless.
It's fine.

00:12:41.694 --> 00:12:43.262
When we get her a spear,

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:44.963
she'll fucking be
right back in the game.

00:12:44.963 --> 00:12:46.198
Yeah, once you have a spear,
Christine,

00:12:46.198 --> 00:12:47.666
honestly it's a fair fight.

00:12:47.666 --> 00:12:49.467
Yeah, we'll be right back
with more

00:12:49.467 --> 00:12:52.804
Bonfire and nun chucks,
and pieces of shit.

00:12:53.271 --> 00:12:57.809
"Calling for you.
I'm calling ...

00:12:58.377 --> 00:13:01.146
tell your mom to hang up.
I got a real question to ask.

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:05.016
Seriously, I can hear your mom
breathing on the phone.

00:13:05.016 --> 00:13:07.353
Miss Leadleson,
please get off."

00:13:09.321 --> 00:13:13.725
"Is this the cops? This isn't R.
Kelly if you are the cops."

00:13:13.725 --> 00:13:16.728
"I'm going to go to the mall
and get an Orange Julius

00:13:16.728 --> 00:13:18.097
and some young puss."

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:19.665
"If you're for real,
meet me there.

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:23.502
I'm going to act like I don't
know you 'til we get outside."

00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:26.104
"Mrs. Fields,
do you have a daughter?"

00:13:26.104 --> 00:13:30.041
"I prefer the selection
at KB Toys.

00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:32.844
Only in the mall."

00:13:33.512 --> 00:13:35.914
"I'll be in GameStop
checking off."

00:13:36.347 --> 00:13:38.550
"Slap bracelets
for all my new bitches."

00:13:39.785 --> 00:13:43.289
"Cruisin' for puss.
Yeah, the class accessories.

00:13:45.257 --> 00:13:48.260
It's raining pussy
at Pierce and Pagoda."

"I'm cumming buckets
at Gymboree."

"I'm hiding in a basket of

00:14:07.178 --> 00:14:08.713
"I love watching women ride

that zebra slide
in the middle of the mall."

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:16.755

come in there. I'm Dan Soder.
