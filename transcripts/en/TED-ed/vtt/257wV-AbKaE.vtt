00:00:11.093 --> 00:00:13.984
As one of the most notorious gangsters
in history,

00:00:13.984 --> 00:00:19.928
Al Capone presided over a vast
and profitable empire of organized crime.

00:00:19.928 --> 00:00:21.738
When he was finally put on trial,

00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:26.363
the most he could be convicted of
was tax evasion.

00:00:26.363 --> 00:00:28.604
The nearly $100 million a year,

00:00:28.604 --> 00:00:32.308
that's 1.4 billion in today's currency,

00:00:32.308 --> 00:00:34.737
that Capone had earned from
illegal gambling,

00:00:34.737 --> 00:00:35.898
bootlegging,

00:00:35.898 --> 00:00:37.045
brothels,

00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:38.412
and extortion,

00:00:38.412 --> 00:00:41.317
would have served as evidence
of his crimes.

00:00:41.317 --> 00:00:44.985
But the money was nowhere
to be found.

00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:49.265
Capone and his associates had hidden it
through investments in various businesses

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:52.736
whose ultimate ownership
couldn't be proven,

00:00:52.736 --> 00:00:55.474
like cash-only laundromats.

00:00:55.474 --> 00:01:00.605
In fact, those laundromats are part of
the reason for the name of this activity,

00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:02.995
money laundering.

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:06.235
Money laundering came 
to be the term for any process

00:01:06.235 --> 00:01:12.185
that cleans illegally obtained funds
of their dirty criminal origins,

00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:16.516
allowing them to be used within
the legal economy.

00:01:16.516 --> 00:01:20.375
But Capone wasn't the first
to launder money.

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:24.606
In fact, this practice is about
as old as money itself.

00:01:24.606 --> 00:01:27.536
Merchants hid their riches from
tax collecters,

00:01:27.536 --> 00:01:31.746
and pirates sought to sell their bounty
without drawing attention

00:01:31.746 --> 00:01:33.836
to how they got it.

00:01:33.836 --> 00:01:36.096
With the recent arrival 
of virtual currencies,

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.766
offshore banking,

00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.467
the darknet,

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:41.136
and global markets,

00:01:41.136 --> 00:01:44.607
schemes have become much more complex.

00:01:44.607 --> 00:01:47.876
Although modern money laundering
methods vary greatly,

00:01:47.876 --> 00:01:50.836
most share three basic steps:

00:01:50.836 --> 00:01:51.948
placement,

00:01:51.948 --> 00:01:53.138
layering,

00:01:53.138 --> 00:01:55.476
and integration.

00:01:55.476 --> 00:02:00.337
Placement is where illegally obtained
money is converted into assets

00:02:00.337 --> 00:02:02.366
that seem legitimate.

00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:05.656
That's often done by depositing funds
into a bank account

00:02:05.656 --> 00:02:11.737
registered to an anonymous corporation
or a professional middleman.

00:02:11.737 --> 00:02:15.400
This step is where criminals are often
most vulnerable to detection

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.967
since they introduce massive wealth
into the financial system

00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:21.899
seemingly out of nowhere.

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:26.278
The second step, layering, involves
using multiple transactions

00:02:26.278 --> 00:02:30.067
to further distance the funds
from their origin.

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:33.127
This can take the form of transfers
between multiple accounts,

00:02:33.127 --> 00:02:35.758
or the purchase of tradable property,

00:02:35.758 --> 00:02:37.428
like expensive cars,

00:02:37.428 --> 00:02:38.303
artwork,

00:02:38.303 --> 00:02:39.917
and real estate.

00:02:39.917 --> 00:02:43.780
Casinos, where large sums of money
change hands every second,

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.208
are also popular venues for layering.

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:50.609
A money launderer may have their
gambling balance made available

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.960
at a casino chain's locations 
in other countries,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.709
or work with employees
to rig games.

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.260
The last step, integration, allows clean
money to re-enter the mainstream economy

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.059
and to benefit the original criminal.

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:08.669
They might invest it into a legal business

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:11.309
claiming payment by producing
fake invoices,

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:13.950
or even start a bogus charity,

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.490
placing themselves 
on the board of directors

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.370
with an exorbitant salary.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.689
Money laundering itself

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:26.950
wasn't officially recognized as a federal
crime in the United States until 1986.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.730
Before that point, the government
needed to prosecute a related crime,

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.680
like tax evasion.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.840
From 1986 on, they could confiscate
wealth simply by demonstrating

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.610
that concealment had occurred,

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.570
which had a positive effect on prosecuting
major criminal operations,

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.880
like drug traffickers.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.901
However, a legal shift has raised concerns

00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:53.931
involving privacy 
and government surveillance.

00:03:53.931 --> 00:03:55.852
Today, the United Nations,

00:03:55.852 --> 00:03:57.411
national governments,

00:03:57.411 --> 00:03:58.992
and various nonprofits

00:03:58.992 --> 00:04:00.932
fight against money laundering,

00:04:00.932 --> 00:04:06.031
yet the practice continues to play
a major role in global crime.

00:04:06.031 --> 00:04:08.816
And the most high-profile instances
of money laundering

00:04:08.816 --> 00:04:11.803
have involved 
not just private individuals,

00:04:11.803 --> 00:04:17.207
but major financial institutions
and government officials.

00:04:17.207 --> 00:04:20.102
No one knows for sure the total
amount of money

00:04:20.102 --> 00:04:22.833
that's laundered on a yearly basis,

00:04:22.833 --> 00:04:29.736
but some organizations estimate it to be
in the hundreds of billions of dollars.
