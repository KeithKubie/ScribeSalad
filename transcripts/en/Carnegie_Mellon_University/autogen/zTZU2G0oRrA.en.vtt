Institute as the right way to think
about it and we are trying to build this

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080
about it and we are trying to build this

on three pillars the first pillar is

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630
on three pillars the first pillar is
 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.490
on three pillars the first pillar is
transitioning to a lower carbon

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500
transitioning to a lower carbon
 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.260

sustainable energy future and the

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270
sustainable energy future and the
 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.180
sustainable energy future and the
implication of that is that coal and gas

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190
implication of that is that coal and gas
 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.650
implication of that is that coal and gas
are going to be here for a very very

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660
are going to be here for a very very
 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.530
are going to be here for a very very
long time so the goal is not to get rid

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540
long time so the goal is not to get rid
 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.030
long time so the goal is not to get rid
of them but the goal is to find better

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040
of them but the goal is to find better
 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.850
of them but the goal is to find better
ways to make them more efficient and to

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860
ways to make them more efficient and to
 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.040
ways to make them more efficient and to
also start integrating renewables the

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050
also start integrating renewables the
 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.780
also start integrating renewables the
second pillar is going to be smart grid

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790
second pillar is going to be smart grid
 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.270
second pillar is going to be smart grid
because without that you can't integrate

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280
because without that you can't integrate
 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.970
because without that you can't integrate
the renewables and the third pillar is

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980
the renewables and the third pillar is
 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.950
the renewables and the third pillar is
going to be innovation in the area of

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960
going to be innovation in the area of
 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.610
going to be innovation in the area of

this energy and they need that fifty
 

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.819
this energy and they need that fifty
percent more energy in the next 25 years

00:13:32.819 --> 00:13:32.829
percent more energy in the next 25 years
 

00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:37.870
percent more energy in the next 25 years
where is it going to come from

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:37.880
 
 

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:43.550
 
well let's start with coal massive uses

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560
well let's start with coal massive uses
 

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.950
well let's start with coal massive uses
in the right now is happening in the use

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:45.960
in the right now is happening in the use
 

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.800
in the right now is happening in the use
of coal worldwide China India are

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:48.810
of coal worldwide China India are
 

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.420
of coal worldwide China India are
expected to be the two largest growth

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:50.430
expected to be the two largest growth
 

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.910
expected to be the two largest growth
areas and continue to be the two largest

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920
areas and continue to be the two largest
 

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.470
areas and continue to be the two largest
growth areas but it's going to

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480
growth areas but it's going to
 

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.600
growth areas but it's going to
exponentially accelerate especially in

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:56.610
exponentially accelerate especially in
 

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.090
exponentially accelerate especially in
India China is already on that path in

00:13:59.090 --> 00:13:59.100
India China is already on that path in
 

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.310
India China is already on that path in
India's right behind it you have

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:01.320
India's right behind it you have
 

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.840
India's right behind it you have
Indonesia and other places like that

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:02.850
Indonesia and other places like that
 

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:06.740
Indonesia and other places like that
same trajectory you have problems like

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:06.750
same trajectory you have problems like
 

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:10.070
same trajectory you have problems like
we saw a nuclear in Japan that looks

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:10.080
we saw a nuclear in Japan that looks
 

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.960
we saw a nuclear in Japan that looks
like it's going to shift them for demand

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:11.970
like it's going to shift them for demand
 

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.300
like it's going to shift them for demand
for coal in the short term more coal so

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:14.310
for coal in the short term more coal so
 

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:15.680
for coal in the short term more coal so
what is really going to happen in the

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:15.690
what is really going to happen in the
 

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:17.000
what is really going to happen in the
world and where is the demand going to

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.010
world and where is the demand going to
 

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.440
world and where is the demand going to
come from and what are the capabilities

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:18.450
come from and what are the capabilities
 

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.350
come from and what are the capabilities
of world to produce this energy versus

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360
of world to produce this energy versus
 

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.980
of world to produce this energy versus
other forms of energy well let's talk a

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:24.990
other forms of energy well let's talk a
 

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.640
other forms of energy well let's talk a
little bit about natural gas we always

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:28.650
little bit about natural gas we always
 

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.410
little bit about natural gas we always
knew the shale was there we always knew

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:30.420
knew the shale was there we always knew
 

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.960
knew the shale was there we always knew
that we have gas in the shale we didn't

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:32.970
that we have gas in the shale we didn't
 

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.210
that we have gas in the shale we didn't
know how much we never had the

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:35.220
know how much we never had the
 

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.970
know how much we never had the
technology to extract it because of

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:37.980
technology to extract it because of
 

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.310
technology to extract it because of
great engineers we figured out how to

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320
great engineers we figured out how to
 

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.740
great engineers we figured out how to
drill vertically and then drill

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:42.750
drill vertically and then drill
 

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.500
drill vertically and then drill
horizontally and frack the zones to

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:45.510
horizontally and frack the zones to
 

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.150
horizontally and frack the zones to
release the gas out of the shales and

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160
release the gas out of the shales and
 

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.880
release the gas out of the shales and
now it looks like we probably have at

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:49.890
now it looks like we probably have at
 

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:52.640
now it looks like we probably have at
least 30 times more gas in the United

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:52.650
least 30 times more gas in the United
 

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:54.530
least 30 times more gas in the United
States and we thought we had as little

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:54.540
States and we thought we had as little
 

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.530
States and we thought we had as little
as six to seven years ago how think

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:57.540
as six to seven years ago how think
 

00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.329
as six to seven years ago how think
about that when you have this huge

00:14:59.329 --> 00:14:59.339
about that when you have this huge
 

00:14:59.339 --> 00:15:01.640
about that when you have this huge
reserves of energy that has now been

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:01.650
reserves of energy that has now been
 

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.410
reserves of energy that has now been
able to be tapped the world energy has

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:03.420
able to be tapped the world energy has
 

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.870
able to be tapped the world energy has
started to change and sort of shipping

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:05.880
started to change and sort of shipping
 

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.540
started to change and sort of shipping
our dollars overseas we need to learn to

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:08.550
our dollars overseas we need to learn to
 

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.880
our dollars overseas we need to learn to
extract our energy right at home now

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:10.890
extract our energy right at home now
 

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:12.410
extract our energy right at home now
when you think of marcellus shale and

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:12.420
when you think of marcellus shale and
 

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.990
when you think of marcellus shale and
you think of shale plays in this area

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000
you think of shale plays in this area
 

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
you think of shale plays in this area
think of it in terms of embryo it has to

it's just on that we are just at the
 

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:33.590
it's just on that we are just at the
beginning of the marcellus age in terms

of what can be done in terms of energy

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:35.130
of what can be done in terms of energy
 

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:37.340
of what can be done in terms of energy
for the United States but in terms of

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:37.350
for the United States but in terms of
 

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:40.460
for the United States but in terms of
Western PA this will be as important to

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:40.470
Western PA this will be as important to
 

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.500

century that's how big this fight is
 

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:48.500
century that's how big this fight is
that's amazing and the demand in the

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:48.510
that's amazing and the demand in the
 

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:51.350
that's amazing and the demand in the
United States for low-cost energy is

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360
United States for low-cost energy is
 

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.319

the world deserves a right to have some
 

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.590
the world deserves a right to have some
access to energy how is it human right

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:14.600
access to energy how is it human right
 

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.240
access to energy how is it human right
it's not it's not a legislative right

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:17.250
it's not it's not a legislative right
 

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.150
it's not it's not a legislative right
but I think it's human right and if they

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160
but I think it's human right and if they
 

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.829
but I think it's human right and if they
have the access they have a better

00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839
have the access they have a better
 

00:16:21.839 --> 00:16:23.660

have access to energy right now but it's
 

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.930
have access to energy right now but it's
changing because the technology of the

now we need to figure that out as a
 

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:09.260
now we need to figure that out as a
society or maybe you need to figure out

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:09.270

Pittsburgh a hundred years ago so you

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:47.460
Pittsburgh a hundred years ago so you
 

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.390
Pittsburgh a hundred years ago so you
can see how it's involving Europe has a

need these resources
 

00:18:01.059 --> 00:18:03.299
need these resources
to go so that creates an opportunity for

00:18:03.299 --> 00:18:03.309
to go so that creates an opportunity for
 

00:18:03.309 --> 00:18:07.769

world okay what about opportunities for
natural gas like I said we think we have

00:18:18.239 --> 00:18:18.249
natural gas like I said we think we have
 

00:18:18.249 --> 00:18:20.070
natural gas like I said we think we have
as much as 30 times more gas than we

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080
as much as 30 times more gas than we
 

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.669
as much as 30 times more gas than we
thought we had five and six years ago

00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:22.679
thought we had five and six years ago
 

00:18:22.679 --> 00:18:26.369
thought we had five and six years ago
now natural gas how important is it is

00:18:26.369 --> 00:18:26.379
now natural gas how important is it is
 

00:18:26.379 --> 00:18:28.080
now natural gas how important is it is
twenty percent of our electricity it

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:28.090
twenty percent of our electricity it
 

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:31.230

that has natural gas and we found 30

00:18:36.149 --> 00:18:36.159
that has natural gas and we found 30
 

00:18:36.159 --> 00:18:39.570
that has natural gas and we found 30
times more it could be in exported only

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:39.580
times more it could be in exported only
 

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.249
times more it could be in exported only
five years ago we thought we were going

00:18:41.249 --> 00:18:41.259
five years ago we thought we were going
 

00:18:41.259 --> 00:18:43.739
five years ago we thought we were going
to import most of our natural gas now we

00:18:43.739 --> 00:18:43.749
to import most of our natural gas now we
 

00:18:43.749 --> 00:18:45.269
to import most of our natural gas now we
think we're going to export most of our

00:18:45.269 --> 00:18:45.279
think we're going to export most of our
 

00:18:45.279 --> 00:18:47.070
think we're going to export most of our
natural gas and it's all based on a

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:47.080
natural gas and it's all based on a
 

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.220
natural gas and it's all based on a
change in technology access right under

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:50.230
change in technology access right under
 

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.619

our feet to natural gas that could be

00:18:52.619 --> 00:18:52.629
our feet to natural gas that could be
 

00:18:52.629 --> 00:18:54.840
our feet to natural gas that could be
extracted before with the same

technology we've used for a hundred
 

00:18:56.259 --> 00:18:58.440
technology we've used for a hundred
years in terms of vertical fracking we

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:58.450
years in terms of vertical fracking we
 

00:18:58.450 --> 00:18:59.609
years in terms of vertical fracking we
just learned to how to frack it

00:18:59.609 --> 00:18:59.619
just learned to how to frack it
 

00:18:59.619 --> 00:19:02.460
just learned to how to frack it
horizontally what an amazing change it

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:02.470
horizontally what an amazing change it
 

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:03.930

and these things were developed with

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:03.940
and these things were developed with
 

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.180
and these things were developed with
engineers trying to find oil in the

engineers trying to find oil in the
 

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:08.070
engineers trying to find oil in the
Gulf's and so forth we applied it to

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080
Gulf's and so forth we applied it to
 

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.570
Gulf's and so forth we applied it to
natural gas and it's working very well

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:09.580
natural gas and it's working very well
 

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:13.019
natural gas and it's working very well
so we could be an exporter not only of

00:19:13.019 --> 00:19:13.029
so we could be an exporter not only of
 

00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:15.330
so we could be an exporter not only of
coal but also of natural gas going

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:15.340
coal but also of natural gas going
 

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:16.889
coal but also of natural gas going
forward because its energy demand

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:31.810
something that we should do and seventy
percent of that coal is owned by the

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:31.820
percent of that coal is owned by the
 

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.970
percent of that coal is owned by the
federal government which means it's

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:33.980
federal government which means it's
 

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:37.720
federal government which means it's
owned by us as citizens so for us to to

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:37.730
owned by us as citizens so for us to to
 

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.270
owned by us as citizens so for us to to
look at this resource and lock it up and

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:40.280
look at this resource and lock it up and
 

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.220
look at this resource and lock it up and
not use it for the good of society is

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:42.230
not use it for the good of society is
 

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:43.990
not use it for the good of society is
absolutely the wrong thing all we need

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000
absolutely the wrong thing all we need
 

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.180
absolutely the wrong thing all we need
is technology and that technology is the

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:46.190
is technology and that technology is the
 

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:49.000
is technology and that technology is the
burnet cleaner to sequestered carbon and

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:49.010
burnet cleaner to sequestered carbon and
 

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:50.770
burnet cleaner to sequestered carbon and
do all those things that create a lot of

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:50.780
do all those things that create a lot of
 

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.700
do all those things that create a lot of
value for society

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:54.710
 
 

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:59.510
 
how regulation I'd say I think when we

00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520
how regulation I'd say I think when we
 

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:04.970
how regulation I'd say I think when we
talk about regulation sometimes we live

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:04.980
talk about regulation sometimes we live
 

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.440
talk about regulation sometimes we live
in a society where were so far ahead

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:06.450
in a society where were so far ahead
 

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.110
in a society where were so far ahead
there are regulations burden what we've

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120
there are regulations burden what we've
 

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.940
there are regulations burden what we've
been doing and it drives a cost up and

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:10.950
been doing and it drives a cost up and
 

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:13.190
been doing and it drives a cost up and
I'll give you example the cost of a ton

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200
I'll give you example the cost of a ton
 

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.860
I'll give you example the cost of a ton
of coal seven years ago and the United

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:15.870
of coal seven years ago and the United
 

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:17.530
of coal seven years ago and the United
States was about thirty dollars a ton

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:17.540
States was about thirty dollars a ton
 

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:21.230
States was about thirty dollars a ton
the cost of a ton of coal today is about

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240
the cost of a ton of coal today is about
 

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.380
the cost of a ton of coal today is about
sixty dollars a ton and rising and it's

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:24.390
sixty dollars a ton and rising and it's
 

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:26.720
sixty dollars a ton and rising and it's
because the cost of regulation is rising

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:26.730
because the cost of regulation is rising
 

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.130
because the cost of regulation is rising
now are we making a better

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:28.140
now are we making a better
 

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.990
now are we making a better
environmentally sure we are are we

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000
environmentally sure we are are we
 

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.550
environmentally sure we are are we
making a tough around the economy to

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:31.560
making a tough around the economy to
 

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.280
making a tough around the economy to
compete worldwide we are so that new

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:34.290
compete worldwide we are so that new
 

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:35.840
compete worldwide we are so that new
technology that we're talking about has

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:35.850
technology that we're talking about has
 

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:38.840
technology that we're talking about has
to be competitive and it has to be with

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:38.850
to be competitive and it has to be with
 

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:41.510
to be competitive and it has to be with
natural gas and with cold because of we

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520
natural gas and with cold because of we
 

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.820
natural gas and with cold because of we
take these valuable resources we lock

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:43.830
take these valuable resources we lock
 

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.920
take these valuable resources we lock
them up and then try to compete with the

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:45.930
them up and then try to compete with the
 

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:47.270
them up and then try to compete with the
rest of the world all we do is drive the

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.280
rest of the world all we do is drive the
 

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.310
rest of the world all we do is drive the
price of what we're doing up and that

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320
price of what we're doing up and that
 

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.630
price of what we're doing up and that
and that's an important thing to

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640
and that's an important thing to
 

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:58.730
and that's an important thing to
understand

00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:58.740
 
 

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:03.090
 
now let's talk about energy policy our

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:03.100
now let's talk about energy policy our
 

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.860
now let's talk about energy policy our
country does not have an energy policy

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:04.870
country does not have an energy policy
 

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:09.870
country does not have an energy policy
has not had an energy policy and i would

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:09.880
has not had an energy policy and i would
 

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.270
has not had an energy policy and i would
say in some senses it's almost been an

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:12.280
say in some senses it's almost been an
 

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.700
say in some senses it's almost been an
anti energy policy in terms of we

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:14.710
anti energy policy in terms of we
 

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:17.340
anti energy policy in terms of we
haven't focused on our own resources and

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:17.350
haven't focused on our own resources and
 

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:19.740
haven't focused on our own resources and
applied technology for the good of the

applied technology for the good of the
 

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:21.630
applied technology for the good of the
citizens what we've done is put

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:21.640
citizens what we've done is put
 

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.360
citizens what we've done is put
regulation after regulation on top of

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:24.370
regulation after regulation on top of
 

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.340
regulation after regulation on top of
what was already in place made it more

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:26.350
what was already in place made it more
 

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.590
what was already in place made it more
expensive and we have a very scattered

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:28.600
expensive and we have a very scattered
 

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.240
expensive and we have a very scattered
energy policy in fact our energy policy

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:32.250
energy policy in fact our energy policy
 

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:35.820
energy policy in fact our energy policy
would almost look like countries who

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:35.830
would almost look like countries who
 

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:41.810
would almost look like countries who
don't have any energy domestically if

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:41.820
don't have any energy domestically if
 

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:45.510
don't have any energy domestically if
Japan had our resources they would

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520
Japan had our resources they would
 

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.190
Japan had our resources they would
conquer the world just with their own

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200
conquer the world just with their own
 

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.960
conquer the world just with their own
industry but they have to import

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:48.970
industry but they have to import
 

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:52.410
industry but they have to import
everything that they have and we have it

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:52.420
everything that they have and we have it
 

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.330
everything that they have and we have it
right here under our feet but we debate

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:54.340
right here under our feet but we debate
 

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.400
right here under our feet but we debate
whether we want to use it or not so the

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:56.410
whether we want to use it or not so the
 

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.290
whether we want to use it or not so the
energy policy policy of the United

00:23:58.290 --> 00:23:58.300
energy policy policy of the United
 

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.600
energy policy policy of the United
States has to have and embrace

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:00.610
States has to have and embrace
 

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:03.000

technology and fossil fuels to move
 

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.220
technology and fossil fuels to move
forward if we don't do that we're

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:05.230
forward if we don't do that we're
 

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:07.830
forward if we don't do that we're
leaving all that valuable energy on the

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840
leaving all that valuable energy on the
 

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.100
leaving all that valuable energy on the
ground and we're taking away our edge

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:10.110
ground and we're taking away our edge

terms of competition so that's got to be
 

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:18.820

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:21.970
 
we really knew need a real portfolio of

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:21.980
we really knew need a real portfolio of
 

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.970
we really knew need a real portfolio of
energy choices now it took us two

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:24.980
energy choices now it took us two
 

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.230
energy choices now it took us two
hundred years ago where we're at in

hundred years ago where we're at in
 

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.120
hundred years ago where we're at in
terms of energy we went through the

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:28.130
terms of energy we went through the
 

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:30.100
terms of energy we went through the
Industrial Revolution where we're at

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:30.110
Industrial Revolution where we're at
 

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.769
Industrial Revolution where we're at
today think of all the things you use in

00:24:32.769 --> 00:24:32.779
today think of all the things you use in
 

00:24:32.779 --> 00:24:36.220
today think of all the things you use in
your life that use energy the heater

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:36.230
your life that use energy the heater

percent energy if you looked at all the

00:24:54.039 --> 00:24:54.049
percent energy if you looked at all the
 

00:24:54.049 --> 00:24:57.100
percent energy if you looked at all the
energy processes in making the steel and

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:57.110
energy processes in making the steel and
 

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.259
energy processes in making the steel and
extracting all the processes if you

00:24:59.259 --> 00:24:59.269
extracting all the processes if you
 

00:24:59.269 --> 00:25:01.899
extracting all the processes if you
change that very much you make that car

00:25:01.899 --> 00:25:01.909
change that very much you make that car

change that very much you make that car
so it's never competitive against with

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:03.500
so it's never competitive against with
 

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.560
so it's never competitive against with
other countries so if you double your

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:05.570
other countries so if you double your
 

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:07.930
other countries so if you double your
cost of energy you're going to you're

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:07.940
cost of energy you're going to you're
 

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.159
cost of energy you're going to you're
going to drive the cost of that vehicle

00:25:09.159 --> 00:25:09.169
going to drive the cost of that vehicle
 

00:25:09.169 --> 00:25:11.919
going to drive the cost of that vehicle
up and that's just on a that's just what

00:25:11.919 --> 00:25:11.929
up and that's just on a that's just what
 

00:25:11.929 --> 00:25:14.980
up and that's just on a that's just what
we looked at in terms of a vehicle what

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:14.990
we looked at in terms of a vehicle what
 

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:18.970
we looked at in terms of a vehicle what
happens to every product you have so we

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:18.980
happens to every product you have so we
 

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:21.220
happens to every product you have so we
got where we are because we use what we

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:21.230
got where we are because we use what we
 

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:24.460
got where we are because we use what we
had we had fossil fuels we invented

energy but i believe probably the most
 

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.820

couple generations ago everybody had a

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:17.090
couple generations ago everybody had a
 

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:19.450
couple generations ago everybody had a
gud furnace in their house and went to

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:19.460
gud furnace in their house and went to
 

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.400
gud furnace in their house and went to
natural gas then we distributed the

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:21.410
natural gas then we distributed the
 

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:23.080
natural gas then we distributed the
generation then we put scrubbers on the

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:23.090
generation then we put scrubbers on the
 

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:25.090
generation then we put scrubbers on the
power plants and now we're looking at

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:25.100
power plants and now we're looking at
 

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.100
power plants and now we're looking at
particulate matter beyond that and I

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:27.110
particulate matter beyond that and I
 

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:29.950
particulate matter beyond that and I
think it should it's a function of the

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:29.960
think it should it's a function of the
 

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:33.790
think it should it's a function of the

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:17.180
do with the pace of innovation and the
 

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:22.030
do with the pace of innovation and the
role of regulation in society so there's

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:22.040
role of regulation in society so there's
 

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.320
role of regulation in society so there's
the old adage about where you stand

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:23.330
the old adage about where you stand
 

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:26.860
the old adage about where you stand
depends on where you sit and not

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:26.870
depends on where you sit and not
 

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:29.530

necessarily the same place but we all
sit in this country and the trick is to

sit in this country and the trick is to
 

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:39.280
sit in this country and the trick is to
get that it's the Goldilocks moment just

is water that now does not have to be
 

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:52.859
is water that now does not have to be
treated and disposed of so you can

00:47:52.859 --> 00:47:52.869
treated and disposed of so you can
 

00:47:52.869 --> 00:47:54.480

that we didn't have to the cast and so
there is a real demand for natural gas

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040
there is a real demand for natural gas
 

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:09.069
there is a real demand for natural gas
that's not for cold and we'll fill that

and so that's one of the reason we got
 

00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:26.890
and so that's one of the reason we got
into the gas business because we knew

world's changing on this gas issue where
you're going to use gas where are you

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:12.250
you're going to use gas where are you
 

00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:16.940
you're going to use gas where are you
going to use coal if I'm up and the deep

hinterlands of China or India and I just
 

00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.589
hinterlands of China or India and I just
want electricity I'm going to go to coal

00:57:22.589 --> 00:57:22.599
want electricity I'm going to go to coal
 

00:57:22.599 --> 00:57:24.510
want electricity I'm going to go to coal
first and i'm going to i'm not worried

00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:24.520
first and i'm going to i'm not worried
 

00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:25.980
first and i'm going to i'm not worried
about what we're talking about I'm want

00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:25.990
about what we're talking about I'm want
 

00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:28.290
about what we're talking about I'm want
electricity and that remember that's two

00:57:28.290 --> 00:57:28.300
electricity and that remember that's two
 

00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:32.970
electricity and that remember that's two
billion people and they also read all

00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:32.980
billion people and they also read all
 

00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:35.460
billion people and they also read all
this off the internet because they have

00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:35.470
this off the internet because they have
 

00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:37.859
this off the internet because they have
internet even before electricity it's

00:57:37.859 --> 00:57:37.869
internet even before electricity it's
 

00:57:37.869 --> 00:57:40.680
internet even before electricity it's
interesting how that works but these

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:40.690
interesting how that works but these
 

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:42.839
interesting how that works but these
people want what we have and coal is

00:57:42.839 --> 00:57:42.849
people want what we have and coal is
 

00:57:42.849 --> 00:57:44.760
people want what we have and coal is
going to be the pace driver of that and

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:44.770
going to be the pace driver of that and
 

00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:47.280
going to be the pace driver of that and
so Cole really is the the common

00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:47.290
so Cole really is the the common
 

00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:50.400
so Cole really is the the common
denominator of humanity in terms of

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:50.410
denominator of humanity in terms of
 

00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:52.260
denominator of humanity in terms of
energy and then the rest of it is

00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:52.270
energy and then the rest of it is
 

00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:53.609
energy and then the rest of it is
technology to make it better for

00:57:53.609 --> 00:57:53.619
technology to make it better for
 

00:57:53.619 --> 00:57:56.520
technology to make it better for
everybody so there's an interesting

00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:56.530
everybody so there's an interesting
 

00:57:56.530 --> 00:57:58.830
everybody so there's an interesting
that you bring up in Africa I know there

00:57:58.830 --> 00:57:58.840
that you bring up in Africa I know there
 

00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:01.230
that you bring up in Africa I know there
are places which have cell phone access

00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:01.240
are places which have cell phone access
 

00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:03.030
are places which have cell phone access
but no electricity and there's a

00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:03.040
but no electricity and there's a
 

00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:04.770
but no electricity and there's a
business in taking your South when it

00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:04.780
business in taking your South when it
 

00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:07.020
business in taking your South when it
taking 30 miles away that is charged and

00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:07.030
taking 30 miles away that is charged and
 

00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:09.150
taking 30 miles away that is charged and
bring it back and people are actually

00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:09.160
bring it back and people are actually
 

00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:13.220
bring it back and people are actually
making some good letting knowing that

00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:13.230
 
 

00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:18.180
 
the keynote I think we heard discussed

00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:18.190
the keynote I think we heard discussed
 

00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:22.740
the keynote I think we heard discussed
about the regulations were being imposed

00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:22.750
about the regulations were being imposed
 

00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:25.260
about the regulations were being imposed
and but elsewhere in the keynote there

00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:25.270
and but elsewhere in the keynote there
 

00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:28.200
and but elsewhere in the keynote there
was a figure buck sixty percent more

00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:28.210
was a figure buck sixty percent more
 

00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:30.750
was a figure buck sixty percent more
efficient or or there was something

00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:30.760
efficient or or there was something
 

00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:34.230
efficient or or there was something
about the effectiveness not to reduction

00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240
about the effectiveness not to reduction
 

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:37.140
about the effectiveness not to reduction
for the compliment right well I guess is

00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:37.150
for the compliment right well I guess is
 

00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:39.030
for the compliment right well I guess is
it possible look back in terms of

00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:39.040
it possible look back in terms of
 

00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:41.070
it possible look back in terms of
historical ease up and make some kind of

00:58:41.070 --> 00:58:41.080
historical ease up and make some kind of
 

00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:43.880
historical ease up and make some kind of
reasonable judgment about the

00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:43.890
reasonable judgment about the
 

00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:46.290
reasonable judgment about the
regulations the effective regulation for

00:58:46.290 --> 00:58:46.300
regulations the effective regulation for
 

00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:48.690
regulations the effective regulation for
the event is that good or that bad so

00:58:48.690 --> 00:58:48.700
the event is that good or that bad so
 

00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:52.380
the event is that good or that bad so
that we can talk about regulations

00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:52.390
that we can talk about regulations
 

00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:54.880
that we can talk about regulations
these these are experts here on the

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:54.890
these these are experts here on the
 

00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:56.290
these these are experts here on the
regulation side and how to deal with

00:58:56.290 --> 00:58:56.300
regulation side and how to deal with
 

00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:58.300
regulation side and how to deal with
that I'm just going to say from a

00:58:58.300 --> 00:58:58.310
that I'm just going to say from a
 

00:58:58.310 --> 00:59:00.250
that I'm just going to say from a
business perspective regulation I think

00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:00.260
business perspective regulation I think
 

00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:03.520
business perspective regulation I think
makes us better every generation I just

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:03.530
makes us better every generation I just
 

00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:05.230
makes us better every generation I just
wanted to get to the point to where it's

00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:05.240
wanted to get to the point to where it's
 

00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:07.180
wanted to get to the point to where it's
so far ahead of us that it hurts us and

00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:07.190
so far ahead of us that it hurts us and
 

00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:09.010
so far ahead of us that it hurts us and
that's the concern from the business

00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:09.020
that's the concern from the business
 

00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:10.990
that's the concern from the business
side you might want to address the

00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:11.000
side you might want to address the
 

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.480
side you might want to address the
technology versus regulation yeah

00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:13.490
technology versus regulation yeah
 

00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:15.100
technology versus regulation yeah
they're there is a lot to learn I'm

00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:15.110
they're there is a lot to learn I'm
 

00:59:15.110 --> 00:59:17.230
they're there is a lot to learn I'm
going to let ed and maybe Calvin make

00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:17.240
going to let ed and maybe Calvin make
 

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:19.360
going to let ed and maybe Calvin make
some comments but add for sure relatives

00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:19.370
some comments but add for sure relatives
 

00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:21.100
some comments but add for sure relatives
technology wise to looking back at

00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:21.110
technology wise to looking back at
 

00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:23.350
technology wise to looking back at
learning curves for analogous technology

00:59:23.350 --> 00:59:23.360
learning curves for analogous technology
 

00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:27.100
learning curves for analogous technology
types and us learning from that and

00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:27.110
types and us learning from that and
 

00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:29.170
types and us learning from that and
maybe even accelerating or definitely at

00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:29.180
maybe even accelerating or definitely at
 

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:30.970
maybe even accelerating or definitely at
a minimum understanding when

00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:30.980
a minimum understanding when
 

00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:32.530
a minimum understanding when
technologies at a given point in time

00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:32.540
technologies at a given point in time
 

00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:34.090
technologies at a given point in time
could potentially be ready and available

00:59:34.090 --> 00:59:34.100
could potentially be ready and available
 

00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:37.450
could potentially be ready and available
so we do look back historically at these

00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:37.460
so we do look back historically at these
 

00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:39.790
so we do look back historically at these
learning curves and try to relate it to

00:59:39.790 --> 00:59:39.800
learning curves and try to relate it to
 

00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:41.620
learning curves and try to relate it to
the state of development that we have

00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:41.630
the state of development that we have
 

00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:43.300
the state of development that we have
today in determining what a technology

00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:43.310
today in determining what a technology
 

00:59:43.310 --> 00:59:45.820
today in determining what a technology
might be available and it happens to be

00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:45.830
might be available and it happens to be
 

00:59:45.830 --> 00:59:47.890
might be available and it happens to be
an expert in that area looking at these

00:59:47.890 --> 00:59:47.900
an expert in that area looking at these
 

00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:49.660
an expert in that area looking at these
past learning curves on the technologies

00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:49.670
past learning curves on the technologies
 

00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:57.820
past learning curves on the technologies
and yeah historically it depends on the

00:59:57.820 --> 00:59:57.830
and yeah historically it depends on the
 

00:59:57.830 --> 01:00:00.970
and yeah historically it depends on the
time frame our roads look we've done for

01:00:00.970 --> 01:00:00.980

and then by the time that we had a more

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:43.900
and then by the time that we had a more
 

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:47.880
and then by the time that we had a more
expensive system and the good news is

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:47.890
expensive system and the good news is
 

01:00:47.890 --> 01:00:49.529
