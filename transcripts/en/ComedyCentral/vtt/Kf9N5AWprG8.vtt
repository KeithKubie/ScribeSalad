00:00:01.968 --> 00:00:04.738
- The paramedic wanted
to tell me the worst news

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:07.774
in the least amount
of words possible.

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:08.608
What's happening?

00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:09.509
You just had a seizure!

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:10.643
Now what's gonna happen?

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:12.178
You're gonna have another!

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:13.246
(audience laughing)

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:16.850

Welcome to This Is Not Happening
Presents: One Crazy Night

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:31.998
So this is what we do.

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:33.299
Our bunch of comedians

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.268
tell stories about
a similar subject.

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:36.569
So this is just One Crazy Night.

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:39.172 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
Give it up for Mr.
T.J. Miller, everybody!

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:42.175 line:0%
(audience clapping)

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:45.011
What a crazy night!

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:48.181
You guys ever been on a bender?

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.216
It's like more than three
to four days of drinking

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.552
from morning to evening.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:55.555 align:start size:81% position:19%
You ever done a
three-week bender?

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:56.823
That's an interesting comedown.

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:58.158
You have to be careful, you know

00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:00.126
you obviously have withdrawal.

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:02.395 align:start size:97% position:3%
I had a particularly
difficult night of sweating

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:05.165 align:start size:94% position:6%
and waking up and you
hallucinate a little bit.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.333 align:start size:97% position:3%
And one of the hallucinations
I had was that the guy,

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.736 align:start size:94% position:6%
my buddy, who was letting
me stay at his place,

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:12.906
I woke up and he had also
been getting off a bender,

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:16.976
and he was like in the
corner, sort of naked.

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:18.845
Sort of, he was like naked.

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:20.213
(audience laughing)

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:21.548
And he was just going like this,

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:24.250 align:start size:88% position:13%
like, you ever seen
someone not quite dance?

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.253
(audience laughing)

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:35.261
Like it's just inches
from dancing, you know?

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:38.698 align:start size:88% position:13%
I mean, he was so
close to being dancing.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.035 align:start size:84% position:16%
And the next morning,
I came downstairs

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:44.671 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I was like, buddy,
what were you doing

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:47.507 align:start size:81% position:19%
at 7 a.m. in my
room, kinda naked,

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:49.242
well, naked

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:54.347 align:start size:84% position:16%
but just sort of
dancing in the corner?

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:57.417
That's weird, it's
uncomfortable to me.

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:58.985
I don't want to go on
benders with a person

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:00.787
that that will happen.

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:03.556 align:start size:84% position:16%
And he said, "What
are you talking about?

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:06.259 align:start size:97% position:3%
"My cousin had a 7 a.m.
flight, I was at the airport."

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.662
And I had never had a moment
switch from me being like,

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:11.564
weirdo to oh shit.

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:14.567
(audience laughing)

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:17.537
'Cause then I was
really the weirdo.

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:18.805
(audience laughing)

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.974
It went from him being
so strange that he was

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:23.143
sort of dancing naked in my room

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:26.012 align:start size:88% position:13%
to me being the guy
that when I hallucinate,

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:27.881
it's of my friend.

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:29.382
(audience laughing)

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:32.218 align:start size:81% position:19%
Sort of dancing
naked in the room.

00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:37.457 align:start size:84% position:16%
We didn't hang out for
a while after that.

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:41.327 align:start size:97% position:3%
But that's not the craziest
night I've ever had.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:45.498
The craziest night, I
almost died in 2010,

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:47.233
not from any of these fun things

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:49.302
that everyone's talking about.

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:52.138 align:start size:84% position:16%
I had an arteriovenous
malformation,

00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:54.474 align:start size:84% position:16%
which is a congenital
brain disorder

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:56.776 align:start size:97% position:3%
where there's a hemorrhaging
in a part of your brain

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:59.045
that has malformed
since you were born.

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:03.183
They later had to remove
about a golf-ball-size

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:06.286 align:start size:84% position:16%
chunk of my brain
from the frontal lobe.

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:08.087
Flash forward just
about six months,

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:10.924
I was doing a film
I'm sure you've seen,

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:12.358
Yogi Bear 3D.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:15.361
(audience laughing)

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:18.264
Of which I was the star,

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:26.339 align:start size:84% position:16%
and my behavior
had become erratic.

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:27.840
I mean really erratic.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.177 align:start size:88% position:13%
I got very excited about
entanglement puzzles,

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:32.912
I was studying them
and taking them apart

00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:34.547
and putting them back together.

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:36.049
I was speaking in narrative

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.117
where I would sort of talk
about the narrative path

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:40.853 align:start size:88% position:13%
of the conversation
before I engaged in it,

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:43.957
and then I would hit those
signposts in the conversation

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:45.692 align:start size:81% position:19%
and usually end
with a compliment.

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:48.394
(audience laughing)

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:49.229
It works.

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:52.031
Later, I would ask my friends,

00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:54.334 align:start size:97% position:3%
did you notice anything
weird about how I was acting?

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:55.868
And they were like,

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:57.303 align:start size:94% position:6%
oh yeah, we thought you
were on, like, hard drugs.

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:59.038
(audience laughing)

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:03.409
That really shows you how
good of friends you have.

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.011
They think you're on meth
and they're just like,

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:07.180 align:start size:84% position:16%
don't mention it,
it'll work itself out.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.183
(audience laughing)

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:16.189 align:start size:88% position:13%
So, you know, my
behavior being erratic,

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:18.992 align:start size:94% position:6%
I came back to the
States, finished the film,

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:21.961
which grossed $100
million domestic

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:24.030
and not bad for the first

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:29.936 align:start size:88% position:13%
talking bear hybrid
cartoon live-action 3D.

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.437
(audience laughing)

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.840
Oh yeah, there's gum on here.

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:41.047
So I was at lunch with
my terrible managers

00:04:41.047 --> 00:04:42.915
at a Beverly Hills lunch spot,

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:45.685
I'm sure it was vegetarian,

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:48.788 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I was pitching a
movie, this is all true,

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:50.290
about Chatroulette.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.158
Are you guys familiar
with Chatroulette?

00:04:52.158 --> 00:04:56.262 align:start size:97% position:3%
That social experiment that
turned into dicks immediately.

00:04:56.262 --> 00:04:59.432 align:start position:0%
I was pitching a terrible
horror film about Chatroulette,

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:00.633
where you get on,

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.735
and you sort of start
talking to a girl,

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:04.937
and they're talking for a while,

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:06.139 align:start size:84% position:16%
and they're just
getting to that point

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.273 align:start size:84% position:16%
where they might start
telling you about

00:05:07.273 --> 00:05:09.942
where they are in the world.

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:11.911 align:start size:84% position:16%
they find out they're
in the same state

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:13.379
in the United States.

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:16.449 align:start size:97% position:3%
And then right when he's
about to find out which city,

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.420 align:start size:94% position:6%
sort of a scary man walks
by in the background.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.823 align:start size:97% position:3%
And the guy's like,
There's a guy in your room.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:25.091
Who's that?

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:26.359
And she's like, ha,
yeah right, whatever

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:28.161
don't try to freak
me out, it's late.

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:32.365
And then the same stranger
walks by and goes like that.

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:33.766
Pretty good movie, right?

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:36.769
(audience laughing)

00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:40.673
Too bad it never got made

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:43.309
because of this crazy night
I'm about to tell you about.

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:46.312
(audience laughing)

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:50.717
So, again, the dark
stranger walks by,

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:52.952 align:start size:84% position:16%
not dark in ethnicity,
he's just doesn't,

00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:54.087
he's not well lit.

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:55.355
So he walks by.

00:05:57.623 --> 00:05:59.192 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm talking to my
managers, and I'm like,

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:01.828
and then, you know, he
comes directly behind her

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:03.963
and he makes this
really scary face.

00:06:03.963 --> 00:06:06.966
(audience laughing)

00:06:12.138 --> 00:06:14.841
And I fell on the ground,
and my managers were like,

00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:17.677
he has such commitment
to such a terrible idea.

00:06:17.677 --> 00:06:20.880
(audience laughing)

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.281
Then they realized I
had stopped breathing

00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:25.752 align:start size:94% position:6%
so they called the
ambulance, and I woke up.

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:27.286
"Boo!" goes one girl.

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:28.721
(audience laughing)

00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:30.857
I like your attitude
towards death, ma'am.

00:06:30.857 --> 00:06:33.359
(audience laughing)

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:34.761
What, you had to
go to the hospital?

00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:35.595
Booo!

00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:37.830
Keep it healthy!

00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:43.703
Multivitamins!

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:51.244
So I woke up in the ambulance,

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.712 align:start size:88% position:13%
and there's a
paramedic, and he goes,

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:53.646
you just had a seizure!

00:06:53.646 --> 00:06:55.114
I was like, huh?

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:56.883
He goes, "You're about
to have another seizure!"

00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:59.018
I was like, "Ah!" and
I passed back out.

00:06:59.018 --> 00:07:01.287
(audience laughing)

00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:02.688
What a bizarre...

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:06.125
The paramedic wanted to
tell me the worst news

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:08.795
in the least amount
of words possible.

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:10.163
(audience laughing)

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:11.931
You know what I mean.

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:14.033
What's happening?

00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:15.334
You just had a seizure!

00:07:15.334 --> 00:07:16.269
Now what's going to happen?

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.370
You're going to have another!

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.572
(audience laughing)

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:21.040
He's out guys, it's fine!

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.278 align:start size:97% position:3%
He knew what happened and
than what was going to happen.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.280
We can let this one go.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.283
(audience laughing)

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:33.352
The next time I woke
up, I woke up and I was

00:07:33.352 --> 00:07:36.189 align:start size:81% position:19%
in the ninth floor
of Cedars-Sinai

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:39.292
in what I would later
find out to be the ICU,

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:40.359
in the neurology ward.

00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:41.727
Nobody can talk up there,

00:07:41.727 --> 00:07:43.496 align:start size:84% position:16%
I was the only
person able to talk.

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:45.498
That's heavy duty brain problems

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:48.000
if you're in the
ICU, ninth floor.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.804
So I woke up, and I
was looking around,

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:54.307 align:start size:84% position:16%
and this nurse comes
in, and she goes,

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:56.375
"Um, your doctor cannot be here,

00:07:56.375 --> 00:08:00.146
"but a proxy will be
here in just a bit."

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.180
She walked out.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.183
(audience laughing)

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:10.790
There's that moment where you
don't have any information

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.191 align:start size:81% position:19%
and that's all
you've been given,

00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:14.260 align:start size:84% position:16%
and the first thought
I had was like,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.895
where's that paramedic guy?

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:18.464
(audience laughing)

00:08:18.464 --> 00:08:20.199
He'd know what the
fuck is going on.

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:23.603
(audience laughing)

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:24.537
He'd come in and be like,

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:25.938
doctor's gone, proxy coming.

00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:27.874
We'll explain proxy later!

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:30.877
(audience laughing)

00:08:35.414 --> 00:08:36.616
So I'm sort of waiting

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:38.751 align:start size:88% position:13%
and sitting in what
little knowledge I have,

00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:39.919
and this is all true.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:42.522
Then a robot wheeled in.

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:43.990
(audience laughing)

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.092 align:start size:84% position:16%
We all think of
robots as so exciting

00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:48.261 align:start size:81% position:19%
and helpful in
our everyday life,

00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:52.398 align:start size:88% position:13%
but when you're not
expecting to see a robot

00:08:52.398 --> 00:08:54.066
it's not like, hey, a robot!

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:55.668
You're like, oh no.

00:08:57.069 --> 00:08:57.904
A robot.

00:08:59.338 --> 00:09:02.642
But it sort of wheeled in; it
was on these Segway wheels,

00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:04.510
and it was a sort of a,

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.579
it had a column,

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:07.780
a metal column,

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.516 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then a flat-screen
little television

00:09:10.516 --> 00:09:14.353
with a camera on top and a
microphone at the bottom,

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:17.757
and it was sort of like
Skyping to another place,

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:20.393
and there was a
man's face on it.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:22.795
And it wheeled like this,

00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:24.230
and wheeled over,

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:27.199
and just looked at me.

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:29.468
And he's like, "I'm sorry
I can't be here right now,

00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:32.972
"but I've sent a
proxy in my place."

00:09:32.972 --> 00:09:34.206
And I couldn't help it.

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:36.943
I just went, are
we in the future?

00:09:36.943 --> 00:09:39.946
(audience laughing)

00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:44.517
And his reaction was so great,

00:09:44.517 --> 00:09:48.554 align:start size:97% position:3%
because he must have gotten
a lot of that, I guess,

00:09:48.554 --> 00:09:50.523 align:start size:81% position:19%
because he was
like, ha ha, okay.

00:09:50.523 --> 00:09:52.425 align:start size:81% position:19%
Anyway, I'll be
there on Thursday.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:55.795
(audience laughing)

00:09:55.795 --> 00:09:59.098
He just laughed and said,
"I'll be there on Thursday"

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:02.068
to a man who was
clearly terrified.

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:03.836
But I woke up the next
morning and they said,

00:10:03.836 --> 00:10:07.440
look, you just had
an AVM hemorrhage.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.176
AVMs are usually
found in autopsy.

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:12.311
Which means you're usually
dead when they find them,

00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:16.716
or you're in an almost worst
situation than being dead,

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:19.485 align:start size:97% position:3%
which is being in an autopsy
alive and you're like,

00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:20.419
stop, wait!

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:28.494 align:start size:94% position:6%
So he said, "Usually
these are found in autopsy

00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:29.962
"but you're lucky,

00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:32.131 align:start size:97% position:3%
"your brain started bleeding
probably six months ago.

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:33.866
"Did you notice any
erratic behavior?"

00:10:33.866 --> 00:10:35.134
And I said, "Yes."

00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:37.169 align:start size:88% position:13%
And he said, "Well it
was in the frontal lobe,

00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:38.971
"which is responsible
for the personality,

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:40.973 align:start size:84% position:16%
"so if there was
excess bleeding there,

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:42.508
"you'd feel more activity.

00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:46.345 align:start size:97% position:3%
"Did you have any grandeur,
delusional personality stuff?"

00:10:46.345 --> 00:10:48.214 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I was like, yeah,
you know it, man.

00:10:48.214 --> 00:10:51.851
(audience laughing)

00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:53.152
And he said, "Well, we're
going to have to go in

00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:54.820
"and we're going to
embolize that area.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.522
"And luckily it's close
enough to your skull

00:10:56.522 --> 00:10:59.458
"that we'll cut into it
and then we'll take out

00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:01.527
"a small piece of
your frontal lobe.

00:11:01.527 --> 00:11:03.195 align:start size:88% position:13%
"It was already
malformed to begin with,

00:11:03.195 --> 00:11:05.031 align:start size:94% position:6%
"so we don't think that
it'll affect your thinking

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:07.033
"or your personality,
but we're not sure.

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:11.103
"There's a 10% fatality
rate for the surgery.

00:11:11.103 --> 00:11:12.338
"You don't have to get it,

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:15.274
"but you'll probably
die in your mid 30's."

00:11:15.274 --> 00:11:17.009
And I was like, okay.

00:11:19.378 --> 00:11:21.847 align:start size:84% position:16%
Just give me the
options one more time.

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:23.783
Just kidding, I'll
have the surgery.

00:11:23.783 --> 00:11:25.317
(audience laughing)

00:11:25.317 --> 00:11:27.086 align:start size:81% position:19%
But you know I had
to ask, I said,

00:11:27.086 --> 00:11:28.954
"Well, I am a comedian,

00:11:28.954 --> 00:11:31.824
"I kind of make living off
of being sort of amusing

00:11:31.824 --> 00:11:35.127 align:start size:97% position:3%
"and entertaining, and
being able to look at things

00:11:35.127 --> 00:11:37.530
"in kind of a quirky, fun way."

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.832 align:start size:97% position:3%
For instance, my own death,
or something like that.

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:42.702
(audience laughing)

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:44.704 align:start size:84% position:16%
"So if you remove
this part of my brain,

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:48.074 align:start size:94% position:6%
"will that affect my
ability to do that work?"

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:50.910
And he was like,
uh, I don't know.

00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:53.345
But if you don't get it,

00:11:53.345 --> 00:11:55.481
you're probably
going to die, so.

00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:59.118
(audience laughing)

00:11:59.118 --> 00:12:00.853 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I said, "Yeah,
but I'm still asking."

00:12:00.853 --> 00:12:02.588
He said, look, friend

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.058
which is worse dying

00:12:08.427 --> 00:12:10.930
or not being as funny on stage

00:12:12.098 --> 00:12:14.066 align:start size:81% position:19%
when you tell your
little stories?

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:17.069
(audience laughing)

00:12:18.237 --> 00:12:20.406
And I was like, have
you ever been on stage

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:22.241
and not had it go well?

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:25.244
(audience laughing)

00:12:26.946 --> 00:12:28.347
He was like, no.

00:12:28.347 --> 00:12:31.851 align:start size:97% position:3%
I mean, I've a lot of
lectures to medical societies.

00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:33.385 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I was like, do you
ever start out with

00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:34.887
a joke or anything.

00:12:34.887 --> 00:12:37.156
And he said, "No, sometimes
I'll close with a joke."

00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:40.059
And I was like, has any of
those ever not gone well?

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:41.560
He's like, sometimes I feel like

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.763
they're starting on a path
where it's gonna go well

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.765
and then I get really confident,

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:49.869
and then it kind of goes
on longer than it should

00:12:49.869 --> 00:12:52.104 align:start size:88% position:13%
and then the payoff
isn't necessarily worth

00:12:52.104 --> 00:12:54.807
what I thought it
would be worth.

00:12:54.807 --> 00:12:57.176
And I was like,
isn't that awful?

00:12:57.176 --> 00:12:59.779
And he was like, yeah.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.280
(sighing)

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.748
