WE WIRE GUYS ON THE COURT
JUST TO HEAR

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:06.473
WHAT'S GOING ON
BEHIND THE SCENES.

00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:08.242
SO CHECK IT OUT.

00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:10.711

[blowing whistle]
THAT'S A CHARGE.

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:23.757
YOU SEEN
BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE?

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.826
I THOUGHT THAT MOVIE
WAS FUNNY.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.928
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS GETTING UP TO
AFTER THE GAME TONIGHT?

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.096

GONNA DO?

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:32.733
IS THERE A LIST, OR IS THIS,
UH, ANYBODY CAN WALK UP?

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.568
IS IT ONE OF THOSE LIST--
LIST THINGS?

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:35.903
I'M BEHIND YOU,
I'M BEHIND YOU,

00:00:35.936 --> 00:00:37.037
I'M BEHIND YOU,
I'M BEHIND YOU.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.173
ONE, TWO, THREE,
DRINKS ON THE COACH.

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:40.741
[laughing]

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:43.010
YOU GUYS GOT PLANS TONIGHT?
I'M, UH...

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:45.345
PROBABLY HANGING OUT
WITH THE PLAYERS.

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.681
IT'S A LIST-ONLY THING CLUB
SO YOU...

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.284
YOU PIECES OF [bleep]
CAN'T COME. LET'S GO!

00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:52.219
44.

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:54.321
THAT'S A FOUL
ON 44.

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:55.556
LOOK, IF YOU GUYS
WANT TO HANG OUT LATER,

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.057
WE CAN'T ARGUE LIKE THIS,
ALL RIGHT?

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.326
I HAVEN'T LOCKED IN PLANS YET,
ALL RIGHT?

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.460
- THESE GUYS ARE NOT
YOUR FRIENDS.

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:03.597
WE'RE NOT GOING OUT
FOR DRINKS.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.699
- FORGET ABOUT YOU.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.668
YOU GOT PLANS TONIGHT?

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.203

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.104
NO, YEAH, THOSE GUYS
WANT TO TAKE ME OUT,

00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:13.073
BUT I HAVEN'T LOCKED
ANYTHING IN YET, SO...

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:14.741
LET ME KNOW.

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:15.776
ALL RIGHT.

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:17.211
I DIDN'T HAVE A DAD.

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:20.347
THAT'S WHAT I GOT IN COMMON
WITH YOU BLACK KIDS.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.783
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS UP TO TONIGHT?
YOU GOT ANY PLANS?

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:24.418
- [grunting]

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.887
- [blowing whistle]
THAT'S A FOUL.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.955
LITTLE HELP.

00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:29.623
I WANT ONE OF THE PLAYERS
TO DO IT.

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:33.093
[groaning]

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.261
[sobs]

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:36.230
STOP CRYING,
YOU LITTLE BITCH.

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:39.266
THAT'S WHY DAD WALKED OUT.
THAT'S WHY EVERYBODY LEAVES.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.534
[clearing throat]

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.102
- YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
WHAT YOU HEAR ON THE COURT

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:43.237
WILL MAKE YOU
STRAIGHT-UP SAD.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.271
WE'LL BE BACK.
