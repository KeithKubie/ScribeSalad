LAURENCE MORONEY: Hi,
and welcome to part two

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.670
of this series on using Google
Colab to code, train, and test

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.760
neural networks in the browser
without needing to install

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.470
any kind of a runtime.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.590
In the previous video, Jake
introduced you to Colab

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.480
and how you can get
started with it.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.800
We'll take that to the
next level in this video,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.850
and I'm going to show you how
to install TensorFlow into Colab

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.310
and then play with the different
versions of TensorFlow,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.590
such as those that use the GPU.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.670
The first thing you can do
is to create a new Colab.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.420
Did you know that you
can do this directly

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.770
from Google Drive?

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.530
Just click New,
and you will find

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.640
Colaboratory in the More menu.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.680
Once the Colab is
created, you'll

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.810
have a new code
cell ready for you.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.360
You can then type
Python code into this.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.640
But I'll create a new
code cell and, in it, I

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.970
will use the PIP command
to install TensorFlow.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.740
PIP is a command line
tool, not a code command,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.860
so you have to prefix it
with an exclamation mark.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.130
That way Colab
will understand it.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.560
When I run the install
command, the environment

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.870
will download and
install TensorFlow

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.240
if it isn't already installed.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.000
You can then check if it worked
by printing out the installed

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.960
version.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.440
This is done with this code.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.280
And when I execute
this code, you

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.910
can see that we have
version 1.12 installed.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.110
Now TensorFlow also comes
in different versions.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.810
For example, if you want
to use a GPU for learning,

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.760
there is a GPU version.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.820
Let's look at how to install
that in a fresh notebook.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.940
Because the GPU
version needs a GPU,

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.990
we first need to be sure
that our runtime has a GPU.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.740
So to do this, I find it
best to reset all runtimes

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.910
and then set the runtime
type to be a GPU-based one.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.530
It may take a few
seconds to allocate

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.170
the new virtual machine
and then launch it.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.470
Now I can install the
GPU flavor of TensorFlow

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.830
with pip install tensorflow-GPU.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.540
You'll see that it isn't
present on this machine,

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.040
so it will download
and install it.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.990
And now I can check the version
of TensorFlow as before,

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.150
and we'll see that we
also have version 1.12.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.330
And that's it.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.870
In the next video
in this series,

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.000
I'll take that to the
next level and show you

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.950
how to train a
neural network using

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.590
Keras to perform classification
of breast cancer data.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.660
And I'll see you there.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.410
