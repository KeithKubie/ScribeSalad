00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.500
For the past year,
a travel agency

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.550
has collected data about the
number of individual tickets

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.740
that it sells for its signature
product, a Mediterranean

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.870
cruise.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.350
The monthly data on ticket
sales is shown below.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.700
What are the best and worst
months for cruise sales?

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.550
So what they have
given us, this diagram.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.914
This is usually called
a pie chart or pie graph

00:00:21.914 --> 00:00:23.330
because it looks
like a pie that's

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.980
sliced up into a
bunch of pieces.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.050
Sometimes this is
called a circle graph.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.117
But pie graph is
much more common.

00:00:29.117 --> 00:00:30.950
And then they say it's
monthly ticket sales.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.210
So each of these
slices represent

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.940
the sales in a given month.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.420
So for example, this
blue slice over here

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.060
represents the sales in January.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.980
And the way that a
pie chart is set up,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.100
each slice is bigger
or smaller, depending

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.230
on what fraction of the
whole it represents.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.610
So for example, they're
telling us in January

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.870
they sold 18% of the total
year's ticket sales in January.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.990
So if you add up all
of these percentages,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.300
it should add up to 100%.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.810
And not only do they tell
us that they sold 18%,

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.910
but the slice of
this pie should be

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.440
18% of the area
of the entire pie.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.480
It is literally 18% of the pie.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.060
If you were to eat
this slice, you

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.382
would have eaten 18% of the pie.

00:01:13.382 --> 00:01:15.090
Now with that out of
the way, let's think

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.480
about their questions.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.380
What are the best and the
worst months for cruise sales?

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.270
So the best month is obviously
the month where they sell,

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.240
where they have the largest
percentage of their tickets

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.190
were sold.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.610
And actually, I started with
January, and if you just--

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.660
and this is what's
neat about pie graphs.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.576
You wouldn't even have
to look at the numbers,

00:01:33.576 --> 00:01:35.750
January just jumps out as
the biggest slice of pie.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.920
If you didn't even
see the numbers,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.000
if you couldn't even read,
and you just looked at this

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.070
and someone said what is
the largest slice of pie?

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.778
You would immediately
say this is clearly

00:01:42.778 --> 00:01:44.640
the largest slice of
pie right over there.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.210
And so that is actually the
best month for cruise sales

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.620
because they sold 18%.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.820
You see this 18%
is larger than all

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.420
of the other
percentages over here.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.590
But it's clear, just by
looking at the graph,

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.390
this is the largest slice.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.100
Now what's the worst month
for cruise ticket sales?

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.560
Well, then we just have to
find the thinnest slice of pie.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.250
And if we look over
here, the slices of pie

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.220
get pretty thin out down here.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.810
This is in the summer, in
June and July, and in May.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.450
But the smallest are
actually July and June.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.440
And this is where the
numbers become useful.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.527
Because when you just
eyeball it, you're not sure,

00:02:22.527 --> 00:02:23.860
hey, are these exactly the same?

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.727
Or do they just look
exactly the same?

00:02:25.727 --> 00:02:27.560
And that's where these
numbers are valuable.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.184
And based on the data
they've given us,

00:02:29.184 --> 00:02:31.594
it looks like these are
tied for the worst in terms

00:02:31.594 --> 00:02:32.260
of ticket sales.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.350
In both of these months they
sell only 3% in each month.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.090
So the worst months for cruise
sales are July and June.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.470
July and June are
tied for the worst.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.640
The best is clearly January,
and then after January

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.792
the next best-- they're
not really asking us that,

00:02:50.792 --> 00:02:52.750
but since we have the
pie chart in front of us,

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.041
might as well ask ourselves
that, what's the next best?

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:57.680
Well it looks like November is
slightly better than December.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.080
But in general,
it's pretty clear

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.056
that the winter months do much
better in terms of cruise sales

00:03:04.056 --> 00:03:04.930
than these over here.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.324
And I guess people are looking
to get away from the cold.
