00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:13.169
A new study finds that experiences make us
happier than material possessions.

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.160
So go ahead - just throw your iPhone right
in the trash!

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:25.880
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and no matter
how you choose to spend your free time, there

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.720
seems to be 2 kinds of people: people who
prefer experiences, and people who prefer

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.720
material possessions.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.860
It’s not up to us to say which one is better
- after all, if it makes you happy, then it

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.860
makes you happy.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.760
But a new study published this week in Psychological
Science, seems to indicate that on the whole,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.530
experiences make us happier than possessions.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.440
For this study, researchers tracked 100 college
students and over 2,200 randomly selected

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.670
adults, to see what excites people the most.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.680
And what they found, is that people tend to
feel more positive about experiences, than

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.680
material goods.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.910
A lot of it has to do with anticipation.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.950
When we’re looking forward to a trip, for
example - it’s kind of this nebulous thing.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.229
We have an idea of what’s gonna happen,
but the unpredictability of those events,

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:07.850
is what makes them exciting.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.159
It piques our creativity, and we start to
think about all the fun things we’re gonna

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.159
do.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.460
On the flip side, when we’re anticipating
a big purchase - our excitement is usually

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.759
tinged with impatience.

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.700
The example they use is someone purchasing
the latest iPhone.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.670
In this day and age, everyone researches everything
- because nobody wants to feel buyer’s remorse.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.100
So we almost always know exactly what we’re
gonna get.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.170
We know how many megapixels the phone has,
we know what it looks like, we know minute

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.799
details of every single feature of most of
the products we buy.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.280
And that takes a lot of the excitement out
of it.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.189
Even something as banal as waiting in line,
is more fun when you’re doing it for an

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.799
event, than for a release of the next big
gadget.

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.329
People are bonding and socializing, and even
news reports have shown that people waiting

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.429
in lines for material purchases are more likely
to end in violence.

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.009
Another factor could be money.

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.500
People tend to get competitive over material
possessions, but that’s not usually the

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.310
case with vacations or events.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.149
Interestingly, there was another study done
last year, that expanded on this topic.

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.479
And it talked about how the kinds of experiences
we like, change as we get older.

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.311
So while young people tend to prefer new,
uncommon experiences, as we get older, we

00:02:11.311 --> 00:02:14.920
actually find MORE joy from normal everyday
experiences.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.060
And it stems from how we define ourselves.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.640
When we’re young, we build our identity
through our extraordinary experiences.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.620
But when we get old, that changes - and we
start to define ourselves, through the ordinary

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.800
experiences that comprise our daily lives.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.930
Personally, I’ve always enjoyed experiences
to material possessions - because possessions

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.930
only last so long.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.810
Once you have kids, and your kids have kids,
nobody’s gonna care about the time you waited

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.110
2 days in line to get the newest iPhone release.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.750
But they WILL like seeing photos from your
awesome trip to Fiji where you wrestled a

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.750
shark.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.750
Think about it.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.890
While we’re on the topic of adventures,
I wanna remind you guys that I host another

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.870
show here on Discovery called Anyhoo, and
we just shot an episode last week about the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.041
7 different times someone has died while taking
a selfie.

00:02:59.041 --> 00:03:11.720
Which is horrifying, and kinda makes you think
twice about taking photos on your next vacation.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.000
You can find that episode, along with many
others, over at youtube.com/revision3.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.510
And in the meantime, let us know in the comments
below, which side of the fence YOU’RE on

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.380
- is it experiences, or material goods that
make you happier?

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.220
That’s it for me, but as always - thank
you guys for watching!
