00:00:12.221 --> 00:00:15.317
[This talk contains mature content]

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.079
In 1969, I was standing behind

00:00:21.103 --> 00:00:23.976
a Sylvania black-and-white television set.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.800
Hearing about these things happening
on the set in the front,

00:00:27.824 --> 00:00:28.975
I was the guy, you know,

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.110
moving the rabbit ears
for my dad, and my sister and my mom.

00:00:32.134 --> 00:00:35.629
"Move over here, turn over here,
move this way, we can't see the screen."

00:00:36.213 --> 00:00:38.252
And what they were watching

00:00:38.276 --> 00:00:43.522
was: "One small step for a man,
one giant leap for mankind."

00:00:43.546 --> 00:00:46.882
Neil [Armstrong] and Buzz Aldrin
were walking on the Moon.

00:00:47.308 --> 00:00:51.149
And I was five years old
in Lynchburg, Virginia,

00:00:51.173 --> 00:00:54.493
a skinny black kid
in a kind of somewhat racist town.

00:00:55.303 --> 00:00:59.469
And I was trying to figure out
what I was going to do with my life.

00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.732
And my parents, you know,
they were educators,

00:01:02.756 --> 00:01:04.790
they'd said that you can do anything.

00:01:05.094 --> 00:01:08.106
But after that moon landing,
all the kids in the neighborhood

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.264
were like, "You're going to be
an astronaut?"

00:01:10.288 --> 00:01:11.490
I'm like, "No."

00:01:11.514 --> 00:01:14.713
I don't want a buzz cut,
and I don't see someone who looks like me.

00:01:14.717 --> 00:01:16.419
Because representation does matter.

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:20.260
And I knew that there was a guy

00:01:20.284 --> 00:01:23.363
five blocks down the street
on Pierce Street

00:01:23.387 --> 00:01:25.521
who was training to play tennis.

00:01:25.848 --> 00:01:27.314
And it was Arthur Ashe.

00:01:27.832 --> 00:01:30.736
And my dad talked
about his character, his discipline,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.030
his intelligence, his athleticism.

00:01:33.054 --> 00:01:34.424
I wanted to be Arthur Ashe,

00:01:34.448 --> 00:01:36.614
I didn't want to be
one of those moon guys.

00:01:37.106 --> 00:01:41.590
And as I went on through this journey,

00:01:41.614 --> 00:01:45.535
my dad, who was a school teacher,
he played in a band,

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:48.320
he did all these things to make money
for my sister and I

00:01:48.344 --> 00:01:49.655
to take piano lessons

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.797
and do these different things
with education.

00:01:51.821 --> 00:01:57.740
And he one day decides to drive up
into the driveway with this bread truck.

00:01:58.356 --> 00:02:02.133
And I'm thinking, "OK, bread truck,

00:02:02.157 --> 00:02:05.133
me delivering bread
while my dad's driving the truck."

00:02:05.157 --> 00:02:07.768
I'm like, "OK, I'm going to be
a bread guy now."

00:02:07.792 --> 00:02:10.411
But he says, "This is our camper."

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.792
I'm like, "Dude, come one, I can read:
'Merita Bread and Rolls'

00:02:14.816 --> 00:02:16.354
on the side of this truck.

00:02:16.378 --> 00:02:20.298
And he says, "No, we're going
to build this into our camper."

00:02:21.187 --> 00:02:25.060
And over that summer, we rewired
the entire electrical system.

00:02:25.483 --> 00:02:28.133
We plumbed a propane tank
to a Coleman stove,

00:02:28.157 --> 00:02:30.601
we built bunk beds that flip down.

00:02:30.625 --> 00:02:35.774
We were turning this into our summer
vacation launch pad, escape pod,

00:02:35.798 --> 00:02:38.565
this thing that could
take us out of Lynchburg.

00:02:39.614 --> 00:02:42.214
And before that,

00:02:43.376 --> 00:02:47.312
I was actually raped at five
by some neighbors.

00:02:48.574 --> 00:02:50.998
And I didn't tell anyone,

00:02:51.022 --> 00:02:54.490
because I had friends
that didn't have fathers.

00:02:54.887 --> 00:02:56.848
And I knew that my father

00:02:56.872 --> 00:02:59.840
would have killed the people
that did that to his son.

00:02:59.864 --> 00:03:02.464
And I didn't want my father to be gone.

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.441
So as we got in this bread truck
and escaped from Lynchburg,

00:03:07.465 --> 00:03:09.668
it was my time with my dad.

00:03:09.692 --> 00:03:11.926
And we went to the Smoky Mountains

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.997
and looked at the purple
mountains' majesty.

00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:16.563
And we walked along the beach
in Myrtle Beach,

00:03:16.587 --> 00:03:19.699
and this thing was transformative.

00:03:20.298 --> 00:03:23.933
It showed me what it meant
to be an explorer, at a very early age.

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:27.815
And I suppressed all that negativity,

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:29.005
all that trauma,

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:31.469
because I was learning to be an explorer.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.965
And a little bit later, my mother gave me
an age-inappropriate,

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.624
non-OSHA-certified chemistry set,

00:03:36.648 --> 00:03:37.811
(Laughter)

00:03:37.835 --> 00:03:41.728
where I created the most incredible
explosion in her living room.

00:03:41.752 --> 00:03:43.213
(Laughter)

00:03:43.237 --> 00:03:44.975
And so I knew I could be a chemist.

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:47.420
So as I went on this journey
through a high school,

00:03:47.444 --> 00:03:49.046
and I went to college,

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.189
and I got a football scholarship
to play football in college.

00:03:52.213 --> 00:03:55.721
And I knew that I could be a chemist,
because I'd already blown stuff up.

00:03:55.745 --> 00:03:57.379
(Laughter)

00:03:57.403 --> 00:04:00.784
And when I graduated,

00:04:00.808 --> 00:04:03.382
I got drafted to the Detroit Lions.

00:04:03.406 --> 00:04:05.612
But I pulled a hamstring in training camp,

00:04:05.636 --> 00:04:08.993
and so what every former NFL player does,
they go work for NASA, right?

00:04:09.017 --> 00:04:10.311
So I went to work for NASA.

00:04:10.335 --> 00:04:11.336
(Laughter)

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.453
And this friend of mine said,
"Leland, you'd be great astronaut."

00:04:14.477 --> 00:04:17.361
I just laughed at him,
I was like, "Yeah, me, an astronaut?"

00:04:17.385 --> 00:04:19.805
You know that Neil and Buzz
thing from back in '69?

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.396
And he handed me an application,
and I looked at it,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.682
and I didn't fill it out.

00:04:23.706 --> 00:04:28.665
And that same year, another friend of mine
filled out the application

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:29.839
and he got in.

00:04:30.372 --> 00:04:31.772
And I said to myself,

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.951
"If NASA's letting knuckleheads
like that be astronauts,"

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:37.149
(Laughter)

00:04:37.173 --> 00:04:38.578
"maybe I can be one, too."

00:04:38.602 --> 00:04:42.309
So the next selection, I filled out
the application, and I got in.

00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:46.142
And I didn't know
what it meant to be an astronaut:

00:04:46.166 --> 00:04:48.745
the training, the simulations,

00:04:48.769 --> 00:04:51.839
all these things to get you ready
for this countdown:

00:04:51.863 --> 00:04:53.863
three, two, one, liftoff.

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:59.877
And in 2007, I was in Space Shuttle
"Atlantis," careening off the planet,

00:04:59.901 --> 00:05:03.435
traveling at 17,500 miles per hour.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.800
And eight and a half minutes later,

00:05:05.824 --> 00:05:09.151
the main engines cut off,
and we're now floating in space.

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:12.472
And I push off
and float over to the window,

00:05:12.496 --> 00:05:14.551
and I can see the Caribbean.

00:05:14.575 --> 00:05:18.205
And I need new definitions of blue
to describe the colors that I see.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.723
Azure, indigo, navy blue,
medium navy blue, turquoise

00:05:22.747 --> 00:05:25.643
don't do any justice
to what I see with my eyes.

00:05:26.151 --> 00:05:29.086
And my job on this mission was to install

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.501
this two-billion dollar
Columbus laboratory.

00:05:33.117 --> 00:05:34.800
It was a research laboratory

00:05:34.824 --> 00:05:37.427
for materials research,
for human research.

00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:41.086
And I reached into the payload bay
of the space shuttle,

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.594
grabbed out this big module,

00:05:43.618 --> 00:05:47.044
and I used the robotic arm
and I attached it to the space station.

00:05:47.962 --> 00:05:51.788
And the European team have been waiting
10 years for this thing to get installed,

00:05:51.812 --> 00:05:56.386
so I'm sure everyone in Europe was like,
"Leland! Leland! Leland!"

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.800
(Laughter)

00:05:57.824 --> 00:06:01.402
And so this moment happened,
this was our primary mission objective,

00:06:01.426 --> 00:06:02.576
it was done.

00:06:03.006 --> 00:06:05.863
And I had this big sigh of relief.

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:10.355
But then, Peggy Whitson,
the first female commander,

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:12.435
she invited us over
to the Russian segment.

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:15.308
And the space station's
about the size of a football field,

00:06:15.332 --> 00:06:18.863
with solar panel and trusses
and all of these modules.

00:06:19.427 --> 00:06:22.491
And she says, "Leland, you go get
the rehydrated vegetables,

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:23.729
we have the meat."

00:06:23.753 --> 00:06:27.522
So we float over with the bag
of vegetables, all rehydrated,

00:06:27.546 --> 00:06:28.696
and we get there.

00:06:29.467 --> 00:06:30.789
And there's this moment

00:06:30.813 --> 00:06:35.133
where I get [transported]
back to my mother's kitchen.

00:06:35.157 --> 00:06:37.856
You can smell the beef
and barley heating up,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.633
you can smell the food, the colors,

00:06:41.657 --> 00:06:44.554
and there are people there
from all around the world.

00:06:44.578 --> 00:06:46.165
It's like a Benetton commercial,

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:50.149
you know, you have African American,
Asian American, French, German, Russian,

00:06:50.173 --> 00:06:51.498
the first female commander,

00:06:51.522 --> 00:06:55.317
breaking bread at 17,500 miles per hour,

00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:57.667
going around the planet every 90 minutes,

00:06:57.691 --> 00:07:00.597
seeing a sunrise and a sunset every 45.

00:07:01.127 --> 00:07:03.754
And Peggy would say,
"Hey, Leland, try some of this,"

00:07:03.778 --> 00:07:05.579
and she'd float it over to my mouth,

00:07:05.603 --> 00:07:07.832
and I'd catch it
and we'd go back and forth.

00:07:07.856 --> 00:07:13.015
And we're doing all of this while
listening to Sade's "Smooth Operator."

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:14.040
(Laughter)

00:07:14.064 --> 00:07:16.459
I mean, this is like
blowing my mind, you know.

00:07:16.483 --> 00:07:17.578
(Laughter)

00:07:17.602 --> 00:07:21.022
And I float over to the window,
and I look down at the planet,

00:07:21.046 --> 00:07:24.078
and I see all of humanity.

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:27.221
And my perspective changes at that moment,

00:07:27.245 --> 00:07:30.124
because, I'm flying over Lynchburg,
Virginia, my home town,

00:07:30.148 --> 00:07:32.134
and my family's probably breaking bread.

00:07:32.158 --> 00:07:34.721
And five minutes later,
we're flying over Paris,

00:07:34.745 --> 00:07:37.348
where Leo Eyharts
is looking down at his parents,

00:07:37.372 --> 00:07:39.173
probably having some wine and cheese,

00:07:39.197 --> 00:07:41.061
and Yuri's looking off to Moscow,

00:07:41.085 --> 00:07:43.630
and they're probably eating
borscht or something else.

00:07:43.654 --> 00:07:48.681
But we're all having this moment
where we see our respective families

00:07:48.705 --> 00:07:52.872
working together as one civilization,

00:07:52.896 --> 00:07:55.253
at 17,500 miles per hour.

00:07:56.245 --> 00:07:59.078
My perspective shifted cognitively,

00:07:59.102 --> 00:08:00.435
it changed me.

00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:02.919
And when I think about being
that little skinny boy,

00:08:02.943 --> 00:08:06.300
from sometimes racist Lynchburg, Virginia,

00:08:06.324 --> 00:08:10.451
I would never have had that perspective

00:08:10.475 --> 00:08:13.459
to think about myself
of being an astronaut,

00:08:13.483 --> 00:08:16.514
if my father hadn't taken us on a journey

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:20.399
in this radical craft that we built
with our own two hands.

00:08:22.016 --> 00:08:24.230
When I came home,

00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:28.952
I realized that perspective is something

00:08:28.976 --> 00:08:31.421
that we all get and we all have.

00:08:32.236 --> 00:08:34.673
It's just how far
do we open up our blinders

00:08:34.697 --> 00:08:37.244
to see that shift and that change.

00:08:37.903 --> 00:08:39.702
And going back to the space station,

00:08:39.726 --> 00:08:44.549
I think of, you know, Germans
and Russians fighting Americans.

00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:48.025
We have these people
living and working together.

00:08:48.382 --> 00:08:52.475
White folks, black folks, Russian folks,
French folks, you know.

00:08:52.499 --> 00:08:57.600
All these different people coexisting
in harmony as one race.

00:08:58.712 --> 00:09:02.959
And I think about the colors that I saw,
the design of the modules,

00:09:02.983 --> 00:09:04.563
the way that things fit together,

00:09:04.587 --> 00:09:08.349
the way that it made us
a community, our home.

00:09:09.221 --> 00:09:13.709
And so when I look up to space now,

00:09:13.733 --> 00:09:17.474
and I have this newfound perspective

00:09:17.498 --> 00:09:20.685
on the space station going overhead
and looking there,

00:09:20.709 --> 00:09:22.501
and then looking back at my community

00:09:22.525 --> 00:09:25.724
and seeing the people
that I'm living and working with,

00:09:25.748 --> 00:09:27.843
and coexisting with,

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:33.792
I think it's something that we all
can do now, especially in these times,

00:09:33.816 --> 00:09:37.538
to make sure that we have
the right perspective.

00:09:38.466 --> 00:09:39.660
Thank you.

00:09:39.684 --> 00:09:44.314
(Applause)

00:09:44.338 --> 00:09:47.828
Chee Pearlman: If you don't mind,
could I just chat with you for a minute,

00:09:47.852 --> 00:09:50.224
because they're going to set up
some things here.

00:09:50.248 --> 00:09:52.550
And I get to have you all to myself, OK.

00:09:52.574 --> 00:09:53.784
Leland Melvin: Alright.

00:09:54.348 --> 00:09:56.165
CP: You guys don't get to hear this.

00:09:56.189 --> 00:09:58.268
So I have to tell you

00:09:58.292 --> 00:10:03.454
that in my family,
we watch a lot of space movies

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:05.363
about astronauts and stuff like that.

00:10:05.387 --> 00:10:07.403
I can't tell you why, but we do.

00:10:07.427 --> 00:10:09.212
(Laughter)

00:10:09.849 --> 00:10:11.925
The thing that I wanted
to ask you, though,

00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:15.305
is that we were seeing
this movie the other day,

00:10:15.329 --> 00:10:19.221
and it was about one of the astronauts,
one of your colleagues,

00:10:19.245 --> 00:10:22.213
and before he went up into space,

00:10:22.237 --> 00:10:26.396
they actually wrote an obituary,
NASA wrote an obituary for him.

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:28.642
And I was like, is that normal?

00:10:28.666 --> 00:10:30.602
And is that part of the job?

00:10:30.626 --> 00:10:36.160
Do you think about that peril
that you're putting yourself in

00:10:36.184 --> 00:10:37.478
as you go into space?

00:10:37.502 --> 00:10:38.800
LM: Yeah.

00:10:38.824 --> 00:10:41.078
So, I don't remember anyone
writing my obituary,

00:10:41.102 --> 00:10:43.713
maybe that was an Apollo-day thing.

00:10:43.737 --> 00:10:48.268
But I do know that in the 135
shuttle flights that we've had,

00:10:48.292 --> 00:10:50.943
the shuttle that I flew on,

00:10:50.967 --> 00:10:54.737
we had two accidents
that killed everyone on that mission.

00:10:55.292 --> 00:10:58.572
And we all know the perils
and the risks that go along with this,

00:10:58.596 --> 00:11:01.435
but we're doing something
that's much bigger than ourselves,

00:11:01.459 --> 00:11:03.061
and helping advance civilization,

00:11:03.085 --> 00:11:06.181
so the risk is worth the reward.

00:11:06.515 --> 00:11:09.227
And we all feel that way
when we get into that vehicle

00:11:09.251 --> 00:11:13.967
ans strap into those million pounds
of rocket fuel and go up to space.

00:11:13.991 --> 00:11:16.332
CP: Yeah, I've only seen
the Hollywood version --

00:11:16.356 --> 00:11:18.715
it looks pretty terrifying,
I have to tell you.

00:11:18.739 --> 00:11:19.943
LM: You should go.

00:11:19.967 --> 00:11:21.118
(Laughter)

00:11:21.142 --> 00:11:23.879
CP: Yeah, my husband's
told me that a few times.

00:11:23.903 --> 00:11:25.895
(Laughter)

00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:27.879
LM: One-way trip or two-way?

00:11:27.903 --> 00:11:29.054
(Laughter)

00:11:29.078 --> 00:11:31.530
CP: That’s a bit of a debate in our house.

00:11:31.554 --> 00:11:33.018
(Laughter)

00:11:33.411 --> 00:11:36.884
I wanted to, if I may ...

00:11:37.554 --> 00:11:42.787
You did touch on something
that was very powerful and difficult,

00:11:42.811 --> 00:11:46.472
which is, you spoke about this incident

00:11:46.496 --> 00:11:49.020
that had happened to you
when you were five years old,

00:11:49.044 --> 00:11:50.225
and that you were raped.

00:11:50.249 --> 00:11:53.451
And I just think that
for you to be able to say those things,

00:11:53.475 --> 00:11:55.602
you know, on the TED stage,

00:11:55.626 --> 00:11:58.308
to be able to talk about that at all,

00:11:58.332 --> 00:12:00.268
is pretty fearless.

00:12:00.292 --> 00:12:03.157
And I wanted to get a sense from you,

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:07.428
is that something that you think
is important for you to share that now,

00:12:07.452 --> 00:12:08.895
to speak about it?

00:12:08.919 --> 00:12:13.047
LM: It's so important, especially for men,
to talk about things that have happened,

00:12:13.071 --> 00:12:14.550
because we've been trained

00:12:14.574 --> 00:12:18.760
and told by our society
that we have to be so tough and so hard

00:12:18.784 --> 00:12:21.609
and we can't tell of things
that are happening to us.

00:12:21.633 --> 00:12:25.187
But I've had so many men
contact me and tell me that,

00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:27.260
"You came through that, you got over that,

00:12:27.284 --> 00:12:29.107
I'm going to get over my alcoholism,"

00:12:29.131 --> 00:12:31.149
and these things
that are going on in them,

00:12:31.173 --> 00:12:32.776
because of what happened to them.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.046
And so we must share these stories,
this is part of storytelling,

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.300
to heal us and to make us
whole as a community.

00:12:39.324 --> 00:12:41.223
CP: That's wonderful.

00:12:41.247 --> 00:12:46.670
(Applause)

00:12:46.694 --> 00:12:50.853
And you know, quite honestly,
you spoke about perspective shift,

00:12:50.877 --> 00:12:55.173
and that is a shift that I think
we've been very slow to accept

00:12:55.197 --> 00:12:59.062
and to be able to speak about that,
so we thank you for that.

00:12:59.086 --> 00:13:02.231
We thank you for being
the amazing astronaut that you are,

00:13:02.255 --> 00:13:04.666
and thank you for coming
to the TED stage, Leland.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:06.065
LM: Thank you so much, Chee.

00:13:06.089 --> 00:13:07.405
(Applause)
