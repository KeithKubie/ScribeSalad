with these two men having feelings for
each other and so the film doesn't have

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960
each other and so the film doesn't have
 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.960
each other and so the film doesn't have
any easy answers and it doesn't give the

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970
any easy answers and it doesn't give the
 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.600
