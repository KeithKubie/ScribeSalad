I'm Eli Harari.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.450 position:73%
I got my Ph.D. in 1973 in solid-state sciences.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.560 position:89%
I'm currently chairman and CEO of SanDisk Corp., a public

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.810 position:75%
company located in Milpitas, Calif. A successful

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.590 position:94%
inventor basically recognizes a deficiency or some kind of a

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.840 position:83%
need and comes up with a solution and files a patent.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.935 position:83%
Ideas are great, but ideas are really a dime a dozen.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.165 position:91%
Taking that one idea that's going to change the world, and

00:00:45.165 --> 00:00:48.545 position:81%
actually changing the world, is what an entrepreneur

00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:49.800
strives to achieve.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.410 position:88%
When I came to Princeton in 1969, this was the year that

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.975 position:94%
America landed on the moon, and it was a very exciting time.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.170 position:83%
My research work at Princeton was basically to try to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.890 position:81%
understand why electronic devices in satellites were

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.324 position:64%
failing after a very short time in space.

00:01:09.741 --> 00:01:12.830 position:88%
The laws of physics that applied to radiation effects in

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.380 position:91%
space on early semiconductor devices turned out to be very

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.740 position:75%
much the same physics that later on I applied in

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.750
flash memory technology.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.230 position:91%
What we found at SanDisk is that the technology was there.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.230 position:63%
We had developed it. It was ready to go.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.850 position:86%
Digital cameras were there to take advantage of storage

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.090 position:63%
technology in flash that we had created.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.020 position:86%
But the markets weren't there. Consumers weren't ready.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.335
The price was too high.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.440 position:98%
Most importantly, the entire ecosystem, the infrastructure, wasn't there.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.080 position:92%
It was really 1999, five-six years later, when the Internet

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.370 position:95%
came on the scene -- the Web -- that people suddenly realized

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.860 position:97%
that they didn't need to print their pictures, that they could

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.470
just send them by e-mail.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.090 position:88%
Suddenly, the infrastructure fell into place, and people

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.866 position:97%
flocked to stores, and everybody wanted their digital cameras.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.099 position:89%
We've gone from $50 per megabyte to cents per megabyte in

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.780 position:88%
the space of 18 years, and that has made flash memory so

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.715 position:95%
affordable and so pervasive for so many applications, and all

00:02:24.715 --> 00:02:31.958 position:98%
based on early technology that I learned about and developed, during my Ph.d.

00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:32.890
research work at Princeton.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.690

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.605 position:97%
Flash is now in literally thousands of different applications.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.420 position:75%
In the last 35 years, I have bought 130 patents.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.380

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.470 position:72%
The only way you can push innovation is to try

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.400
to obsolete yourself.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.910 position:75%
Everything that we've done until today, consider

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.580
it obsolete.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.480 position:73%
Try to obsolete yourself, because if you don't,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.646
others will do it to you.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.090 position:73%
No matter how fast you run, you can never stop.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.510
You can never read on your laurels.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.690 position:72%
You should always be working on the next three

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.505
generations of technology.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.253 position:89%
My wife and I have endowed a graduate student fellowship.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.334 position:98%
It's the least I could do to pay back Princeton by enabling other

00:03:22.334 --> 00:03:26.570 position:83%
students, talented students from around the world, to

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.040 position:78%
come and benefit from this phenomenal institution.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.200

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.172 position:81%
My name is Eli Harari, and I'm a Princeton engineer.
