launching and I suspect many of you have
 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.360
launching and I suspect many of you have
done this before you you have went

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370
done this before you you have went
 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.400

through these steps the first one would
 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.840
through these steps the first one would
be beta testing so that's when you have

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850
be beta testing so that's when you have
 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.820
be beta testing so that's when you have

many of those are turning into
 

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.650
many of those are turning into
installers and then how many of those

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:40.660
installers and then how many of those
 

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.090
installers and then how many of those
are actually buying something within

that as a very recently you can also
break down this report by country so you

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:01.870
break down this report by country so you
 

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.079
break down this report by country so you
can see how your convert whether for

the top of your funnel you make the

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:44.470
the top of your funnel you make the
 

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.740
the top of your funnel you make the
whole funnel wider and basically it's

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:46.750
whole funnel wider and basically it's
 

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.030
whole funnel wider and basically it's
more likely that you know kind of more

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:48.040
more likely that you know kind of more
 

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.650

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:07.730
bring their monster strike game into
 

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:10.960
bring their monster strike game into
into u.s. however they they had a

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:10.970
into u.s. however they they had a
 

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:13.360
into u.s. however they they had a
feeling that the local tastes of people

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:13.370
feeling that the local tastes of people
 

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:15.430
feeling that the local tastes of people
in the US would be different to local

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440
in the US would be different to local
 

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.650
in the US would be different to local
taste of people in Japan so they wanted

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:17.660
taste of people in Japan so they wanted
 

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.750
taste of people in Japan so they wanted
to make sure that they really match the

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:19.760
to make sure that they really match the
 

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.240
to make sure that they really match the
that local take the taste is expressed

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:22.250
that local take the taste is expressed
 

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:23.920
that local take the taste is expressed
in the in the store listing so they

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:23.930
in the in the store listing so they
 

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:25.720
in the in the store listing so they
started iterating on the on the feature

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:25.730
started iterating on the on the feature
 

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:27.880
started iterating on the on the feature
graphic or on the video then went on to

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:27.890
graphic or on the video then went on to
 

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.830
graphic or on the video then went on to
to to iterate on the screenshots on the

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840
to to iterate on the screenshots on the
 

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.320
to to iterate on the screenshots on the
description and and eventually on the

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:32.330
description and and eventually on the
 

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.230
description and and eventually on the
icon over the the scope of a couple of

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:35.240
icon over the the scope of a couple of
 

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.490
icon over the the scope of a couple of
months they have managed to increase

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:36.500
months they have managed to increase
 

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.400
months they have managed to increase
their conversion rate by 68 percent by

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:39.410
their conversion rate by 68 percent by
 

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:41.350
their conversion rate by 68 percent by
running kind of test after test in a

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360
running kind of test after test in a
 

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.990
running kind of test after test in a
very scientific very methodical way very

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000
very scientific very methodical way very
 

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.970
very scientific very methodical way very
persistent way so it's just kind of it's

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:45.980
persistent way so it's just kind of it's
 

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.040
persistent way so it's just kind of it's
two main takeaways from this would be a

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:48.050
two main takeaways from this would be a
 

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:51.220
two main takeaways from this would be a
you know kind of keep keep going at it

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:51.230
you know kind of keep keep going at it
 

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:53.590
you know kind of keep keep going at it
keep kind of making changes and keep

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600
keep kind of making changes and keep
 

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.810
keep kind of making changes and keep
testing and the other one would be

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:55.820
testing and the other one would be
 

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.850
testing and the other one would be
yes users in different countries have

00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:57.860
yes users in different countries have
 

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:00.640
yes users in different countries have
very different tastes to taste the very

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:00.650
very different tastes to taste the very
 

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:03.190
very different tastes to taste the very
different kind of local flavor so you

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200
different kind of local flavor so you
 

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.500
different kind of local flavor so you
know confuse store listing in Asia will

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:05.510
know confuse store listing in Asia will
 

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:07.510
know confuse store listing in Asia will
probably end up looking much different

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520
probably end up looking much different
 

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.920
probably end up looking much different
to your should end up looking much

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:08.930
to your should end up looking much
 

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.110
to your should end up looking much
different to your store listing in New

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120
different to your store listing in New
 

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.920
different to your store listing in New
York

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:13.930
 

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:17.110
okay couple of best practices that's the

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120
okay couple of best practices that's the
 

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.790
okay couple of best practices that's the
multiple languages this is exactly what

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:18.800
multiple languages this is exactly what
 

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.970
multiple languages this is exactly what
I what I was tell you just now so it's a

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:21.980
I what I was tell you just now so it's a
 

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.220
I what I was tell you just now so it's a
yeah kind of worth trying out different

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:24.230
yeah kind of worth trying out different
 

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.470
yeah kind of worth trying out different
things for four different languages and

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480
things for four different languages and
 

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.750
things for four different languages and
as of earlier this year you can run

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:28.760
as of earlier this year you can run
 

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.910
as of earlier this year you can run
multiple tests in parallel in different

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:30.920
multiple tests in parallel in different
 

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.860
multiple tests in parallel in different
languages so this can now be very easy

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:32.870
languages so this can now be very easy
 

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:35.770
languages so this can now be very easy
and efficient it's rate you know keep at

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:35.780
and efficient it's rate you know keep at
 

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.000
and efficient it's rate you know keep at
it keep you know kind if it looks like

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:37.010
it keep you know kind if it looks like
 

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:38.050
it keep you know kind if it looks like
there is always kind of a next

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:38.060
there is always kind of a next
 

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.900
there is always kind of a next
improvement to be had focus on one thing

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:40.910
improvement to be had focus on one thing
 

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:42.760
improvement to be had focus on one thing
at a time so it's kind of if you're

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:42.770
at a time so it's kind of if you're
 

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:45.700
at a time so it's kind of if you're
don't do icon and description test at

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:45.710
don't do icon and description test at
 

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:47.080
don't do icon and description test at
the same time because it's going to be

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:47.090
the same time because it's going to be
 

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:49.060
the same time because it's going to be
hard to know what actually worked so

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:49.070
hard to know what actually worked so
 

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.160
hard to know what actually worked so
choose to optimize the icon first and

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:51.170
choose to optimize the icon first and
 

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:53.910
choose to optimize the icon first and
then optimize the screenshots or so on

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:53.920
then optimize the screenshots or so on

in a better way than just randomly

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:09.920
in a better way than just randomly
 

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.120

trying out different text or graphics

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:12.130
trying out different text or graphics
 

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.710
trying out different text or graphics
give it some time it takes time to reach

the pistil significance with with these
results don't you know kind of we try to

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:19.070
results don't you know kind of we try to
 

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:21.640
results don't you know kind of we try to
do we pay a lot of tension to tell you

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:21.650
do we pay a lot of tension to tell you
 

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:24.040
do we pay a lot of tension to tell you
when we think the the the experiment is

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:24.050
when we think the the the experiment is
 

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:26.170
when we think the the the experiment is
done and ready but in general just

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:26.180
done and ready but in general just
 

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.570
done and ready but in general just
giving it more time is gonna be you know

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:28.580
giving it more time is gonna be you know
 

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:31.300
giving it more time is gonna be you know
kind of forced it will be more sure that

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:31.310
kind of forced it will be more sure that
 

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:32.830
kind of forced it will be more sure that
it's going to yield actual good results

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:32.840
it's going to yield actual good results
 

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.440
it's going to yield actual good results
and finally be bold yeah especially if

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:35.450
and finally be bold yeah especially if
 

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:37.480
and finally be bold yeah especially if
you're early in your startup's life you

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:37.490
you're early in your startup's life you
 

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:38.890
you're early in your startup's life you
know try out a lot of different things

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:38.900
know try out a lot of different things
 

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.390
know try out a lot of different things
it's kind of it's harmless and it's

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400
it's kind of it's harmless and it's
 

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.370
it's kind of it's harmless and it's
cheap so it's worth playing around with

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:42.380
cheap so it's worth playing around with
 

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:45.420
cheap so it's worth playing around with
a lot of different visual identities

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:45.430
a lot of different visual identities
 

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:47.910
a lot of different visual identities
okay and the last thing related to

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:47.920
okay and the last thing related to
 

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.410
okay and the last thing related to
localizing earlier this year we've also

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:50.420
localizing earlier this year we've also
 

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.330
localizing earlier this year we've also
launched pricing templates pricing

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:52.340
launched pricing templates pricing
 

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.000
launched pricing templates pricing
templates allow you to manage the

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:55.010
templates allow you to manage the
 

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.160
templates allow you to manage the
pricing for your entire app and in a

way in a very easy bulk way so if you
 

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.390
way in a very easy bulk way so if you
haven't switched the DEM yet many levers

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400
haven't switched the DEM yet many levers
 

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.560
haven't switched the DEM yet many levers
have but if you haven't switched them

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:05.570
have but if you haven't switched them
 

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:06.910
have but if you haven't switched them
yet we definitely recommend them as a

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:06.920
yet we definitely recommend them as a
 

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.980
yet we definitely recommend them as a
very efficient bulk pricing management

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:08.990
very efficient bulk pricing management
 

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.830
very efficient bulk pricing management
tool however on top of that when we

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840
tool however on top of that when we
 

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.450
tool however on top of that when we
added pricing templates we've also added

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:13.460
added pricing templates we've also added
 

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.570
added pricing templates we've also added
smart localized price rounding so for

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:16.580
smart localized price rounding so for
 

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.850
smart localized price rounding so for
example if you input your default price

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:18.860
example if you input your default price
 

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:22.960
example if you input your default price
and auto convert to two all the 70

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:22.970
and auto convert to two all the 70
 

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:24.580
and auto convert to two all the 70
markets to which Google Play Now sells

using the latest conversion rates

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:27.350
using the latest conversion rates
 

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:29.110

may not be entirely obvious as you work
 

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:03.340
may not be entirely obvious as you work
on your app quality especially this

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:03.350
on your app quality especially this
 

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:05.350
on your app quality especially this
quality is reflected through your

quality is reflected through your
 

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.230
quality is reflected through your
average rating score you will actually

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240

not be entirely obvious but the feedback
 

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:13.720
not be entirely obvious but the feedback
we've heard from number of developers

we've heard from number of developers
 

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.399
we've heard from number of developers
and the recent one is from a game ville

00:25:15.399 --> 00:25:15.409
and the recent one is from a game ville
 

00:25:15.409 --> 00:25:18.549

point three stars to 4.1 stars they've

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:21.110
point three stars to 4.1 stars they've
 

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.080

right so it's worth trying out the other

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:28.070
right so it's worth trying out the other
 

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:30.640
right so it's worth trying out the other
thing that totally may not be obvious is

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:30.650
thing that totally may not be obvious is

thing that totally may not be obvious is
that by working on your quality through

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720
that by working on your quality through
 

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.360
that by working on your quality through
improving the average rating you're

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:34.370
improving the average rating you're
 

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:36.159
improving the average rating you're
actually also working on your velocity

they analyze this feedback which allows
 

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.860
they analyze this feedback which allows
them to cut their release cycle to two

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:51.870
them to cut their release cycle to two
 

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:53.510
them to cut their release cycle to two
to three weeks which they weren't able

on other platforms so just kind of by
really shifting your cycle your

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:01.650
really shifting your cycle your
 

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:04.310
really shifting your cycle your
development cycle to make kind of

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320
