JOEL SCHINDALL:
Initially, the course

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.360
was taught in a more or less
conventional manner where

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.510
Blade and I did the
teaching, and we

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.770
had one teaching assistant
who was actually someone

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.772
that Blade new from
Tufts University who

00:00:16.772 --> 00:00:18.480
came in and helped
the students with some

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.220
of the technical issues
in the design problems.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.280
But after the first term,
some of the students

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.450
volunteered to be teaching
assistants the following term.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.840
And they brought a
whole new dimension

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.370
to the teaching of the
course, because the students

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.580
were encouraged to--

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.770
The students don't do their
homework during class,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.390
they do it typically at
10:00 PM or 2:00 AM or 4:00

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.950
AM, any time of
the day or night.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.630
And it's frustrating
to run into an obstacle

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.030
and not be able to get an
answer to your question.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.775
So we established a website
where the students can go to it

00:00:53.775 --> 00:00:54.986
and ask their question.

00:00:54.986 --> 00:00:56.860
And we have three or
four teaching assistants

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.860
who are monitoring
that website 24/7.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.530
Literally 24/7.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.129
And it's fun to watch the
dialogue because you'll

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.460
often-- at 2:00 AM a
question will come in.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.450
One of the students
will say, well, Jim

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.690
is best equipped to
answer this question,

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.190
but he's sleeping now.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.940
I'm going to give you
an initial answer.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.710
And about 5:00 or 6:00
in the morning, Jim

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.160
will get back on and give
you the rest of the answer.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.480
We have probably,
over the course

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.060
of the term, at least 1,000
question-answer exchanges that

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.270
take place.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.100
The students who
evaluate the course

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.355
often give perfect
scores of seven

00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:32.480
to the teaching assistants.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.860
A little bit humbling for
us and the faculty who

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.030
are getting good
scores-- 6.1, 6.2--

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.350
but the teaching assistants
get the best scores

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.760
because they're
actually one-on-one

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.170
guiding the students
through a problem.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.490
And they're doing it very much
from the student's perspective,

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.610
because this is the
same problem that they

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.530
had to deal with
the previous year

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.500
so they know what
questions to ask.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.665
They phrase their
answers so eloquently.

00:01:57.665 --> 00:01:59.550
You know, today's
younger generation

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.550
is accustomed to electronic
tools, to chatting, you know,

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.710
to social media, and they have
a very nice deferential and yet

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.680
effective style of interacting
with this communication.
