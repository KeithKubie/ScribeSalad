00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.880
It’s Mark Wiens here, I’m in Tokyo, Japan,
which is one of the world’s largest cities,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.880
and there are so many things to see and do,
of course, this is one of the best cities

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.639
in the world for food, so many awesome restaurants
and delicious things to eat.

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.160
I’m cruising around Tokyo, and I’m going
to show you what I think are twenty five of

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.420
the top things to do when you’re in Tokyo.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.619
So keep watching this video, let’s explore
Tokyo together right now.

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:46.469
I am at the Ameya Yokocho market, just next
to Ueno station and park.

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.900
There’s almost everything in this market
that you can imagine, from cosmetics, I’ve

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:59.330
seen big piles of shoes, jackets, clothes,
golf stores, like army fatigue stores, and

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:05.530
also it’s very famous for buying snacks,
so giant snack stores.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.229
You can pick yourself up some green tea kit
kats.

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:18.140
You can spend a few hours here wandering around
and exploring for sure.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.689
We just took a walk through the park, and
now we are about to enter the Meiji shinto

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:26.770
shrine.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.090
So this is one of the most famous places to
visit when you’re in Tokyo.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.389
Located in the center of Tokyo, yet in the
midst of a quiet forested area, Meiji Jingu

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:39.960
is one of the landmarks and most important
religious shinto monuments in Tokyo.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.779
When I visited, I got lucky to see a wedding
ceremony taking place.

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:49.529
I am at the sumo stadium.

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:55.020
Pretty cool place to visit, I’m pretty bummed
right now that I’m not here during a fight

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.020
time.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.500
You can come here when it’s not fight season.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.069
There’s a little museum at the stadium,
it’s pretty small, but there’s a bunch

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:10.239
of photographs of the different famous sumo
wrestlers, as well as little three d models

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:16.090
of basically every kind of winning technique
or position.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.940
After going to the museum, no visit to Tokyo’s
sumo town would be complete without a proper

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.190
sumo feast, and a dish known as chankonabe.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.890
This hearty stew tastes absolutely amazing,
and it will fill your belly with extreme satisfaction.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.060
We just entered the Shinjuku Gyoen National
Garden, this is one of the famous gardens

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.860
in Tokyo, central Tokyo, and you actually
pay a fee of two hundred yen to enter.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.330
At first I wasn’t so sure about paying entrance
to visit a park at first, but after walking

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.060
around, and seeing a few of the amazing gardens,
I thought it was well worth it.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.069
There’s an impressive green house, Japanese
gardens, formal French gardens, and a traditional

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:06.980
tea house.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.900
Ginza is one of Tokyo’s most prestigious
upscale districts, there are plenty of malls,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:19.120
food courts, high end restaurants, and boutiques.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.030
And just a short walk from Ginza is Yurakucho
train station.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.349
Tucked under the railroad tracks you’ll
discovers dozens of izakaya bars and restaurants,

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:28.750
each with unique character.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.579
I went to a place called Yakitori Ton Ton
for a quick beverage and plate of succulent

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:44.450
grilled meat.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.879
I am at the Tokyo metropolitan government
offices, and there is an observatory, I think

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:56.629
it’s on the forty fifth floor, offering
a three sixty panoramic view of Tokyo, and

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.170
the view is just unbelievable actually.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.340
And the good thing is, you can come here for
free, there’s a couple of gift shops it

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:16.419
looks like.

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.400
At the Tsukiji fish market, walk in, and when
they see you are a tourist you’ll get a

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.389
map.

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.750
Basically you can only visit the wholesale
area and then there’s a bunch of, a few

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.310
restaurants, and a vegetable area.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.360
If you come at five am, you can get in to
the fish auction, the tuna auction, but they

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:44.669
only allow, I think one hundred and twenty
people per day I think to see the auction.

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:51.460
It can be pretty tough to get a spot to see
the early morning tuna auction, plus you have

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.180
to wake up early and make the trip there.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.430
So if you decide to skip the auction, just
head to the wholesale area around nine am

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.860
when it opens for tourists - I was amazed
at the quantity and diversity of seafood available

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.960
- some things I had never even seen before.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.110
When you visit the Tsukiji fish market, eating
sushi for breakfast is basically a rite of

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.430
passage.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.370
There are famous restaurants across the street
from the wholesale market, and also some great

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.400
places in the outer market.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:27.169
Sashimi over rice and you can see it has the
fatty tuna plus the fish roe, salmon fish

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:37.139
roe, and this is sea urchin.

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:45.410
Here I am at the Shibuya crossing, which is
basically a sea of humanity crossing the street

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.990
at one time.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.949
It’s like fifty meters of solid people.

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:55.060
Shibuya is not only famous for its massive
street crossing, but it’s also one of the

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.080
most well known areas in Tokyo when it comes
to shopping and fashion.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:06.759
There are some nice department stores, shops,
and some good food as well.

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:12.699
I am at Sumida river and the park, it’s
a good place to come if you want to do some

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:16.110
exercise, nice place to take a relaxing stroll.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:23.800
You can choose to do the Tokyo Cruise, and
it’s a little pricey, but you get to cruise

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:34.600
along the river and see lots of sights, and
it’s a nice leisure experience.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:40.729
I am at the Imperial Palace and going to take
a walk around and especially see the stone

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:46.020
bridge, which is one of the famous things
to see, as well as try to get a view of the

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.020
palace.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.090
Tokyo’s Imperial Palace is the residence
of the emperor of Japan.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.419
You can’t walk into the palace grounds by
yourself, but you can apply for a free tour

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:58.770
on the official website, and when your booking
is accepted you’ll have the opportunity

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:12.780
to take a tour inside the gates.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:18.100
Ueno Park is a huge public park in Tokyo,
surrounded by temples and shrines, cafes and

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.530
restaurants, the Tokyo zoo, and a few noteworthy
museums.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.150
Throughout the day you’ll find people walking
and jogging, others performing dances and

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.550
playing music, and others just enjoying the
outdoors.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:34.889
The Tokyo Museum, at the far north side of
Ueno Park, is one of Tokyo’s most renowned

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:46.069
museum, preserving art and artifacts from
Japan and throughout Asia.

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:50.280
The modern Tokyo Skytree is a six hundred
and thirty four meter high communications

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.280
tower.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.530
Within the mega tower are a number of viewing
decks and galleries - and they claim that

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:59.200
you can see a view of up to seventy kilometers
in distance.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.700
At the base of the Tokyo Skytree is a huge
mall.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:14.629
I’m on a street right now which is known
as Tekshita Dori which is a walking street,

00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:20.271
and it’s especially famous for people dressed
up in animation characters, cartoons, all

00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:27.340
sorts of costumes, cartoon characters, and
just a very interesting place, and it’s

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:39.470
especially popular with teens and young people.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:43.690
Along with the unique atmosphere and cosplay
that takes place, Takeshita Dori street is

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:48.880
also extremely famous for the Harajuku crepes
and you can choose from dozens of different

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.880
types.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:56.470
The crepe is fried thin, wrapped into a cone
shape, and stuffed with whatever you choose.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:04.750
I’m about to go into Sensoji temple, which
is one of the main places to see when you’re

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:05.750
in Tokyo.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:10.020
I think this is sort of the entrance gate,
and then we’ll walk around in there and

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.310
check it out.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:16.810
Everyday big crowds of both religious pilgrims
and countless tourists visit Sensoji temple,

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.920
one of the most important religious sites
in Tokyo.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.630
The temple dates back to six twenty eight,
making it the oldest temple in the city and

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.310
a historical treasure.

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:30.140
Surrounding the temple you’ll find little
shops and a few places to sample some snacks.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:36.870
I decided to tried a Japanese sweet bread,
which was extremely fluffly and quite sweet.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:43.261
I am at the Edo Tokyo museum, it’s quite
a structure.

00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:48.880
The real price is six hundred yen, but if
you have this Tokyo handy guide, I got this

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.500
from the tourist center, you get a one hundred
twenty yen discount.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.650
So that is just four hundred and eighty yen
for the ticket, and that’s a good little

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:58.650
discount.

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.130
Make sure you have this handy guide.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:04.840
Made to look like a warehouse on stilts, though
I sort of think it looks like a UFO, the Edo

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:10.170
Tokyo Museum is dedicated to preserving the
history of Tokyo, Edo being the former name

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.170
of the city.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:16.170
As soon as you enter, you’ll cross a wooden
replica of the famous Nihonbashi bridge, and

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:20.480
you can then walk through the many exhibitions
to gain an education of how Tokyo became the

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.220
city it is today.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:27.370
As you know, I normally like to stick to street
food when I travel, but there’s something

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:32.030
about Tokyo that makes you want to experience
the elegant luxurious side of the dining scene.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:37.700
Food in Tokyo is so incredibly elaborate and
so aesthetically pleasing - not only to the

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.370
taste buds, but to all of your senses.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:45.830
At fancy restaurants in Japan they pay acute
attention to every minute detail of the atmosphere

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:50.960
and presentation - the food will undoubtedly
be outstanding - but the entire experience

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.290
is what really makes the fine dining in Tokyo
so remarkable.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:58.430
If you have the budget to splurge on a nice
meal in Tokyo, whether it be international

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.940
or Japanese cuisine, the experience you have
will be unforgettable.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.510
I am in the area of Tokyo known as Akihabara.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:12.950
And this is also known as the electronics
town, gamers town, geek town, so if you are

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:17.650
looking for electronics or if you are a crazy
gamer, this is the spot you’re going to

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.210
want to come when you visit Tokyo.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:23.910
Akihabara is home to electronic stores, game
stores, arcades, the animation center and

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.440
those infamous maid cafes.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.910
It even has its own temple, where you can
often see business men seeking luck for their

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.940
latest modern ventures.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.000
One of the free things you can do here in
Tokyo is visit the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.530
So you walk in and you’ll get a visitors
pass, and then you can go through the small

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:48.030
Tokyo Stock Exchange Museum, but then you
can walk around the whole edge of the floor,

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:53.960
edge of the trading floor, and you can pick
up these phones and it will give you an education

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:59.030
about what’s going on and what they’re
doing in these different parts of the exchange.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:02.440
I am at Roppongi, which is a famous area in
Tokyo.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:08.120
You can go to the Mori Art Museum, which is
a modern art museum, as well as the sky view

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:13.270
observatory, which is at the top of one of
the tallest buildings in Tokyo, offering a

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.100
spectacular view of the city.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:22.560
But you got to go to the art museum and then
you can also go to the observatory at the

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.560
same time.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.940
Roppongi is also a famous area in Tokyo for
its nightlife, lots of bars and clubs here,

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.460
especially on the weekend nights.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:36.110
I am on the monorail right now heading to
Odaiba city.

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:47.260
The monorail is really cool, some pretty awesome
views.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.260
The next station is Odaiba.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.000
Made it to Odaiba city, and here at Decks.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.290
There’s a couple of things to do here including
Legoland.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:13:00.290
A bunch of different restaurants and cafes,
actually I saw a couple of Hawaiian restaurants.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:04.350
You have a beautiful view of Tokyo Bay, and
Tokyo skyline.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:08.290
So yah, Odaiba city, kind of an entertainment
island.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:13.120
Odaiba is also home to the famous Fuji TV
headquarters building and the mega ferris

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.940
wheel at Palette Town.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:23.670
I am walking around Yoyogi Park which is one
of the main central big parks in Tokyo.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:31.870
This is a favorite spot for people doing dances,
exercising, walking dogs, and it also seems

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:38.050
to be one of the favorite spots for these
giant sized, chicken sized crows.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.450
Which, yah, they’re like dinosaurs.

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:46.750
It’s a nice place to walk around, and a
place to people watch, especially on the weekends.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:53.450
I’m here on Tuesday, so there aren’t that
many people doing their like dressed up and

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:57.570
doing their dances and costumes and stuff
like that, but on the weekends, you’ll see

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.000
a lot of that.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:06.480
Another very cool area of Tokyo to explore
is called Nezu and also Yanaka, which is kind

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.720
of an old historical area of town.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:13.070
It’s a really quiet area, right now I’m
at the Nezu shrine.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:29.050
It’s a really peaceful place, feels like
you’re far removed from Tokyo.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:33.730
Nezu and Yanaka, two neighborhoods located
next to each other, make a great area of Tokyo

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:35.410
to just walk around and explore.

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:40.100
It’s an area of town that has retained a
lot of its traditional charm and Japanese

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.100
culture.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.980
Don’t forget to walk down snake road, a
small neighborhood alley that weaves back

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.910
and forth to earn its name.

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:50.910
Walking around Yanaka, you’ll find little
stores as well as restaurants selling meals

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.960
and little Japanese street food snacks.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:15:00.590
Thats kind of interesting, I don’t know
if it’s sweet or salty.

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:07.690
It’s a cold and rainy day here in Tokyo,
so it looks like my perfect opportunity to

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:15.060
try out my very first onsen, or a Japanese
public bath.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:20.430
That was quite an interesting experience.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:26.560
Basically you walk in there, and you pay your
fee with a vending mating, and it costs four

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.870
hundred and fifty yen entrance.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:35.800
And from there you get a locker, and you strip
down completely naked, and then you can go

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.300
into the the series of jacuzzis.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:42.750
There was one indoor jacuzzi with a view of
Mount Fuji painted on the wall, there were

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.620
another couple of baths outide.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:49.850
Today we’re taking a little day trip to
Mount Takao, which is about fifty kilometers

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:54.060
outside of central Tokyo, but it feels like
you’re far removed from the city.

00:15:54.060 --> 00:16:00.430
We’re going to climb the mountain and will
be great to get some fresh air and get a little

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:01.780
exercise.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.970
Located just about fifty kilometers from the
center of Tokyo, mount takao is an extremely

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:11.010
popular destination for hiking and exercising,
and it also doubles as a sacred religious

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:14.040
mountain with a number of shrines and temples.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:18.470
If you go on a weekend or holiday, the amount
of people can get a little crazy, but I went

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:20.959
on weekday morning when it wasn’t too bad
at all.

00:16:20.959 --> 00:16:25.120
The air was fresh, and we got good views of
the mountains on one side and Tokyo on the

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.510
other side.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:30.570
There are a number of different trails you
can take, one of them that takes you by the

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:40.140
Biwa waterfall.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:44.230
Eating food and exploring the everlasting
supply of delicious edible things, is without

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:48.450
doubt one of the best things to do when you’re
in Tokyo, and for myself I can safely say

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:51.800
that food was the reason I visited Tokyo.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.310
Navigate your way to the bottom of a department
store for a culinary frenzy that might will

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:58.690
make your head spin from the variety of food
at hand.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:02.770
Not only does it taste amazing, but Japanese
food is easily some of the most beautiful

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.370
looking food I’ve ever seen on the planet.

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:09.100
So much care and thought are put into each
morsel of cuisine.

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:13.350
With over one hundred and sixty thousand official
restaurants in Tokyo alone, you essentially

00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:17.170
have a never ending choice of delicious dining
spots that will never run out.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:21.439
You could easily spend your entire life discovering
Japanese food in Tokyo, and that would be

00:17:21.439 --> 00:17:26.629
an awesome life too, but just do your best
to eat as much as you can during your stay.

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:30.010
From the moment you step foot in Japan, your
mouth will begin to water, and I’m here

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:33.429
to tell you, your taste buds won’t be let
down.

00:17:33.429 --> 00:17:37.920
So that wraps up twenty five of the best things
to do in Tokyo when you visit, it’s a city

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:43.169
that never gets boring and there’s literally
always something to do, see, and eat.

00:17:43.169 --> 00:17:48.940
Your next step is to get yourself to Tokyo
and start to discover it for yourself.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:56.320
