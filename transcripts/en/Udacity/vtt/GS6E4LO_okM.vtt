00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.910
We're here with Nadya Direkova,
a staff designer at Google and a design

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.520
print master will run more design print
more than anyone else in the company.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.384
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:11.840
&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.080
&gt;&gt; So, when should an entrepreneur
think of design and

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.780
user experience when
building their product?

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.640
&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.060
The answer is right away, I don't
believe that there is a successful

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.840
product that separate
from being a product or

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.840
something that's carefully designed.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.750
So as soon as someone's thinking
about starting a company,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.140
it's useful to think about what is it
they want to bring to the world, and

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.800
that starts the design process.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.500
&gt;&gt; Right, and
when you don't have a designer or

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.150
you can't afford
a designer what do you do?

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.369
&gt;&gt; So we'd like to believe that anyone
can have some of the skills that

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:48.140
a designer has.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.390
Note the skills in Photoshop
actually rendering beautiful mocks.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.290
But the kinds of questions
that the designer asks,

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.730
we're hoping to cover some of
these today so that you can learn,

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.230
what are the design skills that can
help you quickly tackle your product and

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.880
the chief results with your team,
even if you're not a designer.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.090
&gt;&gt; You'll hear more about design
spreads from Nadia in the next lesson.
