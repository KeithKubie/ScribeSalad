00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.080
Just happened everyone agrees the footage is phenomenal. It was amazing technological wizardry

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.360
Everyone loves it, but there's something that is missing when you view it over the internet everyone

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.830
that's ever been to an actual space launch will tell you it's the sound of the event that just

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.339
Overwhelms your body and that's kind of lost when you're looking through a screen, right?

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.380
So it's time for me to introduce you to my other youtube channel. It's called the sound traveler

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.759
I used binaural 3d audio if you will to transport your body to the location it kind of tricks your mind

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.379
It's a acoustic type mental thing going on just trust me it works.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.669
Here's how it works get your headphones put your headphones on it only works

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.610
if you have headphones

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.659
Make sure the left headphone is on your left ear make sure the right headphone isn't your right ear there once you get set up

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.570
your

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.880
Calibrated the Vehicle Assembly Building is the largest single story building

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.740
In the world this is where they assemble the Rockets you are one of only 20 photographers credentialed

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.369
That's allowed onto the top of the Vehicle Assembly Building with your headphones on we're gonna walk through the Vehicle Assembly Building with these photographers

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.799
Get on some elevators do some catwalk stuff so that your mind gets calibrated to that 3d audio

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.239
Then walk out to the cameras and get ready for launch there's three things

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.610
I want you to listen for number one at the countdown listen to all the shutters firing from the cameras around you you can hear

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.339
Where they are number two once the rocket lifts off the pad you can no longer hear the cameras. It's so loud

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.169
What kind of aircraft is overhead and where it is relative to your mind? Okay, Go enjoy launch and then we'll get ready for re-entry

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.720
 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.500
15

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.320
thank you

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.360
10

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.600
Thank you

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.700
there it goes

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.040
3

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.000
2

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.020
1

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.460
lift off

00:03:36.560 --> 00:04:42.960
Lots of noise

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.880
That sound adds so much for me. That is so incredible

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.160
Okay, the next part that I absolutely love so the Rockets up up in a way right the two boosters

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.219
Safely separate they do a little pirouette and they come back without touching each other and they come back in

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.409
With a re-entry burn the part that I love I mean as an engineer this just tickles all the right parts of my brain

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.039
the fact that the video feed from both of those boosters

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.089
Looks like it's just one booster played on two different screens

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.750
I love that that means the guidance and control algorithm was so finely tuned

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.100
But they just nailed it so tip of the hat to the guidance control team that did that

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.079
Very very impressed the next thing that you missed by not being there because we're watching it on a screen

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.130
And we're hearing the cheering at Hawthorne or the sonic booms as it approaches the pad

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.079
So here's how this works according to SpaceX there are three sonic booms per booster

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.979
And they're caused by in order number one the engine down there causes the first sonic boom where the legs connect to the booster

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.819
That's the second one and the third one's caused by the grid fins up on top of the booster now

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.829
There's three sonic booms per booster

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.550
We have two boosters that six sonic booms right, now

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.160
Experience this in 3d with your headphones still see if you can count how many sonic booms you hear

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.660
And this is what a person hears when they're down at the Cape when this goes down check it out

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.480
got them

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.840
woooow

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.880
sonic boom's?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.320
6 sonic booms

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.760
holy, holy mackerel

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.440
I didn't count six I counted ten pump. It dump. It dump. It dump it down I

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.409
Went back and looked at the waveform the reason you see ten. There's supposed to be three per booster

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:26.739
There's three with echoes and so the waveform overlays in such a way that it sounds like five. It's fascinating anyway

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:32.949
That is a sound traveller video. I hope you enjoyed this episode of the sound traveler

00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:37.839
I'm promoting it here on smarter every day in hopes that people will go and subscribe to that when I feature a

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.169
guest sound traveler I write up this little contract here and

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:49.179
I make sure to pay them and I also make sure to promote them and this particular sound traveler was trevor maehlman trevor

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.669
Helps me with all the eclipse stuff that we've done in the past but

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:56.650
According to our contract that we wrote. I am now supposed to promote Trevor's MySpace page

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.650
so if you want to support Trevor Mullin

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:04.659
professional rocket photographer you can I'm just kidding he has a patreon trevor is trying to figure out how to make a career out of

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.160
professional rocket photography

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:12.369
And if you know anything about how intellectual property works it is really really hard to do that everybody wants to offer you promotion

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:16.599
When you just need money to eat, so I payed Trevor for this endeavor

00:08:16.599 --> 00:08:17.090
and

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:22.929
I also want to set him up for the long haul and the way to do that is patreon so if you want to support

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:28.780
Trevor you'll notice all the other photographers were more established in their careers Trevor's not so if you want to support a young man

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:34.059
That's doing awesome things and on top of that. He gives you incredible photographs in exchange for your financial support

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:39.369
I'll leave a link down below. So if you want to pack up your photography gear now with Trevor

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:45.489
I'll let you do that and I'll leave a link on the screen to subscribe to the sound traveler one humble request

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:53.280
To subscribe to that channel because it's a pet project. I love anyway. I'm Destin you're getting smarter every day. Have a good one

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.360
Holy cow

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.279
