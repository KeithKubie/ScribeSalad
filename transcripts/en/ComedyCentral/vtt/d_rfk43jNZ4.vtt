00:00:04.704 --> 00:00:06.039
closed-circuit TV.

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:08.375
From time to time we
wire guys on the court,

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:09.843
refs on the court,

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:11.211 align:start size:94% position:6%

on behind the scenes.

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:12.312
Check it out.

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:13.346
- [Jeff] Hey, how are you?

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:14.314
- [Rodney] How's it going man?

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:15.315
Nice to meet you.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:16.316
- I'm Jeff.

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:17.384
- Yeah, Rondy man, Rodney man.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:18.418
- Just washed my hands.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:19.652
Was just in the bathroom.

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:20.653
- [Narrator] This is
gonna be fun tonight.

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:21.454
- All right.
- All right.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:22.255
- All right, get ready.

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:23.023
- All right ladies.

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:23.857
Shake 'em.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:24.791
Don't bake 'em.

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:25.525
- I usually do the tip-off.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:26.359
- I wanna do it.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.094
I'm gonna do it.

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:28.928
- Okay.

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:29.829
(whistle)

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.464
- All right, here we go.

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:32.565
Here we go.

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:33.500
Here we go.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.534
(whistle)

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:35.435
- Time-Out.

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:37.737
- We've got a little
time to kill, probably.

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:38.805
Do you play?

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:39.939
- Oh, do I play?

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:41.274
- A little crossover.

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:42.208
- Nah, nah.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:44.844
- (Whistle) Time-Out over.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:46.112
- Charging.
- Charging?

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:48.615
- Charging. I planted my foot.

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:53.086
(whistle) It's a charge.

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:54.521
- Nah, that's a block.

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:55.355
- That's a charge.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:56.322
- No, that's a block.

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:57.157
- That's what a charge is.

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:58.124
- No, that's a block.

00:00:58.124 --> 00:00:58.958
- Hey man, that's a charge.

00:00:58.958 --> 00:00:59.926
- No, that's a block.

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:00.727
- Hey. What? That's a charge.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:01.528
- No, that's a block.

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:02.195
- Do what you did.

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:03.129
Do what you did.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.064 align:start size:75% position:25%
- No, she--
- You see that?

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.532
- But that's not what happened.

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:06.800 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Jeff] What's the story
with the on-campus restaurant?

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.701
Is it a list situation?

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:09.769
They take money?

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:10.603
Is it points?

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:11.805
Can you use points?

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:13.039 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Rodney] Some
people get in here,

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.208 align:start size:84% position:16%
they see a bunch of
tall, beautiful women.

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:16.676
No offense, but it's the truth.

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:17.510
- (whistle) Foul!

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.678
- Oh, okay, okay.

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:19.946
I got it, I got it.

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:20.613
I got it, I got it,
I got it, I got it.

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:21.414
No, stay down.

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:22.082
- You're all right.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:22.882
She's all right.

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:23.683
Get up. You can get up.

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:24.517
She can get up.

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:25.351
- I got it.

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.186
Stay down.

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:27.420
Stay down.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.221
- She wants to get
up? Let her get up.

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:29.155
- Let's get some ice.

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:30.657
Let's get some ice for her!

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:31.458
- You see, you're problem is
you're coming in way too hot.

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:32.392
They don't like that.

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:33.326
You gotta come in subtle.

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:34.594
- What are you talking about?

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:35.261
Are you talking about
hooking up with girls?

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:35.929
- Hey man.

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:36.596
Hey you said it.

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.098
I didn't.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.432 align:start size:94% position:6%
You pick one girl, and you
give her the attention.

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:40.266
- That's the way.

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.167
You know who I like?

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:42.001
- Which one?

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:42.836
- 15.

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:43.670
- 15, That's your girl?

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.637
I see.

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:45.872
I knew you were a dirty dog.

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:46.706 align:start size:84% position:16%
I knew you were gonna
like one of them.

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:47.941
- Nah, come on, man.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:48.641 align:start size:84% position:16%
- 15? I thought
that was your girl.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:49.342
Hey, hey.

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:50.310
Foul on 15.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.010
- What are you doing, man?

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.711
- Save her.

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:52.412
Save her.

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:53.012
Save her.

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:53.847
Come on.

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:54.814
Save her.

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:55.648
- No way that's a foul on 15.

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:56.349
No, no, take that back.

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:57.183
- Hey man--

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:58.017
- Take that back.

00:01:58.017 --> 00:01:58.852
- I said it's a foul.

00:01:58.852 --> 00:01:59.686
You sure?

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:00.487
- Yeah, I'm sure.

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:01.287
- All right, man.

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:02.222
Whatever you say.

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:03.423
- Okay, that's not a foul on 15.

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:04.090
You're still in the
game sweetheart.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.757
- Trust me.

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:05.558
Trust me.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:06.860
That's gonna pay off.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.794
In dividends.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.562
(refs laughing)

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:11.131
- I'd give him a shot.

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.532
I'd give him a shot.

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:13.900
That's all I'm saying.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.734
Did what I could.

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:16.202
Did what I could.

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:17.237
- What's your favorite
M. Night Shyamalan movie?

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:19.239 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Signs, no question.
- Yeah.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.575 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Looks like he's got a
yellow glooey on his head.

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:24.978
(refs laughing)

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.180
- Cause I was thinking
that for a while now.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.415
- As I said, I call
it like I see it.

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:32.118 align:start size:81% position:19%
Hey dooty head,
get off the court.

00:02:32.118 --> 00:02:34.787
(refs laughing)

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:39.926
All right.

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:40.760
(buzzer buzzing)

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.594
That's the game.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:43.096
That's it.

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:44.030 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
- [Narrator] Sometimes,
what you hear on the court

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.298 line:0%
can be surprisingly uplifting.

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:47.333 line:0%
That's it for today.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.702 line:0%
Remember it's amnesty
week at the library,

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:51.871
so get those books back there.

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:53.273
- [Rodney] When I whip out
Eye of the Tiger by Survivor.

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:56.109
- [Jeff] Not if I
get there first.
