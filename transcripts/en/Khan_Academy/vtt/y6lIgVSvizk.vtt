00:00:00.233 --> 00:00:03.399
- This is a map of what
the Americas looked like

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:05.399
at around the year 1750.

00:00:06.236 --> 00:00:08.274
And as you can see, it
was for the most part,

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:12.617
divided as colonies by a
bunch of European powers.

00:00:12.617 --> 00:00:14.859
Most prominent is Spain.

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:17.784
You can see in this peach brownish color,

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:21.645
it had control all the way
south as modern-day Chile

00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:23.935
and Argentina and all the way as far north

00:00:23.935 --> 00:00:27.495
as modern-day Texas and California.

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:30.323
You also see significant
control by the Portuguese

00:00:30.323 --> 00:00:32.899
in what will eventually be Brazil.

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.270
The French have at this
point some territory,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.140
especially in North America
and in several islands

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.731
in the Caribbean and
the British, of course,

00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:46.259
have control along the east
coast of North America.

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:49.432
And they also have several
islands in the Caribbean

00:00:49.432 --> 00:00:51.188
and the Atlantic.

00:00:51.188 --> 00:00:54.113
As we fast forward 100 years,

00:00:54.113 --> 00:00:57.038
we're going to see a dramatic change.

00:00:57.038 --> 00:01:00.068
Notice roughly a hundred years later,

00:01:00.068 --> 00:01:03.433
most of what used to be
these European colonies

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:06.600
have now achieved independence.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.373
In other videos, we go in
some depth from 1776 to 1783.

00:01:11.373 --> 00:01:14.591
You have the American
War for Independence.

00:01:14.591 --> 00:01:16.442
You see on this map now the United States

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:19.034
is an independent country.

00:01:19.034 --> 00:01:22.951
From 1791 to 1804, you
have Toussaint Louveture

00:01:24.341 --> 00:01:27.661
lead the revolt against French control,

00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:31.514
eventually gaining independence
and establishing Haiti.

00:01:31.514 --> 00:01:35.681
From 1807 to 1830, you have
a series of revolutions

00:01:37.077 --> 00:01:39.897
in Latin America, many of which were led

00:01:39.897 --> 00:01:44.064
by Simon Bolivar, who was a
Crejo, or Creole, Venezuelan.

00:01:45.247 --> 00:01:49.127
The term Creole has many
meanings in modern-day language,

00:01:49.127 --> 00:01:50.838
but in this context, it refers to someone

00:01:50.838 --> 00:01:55.005
of mostly Spanish descent who
was born in the New World.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.092
And Simon Bolivar plays an active role

00:01:58.092 --> 00:02:01.960
in achieving independence
from Spain for Venezuela,

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.738
what will eventually
be Columbia and Panama,

00:02:04.738 --> 00:02:08.037
Ecuador, Peru, and the
country that will eventually

00:02:08.037 --> 00:02:10.723
be named for him, Bolivia.

00:02:10.723 --> 00:02:13.249
So there is an interesting question here.

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:16.994
What led to all of these revolutions?

00:02:16.994 --> 00:02:18.980
The map that I showed you before,

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.334
that colonial map of the Americas,

00:02:21.334 --> 00:02:24.419
these colonies had been in
place for several hundred years

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:27.069
before these revolutions.

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.509
Why did all of these revolutions happen

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:32.032
roughly at the same time?

00:02:32.032 --> 00:02:36.162
Well, one overarching idea
is that as we enter into

00:02:36.162 --> 00:02:39.995
the 1700s, you have the
intellectual movement

00:02:39.995 --> 00:02:42.182
known as the Enlightenment.

00:02:42.182 --> 00:02:44.920
There were many authors
and many publications

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.353
involved in the Enlightenment,

00:02:46.353 --> 00:02:51.157
but perhaps most famous is
the Encyclopedie in French,

00:02:51.157 --> 00:02:53.893
or Encyclopedia, which said
the intent of collecting

00:02:53.893 --> 00:02:56.926
much of the scientific
and political science,

00:02:56.926 --> 00:03:00.177
knowledge of the time and is considered

00:03:00.177 --> 00:03:02.859
one of the central texts
of the Enlightenment.

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.110
And it was a series of articles published

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.334
from the 1750s all the
way until the 1770s.

00:03:08.334 --> 00:03:11.187
And to get a sense of
it, here is an excerpt

00:03:11.187 --> 00:03:13.376
of an article by one of the authors,

00:03:13.376 --> 00:03:17.086
Denis Diderot, considered
one of the primary actors

00:03:17.086 --> 00:03:18.556
in the Enlightenment.

00:03:18.556 --> 00:03:20.796
"No man has received from nature

00:03:20.796 --> 00:03:22.644
"the right to command others.

00:03:22.644 --> 00:03:26.267
"Liberty is gift from
heaven, and each individual

00:03:26.267 --> 00:03:29.423
"of the same species
has the right to enjoy

00:03:29.423 --> 00:03:32.877
"it as soon as he enjoys
the use of reason."

00:03:32.877 --> 00:03:36.246
And so when we get into the
Declaration of Independence,

00:03:36.246 --> 00:03:39.237
written by Thomas Jefferson,
he borrows heavily

00:03:39.237 --> 00:03:42.063
from these ideas of the Enlightenment.

00:03:42.063 --> 00:03:45.431
Now, the Haitian Revolution
was partially inspired

00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:47.542
by these ideas of the Enlightenment,

00:03:47.542 --> 00:03:49.472
but they were also helped by the fact

00:03:49.472 --> 00:03:53.143
that France was undergoing
its own revolution

00:03:53.143 --> 00:03:55.666
at the time and it was not in the position

00:03:55.666 --> 00:03:59.666
to exert strong control
over a far flung colony.

00:04:00.597 --> 00:04:04.347
The French Revolution
lasts from 1789 to 1799

00:04:05.818 --> 00:04:09.238
at which point Napoleon
Bonaparte takes control of France

00:04:09.238 --> 00:04:11.933
and starts the Napoleonic Wars.

00:04:11.933 --> 00:04:14.911
Napoleon tries to keep control
of what would eventually

00:04:14.911 --> 00:04:18.535
be Haiti, was an incredibly
valuable resource.

00:04:18.535 --> 00:04:21.649
It produced a good chunk of
coffee and sugar in the world.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:25.103
It was incredibly profitable
for the plantation owners

00:04:25.103 --> 00:04:27.211
and for France as a nation.

00:04:27.211 --> 00:04:29.062
But between the ideas of the Enlightenment

00:04:29.062 --> 00:04:32.305
and the French Revolution,
the slaves of Haiti

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:34.832
led initially by Toussaint Louverture,

00:04:34.832 --> 00:04:38.934
were able to overthrow and
set up their own nation,

00:04:38.934 --> 00:04:41.293
which is the first time
that this has happened

00:04:41.293 --> 00:04:44.522
from a successful slave revolt.

00:04:44.522 --> 00:04:46.925
This is a map of the empire
that Napoleon establishes

00:04:46.925 --> 00:04:49.576
at its peak and as you can see,

00:04:49.576 --> 00:04:52.455
you see France, but he's
able to take over much

00:04:52.455 --> 00:04:55.304
of modern-day Germany,
Italy, he goes to war

00:04:55.304 --> 00:04:58.464
with Portugal and then
eventually Spain as well.

00:04:58.464 --> 00:05:03.271
Both significant colonial
powers in South America.

00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:05.876
So it's in this context,
you have the Enlightenment

00:05:05.876 --> 00:05:07.856
as we get into the 1700s.

00:05:07.856 --> 00:05:09.245
You already have the example

00:05:09.245 --> 00:05:11.268
of the American War for Independence.

00:05:11.268 --> 00:05:13.724
13 colonies being able
to declare independence

00:05:13.724 --> 00:05:16.658
from one of the largest
powers at the time.

00:05:16.658 --> 00:05:19.410
Then a successful slave
revolt to establish

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.483
their own country against
another significant power.

00:05:23.483 --> 00:05:26.556
And once Spain and Portugal
are fighting Napoleon

00:05:26.556 --> 00:05:28.366
coupled with the ideas
of the Enlightenment

00:05:28.366 --> 00:05:31.314
and the examples of the
United States and Haiti,

00:05:31.314 --> 00:05:33.845
it inspires a whole other series

00:05:33.845 --> 00:05:35.999
of revolts in Latin America, many of which

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:38.857
were led by Simon Bolivar.

00:05:38.857 --> 00:05:41.720
And so by the time we get to 1850,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.473
much of the European
imperialism in the Americas

00:05:45.473 --> 00:05:47.056
has come to an end.
