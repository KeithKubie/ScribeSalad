00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.985
So, in the previous example we
went from kilometers to miles.

00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:06.270
And it wasn't too difficult since we
knew the relationship between the two.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.050
Sometimes they'll be intermediate steps.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.630
So let's say you had a conversion chart
with a whole bunch of unit conversions.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.366
For example, here we have relationships
between miles and kilometers, and yards,

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:19.407
and feet, and meters,
centimeters, millimeters.

00:00:19.407 --> 00:00:20.127
And then, what the heck?

00:00:20.127 --> 00:00:24.925
I started talking about volume and gave
some conversion factors between gallons,

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:26.430
cups, and liters.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.810
Now, let's say you want to convert
a distance that you knew in centimeters

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.430
to a distance in feet.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.020
Just a few things you could do.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.320
One option is, you could start with
centimeters, convert to meters,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.840
then convert from meters to yards,
and then go from yards to feet.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.280
Or maybe you want to go from
centimeters to meters and

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.240
then from meters to kilometers.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.861
Then maybe from kilometers to miles,
miles to yards, and yards to feet.

00:00:50.861 --> 00:00:53.964
In general, there's a lot of ways you
can perform your unit conversions.

00:00:53.964 --> 00:00:57.518
In this case I'd prefer option one
because it involves fewer steps, but

00:00:57.518 --> 00:00:59.360
option two isn't wrong.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.050
Let's practice this with a problem.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.897
Let's say you're having a party again
and you want to serve 26 guests.

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:09.803
And you think that each of them
are going to drink 5 cups of juice,

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:13.387
but the juice you're
buying sold by the liter.

00:01:13.387 --> 00:01:15.830
How many liters of juice should you buy?

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.050
Enter your answer in this box.
