00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.730
&gt;&gt; So after much deliberation I decided I would define creativity simply as

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.270
anything that produces an non-obvious, desirable product.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.090
I think that we have to have to sort of output for creativity in order for

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.800
it to be actually be identifiable as creativity. I think that the output has to

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.820
actually be wanted in some way. Doing something that no one wants is

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.580
not necessarily creative. I think the output has to actually be desirable in

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.990
some way, and it also has to be something non-obvious. Doing the obvious answer

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.590
is not a very creative solution. If I'm propping open a door and

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.950
I use a chair, it's a slightly more creative solution to that problem.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.070
Thank you David. Or course everyone's answer to this question may differ. For

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.730
example, some people may not put the word product here.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.850
It's not clear that the result of creativity is necessarily a product.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.620
Some people do not put the word desirable there because sometimes creativity may

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.570
not result from some initial desire. Let us carry on this discussion of

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.730
what is creativity on the forum. Feel free to add your own notions.
