00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.820
Movies often end on cliffhangers or by hinting
towards things to come, but sometimes those

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.580
endings can be quite dense and confusing for
audiences.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.310
Examples are particularly prominent in - although
not exclusive to - the world of comic book

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.289
movies, because the endings will often hint
towards new characters from the comic books

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.160
that mainstream movie audiences might not
be familiar with.Of course, these days, movies

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.160
don't necessarily "end" at the point that
they're traditionally supposed to.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.160
Back in the day, a movie would end and the
rolling of the credits would be the cue for

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.160
audiences to stop watching, but mid and post-credits
scenes are extremely common these days - and

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.160
these scenes can often explain (or at least
hint towards) the future of the franchise

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.160
in question.In this article, we'll take a
look at ten movies that ended in a way that

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.679
suggested "something" was going to happen
in the future - whether it be in a credits

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.820
scene or otherwise - and we'll explain exactly
what that "something" is going to be.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:44.800
Please note that there will be some spoilers
for a number of movies released in 2016.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.610
Captain America: Civil War
A lot happened at the end of Captain America:

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.610
Civil War.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.610
Heroes went off in all kinds of different
directions and there were two scenes after

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.610
the credits rolled, so let's cut to the chase
here; The Avengers now officially only consist

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.780
of Iron Man, a recovering War Machine and
Vision.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.000
Black Widow is on the run for helping Bucky
and Captain America escape, despite having

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.890
been on Iron Man's team.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.360
As per the mid-credits scene, Black Panther,
also despite having been on Iron Man's team,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.740
has taken Captain America and Bucky Barnes
to Wakanda, granting them both asylum and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.010
putting Barnes back in cryogenic stasis until
his brainwashing can be cured.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.471
The rest of Team Captain America are on the
run - including Ant-Man, who may well be a

00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:21.100
fugitive when his next movie with the Wasp
comes around.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.740
And, as per the post-credits scene, Spider-Man
is back in Queens in possession of a high-tech

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.450
gadget that would suggest Tony Stark is going
to be helping him in the future.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.450
Got all that?

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.450
Good.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.450
Inception
Dom Cobb, the character played by Leonardo

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.450
DiCaprio in Inception, may not exactly be
a traditional "hero" given that he's a thief,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.910
but he's the protagonist of the movie and
the guy you're rooting for, so he certainly

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:35.970
fits the bill here.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.810
For the entire movie, Cobb concerned himself
with whether or not he was dreaming or in

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.550
reality, and his totem - a spinning top - would
tell him in either case.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.510
If it kept spinning, Cobb was dreaming.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.880
If it fell, he was awake.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.729
The movie ended ambiguously, with Cobb walking
away from his spinning totem after seeing

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.730
his children, and the entire point of that
scene - as explained long after the movie's

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.960
release by director Christopher Nolan - was
that Cobb no longer cared whether he was dreaming

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.880
or awake, because he was happy with his life
regardless.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.200
The Thing
John Carpenter's horror classic The Thing

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.580
was about a parasitic extraterrestrial lifeform
that assimilates other organisms and subsequently

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.610
imitates them.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.010
It infiltrated an Antarctic research station
and, at the end of the movie, only two members

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.299
of the research team were left alive - Keith
Davids' Childs and Kurt Russell's MacReady

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.529
- and while it's obvious that one of them
must have been assimilated, it's confusing

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:26.329
trying to fathom which one it is.

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.590
However, there is a subtle clue in the form
of some foreshadowing earlier in the movie.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.049
MacReady handed a drink to a cheating chess
computer and, as he and Childs sit as the

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.930
only survivors, he does the same to Childs.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.700
The parallels are obvious: Macready is the
strategist calling the shots and he has the

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.790
alien all figured out.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.790
Unfortunately, however, that probably means
he was assimilated shortly after the movie

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.790
ended - after all, he was in the middle of
nowhere with nobody there to help him.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.440
X-Men: Apocalypse
X-Men: Apocalypse is getting something of

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.769
a grilling from movie critics, but that doesn't
mean that the movie didn't leave a lot of

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.799
exciting hints about the franchise going forward.

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.060
For starters, it looks like we're going to
see Dark Phoenix in the future, as Apocalypse

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.459
saying "all is revealed" as Jean Grey unleashed
her power was very ominous - as was her nightmare

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.010
that shook the X-Mansion.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.200
You also have to expect that Quicksilver will
reveal himself to Magneto as his son at some

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.519
point - and that will certainly result in
an intriguing relationship.

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.609
Psylocke made a hasty escape after Apocalypse
was defeated - there's every chance she might

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:21.040
join up with Deadpool and Cable in an X-Force
movie in future, which would be awesome.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.249
However, the most exciting thing came in the
post-credits scene, as the reveal of a briefcase

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:30.139
marked "Essex Corp" in the Weapon X facility
hinted towards the future appearance of Nathaniel

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:34.409
Essex - Mister Sinister himself - as a future
big-bad in the franchise.

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.170
That will be absolutely amazing to see.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.790
Birdman
Birdman follows the exploits of a faded actor

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.319
called Riggan Thomson, played by Michael Keaton,
as he struggles to come to terms with the

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.189
fact that his fame isn't what it once was.

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:53.069
Most famous for playing the titular superhero
character Birdman, Thomson's frail mental

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.549
state has resulted in him seeing the character
in hallucinations.

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.068
Towards the end of the movie, Thomson found
peace after landing a role on Broadway.

00:03:58.068 --> 00:03:59.068
Satisfied with life, and wanting to give an
extra real performance, Thomson replaces a

00:03:59.068 --> 00:04:03.029
prop gun with a loaded gun in a suicide scene
and actually shoots himself in the head.

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:06.400
He doesn't die, however, and is later seen
recovering in hospital.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.109
The last time we see the character, he opens
the window of his hospital room and is never

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.109
seen again.

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:15.299
In the final scene, his daughter Sam walks
up to the window, looks down, then looks to

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.010
the sky and smiles.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.889
Although it's quite tragic, what actually
happened is that Sam saw her father's spirit

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.020
heading to heaven, where he will spend eternity
in happiness.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.320
Total Recall
Total Recall tells the story of Douglas Quaid,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.330
a construction worker in 2084 played by Arnold
Schwarzengegger who is having troubling dreams

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.629
about Mars and a mysterious woman there.

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:41.229
At a company called Rekall that provides memory
implants of vacations, Quaid decides to take

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.610
a fantasy memory trip as a secret agent to
Mars.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.430
Something goes wrong with his implant, however,
and from then on the story continuously asks

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.289
the question of what is real and what is hallucination.

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:58.090
At the movie's climax, it is left ambiguous
as to whether Quaid is dreaming or in reality,

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.710
but Paul Verhoeven - the movie's director
- has claimed that everything is taking place

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.639
in Quaid's head and he's been rendered permanently
stuck like that, thanks to the his brain having

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.750
a violent reaction to the implant process
and including aspects of his real life into

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.939
his fantasy trip.

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:14.780
This makes a lot of sense, as far too many
coincidences take place for everything that

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:21.389
goes on to be real.

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.569
Guardians of the Galaxy
The ending to Guardians of the Galaxy wasn't

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:28.342
confusing, per se, but there were some important
things (and some things that probably aren't

00:05:28.342 --> 00:05:29.342
so important in the long-term) that you may
have missed.

00:05:29.342 --> 00:05:33.639
You will no doubt have caught Rocket Raccoon
holding a sapling, and seen mini-Groot dancing

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.069
behind Drax's back, so you'll know the lovable
tree-like humanoid is returning in the sequel,

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:40.060
but did you catch the post-credits scene?

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.500
The Collector was in his destroyed museum
with two characters from the comic books - Howard

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.889
the Duck and Cosmo the Spacedog, who we may
meet again in the future - but the scene served

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:53.389
as a timely reminder of the coming of a much
more important character in the franchise.

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.319
We had previously seen a cocoon in the museum,
but the devastation caused when it was destroyed

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:01.050
will more than likely have seen the character
inside it disturbed from his regenerative

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.050
hibernation.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.330
That character is Adam Warlock - and he will
be a key character going forward in the Marvel

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.810
Cinematic Universe as a whole, as he will
meet the Guardians of the Galaxy in their

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.199
sequel and his participation alongside them
in the fight against Thanos in the Avengers:

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:19.010
Infinity War movies will be decisive when
it comes to defeating the Mad Titan.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.039
The Matrix Revolutions
If you can understand most of what happened

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:27.090
in the three Matrix movies, well done to you,
but nobody can know for sure exactly what

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.879
happened at the end of The Matrix Revolutions
- that is apart from the Wachowski Brothers

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:31.930
who wrote it, of course.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.470
An explanation actually comes from a cut scene
in the video game The Matrix: The Path of

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.750
Neo, in which pixelated representations of
the brothers say this: "Neo stands on the

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:46.060
verge of satori, ready to resolve the parodox
of choice and choicelessness, free will versus

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.080
fate, but that can only be achieved through
an act of surrender, which occurs after an

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.250
abandonment of the perspectile nature of truth,
accepting the totality of present consciousness

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:00.310
which ultimately allows an evolutionary transition,
transcending the Cartesian Dilemma through

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.800
emergence of de-limited spirit which then
provides the world with a third path, the

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.320
Path of Neo, the path of peace."

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.860
And if that doesn't clear it up for you, basically,
by referencing a lot of Eastern philosophies,

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.430
the Wachowskis are saying that Neo's mind
and spirit have likely transcended into the

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:20.490
Matrix, covering it like a guardian angel
or holy ghost.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:26.020
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice
In Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Superman

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.080
was killed in battle against the monstrous
Doomsday - a being created using the corpse

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.830
of General Zod from Man of Steel and the DNA
of Lex Luthor.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.160
As a tribute to his fallen fellow hero, Batman
vowed to assemble a team of metahumans to

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.880
battle evil from that point onwards.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.699
This was, of course, foreshadowing the coming
of the Justice League to our cinema screens

00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:46.479
and we will see the likes of Wonder Woman,
the Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg in the team

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:47.479
in the future.

00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:51.039
But something else happened at the end of
Batman v Superman - a faint heartbeat was

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:54.879
heard and the dirt around Superman's coffin
began to levitate!

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:56.520
Superman isn't actually dead!

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.800
In Man of Steel, particles of ice levitated
around Superman the first time he flew, so

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.760
this is a throwback to that moment - and a
sure sign that Superman will fly again.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.409
Moreover, in the Death of Superman comic book
arc, Superman didn't stay dead for too long

00:08:10.409 --> 00:08:16.009
after a fatal collision with Doomsday - and
you can rest assured he won't in the movies

00:08:16.009 --> 00:08:17.779
either.

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:20.629
Deadpool
After the credits rolled in the brilliant

00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:24.491
Deadpool movie, the titular character re-emerged
on screen from the bedroom of Ferris Bueller

00:08:24.491 --> 00:08:28.949
from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, wearing a bathrobe
identical to the one Ferris wore.

00:08:28.949 --> 00:08:36.550
After some typically humorous babbling from
Ryan Reynolds' character, he explains that

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.230
there will be a sequel to the movie and that
Cable will be in it.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.230
But exactly who is Cable?

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:44.450
Casual audiences probably don't know the character,
but he is iconic in Marvel's comic books.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:49.070
He's the telekinetic son of Cyclops and a
clone of Jean Grey called Madelyne Pryor - but

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.980
he can also time-travel - and he's actually
appeared in a comic book title called "Cable

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:53.980
and Deadpool".

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.960
As he's from the future, expect him to travel
back in time to join Deadpool for some violent

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.150
capers in the sequel.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.950
You also have to imagine that Wolverine will
appear alongside them in Deadpool's second

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:06.640
movie, given how many references to the character
were made in the first one.
