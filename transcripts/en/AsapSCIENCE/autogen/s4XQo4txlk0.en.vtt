and Mitch what exactly are we doing

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610
and Mitch what exactly are we doing
 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.340
and Mitch what exactly are we doing
today so today we're actually looking at

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350
today so today we're actually looking at
 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.540
today so today we're actually looking at
the science of pain and we're gonna

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550
the science of pain and we're gonna
 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.819
the science of pain and we're gonna
start out by having a lot of spicy

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829
start out by having a lot of spicy
 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.040
start out by having a lot of spicy
peppers to understand why spice feels

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050
peppers to understand why spice feels
 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.479
peppers to understand why spice feels
like pain and then we're gonna be

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
like pain and then we're gonna be
 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.380
like pain and then we're gonna be
putting our hands in some really cold

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390
putting our hands in some really cold
 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.090
putting our hands in some really cold
water and see it's swearing can actually

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
water and see it's swearing can actually
 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.220
water and see it's swearing can actually
help with pain and finally we're gonna

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230
help with pain and finally we're gonna
 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.529
help with pain and finally we're gonna
be getting electrocuted to talk about

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539
be getting electrocuted to talk about
 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.660
be getting electrocuted to talk about
the anticipation of pain and how awful

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670
the anticipation of pain and how awful
 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.189
the anticipation of pain and how awful
that is you're gonna be good at this

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199
that is you're gonna be good at this
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.040
that is you're gonna be good at this
no I'm like so weak okay I'm the weak

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050
no I'm like so weak okay I'm the weak
 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.479
no I'm like so weak okay I'm the weak
one of this group you've got red hair

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489
one of this group you've got red hair
 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.069
one of this group you've got red hair
jeans oh you know I can like handle

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
jeans oh you know I can like handle
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.420
jeans oh you know I can like handle
anything yeah they're all gonna be

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430
anything yeah they're all gonna be
 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.130
anything yeah they're all gonna be
challenges by the way so should we just

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140
challenges by the way so should we just
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.350
challenges by the way so should we just
should we just start yeah let's do that

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360
 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.120
all right first step we have our spicy

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130
all right first step we have our spicy
 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.679
all right first step we have our spicy
pepper challenge we've ordered these

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689
pepper challenge we've ordered these
 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.690
pepper challenge we've ordered these
peppers from the least spicy to most

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700
peppers from the least spicy to most
 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.520
peppers from the least spicy to most
spicy and then we have a list of facts

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530
spicy and then we have a list of facts
 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.740
spicy and then we have a list of facts
so every time we bite a pepper we have

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750
so every time we bite a pepper we have
 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.440
so every time we bite a pepper we have
to spew off a spicy pepper fact and this

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450
to spew off a spicy pepper fact and this
 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.719
to spew off a spicy pepper fact and this
is the hottest pepper in the world to

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729
is the hottest pepper in the world to
 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:24.980
is the hottest pepper in the world to
California reverse so we're really

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990
