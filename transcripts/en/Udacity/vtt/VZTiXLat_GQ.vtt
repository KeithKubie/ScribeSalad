00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.690
Putting some numbers behind this,

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.460
the dynamic range that the human
eye can deal with is incredible.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.510
It ranges over 14 orders of magnitude,
and there's almost nothing

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.250
in the real world that works over
14 orders of magnitude, right?

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.810
So that means 10 to the 14,
one and 14 zeros times

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.430
from the darkest dark to the brightest
bright that you can deal with, and

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.140
by the way, that does include looking,
like, directly at the sun, because,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.460
frankly, you can't actually see much
when you look directly at the sun.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.010
It's too bright.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.740
All right?

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.541
But you can go from somewhere from 10
to the minus six to 10 to the eighth,

00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:39.710
what's called candelas, which is
a unit of energy, per square meter.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.910
It's a measure of the amount
of the flux of the light, and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.440
flux falls on a particular area.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.570
So, the human eye can
set its dynamic range,

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.630
its set point, to anywhere from this
really low, this 10 to the minus six,

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.360
10 to the minus five, 10 to the minus
four, so that'd be a range of two,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.330
up to 10 to the six, 10 to the seven,
10 to the, another range of two.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.030
It can set it anywhere
along that spectrum.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.117
At any given point in time, it's
operating at at least a hundred to one,

00:01:04.117 --> 00:01:07.542
maybe a thousand to one, maybe,
maybe even more than that.

00:01:07.542 --> 00:01:09.417
It depends upon how you're doing.

00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:13.386
And in any given sort of real world
scene, like I was just showing you,

00:01:13.386 --> 00:01:16.914
the actual ratio of sort of the darkest
area to the brightest area,

00:01:16.914 --> 00:01:19.875
can sometimes be in
the order of 100,000 to one.

00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:21.297
Right?
So you're standing there,

00:01:21.297 --> 00:01:22.613
it's really bright outside,

00:01:22.613 --> 00:01:25.293
it's kind of dark in here,
that difference might be under if,

00:01:25.293 --> 00:01:28.680
if it was that far, even your eye
would have difficulty dealing with it.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.590
But it's way better than
most imaging systems.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.960
Now, the thing is,
everybody knows about your pupal, right?

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.650
When it's bright out the pupal closes
down, when it's light you know,

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.640
when its, dark, the pupal opens up.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.050
That's a very small range of variation.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.260
A colleague of mine,
professor actually, used to say that it

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.490
was like an order of 10 to 100
variation, in terms of the size.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.050
He actually said 10, but
I think it's a little smaller than that.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.425
But how do you do the this
great huge variation?

00:01:55.425 --> 00:01:59.685
Well, it's actually the retina's
ganglion cells that make this happen.

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:02.775
And the way it does it is, and
this is sort of looking at just a single

00:02:02.775 --> 00:02:06.262
section, so remember, light's coming
in this way, not too important for the,

00:02:06.262 --> 00:02:10.502
here we have our photo receptors,
here we have our horizontal cells,

00:02:10.502 --> 00:02:14.872
our bipolar cells, Amacrine, and
then there's these ganglion cells.

00:02:14.872 --> 00:02:18.932
But notice that this thing is referred
to as the surround, the center,

00:02:18.932 --> 00:02:19.612
and the surround.

00:02:19.612 --> 00:02:24.327
And you can think of this as being
a slice through a circular operator,

00:02:24.327 --> 00:02:28.950
okay, and that circular operator
would look something like this.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.400
Okay?

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.780
In the retina, they are refered to as
center-surround receptive fields, and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.770
what that means is, that in the positive
ones takes the illumination that's

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.950
from the middle, and they subtract
off the illumination around the back.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.400
The negative ones do the negative in the
middle and subtract, and add, positive.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.150
But basically what they're
doing is they're comparing

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.070
the local illumination to the,

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.550
a little patch of the illumination
to the overall illumination.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.460
So what happens when
things get much brighter?

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.690
Well if it's just getting
brighter over the whole thing,

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.310
not a lot different changes.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.690
So one part of your retina can
be sort of electrically and

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.830
chemically setting its dynamic
range at one place, and

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.320
another part is at another
place simultaneously.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.900
So the part that's looking at
the bright window in the church

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.390
is operating at one place.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.950
The part that's op, that's looking
at the the darker part, it,

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.650
it, it's doing its center-surround
on a darker area, but

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.280
it's looking at those
relative contrasts.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.790
This plot here is just a notion of what
a center-surround field looks like.
