RYAN LOREN: All
right, everybody.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.220
Please welcome Kimberly Nichole.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.570
RYAN LOREN: Kimberly, I am
so happy to have you here.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.410
You've performed here,
believe it or not,

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.720
once before, everybody.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.636
KIMBERLY NICHOLE: Yes.

00:00:17.636 --> 00:00:19.910
RYAN LOREN: But this time,
we're doing it right.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.500
So I can't wait for everybody
to hear you sing and perform.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.970
So thanks for being here.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.900
I couldn't have imagined a
celebration of Black Music

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.252
Month without you, and
that's what we're here to do.

00:00:31.252 --> 00:00:32.668
KIMBERLY NICHOLE:
Thank you, Ryan.

00:00:32.668 --> 00:00:34.470
RYAN LOREN: So it's
going to be incredible.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.980
So your style is very, to me,
diverse, eclectic, and raw.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.690
So tell us, where are you from?

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.550
Where did you come from?

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.700
KIMBERLY NICHOLE: I was born and
raised in Seattle, Washington.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.230
And I grew up listening
the music my parents played

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.370
when I was a child, which was
majority gospel music and soul

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.270
music.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.480
But I was also really
into the music of Seattle,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.110
which was grunge and rock.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.400
So those have all played
into who I am today.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.150
RYAN LOREN: Great.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.517
So how would you
describe your style?

00:01:10.517 --> 00:01:12.058
KIMBERLY NICHOLE:
The rock ballerina.

00:01:12.058 --> 00:01:14.010
[CHEERS]

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.962
[LIP SMACK]

00:01:15.962 --> 00:01:19.787
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:19.787 --> 00:01:20.620
RYAN LOREN: Awesome.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.900
More specifically, were
there one or two singers

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.776
you could tell us who did
inspire you growing up?

00:01:29.776 --> 00:01:33.300
KIMBERLY NICHOLE:
Oh my goodness.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.737
I loved the Clark
Sisters when I was a kid.

00:01:36.737 --> 00:01:37.570
I really loved them.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.580
My mom, she really--
I think my mom kind of

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.006
catered my voice towards
those that I resembled.

00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:46.380
So she really
encouraged me a lot

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.880
of times to listen to,
like, Gladys Knight

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.100
and, even as I got older, Sade.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.570
But currently, those
who really inspire me

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.290
are more so, like, the Doors,
Jim Morrison, Sister Rosetta

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.530
Tharpe.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.941
And Outkast has really
been inspiring me lately.

00:02:00.941 --> 00:02:01.690
RYAN LOREN: Great.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.080
KIMBERLY NICHOLE: So it's
changed as I've gotten older.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.788
RYAN LOREN: Cool.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.009
Your voice is your voice.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.350
I don't know how to describe it.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.655
But it's powerful, I would say.

00:02:13.655 --> 00:02:15.030
How do you take
care of yourself?

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.070
How do you take
care of your voice?

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.050
KIMBERLY NICHOLE: I sleep a lot.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.460
Yes, anyone that knows me
knows I'm big on sleeping.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.606
So I take naps.

00:02:25.606 --> 00:02:27.084
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:27.084 --> 00:02:28.750
KIMBERLY NICHOLE: I
do a lot of napping.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.554
And I like to juice, and I
do a lot of ginger as well.

00:02:32.554 --> 00:02:33.720
RYAN LOREN: Ginger is great.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.636
KIMBERLY NICHOLE: Yes.

00:02:34.636 --> 00:02:36.260
RYAN LOREN: What do you juice?

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.640
KIMBERLY NICHOLE: Greens.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.306
RYAN LOREN: Yes.

00:02:37.306 --> 00:02:42.340
KIMBERLY NICHOLE: Kale,
spinach, apples, Gala apples.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.610
KIMBERLY NICHOLE:
Ginger, a lot of ginger.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.610
RYAN LOREN: Carrots?

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.250
KIMBERLY NICHOLE:
And carrots, yes.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.130
That's my favorite juice.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.838
RYAN LOREN: Yeah.

00:02:50.838 --> 00:02:53.080
Have you ever been
on a juice cleanse?

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.160
KIMBERLY NICHOLE: I've
tried, but the chicken

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.822
keeps calling me.

00:02:57.822 --> 00:02:58.814
RYAN LOREN: Yeah.

00:02:58.814 --> 00:03:02.286
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:02.286 --> 00:03:03.774
AUDIENCE: You speak the truth!

00:03:03.774 --> 00:03:04.766
KIMBERLY NICHOLE: Yes!

00:03:04.766 --> 00:03:06.750
Honey, I like to eat!

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.740
RYAN LOREN: Cool.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.600
Great.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.450
Well, that's wonderful.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.190
So can you tell us one
thing maybe outside of music

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.927
and juicing that you're
passionate about?

00:03:17.927 --> 00:03:19.260
KIMBERLY NICHOLE: I love my dog.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.125
I have a puppy.

00:03:20.125 --> 00:03:20.750
RYAN LOREN: OK.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.330
KIMBERLY NICHOLE:
Her name is Hendrix.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.910
RYAN LOREN: Hendrix.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.285
KIMBERLY NICHOLE:
That's my baby.

00:03:24.285 --> 00:03:27.661
I was in LA for three days,
and I missed her so much.

00:03:27.661 --> 00:03:29.660
That's my partner in
crime, and next week, we're

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.701
going to home to Seattle.

00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:31.470
So that's my baby.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.840
RYAN LOREN: Great.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.460
She's accompanying you?

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.780
KIMBERLY NICHOLE:
Yes, that's my girl.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.150
RYAN LOREN: Great.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.859
What kind of dog?

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.275
KIMBERLY NICHOLE:
She's a Shorkie.

00:03:36.275 --> 00:03:37.649
She's a Shih Tzu and Yorkie mix.

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:38.190
She's a mutt.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.220
RYAN LOREN: I love
the fact that I now

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.490
know that word, "Shorkie."

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.940
RYAN LOREN: All right, cool.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.419
So tell us more about your
music and what's coming up.

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.460
KIMBERLY NICHOLE: Well,
I'm working on new music.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.840
I'm so excited about it.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.070
I'm going to do two
new songs here today

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.430
during the performance piece.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.280
I'm excited about
how I'm evolving,

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.280
what it's sounding like.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.700
It's really inspired largely
from my childhood in Seattle.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.085
So it's straight
ahead rock music.

00:04:11.085 --> 00:04:13.000
Like there's no
sugar coating it.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.709
It's raw, it's
nasty, and it's rock.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:18.459
RYAN LOREN: Great.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.320
When did you move to New York?

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.720
And you've been here
for a little while.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.360
What is advice you give to
people who have just got here

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.430
who are trying to do
what you're trying to do?

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.980
KIMBERLY NICHOLE:
I came here in '08.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.430
I think New York, you
have to be very focused.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.060
You have to have a
drive in you, and you

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.620
have to be persistent
and just strong-headed

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.700
and have a strong will.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.870
Because it can
really eat you up.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.730
I've had moments where
I'm like, I can't.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.540
Jesus, please Lord,
just help me out.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.564
But if you believe in what
you've come here to accomplish,

00:04:54.564 --> 00:04:55.480
you can accomplish it.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.030
But you can't do
it without having

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.390
drive and hard work behind it.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.140
RYAN LOREN: Great.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.300
KIMBERLY NICHOLE: Yes.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.592
RYAN LOREN: Well, I know you
do have those things based

00:05:03.592 --> 00:05:05.008
on knowing you for
a little while.

00:05:05.008 --> 00:05:06.890
So I'm really happy
to have you here.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:07.040
KIMBERLY NICHOLE: Thank you.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.801
RYAN LOREN: I know great things
are in store, and best of luck

00:05:09.801 --> 00:05:10.300
to you.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.000
And I'm looking forward
to the performance.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.416
KIMBERLY NICHOLE:
Thank you, Ryan.

00:05:13.416 --> 00:05:14.230
Thank you, guys.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.864
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:14.864 --> 00:05:16.030
KIMBERLY NICHOLE: Thank you.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.480
Y'all have a good one.
