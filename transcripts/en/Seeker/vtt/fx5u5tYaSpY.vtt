00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.340
Plants and animals are easy to tell apart.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.330
This is a plant and this is an animal -- but
THIS is BOTH!

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.650
Hey animals and nearby listening plants, Trace
here for DNews, thanks for tuning in!

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.339
If you look back to middle school science,
you might remember Kingdom, Phylum, Class,

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.239
Order, Family, Genus, Species.

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.369
Easy to remember because, Kids Playing Chicken
on Freeways Get Smashed.

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.270
Kingdom has five groups, Monera, Protista,
Fungi, Plante, Animalia, but it was invented

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.410
by humans, so sometimes there are exceptions
to every rule.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.610
To be a plant, an organism has to make it's
own food and have cell walls.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.080
To be an animal you acquire nutrients by ingestion
and don't have cell walls.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.890
There's more to it, but that's the basic distinction.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.630
This distinction goes even deeper.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.340
As biologists have looked into the genes that
make up the DNA of our planet's organisms,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.930
classification has gotten... *eeeahhhhh* let's
just say fuzzy.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.780
In this case, two studies published in the
journal Genome Research describe the way microRNA

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.909
affects plants and animals differently.

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.429
Animals, like humans, have microRNA which
float around the cell nucleus activating and

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:12.659
deactivating genes.

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:20.490
It's a little technical on HOW, but in essence:
animal microRNA affects how DNA and RNA express

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.490
genes.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.139
This helps organisms adapt to changing diets,
environmental stimuli and so on.

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:29.959
Though, while animal microRNA affects lots
of different gene expressions, plant RNA is

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:31.619
far more specific.

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.530
The sea anemone is classified as an animal,
because its DNA is similar to a vertebrate,

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.909
it gathers food and does not have a cell wall,
but its microRNA behaves as a plant!

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.189
Go home nature, you're drunk.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.189
This isn't the only Plantimal out there that
gives the biologists a nerdgasm // Plantimal!

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.280
It's a thing now, I want all the credits // A
2007 study from University Of Kalmar in Sweden

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.810
found some species of algae which were plantimals
... they dubbed them mixotrophs because they

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.400
can produce energy from sunlight, like a plant,
but they EAT other things, like an ANIMAL!

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.410
Another is the Mesodinium chamaeleon which
sounds like a fancy lizard, but it's actually

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.860
a single-celled organism.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.950
It EATS OTHER THINGS -- so animal -- but it
can use the things it's eaten and live off

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.220
THEIR photosynthesis while it's inside its
body -- until the prey is digested.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.240
Presumably that's why it's called a chameleon,
because depending on whether it's eaten green

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.570
or red algae it will change color.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.040
The process of eating something and using
it, evolved 2 BILLION years ago.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.960
It's called endosymbiosis.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.200
When the first single celled animals ate bacterium,
the prey cell became part of the predator

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.740
cell -- this is how we got mitochondria!

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.410
Many single-celled organisms flirt with the
animal-plant boundary line depending on their

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.640
needs and adaptations... biologists are total
frenemies with them...

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.640
remember frenemies?

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.640
Haha, so dumb.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.900
The sea anemone is significant, because it's
multi-cellular, and the gene regulation is

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.960
similar to that of a fruit fly, which means
there's likely a common link between human,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.520
fly and sea anemone 600 million years ago.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.740
I think maybe plants and animals are part
of a thinner line... like fruits and vegetables...

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.740
