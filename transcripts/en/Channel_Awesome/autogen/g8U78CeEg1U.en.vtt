00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340
Note: You SHOULD watch the review, you'll be in for a treat :)

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:03.840
Wow!

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.860
This guy is such an obvious, yet evil liar, he should probably get a job at The White House.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.060
The other dogs died, and I was the only one left, PERIOD!

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.660
Also, the race I was a part of, had the largest audience to ever witness a dog sled race, PERIOD!

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.320
But, sir, we have eyes...

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.420
YOUR EYES ARE WRONG! It's an alternative bark

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.520
But Melisa...

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.000
STOP CALLING ME THAT!

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.020
But seriously, you should go watch the review itself if you haven't already :)
