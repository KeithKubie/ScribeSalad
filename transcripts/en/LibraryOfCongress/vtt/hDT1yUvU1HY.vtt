to view this Hispanic

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.130
Although its primary emphasis
has always been the acquisition

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.360
of current materials and
government documents,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.170
the Hispanic division has also
acquired a rich collection

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.920
of rare items.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.100
The division has been instrumental
in acquiring significant gifts

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.950
of manuscripts, music scores,
posters, photographs and films.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.680
It has developed special
use of materials

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.790
such as collecting folk
music from San Antonio,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.180

Which is currently and
gradually being digitized

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.500
for wider public access.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.280
The Library of Congress houses
13.5 million items related

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.440
to the Luso-Hispanic world.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.150
Of these 13.5 million items 3.2
million are books and serials.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.630
The staff of the Hispanic reading
room oversees these materials,

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.670

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.230
[ Applause ]

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.720
&gt;&gt; Maria Molina Alvarez
de Toledo: Thank you,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.660
so I'm the cultural counsellor,
I'm head of the cultural office.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.550
We have a cultural center
in 16th Street by the way

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.400
and I would be happy
to host you there.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.260
We are in charge of the cultural
promotion of Spanish culture

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.300
and all kinds of exchanges,
different culture and arts.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.480
And to fulfill that mission we have
created a program called Spain Arts

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.780
and Culture.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.970
Who aims to bring quality shows,
quality events and all kinds

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.890
of authors, artists and performers.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.490
From very renown to less
renowned emerging young artists.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.040
Well, I'd like to first thank the
Hispanic division for inviting me

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.530
and for organizing this event,
for being such a valuable partner,

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.850
for us, for other Spanish speaking
countries and also Portuguese

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.720
because you are really important
to us for your collection

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.300
and for all you do, thank you.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.240
I wish to congratulate
the author and his team,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.510
which I think they
are heroes as well

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.260
for producing that wonderful work.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.250
I'm eager to read it, to
share it with the embassy

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.590
and we're certainly proud of you.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.730
And of course Catalonia's
contribution to the arts

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.170
of culture of Spain and worldwide.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.100
The imprint they have left all
over the world, not only Catalonia

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.980
but I understand other
Catalan speaking regions

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.370
which are referred to
in the book, I guess.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.520
So we're proud of being diverse in
Spain, of being rich and varied,

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.750
having different identities and
particularly we're very proud

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.480
of Catalonia's contribution.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.390 position:56%
Which has always been very important

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.230
because it's been a beacon
of our arts and culture.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.180
Traditionally, historically
and also currently now a days.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.340 position:56%
For sure it's thrived in many
traditions that you know of customs,

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.390
celebrations but not only, it's
always been at the vanguard

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.120
of contemporary art of
architectural design.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.820
It's a literary hub, it's
the mecca still in Spain

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.170
for the publishing world in Spanish
and for the Spanish speaking world.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.390
And it's still producing very
interesting and innovative ideas

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.900
and festivals such --
I'd like to mention some.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.110
That I look at like [inaudible]
or some other festival

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.960
but there are many others
with which we like to work

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.920
and they're very important
world-wide.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.640
Our embassy's focused on of
course fostering connections

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.020
between the U.S. and
Spain and Catalonia.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.240
Of course they have a very
big role to play and we would

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.760
like to continue helping
that, enhancing that.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.220 position:56%
So thank you very much and thank you

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.510
for inviting me to
talk as well, enjoy.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:03.630
[ Applause ]

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.930
&gt;&gt; Carlos Olave: And now we have
Dr. Juan Perez, who will speak

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.510 position:56%
about the Hispanic collections, he
is our Spanish Reference specialist.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:21.790
[ Applause ]

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:27.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juan Perez: The Library of
Congress possesses a rich collection

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:34.730 position:56%
of items from Spain including books,
maps, newspapers, manuscripts,

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.930
photographs and other items.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:46.050
Examples, include the first
edition of the Quixote 1605,

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.040
the book of Privileges of
Christopher Columbus 1502,

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:56.340
the first Hispanic language
dictionary from 1611.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.860
We may very well have
the best collection

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.640
about the Spanish Civil
War outside of Spain

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:09.260
and the includes 123
original posters.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:18.360
Some of them actually is
some were by the government

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.540
and others by the rebel side.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:29.430
Many of those posters were
printed by the general [inaudible].

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:34.180
From that period of the Civil
War I always like to mention

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:41.710
that we have a very special book or
very special poem by Pablo Neruda

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:48.280
which he dedicated to Spain,
it's called Espana en el Corazon.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:54.710
And it was published in Girona
in 1938 by the [inaudible]

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:59.090
and the peculiarity
of the poem not only

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.310
because it's such a beautiful poem.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:06.340
But also what makes it peculiar
is the fact that the material

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:13.120
that was used to produce the paper
came from the uniforms or shirts

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.480
of republican soldiers who
had died around the area

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.850
in Girona and other places.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:27.090
There are only two or three copies
now available and we have one

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:31.910
of those copies of course
is under lock and key.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:35.720
That region is [inaudible] of the
[inaudible] holdings is reflected

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:41.450
in our variety of the
Catalonia holdings.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:45.750
For example we have books on
or by [inaudible] Pablo Casals

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.280
and they represent maybe
almost 2,000 volumes.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:57.020
And for Pablo Casals we
also have lots of video

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.090
and film of his concerts.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.110
Many of them edited

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:06.530
by the [inaudible] Pablo
Casals from Puerto Rico.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:10.790
But we also have more contemporary
writers like [inaudible]

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:18.510
and we even have 16th and
17th century editions of works

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:24.150 position:56%
by Ramon Lu [phonetic] even one from
the 16th century which is attributed

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:31.470
to him but there are now some
doubts as to whether that work

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:36.520 position:56%
of archemie [phonetic] is truly his.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:42.030
And those two works come,
they're both in the same volume

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:49.810
and I think they date from 1541
or something, I'm not quite sure.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:58.420
But also we have more
contemporary writers as an example,

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.720
[inaudible] or [inaudible].

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.530
The library even has
an Italian translation

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:08.660
of [inaudible] from 1538.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:13.290
For history just searching
under Catalonian history it's

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:21.850
over 500 volumes, I can
mention [inaudible] from 1678

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:26.470
to the more contemporary
[inaudible] published in 2015.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:34.580 position:56%
Early description of early Catalonia
could be for example geographical

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.180
and historical account of the
[inaudible] Park of Catalonia

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:41.890
and [inaudible] of Barcelona
published in London in 1705.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:46.710
Again to the more contemporary
Barcelona [inaudible] published

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.170
in 2015 by [inaudible].

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:56.410
We also have items or books
relating to law and we have several

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:59.660
which are really again
quite outstanding

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:04.050
and again also under lock and key.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:08.280
Like for example, [inaudible]
book published in 1618

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:16.430
and even a 1621 edition by the
15th century Catalan jurist Tomas

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:17.730
Mirez [phonetic].

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:27.260
His most famous work, we
have this 1621 edition.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:31.610
And just by closing I,
you know, because we have

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:37.990
so many different items
I was mentioning

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:45.770
to our guest just before we came
in that we may have 12 volumes

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.900
of the [inaudible] the famous
comic book by Victor Mora

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:53.190
who just passed away
last year in Barcelona.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:57.170
So the book which is
being presented today

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:03.290 position:56%
to the library Outstanding Catalan
Contributions will enhance even more

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:07.440

Spanish materials in general

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.420

of all thank you very much

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.720
for your kind invitation
we are very, very,

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.510
very pleased to offer this book
to the Library of the Congress

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:05.400
of United States for us it is key
to have this book in this finest

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.330
and extraordinary library
all over the world.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:16.390
Then thank you very much to
the direction of the library,

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:20.670
thank you to the representation of
the Spanish Embassy to come here

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:24.650
with us and all of you, thank you.

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:29.820
Well, I have to talk a little
bit about the book, no.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:36.530
The book is a heavy book, first of
all it's a heavy book it weighs,

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:43.810
I know it in kilos, it weighs 2.6
kilos then it's quite significant 2

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:48.110
times 4 and to send by mail
is a little bit difficult.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:53.250
Well, this book starts to, the idea

00:15:53.250 --> 00:16:03.300 position:56%
to do this book it start [inaudible]
2003 but I have been engaged

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:07.210
with many other issues
by putting [inaudible].

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:13.810
The book stops and we
start finally in 2008

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:18.320
and we finish the book in 2014.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.340 position:56%
Basically because we like to
present the book the Catalan version

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.500
of the book considering
the city centuries

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:32.890
after for us was a defeat of 1714.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:35.810
Then we celebrate, Catalan used

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.970
to celebrate the defeat
not the [inaudible].

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:46.670
Because we never win nothing
then we used to celebrate defeat.

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:53.110
Well, then in fact a way
[inaudible] present the book just

00:16:53.110 --> 00:17:02.350
in December 2014 in the premises
of the Catalan government.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:08.030
And perhaps before to continue my
presentation you can see is more

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.380
video, only last 5 minutes

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:15.350
and perhaps you would have a
more rough idea of the content

00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:17.840
of the book and then
I will continue.

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.510
I think they said if I push here.

&gt;&gt; The book about outstanding
Catalan contributions is an

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:46.680
initiative of the Occitano
Catalonian Foundation.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.540
Work on the book began in 2009
instigated by the promotional team

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.280
which included the late
Joanne Theodore [phonetic].

00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:04.240
The book of outstanding Catalan
contributions is another way

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.760
of interpreting the
history of a people

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.900
with the contributions it has made.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.500
Which have had an impact
across Europe and the world.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:19.040
The book is divided
into three parts.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:25.230
A brief summary of the
history of Catalonia,

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:29.870
descriptions of the
contributions chosen and opinions

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:34.370
of leading figures about
the future of Catalonia.

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:40.670
The book has 744 pages and
almost 1,000 illustrations.

It is published by editorial

Pablo Casals, the United Nations

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:13.240
on the 24th of October 1971.

But what has been Catalonia,

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:25.670
Catalonia has been the
greatest nation in the world.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:30.820
I tell you, I will tell you why,

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:37.880
Catalonia has had the first
[inaudible] much before England.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:47.760
Catalonia since the beginning
of the United Nations.

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:53.660
&gt;&gt; The purpose of the
book is two-fold,

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:57.690
to show that Catalonia's
ability to contribute

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:01.810
in all areas makes it
important to European nation.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:07.730
And to increase self-esteem and
spread the word around the world

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:10.010
that the Catalan people
are an open people.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:14.040
Capable of projecting
themselves through innovation

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.980
and action of universal reach.

to humanity is inextricably linked

to the [inaudible] of its history.

History is the thread which
follows the trajectory of the people

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:16.610
and guides it toward the future.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:20.950
The contributions of previous
generations underpin those

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:27.510
and those to come.

to occupy it's rightful place
in Europe and the world.

[ Music ]

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:53.840
&gt;&gt; Joan Amoros: Well, the book
here you have rough explanation

00:22:53.840 --> 00:23:00.050
of the book and of course
one main aim of the book is

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:04.260
to get aware the Catalan people
regarding the contributions

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:08.640
that you can make because
unfortunately our history

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:13.680 position:56%
in many occasions has been
forbidden, then it's very difficult,

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:17.620
not difficult but during the
French [inaudible] persecution

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:21.810
to the Catalan culture, the Catalan
language, etcetera, etcetera.

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:27.450
Many people doesn't know
which Catalan people has made.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:31.450 position:56%
So the general problems of humanity.

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:37.450
Then we this was the first idea
and the second idea basically was

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:42.620
to get word all over the
world what we have made.

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.840
That has been split out

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:49.270
and has [inaudible]
internationally but everywhere.

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:51.990
This is the topic of the book

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:58.810
and as you have seen you can
make four different impressions,

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:03.590
one in Catalan that
have been presented

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:07.870
in [inaudible] government
at the end of 2014.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:12.840
And by the end of 2015 we present

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:18.610
in the institute [inaudible] the
other version, the Spanish version,

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:21.080
the French version and
the English version.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:26.150 position:56%
And now what we are doing is to
present the book all over Catalonia,

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:29.060
all over Europe and
all over the world.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:34.720
And this is what we are doing
at the moment and the book

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:38.660
as you have seen there
is three parts one

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:43.100
that basically makes a short
explanation only 23 pages.

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:48.110
Of our history in other
that the reader could know

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:52.450
in which context has been made
the contribution in which area

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.300 position:56%
because we start in the middle ages,

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:58.110
there are contributions
from the 10th century.

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:01.690
Catalonia is a very
old nation in Europe.

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:07.880
And after this first
part of the book

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:13.070
as I said there's only [inaudible]
pages following this start the

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:17.740
explanation contribution
by contribution

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.350
from the middle ages till now.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:25.880
There are now positive
contributions that we have made.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:31.130
I have to say that the
Occitano Catalonian Foundation,

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:33.710
it's not a foundation.

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:41.000
It is a foundation that
has been created in 1990

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.720 position:56%
and basically our aim is to produce,

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.000
we have made [inaudible]
regarding Catalan [inaudible]

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:57.450
and we have made [inaudible]
important congresses in 2000

00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:00.870
and first and we have
made several publications

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:04.340
and now we can make
this publication.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:08.710
This is a nonprofit association.

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:15.910 position:56%
Then we don't have money with this
foundation and I have to say as well

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:19.840
that all the authors of the book
we have made this [inaudible].

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.510
And something else that
I think is important is

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:25.770
that we have made this book
without any [inaudible].

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:29.850 position:56%
And in the second part of the book
there is a description chronological

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:31.340
order [inaudible] all the
different contributions.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:36.610
And I have to say that
we have contributions

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:38.990
in all fields of activity.

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:42.820
If you look at the top of the
content by topics you will see

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:45.270
that we have contributions in
[inaudible], in philosophy,

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:48.940
[inaudible] in cuisine
and sometimes [inaudible].

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:56.180
In all fields, you'll see that it's
really contributions in all fields.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:59.530
And we discover because
when we start

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:06.640
to prepare this book we said well,
we'll talk about 100 contributions,

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.540
100 of [inaudible] contributions.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:16.340
But we start to and we saw that
we are passing 100 contributions.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:21.760 position:56%
Well, we'll name the book 150
contributions but still we overpass.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:28.630
And finally the problem is that
we would like to present the book

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:35.670
in 2014 and then we have to
stop and we stopped at 223

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.320
that there's a figure that's
it's a little bit [inaudible]

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.620
that we stop here.

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:43.960
But I have to say that in fact
there are about 260 or even more

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:48.690
because in many cases we
made group of contributions

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:50.540
in a single contribution.

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.770
For instance [inaudible]
we have joined together

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:56.500
and then are there several
hundred contributions.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:00.260
Then if you are [inaudible]
we can reach 260 [inaudible]

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:05.100
in New York [inaudible] I will
not pronounce very good in English

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.710
because Catalan is [inaudible].

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:10.250
But in [inaudible] why you have
not put [inaudible] he was a hero

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:15.250
in the [inaudible] and hero of the
Civil War in the United States.

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:18.000
Well, we forgot in the second
edition [inaudible] then we have

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.520
to say that this book [inaudible]
second edition will be good

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.930
but this is what I can say to you.

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:29.650
What is important is to say
that at the end of the book,

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:33.980
we have asked the opinion of many
stakeholders in Catalonia today.

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.730
From the President of [inaudible]
that is our emblematic bond

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:40.830
in Catalonia to [inaudible] for us
is also an emblematic [inaudible].

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:46.700
Then we have there the
President of the Union,

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:51.330
sorry the general secretaries
of unions,

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:53.500 position:56%
Presidents of employee associations,

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.700
[inaudible] most important
[inaudible] sales,

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.300
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:01.340 position:56%
Directors of universities, everybody
we ask what is your opinion

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.140
regarding this process
of contribution.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:08.490
Because you have to take into
account that for instance

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:17.940 position:56%
in 1930 Catalonia only had 2 million
people, now days we have 7.5.

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:21.580
That is very funny
to know that in fact

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.510 position:56%
if we look how many people is really

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.990
with all the ancestors
from Catalonia.

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.960
[inaudible] only people came
from other part of Spain,

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:36.430 position:56%
from in Barcelona, I think that they
are allowed 400 different languages.

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:40.240
We have people from
everywhere in the world.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:47.260
And what is very interesting to
know is that there is no problem.

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.490
The [inaudible] is
fantastic in Catalonia

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:51.570
and we are very proud of this.

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:56.820
Catalonia is a melting pot
like it is in the United States

00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:02.170
that we have no problems
fortunately,

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:06.340
that for instance you can
see in the shores of London,

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:12.000
on the shores of Paris, we
don't have those problems.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.470 position:56%
There is very, very good
understanding between all the people

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:21.270
and I think that these are one of
our strong positions at the moment.

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:26.030 position:56%
It is very complicated for Catalonia
because as you know somebody would

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:27.430
like to get [inaudible]
some are not.

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:33.880
You know what will happen finally
but in fact perhaps now days

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.830
in the newspapers everywhere,

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:40.130
we've seen it Catalonia
this, Catalonia that.

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:43.890
Well, here you can see a
book, not a political book.

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:50.620
And perhaps through this book you
can get aware of what is Catalonia,

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:56.330
at least what Catalonia
has to contribute.

00:30:56.330 --> 00:31:02.610
To the general progress of the
different countries particularly

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:05.620
in Europe but also
in the United States.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:13.750 position:56%
Here in this folder you can find the
least of the contributions related

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:18.340
with the United States and
there are four pages of --

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.610
I have not counted [inaudible]
probably close to 100

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:26.980 position:56%
of this contributions that have a
relationship with the United States.

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:31.520
From the Romanesque art because
in the course there are zero

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:35.850
in New York, there are a lot
of Catalan Romanesque art here

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.180
in this [inaudible] but we
have for instance [inaudible]

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:41.520 position:56%
that as you know painters that
paints the walls of the [inaudible].

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:45.780
The main hall in New
York or I don't know

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.420
for instance regarding the
[inaudible] by chronological order

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:52.060
for instance we have
now a lot of key people.

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:57.100
That is working in the United
States in many important issues.

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:03.530
And one of them for instance is
[inaudible] Oncology Division

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:08.110
in the Harvard University, Medical
Director [inaudible] Hospital

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:13.440 position:56%
in New York and President of the
American Association of [inaudible].

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.970
We have people [inaudible]
in Catalonia today

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.360
in the United States [inaudible].

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:22.380
Heart disease, etcetera, etcetera
and help people everywhere

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:28.450
and when we made the book we
find I have explained it to some

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:30.440
of you issues that we didn't know.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:34.900
And one of them came
from the NASA you know,

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:42.110
in the United States we saw that
in Alabama, NASA has one museum

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:50.320
in which there is a permanent
[inaudible] is a permanent

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:55.670
explanation regarding [inaudible]
because he was really the inventor

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:58.620
of the jet engine in 1917.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:05.050
1917 it's incredible and
that he test successfully.

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:11.630
And [inaudible] but finally
he was engaged in other issues

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:19.290
to create a new factory for
[inaudible] etcetera, etcetera

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:22.750
and then that is recognized is one

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.510
of the [inaudible] of
this kind of engines.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:30.020
Well, in all fields there
are a lot of connections

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:35.330
with the United States and
we think that it is important

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:41.460
to increase the good
relationship between Catalonia

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:46.130
and the United States
in many issues.

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:51.010
Many people from United
States came now to Catalonia,

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:54.590
to visit Catalonia, we
are very proud of this

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:59.180
if you know we have one of the
most important cruises port

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:02.850
in Europe is Barcelona, then
we have a lot of visitors

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:04.600
from the United States
and the country.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:08.540
We have a lot of Catalonians
that come here

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:13.110
to visit this fantastic nation.

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:21.690
Thank you very much for your
hospitality and of course we are

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:28.550
at your disposal for any
kind of this information.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:31.660

moment we can make the official

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.820
&gt;&gt; Joan Amoros: More
than [inaudible].

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:52.740
&gt;&gt; Angela Kinney: I don't
know how I can handle this.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:57.740
&gt;&gt; Joan Amoros: And here is this
folder as I explained to you

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:05.930

regarding the [inaudible].

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:09.820

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:13.950

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:19.500

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:44.310
&gt;&gt; Angela Kinney: Thank
you so much Mr. Amoros

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:46.570
for this wonderful publication.

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:51.410
Mr. Amoros actually took me
aside before this special program

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:56.070
to show me this publication both
the English and the Catalan version

00:37:56.070 --> 00:38:00.210
and we're just extremely honored
that you thought of the Library

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:04.360
of Congress when you
were looking for a place

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:08.970
for this wonderful
publication to reside.

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:14.130
And my division, the African-Latin
American western European division

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:18.590
is actually in charge of
the cataloging as well

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:23.250
as the acquisition of materials
from the Iberian Peninsula.

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:27.820
So we are just thrilled to
receive this gift from you,

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:33.960 position:56%
we know it's a labor of love of
many years and we're just very proud

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.840
to have it in the library's
collection.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:40.710
So thank you so much for thinking
of us when making this donation.

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:46.250
As mentioned before Georgette Dorn,
my colleague, our colleague here

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:49.980
at the Library of Congress couldn't
be present today however Georgette

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:54.330
conveys here best wishes
to you and congratulations

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:59.430
on you getting this publication
in place and thanks you very much

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:03.730
for having donated this publication
to the Library of Congress.

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:09.430
We're just really, really excited
about having it in our collections,

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:15.070
getting it catalogued and having
it exposed to the general public

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:19.340
as a whole through
our online catalogue.

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:24.240
Georgette and I, our division, the
Hispanic division and my division

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:29.170
which we call ALAWE actually our
staff work together to ensure

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:33.370
that the Library's collections
in all formats are filled

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:36.050
with cultural heritage
materials from Spain

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:38.410
and other Hispanic countries.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:43.580
In fact our divisions do a
lot of work in that respect

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:46.200
so that we ensure that the
richness and the history

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:50.660
of the Hispanic culture is
available to scholars world-wide.

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:54.150
Not just from them coming
to the Library of Congress

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:58.960
but actually seeing our collections
through our online catalogue.

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:03.940
So we're looking forward to having
these publications in English

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:07.650
and in Catalan in our catalogue.

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:12.550
The Library has been acquiring
materials in fact from Catalonia

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:15.220
since the 1950's through
various avenues.

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:20.000
We get publications
through purchase, exchange,

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.590
gifts and the deposit we
have a vendor [inaudible]

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:29.850
that actually resides in
and operates in Barcelona.

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:36.500
And the Library actually has
a treaty, a U.S. government

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.380
and Spanish treaty

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:45.570
and intergovernmental international
agreement that dates back to 1959.

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:49.180
That is with the National
Library of Spain.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:53.970
And we acquire publications
from Spain through that treaty.

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:59.180
We also have exchange agreements
with various institutions in Spain

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:05.500 position:56%
and so the library collects in
various formats and in various ways.

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:09.930
As I mentioned before through
various channels from Spain.

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:14.420
So today we're real excited to
have this publication as a gift

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:17.930
to the Library of Congress
and to be able

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:23.710 position:56%
to accept this the Library's current
strategic plan highlights our

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:28.700
intention to fully connect with the
community outside of the library

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:33.230
and both in the U.S. as
well as in other countries.

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:38.110
And so acceptance of this wonderful
gift reinforces the Libraries

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:40.930
mission to enhance it's collections

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:46.440
with remarkable cultural heritage
publications like this one.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:47.830
We're very gratified to you

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:53.930
for having donated this
publication to the library.

00:41:53.930 --> 00:42:00.890 position:56%
And so I would like to express again
my gratitude to you Mr. Amoros,

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:05.540
the President of the foundation
for choosing the library

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:10.360
as the stakeholder, the
placeholder for this publication.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:14.730
We're just really, really
grateful to you for that,

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:16.660
thank you so much for that.

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:19.510
And thank you all for
attending this program.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:30.020
