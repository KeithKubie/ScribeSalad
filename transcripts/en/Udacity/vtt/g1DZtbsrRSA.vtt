00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.585
So this leads us to the question, what is love? We touch on this briefly in the

00:00:04.585 --> 00:00:07.696
lesson on language and thought, when Susan described what are emotional

00:00:07.696 --> 00:00:12.050
feelings returned. Remember she was trying to tell Sofia that she was just

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.625
anxious or nervous about flying, when in fact Sophia's stomach was bothering

00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:20.815
her and she was becoming physically sick. And in that lesson Susan asked what

00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:25.723
is love and how do we describe it? One psychologist by the name of Sternberg,

00:00:25.723 --> 00:00:31.425
developed the triangular theory of love. He had an idea that love was composed

00:00:31.425 --> 00:00:36.560
of three components. They are intimacy, passion, and commitment. And various

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.824
combinations of these three components explain all forms of human love. So let's

00:00:41.824 --> 00:00:46.168
take a closer look at these in a little more detail. Intimacy refers to feeling

00:00:46.168 --> 00:00:51.380
close, connected, and bonded in your loving relationships. Next we have

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.318
passion. Passion refers to the drive that leads to physical attraction,

00:00:56.318 --> 00:01:01.204
romance, and, sexual experiences. And this is accompanied by the physiological

00:01:01.204 --> 00:01:06.693
changes in arousal. And finally, we have commitment. With commitment we're

00:01:06.693 --> 00:01:10.284
talking about both a decision to love someone, and the decision to commit to

00:01:10.284 --> 00:01:15.240
love for the long-term. So for different types of love, these three different

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.371
components are present, but they're present in different amounts. For example,

00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:25.057
with romantic love, we see high levels of intimacy, and passion, but low levels

00:01:25.057 --> 00:01:30.920
of commitment. And here we see companionate love. Which are high levels of

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.026
intimacy and commitment, but low levels of passion. And here we see fatuous

00:01:36.026 --> 00:01:40.058
love, where there's high levels of commitment and passion but low levels of

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:45.380
intimacy. Now if you were to just have passion and no intimacy or commitment,

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.943
you'd see something like lust or infatuation. And if you just had intimacy but

00:01:50.943 --> 00:01:55.363
no commitment or passion, It would just be liking someone, and if you just have

00:01:55.363 --> 00:02:02.560
commitment, but no intimacy, and no passion, this would be empty love. Now if

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.016
all of these types of love were present in equal proportion, Sternberg would

00:02:06.016 --> 00:02:10.681
call this consummate love. So, as I said that any given relationship can have a

00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:15.602
combination of these three components. Some of your life-long friends you're

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:19.276
going to feel commitment with, and intimacy. But not passion. Or your siblings

00:02:19.276 --> 00:02:23.615
and family members would be a mixture of intimacy and commitment. Whereas your

00:02:23.615 --> 00:02:27.941
romantic partners would be intimacy and passion. And for those who have all

00:02:27.941 --> 00:02:31.570
three in the same person, this would be a life-long partner. For example, a

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.050
husband or wife or life partner.
