00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.470
Now I can almost hear you at
home thinking okay dudes.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.640
I got it.
Now what?

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.630
&gt;&gt; One of the first things you should
do is to think on your business model.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.480
What is your profit model, and
how are you going to execute against it?

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.440
A few important questions that
could guide you in the right path.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.920
Would you or someone you know that
represents the target audience

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.180
pay this amount for that service?

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.290
Why?

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.640
Are there any great alternatives
out there that are free?

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.970
What is your expected burn-rate?

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:31.820
How would you control it?

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.630
What is the gross margin?

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.740
What are the net margins?

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.590
How many sales do you need to
make in order to break even?

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.270
What is the worst case scenario for
your business?

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.020
How would you overcome it?

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.490
Lots of question, no?

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.490
Well, it's just a tool to
put us in the right path.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.950
Even if some of these questions
are not applicable to you right now,

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.480
it's a good idea to address
them when you are ready.
