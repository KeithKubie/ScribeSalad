00:00:12.665 --> 00:00:14.288
- What do you remember?

00:00:14.288 --> 00:00:15.288
- I remember

00:00:17.078 --> 00:00:19.081
getting in the bathtub.

00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:21.211
- You do remember
I remember

00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:25.294
not being drunk enough
and then being real drunk.

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:31.507
Alright, you wanna be on national TV?

00:00:31.507 --> 00:00:34.010
Fancy Ray died a month after we shot this

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.393
so I'm curious to see how
disrespectful I was with him

00:00:38.393 --> 00:00:39.255
cause we hated him.

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:40.088
(laughs)

00:00:40.088 --> 00:00:41.238
Can I tell my story?

00:00:41.238 --> 00:00:42.071
(dog barks)

00:00:42.071 --> 00:00:43.550
This is not helpful.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.604
Comedy Central is not
appreciative of your barks.

00:00:46.604 --> 00:00:49.565
(dog growls)

00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:50.576
- He barks a lot.

00:00:50.576 --> 00:00:52.709
- Fancy Ray cost 700 dollars to die.

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:53.542
Crazy.

00:00:54.626 --> 00:00:55.697
Hoo

00:00:55.697 --> 00:00:57.163
- [Derek] How do you feel?

00:00:57.163 --> 00:00:58.374
- Horrible

00:00:58.374 --> 00:00:59.623
And awesome.

00:00:59.623 --> 00:01:00.456
- You got real drunk.

00:01:00.456 --> 00:01:01.289
- Mm hmm.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.866
- [Derek] You wanna
take a cold bath with me

00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.917
after I scrub my balls?

00:01:04.917 --> 00:01:07.508
- I've got at least two bathing suits,

00:01:07.508 --> 00:01:08.341
should I put em on to get in the tub?

00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:09.174
Oh no.

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:13.297
- Were you, like, I'm
gonna try and get Derek

00:01:13.297 --> 00:01:14.834
to get in the bathtub, before?

00:01:14.834 --> 00:01:17.527
- No, not at all, you would think I was

00:01:17.527 --> 00:01:19.011
cause I kept coming on to you.

00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:22.007
- You don't have the balls
to get in the tub with me.

00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:23.863
(laughs)

00:01:23.863 --> 00:01:25.300
- [Dirk] Oh, I do.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.133
(laughs)

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:28.568
- I'm like a creepy old
gay producer in Hollywood

00:01:28.568 --> 00:01:29.903
(laughs)

00:01:29.903 --> 00:01:31.893
like I got a casting couch

00:01:31.893 --> 00:01:33.822
with young actors coming in.

00:01:33.822 --> 00:01:36.569
And this bathing suit
is like my conservative,

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:38.396
public bathing suit.

00:01:38.396 --> 00:01:40.830
So people don't walk up
to me at pools and say,

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.499
"Are you Jay Ryznar?"

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:43.950
- Cause your dick's so long?

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.867
- [Jay] No, well I've got a
very moderately-sized dick.

00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:48.670
- A moderate size?

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.801
- It's a mullet wig
that I thought was more

00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:56.977
reasonable but it's a cartoon
mullet wig unfortunately.

00:01:56.977 --> 00:01:59.176
(laughs)

00:01:59.176 --> 00:02:01.301
- [Dirk] What's cartoon
about it, it looks real?

00:02:01.301 --> 00:02:04.479
- No, it doesn't look
real, it's too bangy.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.592
(both men laugh)

00:02:06.592 --> 00:02:08.480
- I wish it looked more like Bob Seger

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.693
but it looks more like Joe Dirt.

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:11.577
(both men laugh)

00:02:11.577 --> 00:02:13.197
- I like drunk me a lot.

00:02:13.197 --> 00:02:15.322
- I'm thinking about my Dad.

00:02:15.322 --> 00:02:18.322
I'm thinking about my Mom, so proud.

00:02:19.564 --> 00:02:21.781
(both men laugh)

00:02:21.781 --> 00:02:23.331
This episode ain't makin it

00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:26.077
(mumbles)

00:02:26.077 --> 00:02:28.193
- Then you just like rip on me

00:02:28.193 --> 00:02:29.026
(laughs)

00:02:29.026 --> 00:02:31.549
for being a terrible host
cause I won't kiss you.

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.299
(both men laugh)

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:40.260
- Shittiest host of any
Comedy Central show ever.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.220
- Oh, the best would be just
me, just making out with you?

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.437
That would be the best?

00:02:45.437 --> 00:02:47.520
(laughs)
