00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:05.488
Molten aluminium causes ice to explode and molten copper casts an ingot that tunnels down through ice

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.979
We've got a bunch of bullets that we want to melt down to see what happens with molten brass, in clear ice

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.660
Here's the basic idea

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.790
We have a lot of shells we've collected from a gun range that we can melt in our foundry until they're completely liquid

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.889
We know that molten aluminium in a block of ice will make it explode but brass is over three times heavier than aluminium

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.600
And has a much higher melting point. So will it react differently than aluminium or will the ice still explode?

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.780
It amazes me how easily this ice carves this is just a super cheap low-quality knife

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.760
It's not even very sharp because it's the clear ice

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.949
It's uniform thickness and density all the way through so it doesn't have a tendency to crack

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.800
When you hit air pockets or anything because there are no air pockets and I'm carving this out just so there's sort of a funnel

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.280
So that if I am not perfect with my aim the molten brass will still end up right where I want it

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.600
that's so weird

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.080
Okay, it's in.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.940
Ready? Three, Two, One

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.300
Ooh! Volcano

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.760
Oh my gosh

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.520
(laughter)

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.140
It didn't crack, it didn't break, which is what we've seen happen with the aluminium

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:16.260
But it also didn't do what we've seen with the copper at least not entirely. We had a brass volcano

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.120
shooting molten metal up into the air.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.640
Oh and some of it did start tunneling down through

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.780
there was some that didn't spurt out and that just tunneled all the way down through

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.790
We watched it filling up with water

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.390
As it was just being melted by the heat and then once it tunneled all the way through the bottom of ice, all that water

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.130
drained right out. Oh shoot. I think the GoPro got some molten brass on it

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.700
It's still counting. So it's still working

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.280
But yeah the surface of this

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.459
camera has been quite thoroughly melted.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.399
I don't know how well you can see this, but it is still going

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.200
points to GoPro on that one way to go we did go GoPro

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.730
I'm funny

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.430
That is really interesting

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.170
copper tunneled its way down through and brass which is mostly made of copper tunnels its way down through

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.219
neither of them caused the ice to crack or explode the way aluminum does

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.889
I've got a really good eruption of this brass though. That was fantastic.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.950
Well, there is our cast brass ingot

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.769
You can see through the side

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.549
compared to how narrow that little drilled channel was

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.060
It's just like carved its way right down through

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.000
widening it all the way as it went, until it reached the bottom and then just dumped out all the liquid in it

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.029
I don't know if it's just coincidence or not at the bottom of this ingot is still sort of the shape of the drill hole

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.969
When I drill into the ice using this spade bit

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:54.229
it makes one lowest point and then just generally a flatter area and the bottom of our brass ingot that we've just cast is

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.470
almost that same shape. So I'm wondering if that's solidified first and then the heat of the other brass behind it

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.980
just kept it hot enough to keep melting its way down through

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.060
Our brass tunneled really well through a block of ice but it survived you can't have that.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.859
First, i'm going to try taking this heavy chunk of brass and throwing it down at the block of ice as hard as I can and

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.970
If that doesn't work

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.960
I've got Bessie here

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.820
It didn't destroy the whole block but it did crack a lot of it down through there. It's pretty neat.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.820
Bessie's Turn!

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.540
That is so satisfying

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.190
That was really cool. We got a result

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.289
we have not had before, which was seriously just this geyser of the molten metal flying up out of the top

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.848
We've now had different results with aluminum, copper, and brass. What else should we try?

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.630
Guys, that's not all, there's more for you to see that little box up at the top will transport you directly to our last video

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.570
Go watch it!

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.299
The little box at the bottom will show you what YouTube thinks you should be watching next and if you hit this bomb here in the middle

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.639
you'll be subscribed to our channel. So you never miss a video

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.780
don't forget to ring that bell and we will see you in the next one. Talk to you then.
