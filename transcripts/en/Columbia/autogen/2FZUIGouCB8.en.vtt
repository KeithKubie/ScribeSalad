knowledge management are the efforts

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:07.020
knowledge management are the efforts
 

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.810

efforts again still needs to be really

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:10.680
efforts again still needs to be really
 

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:12.320
efforts again still needs to be really
small but again we were still thinking

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:12.330
small but again we were still thinking
 

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:15.020
small but again we were still thinking
about you know how to do more with that

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:15.030

now regarding the library's position
within this myth Sounion we felt that

00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440
within this myth Sounion we felt that
 

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.740
within this myth Sounion we felt that
the library was in a good position as an

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:01.750
the library was in a good position as an
 

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:04.589
the library was in a good position as an
embedded pan institutional unit to

00:46:04.589 --> 00:46:04.599
embedded pan institutional unit to
 

00:46:04.599 --> 00:46:07.020
embedded pan institutional unit to
provide a viable solution and could

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:07.030
provide a viable solution and could
 

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:08.790
provide a viable solution and could
harness the institutional see changes

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800
harness the institutional see changes
 

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.420
harness the institutional see changes
which are putting increased focus on

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:12.430
which are putting increased focus on
 

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:16.349
which are putting increased focus on
collaboration we also knew that we had

00:46:16.349 --> 00:46:16.359
collaboration we also knew that we had
 

00:46:16.359 --> 00:46:19.349
collaboration we also knew that we had
the tools and resources that are at our

00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359
the tools and resources that are at our
 

00:46:19.359 --> 00:46:21.120
the tools and resources that are at our
disposal like the Smithsonian research

and additionally we knew that we were
 

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:29.339
and additionally we knew that we were
well positioned to work with other units

00:46:29.339 --> 00:46:29.349
well positioned to work with other units
 

00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:31.859

outcome of the internship itself
 

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:48.880
outcome of the internship itself
initially we thought we could have a

initially we thought we could have a
 

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:52.090
initially we thought we could have a
data set and tool as the outcome

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:52.100
data set and tool as the outcome
 

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:54.400
data set and tool as the outcome
deliverable but that concept quickly

deliverable but that concept quickly
 

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:57.250
deliverable but that concept quickly
evolved as David and Brian will shortly

to being Elias students um we know about

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:20.720
to being Elias students um we know about
 

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.510
to being Elias students um we know about
knowledge and how to handle knowledge

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:22.520
knowledge and how to handle knowledge
 

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:25.180

sitting down and almost writing a
 

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:34.240
sitting down and almost writing a
literature review on knowledge

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:34.250

the potential to be what has worked and
 

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.600
the potential to be what has worked and
what has not worked at other

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:40.610
what has not worked at other
 

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:46.270
what has not worked at other
institutions yeah so as we explore the

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:46.280
institutions yeah so as we explore the
 

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:50.350
institutions yeah so as we explore the
topic of knowledge management actually I

00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:50.360
topic of knowledge management actually I
 

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.790
topic of knowledge management actually I
think Aaron later on is going to talk

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:51.800
think Aaron later on is going to talk
 

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.000
think Aaron later on is going to talk
about how

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:53.010
about how
 

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:55.070
about how

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.150
disqus knowledge management with people
in the organization you might not want

00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160
in the organization you might not want
 

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.780
in the organization you might not want
to use the term knowledge management

00:48:58.780 --> 00:48:58.790
to use the term knowledge management
 

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:01.520
to use the term knowledge management
excuse me so knowledge management became

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:01.530
excuse me so knowledge management became
 

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:04.790
excuse me so knowledge management became
popular in the 90s as corporate managers

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:04.800
popular in the 90s as corporate managers
 

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:05.870

became concerned about getting
efficiency from their knowledge workers

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:08.100
efficiency from their knowledge workers
 

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:11.270

in their knowledge economy and people
 

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:12.560
in their knowledge economy and people
were concerned with questions like you

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:12.570
were concerned with questions like you
 

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:14.360
were concerned with questions like you
know how do we know what we know and how

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:14.370
know how do we know what we know and how
 

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:15.470
know how do we know what we know and how
can we make sure that everyone knows

00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480
can we make sure that everyone knows
 

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:17.570
can we make sure that everyone knows
what they need to know and so that

00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:17.580
what they need to know and so that
 

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:20.020

billions of dollars were spent on
complex document management systems that

makes us you know valuable and unique is
 

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:31.460
makes us you know valuable and unique is
often what we know that other people

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:31.470
often what we know that other people
 

00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:34.190
often what we know that other people
don't know and so the ideas that people

00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200
don't know and so the ideas that people
 

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:37.100
don't know and so the ideas that people
would you know would file reports and

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:37.110
would you know would file reports and
 

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:39.170
would you know would file reports and
dump knowledge into you know vast

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:39.180
dump knowledge into you know vast
 

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:41.590
dump knowledge into you know vast

everyone would have the same vocabulary

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:43.770
everyone would have the same vocabulary

everyone would have the same vocabulary
and know where everything was going and

actually use this system and then I can

00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:49.020
actually use this system and then I can
 

00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:50.780
actually use this system and then I can
actually put stuff into it and then know

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:50.790
actually put stuff into it and then know
 

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:54.620
actually put stuff into it and then know
what's in it and as librarians know

00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:54.630
what's in it and as librarians know
 

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:55.790

00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:02.440
taxonomy of expertise within the staff
 

00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:06.690
taxonomy of expertise within the staff
directory and we also also took a look

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:06.700
directory and we also also took a look
 

00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:09.420
directory and we also also took a look
at org charts David compiled there's a

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:09.430
at org charts David compiled there's a
 

00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:12.029
at org charts David compiled there's a
massive war chart of how the Smithsonian

00:54:12.029 --> 00:54:12.039
massive war chart of how the Smithsonian
 

00:54:12.039 --> 00:54:14.039
massive war chart of how the Smithsonian
is structured and then it goes down and

00:54:14.039 --> 00:54:14.049
is structured and then it goes down and
 

00:54:14.049 --> 00:54:16.410
is structured and then it goes down and
down and down to the unit level to the

00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:16.420
down and down to the unit level to the
 

00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:19.740
down and down to the unit level to the
subunit level so we there's no real map

00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:19.750
subunit level so we there's no real map
 

00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:21.900
subunit level so we there's no real map
of that there's no real map of the

00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:21.910
of that there's no real map of the
 

00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:23.880
of that there's no real map of the
structure of the institution it was an

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:23.890
structure of the institution it was an
 

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:27.359
structure of the institution it was an
imaginary org chart yeah we made it so

00:54:27.359 --> 00:54:27.369
imaginary org chart yeah we made it so
 

00:54:27.369 --> 00:54:30.089
imaginary org chart yeah we made it so
what we did was we created a sort of

00:54:30.089 --> 00:54:30.099
what we did was we created a sort of
 

00:54:30.099 --> 00:54:31.499
what we did was we created a sort of
interactive one where you could actually

00:54:31.499 --> 00:54:31.509
interactive one where you could actually
 

00:54:31.509 --> 00:54:34.019
interactive one where you could actually
click into each square of each unit and

00:54:34.019 --> 00:54:34.029
click into each square of each unit and
 

00:54:34.029 --> 00:54:36.420
click into each square of each unit and
then click click click down to kind of

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:36.430
then click click click down to kind of
 

00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:39.359
then click click click down to kind of
get up where get a real visual of how

00:54:39.359 --> 00:54:39.369
get up where get a real visual of how
 

00:54:39.369 --> 00:54:41.190
get up where get a real visual of how
the how the organization really really

00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200
the how the organization really really
 

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:44.339
the how the organization really really
functions and who the person you would

00:54:44.339 --> 00:54:44.349
functions and who the person you would
 

00:54:44.349 --> 00:54:46.710
functions and who the person you would
go to is and that's something that we

00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:46.720
go to is and that's something that we
 

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:49.200
go to is and that's something that we
suggested be maintained and updated as

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:49.210

knowledge they measured how important

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:20.530
knowledge they measured how important
 

00:56:20.530 --> 00:56:22.020
knowledge they measured how important
certain knowledge was and how likely it

00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:22.030
certain knowledge was and how likely it
 

00:56:22.030 --> 00:56:24.390
certain knowledge was and how likely it
was that the person who has it is going

00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:24.400
was that the person who has it is going
 

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:27.600
was that the person who has it is going
to is going to retire soon and so they

00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:27.610
to is going to retire soon and so they
 

00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:32.190
to is going to retire soon and so they
figured out how how they could order who

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:32.200
figured out how how they could order who
 

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.830
figured out how how they could order who
to interview and they looked at ways of

00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:34.840
to interview and they looked at ways of
 

00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:38.640
to interview and they looked at ways of
organizing that information so we

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:38.650
organizing that information so we
 

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:40.620
organizing that information so we
interview to retiring knowledge workers

00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:40.630
interview to retiring knowledge workers
 

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:42.240

at some sony and a librarian and a

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:42.250
at some sony and a librarian and a
 

00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:44.730
at some sony and a librarian and a
researcher to test that process and to

00:56:44.730 --> 00:56:44.740
researcher to test that process and to
 

00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:47.100
researcher to test that process and to
try to assess their risk and disco we

00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:47.110
try to assess their risk and disco we
 

00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:49.050
try to assess their risk and disco we
discuss their work processes and we

00:56:49.050 --> 00:56:49.060
discuss their work processes and we
 

00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:51.240
discuss their work processes and we
uncovered several areas for both folks

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:51.250
uncovered several areas for both folks
 

00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:54.120
uncovered several areas for both folks
who were a you know unique knowledge

information that knowledge might be

00:56:59.730 --> 00:56:59.740
information that knowledge might be
 

00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:03.060
information that knowledge might be
retained after after they had left so so

00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:03.070
retained after after they had left so so
 

00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:04.470
retained after after they had left so so
we decided that maybe this was an area

00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480
we decided that maybe this was an area
 

00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:06.990
we decided that maybe this was an area
that Smithsonian should pursue in it but

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:07.000
that Smithsonian should pursue in it but
 

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.070
that Smithsonian should pursue in it but
it's also not something you can just

and then also but it also can be

00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000
and then also but it also can be
 

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.280
and then also but it also can be
formalized more seriously because it's

00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:32.290
formalized more seriously because it's
 

00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:34.980
formalized more seriously because it's
important because people you know you

ideal collaboration being you know two

00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:38.530
ideal collaboration being you know two
 

00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:40.470
ideal collaboration being you know two
partners that provide something that the

00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480
partners that provide something that the
 

00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:43.050
partners that provide something that the
other cannot and i think what the

00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:43.060
other cannot and i think what the
 

00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:44.820
other cannot and i think what the
libraries has to offer is definitely

00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:44.830
libraries has to offer is definitely
 

00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:47.960
libraries has to offer is definitely
something that other partners will

00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:47.970
something that other partners will
 

00:58:47.970 --> 00:58:52.980
something that other partners will
definitely you know benefit from again i

00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:52.990
definitely you know benefit from again i
 

00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:54.089

their research data and projects and I
 

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:46.349
their research data and projects and I
was curious if that's presenting an

01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:46.359
was curious if that's presenting an
 

01:04:46.359 --> 01:04:48.960

no standard way of sharing data he is

01:05:22.890 --> 01:05:22.900
no standard way of sharing data he is
 

01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:24.780
no standard way of sharing data he is
looking at two things right now he's at

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:24.790
looking at two things right now he's at
 

01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:28.290

know how to answer the data management
 

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:34.470
know how to answer the data management
requests and then they are looking at

01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480
requests and then they are looking at
 

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.329
requests and then they are looking at
ways to share data and I believe you

01:05:36.329 --> 01:05:36.339
ways to share data and I believe you
 

01:05:36.339 --> 01:05:38.490

that was actually my first idea was to

01:05:40.859 --> 01:05:40.869
that was actually my first idea was to
 

01:05:40.869 --> 01:05:42.510
that was actually my first idea was to
do something with the repository and

01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:42.520
do something with the repository and
 

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:43.240
do something with the repository and
somehow

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:43.250
somehow
 

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:44.500
somehow
link up with the repository but

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:44.510
link up with the repository but
 

01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:47.950
link up with the repository but
basically in the meetings that we had it

01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:47.960
basically in the meetings that we had it
 

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:52.570
basically in the meetings that we had it
was just too early in in both to it was

01:05:52.570 --> 01:05:52.580
was just too early in in both to it was
 

01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:54.580
was just too early in in both to it was
too early to collaborate in both

01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:54.590
too early to collaborate in both
 

01:05:54.590 --> 01:05:56.680
too early to collaborate in both
initiatives to really get something

01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:56.690
initiatives to really get something
 

01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:58.330
initiatives to really get something
started now so it's it I think that

01:05:58.330 --> 01:05:58.340
started now so it's it I think that
 

01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:00.310
started now so it's it I think that
that's definitely something that's

01:06:00.310 --> 01:06:00.320
