00:00:00.606 --> 00:00:01.518
- [Instructor] The goal of this video

00:00:01.518 --> 00:00:04.180
is to give an overview of some terms

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.221
that you will see as we study government

00:00:07.221 --> 00:00:09.348
and they come out of political philosophy,

00:00:09.348 --> 00:00:10.497
either from the Enlightenment

00:00:10.497 --> 00:00:12.095
or even well before the Enlightenment.

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:15.094
Some of these ideas are
referred to in scripture

00:00:15.094 --> 00:00:17.572
or from the classical Greeks.

00:00:17.572 --> 00:00:20.562
So, let's say we have a little community

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.715
of human beings right over here

00:00:22.715 --> 00:00:26.355
and we talk about this in
our social contract video,

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:28.793
so this right over here is our community

00:00:28.793 --> 00:00:33.401
and so, the first idea
is maybe all individuals

00:00:33.401 --> 00:00:36.009
are endowed with some type

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:39.012
of what we could call natural rights,

00:00:39.012 --> 00:00:41.319
that just by being a human being,

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:43.944
you should have these rights

00:00:43.944 --> 00:00:46.252
and once again, these go
back to the Enlightenment

00:00:46.252 --> 00:00:48.221
or well before the Enlightenment,

00:00:48.221 --> 00:00:50.378
even to something like scripture

00:00:50.378 --> 00:00:52.946
and some notions of natural rights

00:00:52.946 --> 00:00:55.647
might be the right to your life,

00:00:55.647 --> 00:00:57.397
the right to liberty,

00:00:58.335 --> 00:01:01.502
the right to the pursuit of happiness.

00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:04.852
Those should sound very familiar

00:01:04.852 --> 00:01:07.355
and we're going to study these ideas more

00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:08.280
in future videos.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.030
The right to have your
own personal property.

00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:19.357
Well, in theory, if
you don't have any type

00:01:19.357 --> 00:01:21.967
of overarching enforcement body

00:01:21.967 --> 00:01:25.073
or some type of code of conduct,

00:01:25.073 --> 00:01:27.006
some people might also say well,

00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:29.236
I'm gonna give myself some other rights,

00:01:29.236 --> 00:01:31.903
maybe the right to seek revenge,

00:01:33.856 --> 00:01:36.689
maybe the right to imprison folks,

00:01:39.503 --> 00:01:41.451
revenge, I could say also to punish,

00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:43.169
if I think someone has wronged me

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:44.648
or if I even don't like them,

00:01:44.648 --> 00:01:46.444
I could revenge or punishment.

00:01:46.444 --> 00:01:48.611
The right to take property

00:01:52.785 --> 00:01:55.341
and we clearly see a conflict here

00:01:55.341 --> 00:01:57.953
because these things that I'm
writing in this pink color,

00:01:57.953 --> 00:02:00.613
if I assume to have these rights,

00:02:00.613 --> 00:02:02.832
that would allow me to infringe

00:02:02.832 --> 00:02:05.911
on other people's natural rights

00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:08.493
and so, the idea behind social contract

00:02:08.493 --> 00:02:10.867
is well, what if we as a society

00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:14.115
we decide to give up these rights

00:02:14.115 --> 00:02:15.542
as an individual

00:02:15.542 --> 00:02:20.252
and we give them to something
we call a government,

00:02:20.252 --> 00:02:22.402
so we'll give these rights

00:02:22.402 --> 00:02:23.997
to a government

00:02:23.997 --> 00:02:27.949
and in exchange, the
government should protect

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:29.325
my other rights,

00:02:29.325 --> 00:02:30.426
not only these natural rights

00:02:30.426 --> 00:02:31.928
but maybe I have other rights

00:02:31.928 --> 00:02:34.746
that I will expect my
government to protect

00:02:34.746 --> 00:02:37.045
and that notion is what we talked about

00:02:37.045 --> 00:02:38.437
in the social contract video

00:02:38.437 --> 00:02:41.086
as well, the social contract

00:02:41.086 --> 00:02:42.887
which is a nice term to know.

00:02:42.887 --> 00:02:44.204
We're giving up rights to the government

00:02:44.204 --> 00:02:46.840
in exchange for the
government doing things for us

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.804
but that still leaves a very big question.

00:02:49.804 --> 00:02:52.625
What type of government do we have?

00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:54.005
Even in that social contract video,

00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:55.294
people said well, maybe we don't need

00:02:55.294 --> 00:02:56.506
a full government,

00:02:56.506 --> 00:02:58.688
maybe just all of us can agree

00:02:58.688 --> 00:03:00.201
not to do these things to each other

00:03:00.201 --> 00:03:01.493
and if someone does,

00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:03.085
we can come up with some policies

00:03:03.085 --> 00:03:05.684
of what would be the punishment etc. etc.

00:03:05.684 --> 00:03:07.532
And then maybe we could get some people

00:03:07.532 --> 00:03:08.906
to enforce it just to make sure

00:03:08.906 --> 00:03:10.418
that people know it's going to happen.

00:03:10.418 --> 00:03:12.361
Well, even in that very primitive state,

00:03:12.361 --> 00:03:17.280
you are starting to create
some form of a government.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.441
Now, if we think about
larger communities of people,

00:03:21.441 --> 00:03:23.455
the predominant form of government

00:03:23.455 --> 00:03:26.091
that we've seen throughout
most of human history

00:03:26.091 --> 00:03:27.674
has been a monarchy

00:03:28.813 --> 00:03:31.529
where you have some type of a king

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:35.289
or a queen or an emperor
who rules over a country,

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:36.398
who rules over a nation,

00:03:36.398 --> 00:03:38.572
who rules over a state.

00:03:38.572 --> 00:03:41.615
Now, with the birth of the United States,

00:03:41.615 --> 00:03:43.728
you start having a major country

00:03:43.728 --> 00:03:46.169
with an alternate form of government

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.002
and that's a notion of a democracy

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:54.649
which you can imagine is
another important term to know

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:58.213
and this comes from the classical Greeks.

00:03:58.213 --> 00:04:00.390
During the golden age of Athens,

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.472
you have what was first
referred to as a democracy.

00:04:03.472 --> 00:04:04.855
That was just a city state.

00:04:04.855 --> 00:04:06.125
With the United States you start having

00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:08.593
a democracy for a fairly large country

00:04:08.593 --> 00:04:10.681
even when it was formed at the time,

00:04:10.681 --> 00:04:13.301
obviously the United
States is now much larger

00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:15.626
and the core idea behind a democracy

00:04:15.626 --> 00:04:18.250
is that you don't have a monarch who rules

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.950
who is the sovereign,

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.169
you have the people who rule,

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.198
the people are the sovereign

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:27.769
and so, this is another
term that you will see.

00:04:27.769 --> 00:04:30.186
You have popular sovereignty.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.573
It's a fancy word but
sovereign is just well,

00:04:39.573 --> 00:04:40.567
what rules over it?

00:04:40.567 --> 00:04:43.617
You see the term right over here to reign.

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:45.156
What rules over things?

00:04:45.156 --> 00:04:47.518
And here you have the people are ruling

00:04:47.518 --> 00:04:51.980
and that's what's happening
here in a democracy,

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.480
so here the people are ruling.

00:04:56.052 --> 00:04:59.705
Now, in either case of a
monarchy or a democracy

00:04:59.705 --> 00:05:01.168
you have to ask the question

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:03.867
of well, regardless of who's ruling,

00:05:03.867 --> 00:05:07.285
can they just rule on
anything arbitrarily?

00:05:07.285 --> 00:05:09.949
If all of these people decide to vote

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.463
on taking maybe someone else's rights,

00:05:12.463 --> 00:05:14.753
maybe this person's
rights right over here,

00:05:14.753 --> 00:05:16.041
is that okay?

00:05:16.041 --> 00:05:18.867
Or if this monarch wants to
take this person's rights,

00:05:18.867 --> 00:05:20.538
is that okay?

00:05:20.538 --> 00:05:22.379
And so, because of that fear

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:25.851
that either with a monarchy
or even with a democracy,

00:05:25.851 --> 00:05:28.419
the democracy you might
have the majority to rule

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.006
to do something to a minority

00:05:31.006 --> 00:05:32.450
that is not so good,

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.099
that starts to infringe
on their natural rights,

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:36.650
in order to avoid that

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.150
you have this notion of limited government

00:05:45.516 --> 00:05:48.478
which is this idea that
regardless of who's ruling

00:05:48.478 --> 00:05:50.985
whether it's a monarch or the people,

00:05:50.985 --> 00:05:53.081
you need to put some laws in place,

00:05:53.081 --> 00:05:54.963
maybe put a constitution in place

00:05:54.963 --> 00:05:57.312
that very explicitly states

00:05:57.312 --> 00:06:00.586
well, what are the
powers of the government,

00:06:00.586 --> 00:06:02.260
what rights does the government have

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.855
and what rights do the people have?

00:06:04.855 --> 00:06:07.579
And so, you could implement a constitution

00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:10.398
and you can actually do it in either case.

00:06:10.398 --> 00:06:12.148
Constitution and laws

00:06:15.425 --> 00:06:18.290
of which the constitution helps set up

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.027
and if you're talking about a monarchy

00:06:20.027 --> 00:06:21.970
that is limited by a constitution,

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.747
so if you have a king or a queen

00:06:23.747 --> 00:06:25.912
but even they can't just rule anything,

00:06:25.912 --> 00:06:29.224
that's often known as a
constitutional monarchy

00:06:29.224 --> 00:06:33.134
but when you have a
democracy that is constrained

00:06:33.134 --> 00:06:35.878
that has limited government by these laws

00:06:35.878 --> 00:06:38.996
that is protecting the rights of people,

00:06:38.996 --> 00:06:43.653
we refer to this as a
republic or republicanism.

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:47.403
So, this is another good
word, republicanism.

00:06:50.673 --> 00:06:53.971
This is the limited
government and republicanism

00:06:53.971 --> 00:06:57.313
are often strongly
associated with each other

00:06:57.313 --> 00:06:59.891
and that's why the United States today

00:06:59.891 --> 00:07:01.692
and many countries that have actually

00:07:01.692 --> 00:07:03.154
in fact modeled themselves

00:07:03.154 --> 00:07:04.315
after the United States

00:07:04.315 --> 00:07:07.982
refer to themselves as
democratic republics.

00:07:11.073 --> 00:07:12.969
And so, with just these terms,

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:14.807
you have been well armed

00:07:14.807 --> 00:07:18.159
to better study not just the US government

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:20.276
but governments in general

00:07:20.276 --> 00:07:22.385
and in future videos we will see

00:07:22.385 --> 00:07:24.994
how some of the founding
documents of the United States

00:07:24.994 --> 00:07:26.829
like the Declaration of Independence,

00:07:26.829 --> 00:07:28.482
like the United States Constitution

00:07:28.482 --> 00:07:30.649
really embody these ideas.
