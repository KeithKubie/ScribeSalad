[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.500
SUNDAR PICHAI: Welcome to Google
I/O, and welcome to Shoreline.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.590
We live in very,
very exciting times.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.730
We, as Google, have evolved
significantly over the past 10

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.740
years, and we
believe we are poised

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.890
to take a big leap forward
in the next 10 years.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.990
Today, we can do
things which we never

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.650
thought we could do before.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.723
To do this well, we really
need to work with developers

00:00:28.723 --> 00:00:31.110
and third parties,
but we believe

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.202
we are just getting started.

00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:36.060
There are over 3 billion
people connected,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.550
and they are using
the internet in ways

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.010
we have never seen before.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.430
Learn new things.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.514
Gain knowledge.

00:00:43.514 --> 00:00:45.180
MALE SPEAKER:
Accessibility is crucially

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.620
important to Google's
mission, which, fundamentally,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.440
is to make sure that
everyone around the world

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.051
can access the
world's information.

00:00:53.051 --> 00:00:55.300
MALE SPEAKER: And I was just
fascinated with this idea

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.250
that we could bridge the gap
between our physical world

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.495
and our digital lives, that
we take our human nature

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:04.247
and embed it in technology.

00:01:04.247 --> 00:01:06.350
MALE SPEAKER: And today,
we're proud to share,

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.099
with you, the new Firebase.

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:10.640
MALE SPEAKER: We're
adding more tools

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.036
to help you develop your app.

00:01:12.036 --> 00:01:13.910
MALE SPEAKER: We're
really interested to hear

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.590
what you think,
and we can't wait

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.140
to see what you build next.

00:01:24.395 --> 00:01:26.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:30.164 --> 00:01:32.080
MALE SPEAKER: Ultimately,
it's up to all of us

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.450
to write the future of the web.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.276
So go out there, and build a
great, progressive web app.

00:01:39.276 --> 00:01:40.650
MALE SPEAKER:
Software developers

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.062
are changing our
world in a big way.

00:01:45.062 --> 00:01:48.720
FEMALE SPEAKER: We're evolving
Android apps to run instantly,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.892
without installation.

00:01:50.892 --> 00:01:52.350
MALE SPEAKER: With
the end release,

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.000
we wanted to achieve a new
level of product excellence.

00:01:58.073 --> 00:02:01.660
It's amazing to be
here at Google I/O 2016

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.750
at the Shoreline Amphitheater.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.420
FEMALE SPEAKER: And
I can't tell you

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.990
how much I've been
looking forward

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.036
to this moment for
a really long time.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.050
MALE SPEAKER:
Communications is all

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.954
about sharing life's moments.

00:02:20.954 --> 00:02:23.986
Communications is such an
important part of our lives,

00:02:23.986 --> 00:02:28.761
and it's an important
focus for Google as well.

00:02:28.761 --> 00:02:32.170
MALE SPEAKER: Our users and your
users expect the impossible.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.710
They want technology that
they can talk to naturally,

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.540
just the way you would
talk to a person.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.250
We're moving in that direction.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.181
MALE SPEAKER: VR is about
what you can experience.

00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:43.430
FEMALE SPEAKER: There's no
"once upon a time" anymore.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.046
There's no "in a world."

00:02:45.046 --> 00:02:47.910
You, as a visitor, are
now the storyteller.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.470
SUNDAR PICHAI: Things
previously thought

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.190
to be impossible may,
in fact, be possible.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.490
We look forward to building
the future together

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.640
with all of you.
