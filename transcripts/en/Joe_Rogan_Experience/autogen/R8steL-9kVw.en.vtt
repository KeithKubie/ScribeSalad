paradigms and then from that point on
 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.380
paradigms and then from that point on
basically their perspective is modified

that feeling of anxiety you know that

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:17.340
that feeling of anxiety you know that
 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.550

actually are expressing a chemical

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:24.660
actually are expressing a chemical
 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.830
actually are expressing a chemical
called dane orphan and this is an

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840
called dane orphan and this is an
 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.050
called dane orphan and this is an
endogenous Kemel in your brain and it

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060
endogenous Kemel in your brain and it
 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.340
endogenous Kemel in your brain and it
binds to something called the kappa

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:31.350
binds to something called the kappa
 

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.810
binds to something called the kappa
opioid receptor it's kind of like the

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:32.820
opioid receptor it's kind of like the
 

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.230
opioid receptor it's kind of like the
counter of the endorphin which binds to

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240
counter of the endorphin which binds to
 

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.850
counter of the endorphin which binds to
the MU opioid receptor so the and

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:37.860
the MU opioid receptor so the and
 

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.070
the MU opioid receptor so the and
orphans are the feel-good well its

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080
orphans are the feel-good well its
 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.470
orphans are the feel-good well its
nemesis is the dynorphin which is that

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:42.480
nemesis is the dynorphin which is that
 

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.260

anxiety like feeling so but here's the

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:45.270
anxiety like feeling so but here's the
 

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.930
anxiety like feeling so but here's the
interesting part that anxiety like

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:47.940
interesting part that anxiety like
 

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.880
interesting part that anxiety like
feeling that you feel before you're you

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:49.890
feeling that you feel before you're you
 

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.409
feeling that you feel before you're you
know going to do something like you're

00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:51.419
know going to do something like you're
 

00:07:51.419 --> 00:07:53.600
know going to do something like you're
you know really that you care about or

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:53.610
you know really that you care about or
 

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.690
you know really that you care about or
that's kind of anxiety provoking for me

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:56.700
that's kind of anxiety provoking for me
 

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.430
that's kind of anxiety provoking for me
public speaking does it I get it right

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440
public speaking does it I get it right
 

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.500
public speaking does it I get it right
before I'm going to do it you know give

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:00.510
before I'm going to do it you know give
 

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.170
before I'm going to do it you know give
a talk or something or do a podcast in

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:03.180
a talk or something or do a podcast in
 

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.780
a talk or something or do a podcast in
front of you know 500,000 people um so

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:05.790
front of you know 500,000 people um so
 

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.390
front of you know 500,000 people um so
that dynorphin binding to the kappa

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400
that dynorphin binding to the kappa
 

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.850
that dynorphin binding to the kappa
opioid receptor what it does is it up

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:10.860
opioid receptor what it does is it up
 

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.460
opioid receptor what it does is it up
regulates the new opioid receptor so

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:13.470
regulates the new opioid receptor so
 

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.530
regulates the new opioid receptor so
that after you get that anxiety feeling

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:15.540
that after you get that anxiety feeling
 

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.230
that after you get that anxiety feeling
you have a better endorphin rush because

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240
you have a better endorphin rush because
 

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.760
you have a better endorphin rush because
you up regulate the new up your

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:19.770
you up regulate the new up your
 

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.620
you up regulate the new up your
receptors which bind to the endorphins

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:21.630
receptors which bind to the endorphins
 

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.360
receptors which bind to the endorphins
to feel good ones and you actually

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:23.370
to feel good ones and you actually
 

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.760
to feel good ones and you actually
become sensitized to them so there's a

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:25.770
become sensitized to them so there's a
 

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.370
become sensitized to them so there's a
biological mechanism by which having

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:28.380
biological mechanism by which having
 

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.460
biological mechanism by which having
that anxiety actually does you good so

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:31.470
that anxiety actually does you good so
 

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.860
that anxiety actually does you good so
it's it's kind of like a stress at first

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:33.870
it's it's kind of like a stress at first
 

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.380
it's it's kind of like a stress at first
but then later on your you get you feel

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:36.390
but then later on your you get you feel
 

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.050
but then later on your you get you feel
better and you're more relaxed
