00:00:11.546 --> 00:00:15.236
&gt;&gt;The essential elements I would
list as several integrations.

00:00:16.606 --> 00:00:20.426
You're integrating students
across social class.

00:00:21.056 --> 00:00:22.866
As Thomas Jefferson said "The purpose

00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:27.726
of public education is
to create a public."

00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:33.996
You're integrating head and hand,
MITs motto and a place like this

00:00:34.296 --> 00:00:38.176
and John Dewey's point that
understanding drives from activity.

00:00:38.206 --> 00:00:41.596
Making and doing things
is a very engaging way

00:00:41.596 --> 00:00:43.686
and you've got to engage them first.

00:00:43.956 --> 00:00:46.986
You're integrating school
and community, you don't want

00:00:46.986 --> 00:00:49.976
to warehouse kids away from
the world outside them,

00:00:50.726 --> 00:00:53.346
the world that they're preparing
to enter as young adults.

00:00:53.756 --> 00:00:56.686
You want to have lots of people
coming in like we do here

00:00:57.026 --> 00:00:59.226
and you want the kids
going out on internships,

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:02.826
doing community service etc. etc. So
you want the walls to be as permeable

00:01:02.826 --> 00:01:06.266
as possible and no longer to be
the citadel apart from community

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.626
like the very first schools were uh..

00:01:08.826 --> 00:01:10.586
one thousand years ago.

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:14.696
And finally the integration of
secondary and post secondary.

00:01:14.696 --> 00:01:18.536
Some people well intended and
say we should have programs

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:23.886
for non college bound but having
taught carpentry which is presumed

00:01:23.886 --> 00:01:26.496
to be one of those programs,
the problem with that is

00:01:26.496 --> 00:01:28.666
that if you create a program
for the non college bound,

00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:31.686
at the end of the 8th grade the
decision you make about who goes

00:01:31.686 --> 00:01:37.156
into them is based on socioeconomic
predictors of the education

00:01:37.156 --> 00:01:38.576
and economic level of one's parent

00:01:38.636 --> 00:01:40.876
who might not be doing it
consciously but you're doing it.

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:44.856
So you're deciding by creating
a program for non college bound

00:01:44.856 --> 00:01:46.246
that someone's not going to college.

00:01:46.246 --> 00:01:50.556
But my hypothesis is that those kids
who ultimately won't go to college

00:01:50.836 --> 00:01:55.046
and some will not are better served
if they're not being segregated

00:01:55.046 --> 00:01:58.076
from those who are and not
being segregated from programs

00:01:58.076 --> 00:01:59.816
that expect that they will be.

00:02:00.146 --> 00:02:03.596
That's why we've got a hundred
kids accepted to college 100%,

00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:09.116
99.5% participating in college,
70% going to four year colleges,

00:02:09.376 --> 00:02:13.006
50 to 55% first generation
college entrants.

00:02:13.316 --> 00:02:16.026
That's why we're getting those
results because we've got

00:02:16.156 --> 00:02:19.466
that integration across all
those four integrations.

00:02:24.016 --> 00:02:26.846
&gt;&gt;You've got tech and
you've got academics

00:02:27.706 --> 00:02:32.396
and you're taking the methodology
of tech which is group performed,

00:02:32.806 --> 00:02:37.836
team taught, experiential applied,
expeditionary, you're producing

00:02:38.636 --> 00:02:42.386
and the content of academics,
literacy and numeracy,

00:02:42.436 --> 00:02:46.886
[inaudible] all the things that
kids need to know and you're trying

00:02:46.886 --> 00:02:54.106
to wed the pedagogy of tech,
not the content with the content

00:02:54.416 --> 00:02:59.346
of academics that's really the
purpose of sort of restructuring

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.666
and getting schools like this.

00:03:00.926 --> 00:03:04.566
That's MIT, head and
hand is the motto of MIT.

00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:09.536
&gt;&gt;Why is it that your average
kid regardless of socioeconomic

00:03:09.536 --> 00:03:15.466
or educational background, if
given an MMO or video game,

00:03:15.886 --> 00:03:19.956
computer game would left to
their own devices play with it

00:03:20.136 --> 00:03:24.376
for 10 hours a day for 14
months, even though it was fraught

00:03:24.376 --> 00:03:27.456
with failure, frustrations,
setbacks and successes

00:03:27.456 --> 00:03:29.436
but going through and persevering.

00:03:29.926 --> 00:03:33.886
And some of us think isn't
there something that we can take

00:03:33.886 --> 00:03:39.436
from that pedagogically if we were to
change the nature of the transaction

00:03:40.256 --> 00:03:43.876
and so there's a lot of opportunity
there so at High Tech High

00:03:44.386 --> 00:03:45.696
from the beginning we've said

00:03:45.696 --> 00:03:48.176
that you can't play video
games unless you made them here

00:03:48.486 --> 00:03:51.766
and they can't be violent and
they have to be educational.

00:03:52.006 --> 00:03:54.846
I want kids again producing
not consuming,

00:03:54.846 --> 00:03:57.816
I want kids making,
making those things.

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:07.286
&gt;&gt;So here we have fewer blocks
of time and we integrate art

00:04:07.526 --> 00:04:11.386
into physics and into biology
by having kids publish books,

00:04:11.386 --> 00:04:14.266
by having kids create
documentary films instead

00:04:14.266 --> 00:04:16.646
of saying well every
45 minutes you're going

00:04:16.646 --> 00:04:18.646
to jump up and run around.

00:04:18.646 --> 00:04:21.826
So there's time to
do things, seriously.

00:04:22.276 --> 00:04:25.106
The other thing is by having
small teaching teams of a teacher,

00:04:25.106 --> 00:04:28.726
one teaches math/science, the other
one teaches humanities combined

00:04:29.246 --> 00:04:31.426
that the two of us
together have 50 kids

00:04:31.426 --> 00:04:35.116
in a seven period day I teach six out
of seven, I got 28 kids in a class.

00:04:35.186 --> 00:04:39.426
I'm teaching 180, 190 kids
at one time as opposed to 50,

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.556
tremendous benefit to that.

00:04:41.816 --> 00:04:47.336
If you want to integrate pedagogy
of technology with the content

00:04:47.336 --> 00:04:52.346
of academics and have kids be
producing things and be doing it

00:04:52.346 --> 00:04:53.886
in an interdisciplinary fashion,

00:04:54.366 --> 00:04:56.016
teachers need to meet
with each other.

00:04:56.016 --> 00:04:58.076
If you go into a school
that says they're doing that

00:04:58.076 --> 00:05:00.176
and I have visited
schools in 38 states,

00:05:00.176 --> 00:05:01.236
everyone says they're doing it

00:05:01.616 --> 00:05:03.816
and then you say well
do your teachers meet

00:05:03.816 --> 00:05:04.996
with each other, they say no.

00:05:04.996 --> 00:05:07.466
I said oh well got a plane to catch.

00:05:07.566 --> 00:05:10.726
So we knew that we
needed to build that in.

00:05:11.136 --> 00:05:17.606
So in my school back east
we had a group of teachers

00:05:17.606 --> 00:05:18.926
that met first period and a group

00:05:18.926 --> 00:05:20.926
that met fourth period
of a seven period day.

00:05:21.316 --> 00:05:25.556
Teachers who met fourth period
randomly assigned to first

00:05:25.556 --> 00:05:26.966
or fourth over three years.

00:05:27.046 --> 00:05:29.756
The ones who met fourth period talked
about what Billy just did wrong

00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:33.916
and the ones who met first period
were able to talk about three years

00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:37.186
from now, it's something
about human nature and so here

00:05:37.186 --> 00:05:39.676
when we built High Tech
High we said we're going

00:05:39.676 --> 00:05:42.766
to have people meet every morning
of the year in different teams.

00:05:42.766 --> 00:05:46.776
So on Friday everyone in the whole
school meets, on Wednesday they look

00:05:46.776 --> 00:05:50.796
at student work, on Tuesday
and Thursday the teachers

00:05:50.796 --> 00:05:54.786
who share the same kids at the same
time that year, they meet etc. etc.

00:05:54.786 --> 00:05:58.756
So we have different configurations
of common planning time

00:05:58.756 --> 00:06:01.726
which allows people to
feel like and behave

00:06:01.726 --> 00:06:03.496
like they're treated professionally.

00:06:07.146 --> 00:06:08.946
&gt;&gt;You want to treat kids with respect

00:06:10.006 --> 00:06:15.656
and kid's antennae are very well
tuned to pick up contrivance

00:06:15.656 --> 00:06:18.086
and fakery and things that
are not fair and not just

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:20.766
so you don't have kid's bathrooms

00:06:20.766 --> 00:06:22.676
in adult bathrooms, you
just have bathrooms.

00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:26.696
You don't have PA systems that go
off throughout the day making foolish

00:06:26.696 --> 00:06:28.906
announcements of who should come
to the office where it feels

00:06:28.906 --> 00:06:31.896
like quazi bus station/police
station.

00:06:31.896 --> 00:06:35.396
If kids need to go to the bathroom,
they get up and go to the bathroom

00:06:35.656 --> 00:06:40.136
and just little things, a lot of
little things that all add up because

00:06:40.136 --> 00:06:42.486
as Voltaire said, suspicion
invites treachery.

00:06:42.486 --> 00:06:44.756
If you treat kids with
respect they'll be respectful.

00:06:49.596 --> 00:06:52.986
&gt;&gt;A lot of people say well they come
in and say well we can't do this

00:06:52.986 --> 00:06:55.766
because we don't have the computers
or we can't do this because of this

00:06:55.766 --> 00:06:58.386
or we can't do this because of that
and I think that actually you can

00:06:59.176 --> 00:07:04.206
and we did this exercise
yesterday and sort of a gift

00:07:04.316 --> 00:07:05.546
to whoever might be listening

00:07:05.546 --> 00:07:09.436
to this called the most memorable
learning experience exercise.

00:07:10.026 --> 00:07:14.126
It's simple, you're in a
cafeteria, you've got 100 people

00:07:14.126 --> 00:07:17.406
from your community, teachers
or whomever and they're sitting

00:07:17.406 --> 00:07:21.516
in tables with five or six or seven
to a table and you say to everybody,

00:07:21.516 --> 00:07:23.736
would you please just spend
five or ten minutes writing

00:07:23.736 --> 00:07:26.426
down your two most
memorable learning experiences

00:07:26.426 --> 00:07:27.476
from your high school years.

00:07:28.506 --> 00:07:32.896
They do that and they you ask
them, would you please all discuss

00:07:32.896 --> 00:07:35.506
at your table those memorable
learning experiences and come

00:07:35.506 --> 00:07:38.276
up with the key characteristics

00:07:38.276 --> 00:07:43.436
that defined what was an important
significant memorable learning

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:45.016
experience for you all.

00:07:45.386 --> 00:07:48.836
And then you're going to get up
at each table and share those

00:07:48.836 --> 00:07:51.416
and report back to us and I'm
going to be up with this chart here

00:07:51.676 --> 00:07:53.196
and I'm going to write
down what they were.

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:58.416
I've done this in about
28 cities, I've done this

00:07:58.416 --> 00:08:02.256
with my colleagues many times, we did
it yesterday with these architects.

00:08:02.826 --> 00:08:05.096
I could several pages back

00:08:05.096 --> 00:08:08.116
on that flip chart I've been
tempted sometimes to write

00:08:08.116 --> 00:08:11.676
down like a card trick person,
what they were going to say

00:08:11.676 --> 00:08:13.306
because I know what
they're going to say.

00:08:13.966 --> 00:08:18.586
What they say is it was a project,
it involved community, it had fear

00:08:18.586 --> 00:08:21.266
or failure, it had recognition
of success, it had a mentor,

00:08:21.536 --> 00:08:23.176
it had a public display of work.

00:08:23.366 --> 00:08:25.156
It had all of the things
that at this point

00:08:25.156 --> 00:08:26.126
that High Tech High is based on.

00:08:26.386 --> 00:08:29.576
It had all of the things
that I'm talking about,

00:08:29.666 --> 00:08:33.376
so then you respectfully
ask a group of teachers,

00:08:34.046 --> 00:08:37.946
really respectively say well this
was not externally imposed on you,

00:08:38.136 --> 00:08:40.386
the midwifery that we just did was

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:43.886
about your own most memorable
learning experiences.

00:08:45.236 --> 00:08:46.956
How does this comport
with the way you teach?

00:08:49.186 --> 00:08:52.786
And if it doesn't comport with the
way you teach, what can we then do

00:08:52.786 --> 00:08:54.986
to get you teaching the way
that you yourself learned?

00:08:55.166 --> 00:08:58.646
Again it wasn't imposed on
you, this came from within you.

00:08:58.946 --> 00:09:00.586
That's a great place to
start with communities,

00:09:00.586 --> 00:09:02.146
it's a great place to
start with teachers.

00:09:02.146 --> 00:09:05.936
I think that what we're
doing is really obvious.

00:09:06.706 --> 00:09:09.396
