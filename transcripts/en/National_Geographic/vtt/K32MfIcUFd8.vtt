00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:07.206
It was harder than
we anticipated

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:08.675
and it was much,
much colder.

00:00:09.508 --> 00:00:12.011
<i>We're a team of six people.</i>

00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:14.213
<i> Our goal is to determine</i>

00:00:14.213 --> 00:00:17.083
<i>what the highest peak in Burma
 is and then climb it.</i>

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:21.321
<i>Like to solve this fantastic
 geographical mystery.</i>

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:29.729
<i>It never let up, just taken
down to, like, nothing and</i>

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:32.365
<i>how... how did that happen?</i>

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:36.002 line:0%
( applause )

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:39.204 line:0%
I first learned of
Hkakabo Razi in 2001.

00:00:39.204 --> 00:00:40.840
That's the name of the peak and

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.876
so for, you know, 15
years I've dreamt of

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:46.879
going to this place
in Northern Myanmar

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.814
the eastern edge
of the Himalayas

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:50.749
and exploring this mountain.

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:55.421
And finally in the Fall of 2014

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:59.292
this sort of imagined
expedition came to pass.

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:05.531
<i>This is us, down to nothing
 at the end of our trip.</i>

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:08.167
<i>One of the most incredible,
 incredible adventures</i>

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:11.037
I've ever been on in my life,
and that's saying a lot.

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:13.006
I've been on probably 40
different expeditions

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.573
all over the world.

00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:20.846
<i>In 2011, I led an expedition
 of about 12 athletes</i>

00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:22.014
<i> with North Face.</i>

00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:23.683
<i>Conrad Anker was one of those.</i>

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:26.118
And it was a really
amazing success

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:28.987
we all summited,
skied from the top and...

00:01:28.987 --> 00:01:33.159
That led to an invite to go on

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.329
a National Geographic-North Face
supported expedition to Everest.

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.966
<i>Mark Jenkins just happened
to be on the trip as well.</i>

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:42.268
<i>I'd never met him before.
 He was coming in late.</i>

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:45.471
<i>We spent ten, ten days hiking
 into base camp together.</i>

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:48.107
And that where we
started talking about

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:51.277
all these adventures and
exploration that we'd done and

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.513
and Mark is incredibly
well traveled.

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:56.248
And the story of Burma
came up

00:01:56.248 --> 00:01:57.316
and...

00:01:57.316 --> 00:01:59.619
I didn't know the
Himalayas ended in Burma.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.722
So, we started talking
about Hkakabo Razi and

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:04.090
Mark had actually
tried to go and

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.892
climb it when the
area was closed

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:08.461
and been, like, arrested
and all these crazy things

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.496
that Mark does.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.433
<i>As we got further into the climb
of Everest, and you can see here</i>

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:15.601
<i> this is heading
 towards the summit</i>

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:18.004
<i> and the people and
 the crowding.</i>

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:20.939
It was just a stretch
from where I had started

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.109
as this adventurer in new places

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.911
and here was this
amazing mountain but

00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:27.179
<i> a lot of people and</i>

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:29.348
<i> just a different way of
climbing that I wasn't used to.</i>

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:34.153
<i>Mark and I summited Everest
together and when we came down</i>

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:36.322
<i> as we were walking out,
we're like, this is happening.</i>

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:38.491
<i> We're gonna make
 Hkakabo Razi happen</i>

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:39.993
and that's going to
be our next trip.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.861
And it's going to
be anti-Everest

00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:44.364
and it's gonna be an adventure.
( scoffs )

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:45.598
Little did we know.

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:47.033
( laughing )

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:50.803 line:0%
<i> So, the idea behind
 it was to really explore</i>

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:54.440 line:0%
<i> and travel over land and
find this mountain and...</i>

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.576
<i> take GPS's with us and
 tag the summit and</i>

00:02:57.576 --> 00:03:00.112
<i>see if it was really the highest
mountain in South East Asia.</i>

00:03:00.112 --> 00:03:01.981
So, planning the trip,
this is pretty much

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:03.349
what I had to work with.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.719
<i>And you can that the whole
 mountain is blurred out</i>

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:09.288
<i>like it doesn't really exist.</i>

00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:12.758 line:0%
<i>Then the next thing is, you
know, you have to pick a team.</i>

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:15.327 line:0%
<i> So, this had to
 be a really unique team</i>

00:03:15.327 --> 00:03:17.095 line:0%
<i> because we were
 going for two months</i>

00:03:17.095 --> 00:03:18.497 line:0%
<i>and there's probably only, like,</i>

00:03:18.497 --> 00:03:20.332
<i>ten days of actual climbing.</i>

00:03:20.332 --> 00:03:21.367
<i> So, first of all</i>

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:24.470
<i>getting a bunch of athletes
together is like herding cats.</i>

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.773
<i>They're all over the world,
 all the time</i>

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:32.278
<i>and then we show up, you know,
in Tokyo with a zillion bags.</i>

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:34.146
<i> They all weighed
 about 70 pounds and</i>

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:36.916
we're used to Nepal standards
of 'you carry everything'.

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:39.419
You have jeans at base camp
and you have extra shoes

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.421
and flip flops and
a sun hat and...

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:44.657
We showed up with
all of that stuff.

00:03:44.657 --> 00:03:45.959
It didn't last very long.

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.794
Um, quick video about us
getting into the country.

00:03:48.794 --> 00:03:52.198
( instrumental music )

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:53.499
<i> Usually on these trips</i>

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:57.203
<i>you definitely don't take
time to see a place so much</i>

00:03:57.203 --> 00:03:59.605
<i>which is definitely a drawback
 to a lot of expeditions.</i>

00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:01.641
<i> Is you land in this
 foreign place</i>

00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:03.709
<i> but you just beeline
straight for the mountains.</i>

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:10.182
( instrumental music )

00:04:10.182 --> 00:04:15.588
-( bells ringing )
-( indistinct chatter )

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.132
All aboard!

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:28.233 line:0%
( instrumental music )

00:04:28.233 --> 00:04:29.735 line:0%
Mark:<i> Hilaree and I
 conceived of this</i>

00:04:29.735 --> 00:04:31.770 line:0%
<i> as kind of the
 anti-Everest trip.</i>

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.606
<i> We were coming off
 of Everest together.</i>

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.708
<i> Been successful and
 kind of wondered</i>

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:37.844
<i> "Okay, what's an old
 fashioned expedition?"</i>

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:41.113
<i> Start in the capital
 of the country</i>

00:04:41.113 --> 00:04:43.983
<i> go over land all the
 way to your mountain.</i>

00:04:46.218 --> 00:04:49.155
<i>With this team, I think we have
as good a chance as anyone</i>

00:04:49.155 --> 00:04:50.790
<i> of resolving
 the mystery of</i>

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.159
<i> what's the highest
 peaks in Burma.</i>

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:57.964
( instrumental music )

00:05:03.201 --> 00:05:04.837
Normally, as a climber, you just

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:07.039
you fly through
these countries and

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:08.507
you go straight
to the mountains

00:05:08.507 --> 00:05:10.776
and it's actually a risk
to travel over land

00:05:10.776 --> 00:05:12.245
because that's the
time when you get sick

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:16.515
you wear yourself
down unnecessarily.

00:05:16.515 --> 00:05:18.617
But, none of us had
been to this country

00:05:18.617 --> 00:05:20.186
and all of us
individually had spent

00:05:20.186 --> 00:05:21.954
so much time in
Asia in general

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:25.525
<i> that we wanted to really
 experience the country</i>

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:28.394
<i> and that involved
 going over land</i>

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:30.662
<i> which was about 1000
 miles and we took about</i>

00:05:30.662 --> 00:05:32.899
<i> every possible mode
 of transportation,</i>

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:33.799
<i> you could imagine.</i>

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:37.337
So, I had this like, romantic
notion of trains that is...

00:05:38.804 --> 00:05:41.040
I think it doesn't
apply to this country.

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:45.010
<i>This was a gentleman that we
thought was actually dead</i>

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.847
<i>when they were putting him
 in there but he wasn't.</i>

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:50.883
He was alive and he was, kind of
being passed through this window

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:52.351
to his family inside.

00:05:52.351 --> 00:05:54.186
<i>This is as the train started.</i>

00:05:54.186 --> 00:05:57.656
<i>And I think from that expression
on my face this was early on.</i>

00:05:57.656 --> 00:05:58.924
<i>And I was still thinking like</i>

00:05:58.924 --> 00:06:01.026
"Oh my Gosh, this is so great

00:06:01.026 --> 00:06:03.295
like, wow, this is
gonna be amazing."

00:06:03.295 --> 00:06:04.797
And then--

00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:06.398
There's another video here

00:06:06.398 --> 00:06:08.501
that will give you a better idea
of what the train was like.

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:09.835 line:0%
Emily:
<i> I would say this is</i>

00:06:09.835 --> 00:06:13.106 line:0%
<i> definitely another step
 above the Everest trip.</i>

00:06:13.905 --> 00:06:16.275
More remote, more challenging

00:06:17.643 --> 00:06:21.246
<i> and the worst travel
experience I've ever had.</i>

00:06:21.246 --> 00:06:23.048
-( train car buckles )
-( screaming )

00:06:23.048 --> 00:06:25.084
<i> Literally you'd
 be airborne and</i>

00:06:25.084 --> 00:06:26.786
<i> then just slammed back
 into your seat.</i>

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:29.789
<i>And then you'd be launched again
and slammed back into your seat.</i>

00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:34.827
<i>Doing that for 18 hours just
sort of makes you insane.</i>

00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:41.266
Hilaree:<i> We're on an adventure
 and I think that was</i>

00:06:41.266 --> 00:06:44.403
what got me started in
expeditions in the first place.

00:06:44.403 --> 00:06:46.339
<i> Just this excitement for
 the unknown.</i>

00:06:48.274 --> 00:06:50.242
I mean, the funny thing about
an adventure is that

00:06:50.242 --> 00:06:53.312
you never know when the unknown
part is going to strike you.

00:06:53.612 --> 00:06:54.981
And we learned later--

00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:57.917
Taylor, who was the base
camp manager, she was like

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.687
"So, before we left, I was kind
of looking on the internet

00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:02.855
and I found this thing that

00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:05.758
the train in Burma is
called the Death train."

00:07:05.758 --> 00:07:07.159
I was like,
"Why didn't you tell us that

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:08.928
before we got on the train?"

00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:14.566
But, yeah, so that's, don't
ride the train in Burma.

00:07:14.566 --> 00:07:17.503 line:0%
<i> So, the train
 took us to Mytchina.</i>

00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:18.770 line:0%
<i> We're now in
 the Kachin state.</i>

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.707 line:0%
And there is a little bit of
tribal fighting and everything

00:07:21.707 --> 00:07:24.377
between Mytchina and Putao.

00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:29.348
So, we were required to take
a domestic flight to Putao

00:07:29.348 --> 00:07:31.116
<i> which was kind of our
 final destination</i>

00:07:31.116 --> 00:07:32.618
<i> before we set out
 for the mountain.</i>

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:36.221 line:0%
So, Putao, 205
miles to the mountain.

00:07:36.221 --> 00:07:39.759 line:0%
We just had our own feet
to get us there and motorcycles.

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:44.964
<i>At this point, we were put
under town arrest in Putao.</i>

00:07:45.264 --> 00:07:47.867
And we arrived on a Friday

00:07:47.867 --> 00:07:49.168
we were supposed to
leave on Saturday

00:07:49.168 --> 00:07:50.535
we had our motorcycles ready

00:07:50.535 --> 00:07:52.704
we had porters waiting
for us in the jungle

00:07:52.704 --> 00:07:54.640
and we couldn't leave town.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.109
And Mark and I were frantic,
we were running around

00:07:57.109 --> 00:07:58.744
trying to talk to every
government official

00:07:58.744 --> 00:08:00.179
anyone we could.

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:02.715
But, of course it was the
weekend and it was like

00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:05.784
some random, weird holiday
and nobody would talk to us.

00:08:05.784 --> 00:08:08.420
And finally, Monday afternoon

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.157
after we went through
government in Yangon

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:12.691
we finally got clearance.

00:08:12.691 --> 00:08:13.926
But, we didn't actually--

00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:16.194
we weren't actually able
to leave until Tuesday.

00:08:16.194 --> 00:08:17.996
In the end, this four-day delay

00:08:17.996 --> 00:08:21.700
caused a lot of strife
as the trip went on.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:27.773
<i>So, the day that we were cleared
to go, it started raining.</i>

00:08:27.773 --> 00:08:28.941
<i> Of course!</i>

00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:32.778
<i>And a lot of the motorcycle
 drivers had left.</i>

00:08:32.778 --> 00:08:36.381
<i>So, we ended up having to
confine a lot of our gear on a</i>

00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:38.217
<i>on a smaller amount of bikes.</i>

00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:43.055
<i>This was Taylor. She was on
the back of this guy's bike.</i>

00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:45.424
And um... I just
like this picture.

00:08:45.424 --> 00:08:47.326
She was kind of miserable.

00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:51.330
Um, and you'll see why here,
from this next video.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.698
( sound of rain )

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:55.401
Hilaree:<i> We finally got our
 permissions yesterday.</i>

00:08:58.737 --> 00:09:02.574
We are packing up motorcycles,
that looks totally sketchy.

00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:04.143
This is my driver...

00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:05.778
he just cracked a beer

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:08.581
at 7:30 in the morning.

00:09:09.982 --> 00:09:11.183
I'm gonna ride with him.

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:13.553
( motorcycle starts )

00:09:19.925 --> 00:09:25.797 line:0%
Got a 50-pound backpack and a
30-pound Movi in my right hand.

00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:28.734
Not really sure how that's gonna
work, but, see how it goes.

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:32.471
( water splashing )

00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:40.746
I mean, I don't know, it's
probably really hard driving

00:09:40.746 --> 00:09:43.249 line:0%
but I just feel like I have
the shittiest driver.

00:09:44.249 --> 00:09:51.090
( instrumental music )

00:09:52.024 --> 00:09:55.027
<i> We're in
 "Expedition 101" mode.</i>

00:09:55.627 --> 00:09:58.631
And it's definitely,
partly, you know...

00:09:59.231 --> 00:10:00.699
my mistake.

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:03.102 line:0%
I should've been
keeping better track of

00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:04.503 line:0%
where the bikes
were and everything.

00:10:04.503 --> 00:10:06.572 line:0%
But, right now, we're
getting pretty spread out.

00:10:09.808 --> 00:10:14.080
On the way in we get 80 miles
on motorcycles in four days.

00:10:15.447 --> 00:10:18.818
And then, we started
the jungle walk.

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:22.855 line:0%
( insects buzzing )

00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:24.757 line:0%
When we were first getting
on the motorcycles

00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:26.058
one of this driver--

00:10:26.058 --> 00:10:29.361
one of the drivers looked at
me and I was wearing shorts.

00:10:29.728 --> 00:10:31.430
And he was like, "Shorts?"

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.331
( audience laughter )

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:34.400
He's like, "Pants, you
should put on pants."

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.834
I was like, "Oh,
no, no, I'm fine.

00:10:35.834 --> 00:10:37.869
It's super hot. I
don't like heat."

00:10:37.869 --> 00:10:39.905
Um, so I went out the
first day in shorts.

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:42.040
<i>I thought he meant, because
like you could get scratched</i>

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.343
<i> by bamboo or you know,
 whatever.</i>

00:10:44.343 --> 00:10:47.713
<i> But, instead I just
 got completely mauled</i>

00:10:47.713 --> 00:10:49.215
<i> by these no-see-ums.</i>

00:10:49.215 --> 00:10:53.352
So, there weren't mosquitos but
there were these gnats and bees.

00:10:53.352 --> 00:10:54.853
All these bee stings.

00:10:54.853 --> 00:10:58.423
I had hundreds of bites
just from that one day.

00:10:58.423 --> 00:11:00.793
And I put shorts on, even that,
or pants,

00:11:00.793 --> 00:11:03.396
like I had, you know those
trekker-zip on things

00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:05.797
and I, I mean I put pants
on by the end of the day

00:11:05.797 --> 00:11:07.399
because I kind of
finally figured it out

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:08.967
but it was already too late.

00:11:08.967 --> 00:11:13.171
And, so this was my first
real test with suffering.

00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:15.608
I mean, I live at 9,000
feet for a reason

00:11:15.608 --> 00:11:17.642
because I don't
really like bugs.

00:11:17.642 --> 00:11:19.679
I think, does anybody
ever feel like this?

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.680
Like if you have an intense
dislike of something

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.282
and then it seems to recur
over and over in your life.

00:11:24.282 --> 00:11:26.818
Mine's like bugs and
snakes and spiders and--

00:11:26.818 --> 00:11:29.988
<i>I must have come across five
different snakes on the trek.</i>

00:11:29.988 --> 00:11:32.491
<i>And this was the first one
 that I almost stepped on</i>

00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:35.027
<i>within like, two hours of
getting off the motorcycles</i>

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:36.294
<i>and walking on the trail.</i>

00:11:36.294 --> 00:11:38.297
<i> There's a lot of
 snakes in Burma.</i>

00:11:38.297 --> 00:11:41.434
<i> Some leeches. Lots of
 leeches in the area.</i>

00:11:41.434 --> 00:11:44.670
<i> These actually were so
 common and frequent that</i>

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.872
<i> they kind of became
inconsequential by the end.</i>

00:11:46.872 --> 00:11:48.273
But, the first time

00:11:48.273 --> 00:11:49.908
we were hiking at night
through the jungle

00:11:49.908 --> 00:11:51.509
and just coming down and

00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:53.678
Emily got there before
me and she sat down.

00:11:53.678 --> 00:11:57.082
I had this white shirt on and
she had her headlamp on and

00:11:57.082 --> 00:11:59.851
I took my pack off and
I undid the buckle

00:11:59.851 --> 00:12:02.121
And she looks up with
her headlamp and

00:12:02.121 --> 00:12:06.358
the entire middle section of my
white shirt was soaked in blood.

00:12:06.691 --> 00:12:10.128
And she screamed and
started freaking out

00:12:10.128 --> 00:12:11.196
and it was from a leech.

00:12:11.196 --> 00:12:13.832
Like, I had no idea,
I never even saw it.

00:12:13.832 --> 00:12:16.035
And just, when they fall off

00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:18.970
they put this sort of
anti-coagulant in you

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.073
and so you continue to bleed.

00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:22.341
So, it didn't
hurt me or anything

00:12:22.341 --> 00:12:24.209
but it looked so gruesome.

00:12:24.209 --> 00:12:25.877
I thought Emily was going
to faint. ( laughs )

00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:28.813
<i> But, the one thing that
 stood out was the water.</i>

00:12:28.813 --> 00:12:31.150
<i>And I think this the reason
that none of use got sick was</i>

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:36.055
<i>because it was the clearest,
bluest best tasting water</i>

00:12:36.055 --> 00:12:37.556
<i> I have ever seen
 in my entire life.</i>

00:12:37.556 --> 00:12:40.626
<i>And I think it's just because
this area is so untrammelled.</i>

00:12:40.626 --> 00:12:43.228
<i>You had springs coming out of
the side of the hills that we--</i>

00:12:43.228 --> 00:12:45.631
<i>you know, we had all these
water pumps and everything</i>

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:48.901
that we just stopped using and
just drank the water straight

00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:51.203
and it was incredible,
and none of us got sick.

00:12:52.004 --> 00:12:53.839
<i> So, going back to
 that town arrest</i>

00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:57.276
<i>the porters didn't wait for us,
for those four days, they left.</i>

00:12:57.676 --> 00:13:01.347
<i>We didn't realize we were
coming right at harvest season.</i>

00:13:01.647 --> 00:13:02.947
So, they all went
back to the fields.

00:13:02.947 --> 00:13:05.451
And so, this was a major issue

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:09.321
and we had enough
gear for 80 porters.

00:13:09.321 --> 00:13:11.356
But, there's not
this porter history

00:13:11.356 --> 00:13:13.792
like there is in Nepal
or India or Pakistan.

00:13:14.226 --> 00:13:17.229
And so,
none of them really cared.

00:13:17.229 --> 00:13:19.030
They thought we were
just crazy people

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:22.067
trying to get into a mountain
with way too much stuff.

00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:26.038
So, at any given point, the most
we had was maybe 30 porters.

00:13:26.438 --> 00:13:28.307
<i> And what happened was</i>

00:13:28.307 --> 00:13:31.043
<i>we had to make some really
tough decisions at this point.</i>

00:13:31.043 --> 00:13:35.681
<i>And that was hang on to those
base camp booties and go home</i>

00:13:35.681 --> 00:13:38.083
<i>or cut a lot of our gear.</i>

00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:41.053
We basically cut about
two-thirds of our gear.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.955
At one point Renan

00:13:42.955 --> 00:13:47.126
who's like this big man's
man was like, in tears.

00:13:47.126 --> 00:13:50.161
Because he had to get rid
of all of his camera stuff.

00:13:50.161 --> 00:13:54.699
I mean, the most incredible...
takeaway from this is

00:13:54.699 --> 00:13:58.970
what Cory and Renan were able
to pull out as far as

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:05.077
video and photography
with literally sharing lenses

00:14:05.077 --> 00:14:08.747
and two camera bodies
and nothing else.
