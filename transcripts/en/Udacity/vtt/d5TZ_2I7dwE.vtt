That Hadoop job command we typed was pretty painful to have to remember.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.540
So to save you time, we've created an alias in the demo virtual

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.910
machine that you'll be downloading. You can just type hs followed by four

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.670
arguments, the mapper script, the reducer script,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.950
the input directory, and the output directory.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.910
Here's one important thing to note, though. When

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.640
you're running a Hadoop job, the output directory must

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.820
not already exist. And as you can see, if we try and run the command with an

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.920
existing directory. In this case, job output. Hadoop

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.550
refuses to run the job. This is actually a

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.550
feature of Hadoop. It's designed to stop you inadvertently

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.890
deleting or overwriting data that's already in the cluster.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.020
But as you can see, if we specify a different directory,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.890
which doesn't already exist, then the job will begin just fine.
