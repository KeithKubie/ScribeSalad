FEMALE SPEAKER: Welcome to
Photographers at Google.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.850
And we are so pleased to
introduce Chris Orwig with us

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:07.950
today.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.440
Chis is a fantastic educator,
speaker, and photographer.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.900
He teaches at Brooks
Institute in Santa Barbara,

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.940
and he also has
videos on lynda.com.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.060
You're going to be in
for big treat today.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.800
His topic today is how
getting better at photography

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.100
can fuel innovation and growth.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.780
And it is my extreme pleasure
to introduce you to Chris Orwig.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.738
CHRIS ORWIG: All right.

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:30.238
Thanks.

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:34.422
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:34.422 --> 00:00:35.380
CHRIS ORWIG: Thank you.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.230
Super excited to be here.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.104
This is a huge honor.

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:41.160
So for me, I am a
photographer and a teacher.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.570
And over the last
decade or so, I've

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.230
had a chance to interact with a
lot of people who were pursuing

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.180
or were in pursuit of getting
better at photography.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.020
And what I've discovered
is that that pursuit,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.000
it somehow ignited
a creative spark.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.080
And that that creative
spark is contagious,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.470
and that it leads to creativity
in other areas of their lives.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.610
It makes people more innovative.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.110
It helps to enrich their life.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.630
So what I want to
focus in on today

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.390
is this whole idea
of how igniting

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.050
that photographic
spark could help

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.010
us to be more creative, more
innovative, and more alive.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.260
Sound good?

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.400
The way that I want
to try to do that is

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.720
to share with you some
photographs, some stories,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.240
and some ideas, which I
hope will change the way

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.280
that you approach
photography, because I

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.710
think our approach
is really key.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.730
And also, hopefully help
you make better photographs.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.910
And so here I'll just show a
few of my pictures to start off.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.200
And I like to capture pictures
of life as it unfolds.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.500
And so I photograph a lot of
different types of things,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.374
whether it's my daughter
here, or a friend up

00:01:46.374 --> 00:01:49.200
in the mountains, or
someone down in the ocean.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.150
And ultimately, for
me, photography really

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.990
distills down to this idea that
the French photographer Marc

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.840
Riboud once said, he said that
"Photography is savoring life

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.680
at 1/100th of a second."

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.850
Savoring life intensely.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:05.910
And I love that idea.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.169
And what I've discovered
is that when I pick up

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.580
a camera, whatever kind of
camera it is, and I hold it up

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.780
and I look through
it, all of a sudden I

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.130
see the world differently, or if
I have a camera on my shoulder

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.490
or in my pocket.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.085
And we've all kind
of experienced

00:02:21.085 --> 00:02:22.460
this in different ways.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.720
For example, I'll go
back to high school.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.380
My brother and I bought a jeep.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.310
Once I started
driving that jeep,

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.952
all of a sudden
what did I notice.

00:02:30.952 --> 00:02:32.410
Of course, we know
this one, right.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.140
Other jeeps.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.490
Like oh, my gosh.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.020
Oh, my gosh.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.270
All of a sudden I'm waving
to all these other guys who

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.740
are driving jeeps, and
they were always there,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.210
it's just that I
couldn't see them.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.980
I was looking, but
I wasn't seeing

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.460
because I didn't have
one myself, right?

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.460
And so the camera somehow
changes, literally,

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.630
what we see, because
it's giving us a chance

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.500
to perhaps look a
little bit deeper.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.430
One of my friends
David duChemin,

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.987
who's kind of a world
humanitarian photographer I

00:02:59.987 --> 00:03:01.070
think said it pretty well.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.640
He said, "The camera first
opened up my eyes, and then

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.725
my heart, to a
world of wonders."

00:03:07.725 --> 00:03:08.830
And I think that's true.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.770
The camera somehow affects
how we experience life.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.360
And the interesting thing
about photography I think now

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.020
is that really we are
all photographers,

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.650
to a greater or lesser degree.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.920
I can remember a time
when this wasn't so.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.850
I remember when photography
was only an elective.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.760
It was optional, like
high school photography.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.260
Or maybe it was something you'd
do on a really epic vacation.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.230
But what I've discovered,
what we all know now

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.850
is that photography is something
that happens all the time.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.020
I can remember going to my first
concert not too far from here,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.247
and I snuck in a camera.

00:03:46.247 --> 00:03:48.080
Did any of you ever do
that back in the day?

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.382
And it was a big deal.

00:03:49.382 --> 00:03:51.840
And I had this camera, and I
pull it out and take a picture

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.690
and then hide it.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.590
And flash forward to, I
saw the same band recently

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.630
and there's tens of
thousands of cameras

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.160
taking videos and stills now.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.140
And it's part of our life.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.520
And I almost like to think
about photography a little bit

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.810
like the Gutenberg press.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.500
So Gutenberg press happened
600 years ago, approximately,

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.100
right?

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.600
And all of a sudden
it was this boom

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.170
of literacy, and curiosity,
and innovation, and knowledge,

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.279
and whatnot.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.316
And I think now,
perhaps, it's the camera

00:04:20.316 --> 00:04:22.440
in our pocket, whatever
that is, or the one that we

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.390
have with us which is creating
a different type of a boom.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.000
It's a different
type of a literacy.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.032
At the same time, something
fascinating is happening.

00:04:31.032 --> 00:04:32.990
That's why there are all
these statistics which

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.490
are thrown around, like 300
million photographs today will

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.216
be posted on Facebook.

00:04:37.216 --> 00:04:38.590
And that's an
interesting number.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.290
But I'm more interested in
the number 100 years from now,

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.070
right?

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.840
What will that be?

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.840
And how will we look
back on now and say well,

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.990
what is photography
now that it's something

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.930
that we all do to
different degrees?

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.020
And why I'm saying
all this, and why

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.810
I think this is
kind of important

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.100
is because I think
the photograph has

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.180
a different value.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.810
It's a different way to
communicate and convey.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.490
And I think getting
good at photography

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.010
isn't just an option.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.160
Rather, it's get
good at photography.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.360
Pursue getting better
or be left behind.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.470
Because somehow
photography is this force.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.440
It's this part of what we do.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.070
It's no longer kind of fringe.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.920
It's mainstream.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.390
Are you with me on that?

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.820
And so what we
have to do is then

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.570
say, well, what is
a good photograph?

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.710
And so I'll pause
just for a second,

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.900
and we did this just
before the talk,

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.770
but I want to do it again, to
get you re-thinking about that.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.160
Ask your neighbor, what
is a good photograph?

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.660
Go for it.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.576
Let's take 30 seconds
to answer that question.

00:05:38.576 --> 00:05:40.820
[AUDIENCE TALKING]

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.955
What a good photograph
is is really contingent

00:05:42.955 --> 00:05:44.104
upon on who we are.

00:05:44.104 --> 00:05:46.270
And sometimes what people
do and your photo teachers

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.440
show you a picture
and say is it good?

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.105
And then I'll say well, what's
the point, or what's it for?

00:05:51.105 --> 00:05:52.730
Do you want to hang
it on your wall, do

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.180
you want it to be in a
gallery, is this for education?

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.570
What's the intent?

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.700
And so the intent really drives
if a photograph is good or not.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.862
Yet we still all sort
of have this idea

00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:04.070
that we know the difference
between photographs which

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.750
are mediocre, blah,
a little bit empty,

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.040
and ones which are
magnificent and compel.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.820
And so in this pursuit
I think it really

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.297
is this transition from
mediocre to magnificent.

00:06:15.297 --> 00:06:16.880
And I think there
is this idea that we

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.120
have to start thinking about
that we are all photographers.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.220
And that this dividing line
between the pro and the amateur

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.060
has become blurred.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.320
And maybe isn't even as
relevant as it was before.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.650
Now, this makes a few
people nervous on both sides

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.990
of the spectrum.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.310
But on the amateur or
the enthusiast side,

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.830
the person who isn't getting
paid for it, sometimes what

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.480
will happen, at least
in my experience,

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.870
is I'll be shooting
or something,

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.950
or they'll be taking pictures
and then I'll walk up

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.450
and they're like
oh, you're the pro.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.280
Like you'll take
the real pictures.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.600
But that isn't how it works.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.330
I think the amateur has a
really distinct advantage,

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.790
especially even when you're
taking a photograph of a dog,

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.700
especially if you're
an ambitious amateur.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.340
And I think the ambitious
amateur has at least

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.290
these three things
going for them.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.270
This advantage over
the rest of us.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.980
First one is possibility.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.660
Shunryu Suzuki once said
that "In the beginner's mind,

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.720
the possibilities are endless.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.220
In the experts, they're few."

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.819
The amateur says well,
why not set my dog up

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:18.610
on this little railing
and ask it to smile?

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:19.818
And that's what the lady did.

00:07:19.818 --> 00:07:22.030
It was awesome.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.650
The expert's like no,
there's too many dog pictures

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.515
out there.

00:07:25.515 --> 00:07:27.630
The amateur says why not?

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.250
The next one is passion.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.750
The word amateur, as I'm
sure some of us know,

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.080
it comes from the French and the
Latin words which means love.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.770
And so someone who's
an amateur does

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.650
something because of that
passion, because they love it,

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.450
because they just want to do it.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.730
And that's why most
photographs are made today.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.830
And then the last one is growth.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:52.660
Edison said, "Discontent is the
first necessity of innovation."

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.830
Or invention-- discontent.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.834
And I think the amateur knows
that they can get better.

00:07:57.834 --> 00:07:59.500
How many of you have
taken bad pictures,

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.520
like horribly bad pictures.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.950
Like oh, my gosh.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.490
There's so much more
potential for growth.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:09.640
And every pro photographer
I know who's a really, not

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.376
every pro, but a lot
of the pros I know,

00:08:11.376 --> 00:08:13.250
they're trying to recover
these three things.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.590
They're trying to say, well,
what are the possibilities?

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.190
What's possible here?

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.910
I want to rekindle that
passion for what I'm doing.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:21.750
And I also want
to continually say

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.360
that photography
is about growth.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.680
It's something that's
different than other things.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.980
You never arrive.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.370
There's no badge, right, that
says you now have arrived

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.210
and you take great pictures
and will continue to do so.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.669
Most great
photographers will say

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:38.429
they're only as good as
their last photograph.

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:40.850
And so if you can say,
well this is about growth

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.460
and this is about
moving forward,

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.570
then those bad pictures
are sometimes OK.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.470
And what we need to do is say
taking good pictures maybe

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.610
is the end goal, but getting
there requires bad photographs.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.120
So similar to writing, right?

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.620
There are very few writers
that sit down and pen something

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.750
and then hand it
off and it's done.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.440
There is process.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.400
Perhaps this process-- well,
it became really clear to me

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.040
when my mom took me my brother
and sister on a field trip

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.532
to the Hostess factory.

00:09:10.532 --> 00:09:11.365
We were little kids.

00:09:11.365 --> 00:09:12.480
It was summertime.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.680
And my mom's a crazy artist.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.380
So she took us on
this field trip

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.060
and we saw how Hostess
Twinkies were made.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.890
Now, obviously disgusting now.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.140
They don't even exist anymore.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.890
But back then as a kid,
these things were amazing.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.747
And we saw sugar and
flour in a big vat,

00:09:24.747 --> 00:09:27.080
stirred around, and go through
a process, and eventually

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.960
a Twinkie.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.320
And for us as kids
it was like, wow,

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.870
that's the same sugar
and flour that we have.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:36.340
And then it's the process that
results in something else.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.260
And so photography
I think is something

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.910
which is a very similar
type of a thing.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.185
And part of getting good at it
takes really asking yourself

00:09:45.185 --> 00:09:46.160
well, who are we?

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.580
What's a good photograph to me?

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:52.110
One of my photographic mentor
Rodney Smith here, has really

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.740
helped me realize that
who we are, who you are,

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.430
determines the
photographs that you make.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.610
And there's this
distinct connection

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.980
between who we are and
between our pictures.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.550
So Rodney, he's a really
fascinating person.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.550
He's incredibly
thoughtful, he's profound,

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.530
he has this really
interesting sense of humor.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.870
So obviously, these are
couple of his photographs,

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.030
those things show
up in his pictures.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.630
And what I've found is it
that the more closely that

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.810
our pictures reflect who we are,
the better those photographs

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:19.480
are.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.700
And in a sense, the
photographs that we take

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.340
are a bit of a
mirror to who we are.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.550
Elliott Erwitt put it this
way, another photographer.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:29.580
He said, "Photography has little
to do with the things you see,

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.560
and everything to do with
the way that you see them."

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.270
That's why when you capture a
photograph, it is, in a sense,

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:37.770
a mirror.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.570
These are a couple
portraits that I made.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.820
And so what is
this mirror saying?

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.580
Well, you can kind of tell that
I respect these guys, right?

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.210
A world famous
surfer on the left,

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.820
and Yvon Chouinard, a great
adventurer, outdoorsman,

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.000
founded Patagonia.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.930
You can tell that I admire
their strength of character,

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.910
and that I'm really
interested in their eyes

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:57.993
and their presence, right?

00:10:57.993 --> 00:10:59.240
Can you see those things?

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.630
And if we can make photographs
that reflect this most clearly,

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.920
typically they're stronger
than the other ones.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.840
The photographs that are the
worst pictures that I've made,

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.680
those are the ones that are a
mirror that's kind of fogged up

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.997
after you take a shower.

00:11:11.997 --> 00:11:13.580
And you can't really
see through them.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.420
You almost have to wipe it off,
and then even after you wipe it

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.250
off, you can't really
see what's happening.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.860
The best pictures are
the ones you're like wow,

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.389
I know who took that.

00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:23.430
I need to see their name.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.960
I know that's so
and so's photograph.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.470
Or that expresses what's
kind of on the inside, what

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.170
I'm trying to
communicate or convey,

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.430
and I'm getting that in a frame.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:36.340
One of the ways that we
do this as photographers

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.540
is that we use the frame.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.790
The photographic frame's
kind of an interesting thing.

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.420
And for a second, pretend
that you had never seen one.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.620
What you might ask is
why isn't it a circle?

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.420
It'd be easy to do.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.520
Like why don't we have
circular photographs?

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.030
For some reason, we have
these linear lines, right,

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.990
and we have a line
which is usually

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:55.380
a rectangle or a square.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:59.160
And we use these lines to
somehow eliminate clutter,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.320
or eliminate things
from what we see.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.321
And in order to get
good at photographs,

00:12:03.321 --> 00:12:04.820
we have to pay
attention, obviously,

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.190
to what we're capturing.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.190
But perhaps more importantly
is what we aren't capturing.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.400
We have to start to think about
how we can frame and reframe.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.750
And I want to hit this
topic just a little bit,

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:18.050
because I think this is where
stuff gets kind of interesting.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.770
This is where who we
are and the way we see

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.920
effects the pictures.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.590
And I want to start with
sort of a walk-by photograph.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:27.220
Have you ever had the moment,
you walk by something,

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.719
you're like, oh,
that's pretty cool,

00:12:28.719 --> 00:12:30.330
and you take the picture, right?

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.335
And this happens to
us, I think, a lot,

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:34.210
especially when you have
your camera with you

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:35.793
because you're sort
of looking for it.

00:12:35.793 --> 00:12:39.070
You're peripherally aware
that might look interesting.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:41.130
And so I was visiting a
friend, Robert Gupta who

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.934
plays for the LA Phil at the
Disney Concert Hall in LA.

00:12:43.934 --> 00:12:46.100
And it was early in the
morning, the sun was rising.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.110
It's like oh, this is beautiful.

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.840
It's interesting.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.432
And this is just the image kind
of straight out of the camera.

00:12:51.432 --> 00:12:53.140
But what, perhaps, is
more interesting is

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.180
the picture I took
right beforehand.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.900
And this one reveals, I
think, how the camera sees.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.100
It's not good at all, right?

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.260
It's clutter, there's
the road and everything.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.987
And what happened I think when
I took the picture is I held it

00:13:03.987 --> 00:13:06.070
up, and all of a sudden
when I held up the camera,

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.220
it blocked out the
city buildings,

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.280
and it blocked out the
trash that was over there.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.900
And I'm like yes, and then I
just zeroed in on the subject.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.530
Yet what we have to
do in photography

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:18.200
is zero in on the subject and
then travel around the frame

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.180
and say well,
what's on the edge?

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.070
And the art of
learning how to reframe

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:26.160
helps us to create images which
are more clear, which convey,

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.900
which somehow draw people in,
which changed from something

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.234
which is mediocre or to
maybe even magnificent.

00:13:32.234 --> 00:13:34.150
And I don't think this
picture is quite there,

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.264
but I think it illustrates
an interesting point.

00:13:36.264 --> 00:13:37.430
Let's take another scenario.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:40.160
This is not a
walk-by photograph,

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.750
but one which I'm
trying to set up.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.170
Sometimes you go out and you
find pictures on accidents.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.590
Other times you try to
sort of make pictures.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.230
This is one I'm trying to make.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:53.610
This is Jack O'Neill in
his home in Santa Cruz,

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.491
looking out over the
ocean at some surfers.

00:13:56.491 --> 00:13:58.240
And this is the guy
who's often attributed

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.550
to having invented the wetsuit.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.310
And I love the sport of
surfing and I love the ocean.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.709
So I love the fact
that we have wetsuits.

00:14:06.709 --> 00:14:07.750
I'm grateful to this guy.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.810
So I want to create a
portrait which is timeless,

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:13.440
and which really communicates
and conveys about who he is.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.900
And so this was the frame,
the one that I liked.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.560
But again, I'll show you the
one before in just a second.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.654
Yet before I do I have to
share a quick side story.

00:14:21.654 --> 00:14:23.820
You know, when I met him
and I was talking with him,

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.180
I noticed that his eye patch was
made out of wetsuit material.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:30.120
And so, like a smart person,
or smart person that I am,

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.670
I said, oh Jack,
I noticed your eye

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.090
patch is made of
wetsuit material.

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:33.750
Why is that?

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.544
He said, "Well, how else would
I keep my eye socket warm

00:14:36.544 --> 00:14:37.335
when I go surfing?"

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:38.215
I was like, right.

00:14:38.215 --> 00:14:39.914
OK.

00:14:39.914 --> 00:14:40.850
Duh.

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:43.700
But here was the first picture.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.350
Isn't very good
again, and here's why.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.070
It isn't very good because he's
a little bit disengaged, right?

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:50.300
He's not quite looking at me.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.634
He's sort of looking a little
bit just over my shoulder.

00:14:52.634 --> 00:14:54.550
Have you ever had that
experience where you're

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:57.030
talking with someone and they're
not quite talking to you.

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:59.630
And you're just not--
you're not there, right?

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.560
And then the light
isn't-- the light's fine,

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.814
but it's not hitting him good.

00:15:02.814 --> 00:15:04.730
His shoulder's a little
bit too far in, right?

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:05.750
He needs to open up.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:06.950
And then all of a sudden
you're like well, those

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:09.450
are his pots and pans,
and that's his kitchen.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.350
And the portrait I want to
make isn't Jack in is home.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.450
The portrait I want to make is
sort of Jack O'Neill, the man,

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:16.344
the myth, the legend.

00:15:16.344 --> 00:15:18.010
This person who looks
like a pirate, who

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.500
invented the wetsuit, whose
house hangs out over the ocean.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:25.050
And in this case, the reframing,
all it took was two feet.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:26.261
Two feet to the right.

00:15:26.261 --> 00:15:28.760
And we're just saying hey, well
Jack, why don't you sit here

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.870
and then I'll take that frame.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.840
A very simple reframe.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.900
And that's how good
photographs happen.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.472
But in order for that to happen,
we have to have that mindset.

00:15:38.472 --> 00:15:40.430
Maybe it's the rough
draft and the final draft,

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.054
but whatever it is,
but it's reframing.

00:15:42.054 --> 00:15:44.660
It's the first photo of the
building, the walk-by photo,

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.107
and then the second one which
says I'm a photographer.

00:15:47.107 --> 00:15:49.440
And you can't say well, I'm
only an amateur photographer

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.700
because then the second
frame won't happen, right?

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.040
And so we have to get into that.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.510
My friend who's a
travel photographer,

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:55.926
he shoots for
National Geographic,

00:15:55.926 --> 00:15:58.100
all these amazing publications.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.140
What he says is when
you're traveling,

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.640
the first day, if
you have two days,

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.760
the first day you take
the postcard shots.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.360
So if you're in San Francisco
you get the Golden Gate Bridge,

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.250
and you get the
Transameri-- whatever it is.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.011
The next day you do the
work of a photographer.

00:16:11.011 --> 00:16:13.010
He says if you have 10
minutes with the subject,

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.930
the first five minutes you do
the postcard, the obvious shot.

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.890
Then the second five minutes you
do the work of a photographer.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:20.610
And that's all
about that reframe.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:21.740
You with me on that?

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.260
Reframe.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.080
Mediocre to magnificent.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.130
And this, I thought this would
be a fun photo because one

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:29.580
of the early tag lines for
O'Neill wetsuits was it's

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.940
always summer on the inside.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.790
And that's a perfect reframe.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:35.960
I mean those guys were
so cold it's miserable.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.460
And any of you who have been
in the ocean without a wetsuit,

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.760
you can't even use your hands.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.330
I remember getting
out of the water

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.280
and you would hold
your car keys like this

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.905
because you couldn't
open your car door

00:16:45.905 --> 00:16:47.390
and you're just so cold.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.920
And he invented this thing
which was about warmth,

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.490
and he came up with
this great reframe.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.110
And reframe is
something, I think,

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:57.070
the artists, athletes,
and inventors do.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.020
And somehow it's
that reframe, which

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.200
not only affects what we see,
but kind of affects who we are.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.500
So I know this from experience.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.985
So for me, one of the reasons
why I'm a photographer

00:17:06.985 --> 00:17:09.494
is I was hit by a car and I
was in a lot of chronic pain.

00:17:09.494 --> 00:17:11.410
And I've kind of told
this story other places,

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:12.660
so I'll just make it short.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.539
But I had all of this pain,
and my dad gave me this camera,

00:17:15.539 --> 00:17:18.069
and I held it up to my
eye, and all of a sudden I

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:19.440
could reframe.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:23.319
All of a sudden I found beauty,
and hope, and wonder, even

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:24.490
in despair.

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:28.040
And the camera somehow gave
me this little bit of a gift.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.870
Or maybe going back to, let's
say, the Gutenberg press,

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.750
which I mentioned earlier.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:36.430
The Gutenberg press was invented
in Germany, in wine country.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.210
And so Gutenberg, he
took a wine press,

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.990
and rather than pressing grapes,
which he had done many times,

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.560
he changed it to press letters.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.780
He went from grapes to letters.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:46.670
He reframed.

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:48.590
He took something that
was already there.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.450
Printable type was invented in
China like the way before that,

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.330
but somehow he just took
this thing and made it new.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.900
And so what we have to do, if
we want to be really creative,

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:57.890
is do that.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:02.430
And I think photography,
in a sense, is an act.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:04.240
It's a statement.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.340
And if we have a camera,
again, pocket or whatever,

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.830
every time we hold
it up to our eye,

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:12.804
we're saying am I just going to
take what the world gives me?

00:18:12.804 --> 00:18:14.970
I'm walking by-- here it
is, the world gave me that.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:15.810
Boom.

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:21.430
Or am I going to exercise my own
creative power and potential?

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:23.200
Am I going to do more?

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.520
And the more that
reframe with the camera,

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.240
I think the more we can
reframe in other ways.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.770
For example, I remember when
I was early in my career

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:32.460
and I was working
in an ad agency,

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.960
and there was this one person
who would get mad a lot.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.790
Like when it was time for
critique of a project,

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:40.820
he would rant and rave and
arm slam, the whole thing.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.570
And once that happened to me
where he was doing his thing

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:45.170
and he said, I'm
so mad about this.

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:46.560
And I sa well, what
are you mad about that?

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.280
And he's like this and that.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.230
I said, great.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.470
And then we moved on and we
developed a relationship.

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.960
So rather than cowering,
I said I'm just

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.080
going to try to reframe.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.620
I'm going to try to bend
this a different way,

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:58.210
or maybe its spin,
or whatever it is.

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.770
And the more we can do those
things, perhaps the more

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.880
innovation, maybe
even the more life,

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.820
and in photography at least,
the better photographs.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:11.170
Aristotle said the
aim of art isn't

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:14.110
to display the outward
appearance of things,

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:16.920
but their inward significance.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.620
The aim of art isn't
the outward appearance,

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:23.860
but their inward significance.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.230
And I think in photography
we get hung up on the visual,

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:27.480
right, because
that's the end goal.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.063
Like yeah, look at
that, it's amazing.

00:19:29.063 --> 00:19:32.480
But really it's about that inner
truth, or that inner meaning.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.480
Are you with me on that?

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.360
Why some photographs
are good to us

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.340
is because they have some
sort of significance.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.465
Not just because it's like
that's a pretty picture.

00:19:39.465 --> 00:19:40.440
That's my favorite.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.430
That doesn't really
happen, right?

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:45.760
But yeah, that's a pretty
picture, and it's my daughter,

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.670
and it's when she was two.

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:49.190
And I remember that moment.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:51.000
I remember that moment
from that photograph

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.700
because she looked up at me, and
she looked up at me and said,

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.940
dad-- and this is
my daughter Annie.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.950
She said, dad,
you have rainbows!

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:01.470
And I said why are you
talking-- She's like, no,

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.040
you have rainbows!

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.000
And she was talking about
the wrinkles on my forehead.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.620
And she counted them,
and she would kiss them.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.410
And this is my favorite feature
of my body, my rainbows.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.450
They're just going to
get better with time.

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:16.470
And my other two daughters, now
they talk about my rainbows.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.770
And again, it was that
inner significance,

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.040
that moment perhaps.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.990
And what we do as photographers,
we tell stories with light.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:25.390
The word photography,
as we know,

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.470
comes from that Greek
word photos and graphos.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:30.260
It's light and writing,
writing with light.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.390
In the visual arts,
photography is

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.830
all about how do we convey,
communicate with light.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.780
But the trick, of course, is
we can't go to an art store

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.740
and buy ink or pencils
like other artists,

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.040
visual artists can do.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.290
We can't go by lights, right?

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:47.820
We have to sort of pursue
it and discover it.

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.480
And it's this bit of
this chase almost.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.340
I like to think of the pursuit
of light similar to what

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:57.000
my tribe or my friends do
when they pursue waves.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.204
Does anyone know
a surfer in here?

00:20:59.204 --> 00:21:00.370
They're crazy people, right?

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:02.286
And what they do is they
go to the far corners

00:21:02.286 --> 00:21:03.810
of the world looking for waves.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:05.800
And they find waves
because of their search

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.330
in all of these unlikely places.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:11.870
And they only find them
because they're on the hunt.

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:13.860
And the same thing's
true with photography.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.880
Like with these two
pictures, both of them

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.310
sort of happened by accident.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.510
With the one on the right,
this happened about a week ago.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:23.290
I was driving down a dirt
road and the sun was rising,

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:25.524
and I know dirt
and sun and light,

00:21:25.524 --> 00:21:26.690
and I was like there's got--

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:28.130
And I was oh, stop the car.

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:28.900
Jump out.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:29.660
Capture the frame.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:31.840
The dust settled and
the moment was gone.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.700
But it was that
pursuit, that awareness,

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.370
that light is here or around.

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.270
And it's there, maybe
just around the corner.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:40.840
We can discover it.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.780
And if you believe in light,
perhaps you might even find it.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.814
And with this other
one, I was shooting

00:21:46.814 --> 00:21:48.980
the opposite direction, but
the light was too harsh,

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:50.438
and then all of a
sudden it was oh.

00:21:50.438 --> 00:21:52.900
And it was, again, it
was that turnaround.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.070
And that whole
pursuit of lightness

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:58.050
may sound a little bit of
a stretch for some people,

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:02.060
but I think that that
search brings new life.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:05.540
If you do a Google
search for light,

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.920
and read some of the entries,
or the Wikipedia entry,

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.600
or whatever it is, it will say
that almost every thing that's

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:16.790
alive on planet Earth can
trace its life back to light.

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.680
Light is like the
great source of life.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.010
You with me on that?

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:24.130
I mean light gives life.

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:25.540
And if that's what
you're looking

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.980
for, somehow that
effects you, right?

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.672
Because, again, you start
to see it and notice it,

00:22:30.672 --> 00:22:32.880
and it changes, I think,
how you appreciate the world

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.940
and what you see.

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.490
This, though, of course, isn't
just a Pollyanna pursuit.

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:39.910
This isn't about go
photograph sunsets

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:43.650
or sunrises and puppy dogs.

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:47.620
I think the pursuit of
light is something more.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.380
Dylan Thomas, "Do not go
gentle into that good night,

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:55.690
but rage, rage, against
the dying of the light."

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:59.600
This is something
that all artists know.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.080
Light, and the passage of time.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.200
We all know that one day
the lights of our life

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.200
will be gone.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:11.170
The reason why I decided
to pursue photography,

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.410
I began, perhaps, because
I was hit by a car.

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:16.160
But then I pursued it because
I was in graduate school.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.780
I wasn't studying
photography, but I

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.270
was required to
volunteer in a hospital.

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:22.210
And I was assigned
to the floor where

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:25.920
people were being treated
for, wrestling with, and dying

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.310
from cancer.

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.240
And my job was to
sit and just listen.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.830
To be a neutral party who would
just spend time with them.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.900
And what I discovered
is that by spending time

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.330
with people who are dying,
you can't help but learn

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:41.010
about life.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:47.200
In this pursuit of light, I
think is somehow tied to life

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.240
itself.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.900
The camera, in my experience,
is an amazing teacher.

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.530
That's one of the reasons why
I think we like photography.

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:57.140
It helps us to
remember things, right?

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.250
You see something
interesting, you're

00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:59.570
like oh, I'll remember that.

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:01.530
It's also helped us to
really savor moments.

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:02.946
Like so I was
talking with someone

00:24:02.946 --> 00:24:04.240
earlier who photographs food.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.906
When you photograph
food you're like oh,

00:24:05.906 --> 00:24:08.170
I just want to remember
and kind of savor this

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:09.670
before I gobble it up.

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.680
And it also teaches us
something about time.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.420
And there's a
proverb in the Bible

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.370
which says teach us
to number our days

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:18.490
so that we can be wise.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.340
And I think having
this prospectus

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:23.290
makes us realize
life is precious.

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:25.580
And sometimes when you
look back at photographs,

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.000
you learn this truth.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.960
Somehow it can sort of
wrinkle the fabric of time.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.380
And this is a small picture,
but a very important one.

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.965
This is a photograph
of my dad, one

00:24:35.965 --> 00:24:38.420
of the most important
people in my life.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:41.100
The reason I am who I
am in a lot of ways.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:42.880
And there he is with
my oldest daughter.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.287
It's a few years old.

00:24:44.287 --> 00:24:46.120
And when you capture a
photograph like this,

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.940
what you're doing is you're
savoring that moment.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.900
Ah, this is great, my
dad and my daughter.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.000
But then when you look
at it, what happens

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.920
is I realize that's me.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.910
That's me who he used
to hold, and that's

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:59.560
me who now holds her.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.240
And then it goes backwards,
but it also goes forwards.

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.860
And I think one day, even
now as I look at this,

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.830
I realize that I'm going
to look at this photograph

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.230
in the future when
my dad's gone.

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:15.270
And I'm going to look at this
with just immense sadness.

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:17.929
And that's part of the
beauty of this moment.

00:25:17.929 --> 00:25:19.720
And the thing that's
interesting about this

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.779
is photographically
speaking, rule of thirds

00:25:21.779 --> 00:25:24.070
and all these different rules,
it isn't even that good,

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:25.920
but it's good to me.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.830
And sometimes the
best photographs

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:29.730
are the ones which have
that meaning, which

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:31.780
somehow reflect who we are.

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.890
And maybe even shape
the way that we

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:37.630
experience and understand time.

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:40.040
Part of photography,
obviously, is story, right?

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.670
And sometimes the way
that we tell stories

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:47.080
are these little teeny slices
of life stories from daily life.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.380
And again, I'm a dad
with three daughters.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.370
I love my girls, so I have
to show a few photos of them.

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:56.030
But in these photos, we have
Annie, my oldest daughter,

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:57.960
who was little in
that previous picture.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.860
And there she is with
curlers in her hair.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:02.057
The first time she ever
had curlers in her hair,

00:26:02.057 --> 00:26:03.640
and she's sitting
in her grandmother's

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.222
rocking chair with her youngest
sister, and she's tickling her.

00:26:07.222 --> 00:26:08.430
And there's that great laugh.

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:11.420
And then on the left we
have Elsie, the third kid

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.720
in our family, the one who
has to go and feed herself.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.580
When everyone else
eating breakfast,

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.320
she's not getting food, she
just goes in and goes for it.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.800
And it captures these
small little stories.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.520
And so the stories that
we tell and try to convey

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.470
are really, really important.

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:27.520
And sometimes they're
slice of life stories.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.700
Those are important, but those
aren't professional pictures.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:31.760
Who cares?

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.740
That's where that amateur
advantage comes in.

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:34.900
You with me on that?

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.160
Sometimes those
are more important

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.077
than the big pictures.

00:26:38.077 --> 00:26:39.909
And there are other
stories to tell as well.

00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:41.740
Sometimes, perhaps,
they're more subtle.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.650
Sometimes there's
maybe a narrative arc.

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:46.380
This photograph,
my friend Martin,

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.685
best friend in
the world, here he

00:26:48.685 --> 00:26:51.690
is at Witch's Rock in
Costa Rica, where he lives.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:54.400
He doesn't live at Witch's Rock,
but he lives in Costa Rica.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.829
We're surfing at this
really famous surf spot.

00:26:56.829 --> 00:26:58.620
Have any of you ever
seen surf photographs?

00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.650
Like kind of picture
one in your head.

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:01.770
A guy doing a maneuver,
guy in a wave, that's it.

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:02.510
End of story.

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:04.150
I've seen it a million times.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:05.920
I didn't want that picture.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.570
And Witch's Rock, if
I were to show you

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:09.611
all of Witch's Rock, which
is hidden by the wave,

00:27:09.611 --> 00:27:11.200
you'd be like ah, Witch's Rock.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.230
Nice one, Chris.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.200
But I hid it.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:13.972
I got low.

00:27:13.972 --> 00:27:15.180
So I'm swimming in the water.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.960
And it's a moment before
he catches the wave, right?

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.400
It's that little narrative arc.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.070
And I love what
E.M. Forster says

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:22.530
about narrative versus plot.

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:24.400
He says this.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.730
Says that "Plot
is the queen died,

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:30.410
the King died, end of story.

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:33.320
Narrative, the queen died.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.200
The King died of heart break."

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.210
Two little words, but all
of a sudden there's a story.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:42.420
And all of a sudden, the story
adds some sort of meaning.

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.390
And it's that
connective thread which

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:47.834
somehow makes the
photograph a bit stronger.

00:27:47.834 --> 00:27:49.500
So to keep you guys
with me because I've

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.520
been talking a lot, I'm
going to take another 30

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.552
seconds, conversation with
our neighbor, which is--

00:27:54.552 --> 00:27:56.010
and if you're
watching this online,

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:58.689
you could maybe pause and
ask yourself this question.

00:27:58.689 --> 00:27:59.730
And the question is this.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:03.474
Neighbor, what is something
which has resonated with you?

00:28:03.474 --> 00:28:05.140
Something that has
been said that you're

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:07.450
going to sort of put in your
pocket and walk away with?

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:10.310
It could be as simple as
reframe, that's my thing.

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:12.140
Or it could be something else.

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:13.200
So we have 30 seconds.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.670
Ask your neighbor,
neighbor, what

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:18.150
is the one thing so
far that resonates?

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:18.990
Go for it.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.525
[AUDIENCE TALKING]

00:28:20.525 --> 00:28:22.420
Are you guys enjoying
things so far?

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.970
Gain some interesting
insight to photography?

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:26.450
Hopefully, a little
bit different.

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:28.020
So I give you
Jackie Robinson who

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.330
said "Life isn't a
spectator sport."

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:34.160
and I think we could trade the
word life with photography.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.830
Photography isn't
a spectator sport.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:38.410
But unfortunately, for
so many of us it is.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:40.650
We sort of look at
pictures from a distance.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:42.730
Or someone talks about
photography, maybe myself,

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:44.260
and you're like, wow,
that's a great picture,

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:45.890
but it doesn't do
anything for you.

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:48.139
And what you have to say is
well, what do I take away,

00:28:48.139 --> 00:28:50.570
and then how does that affect
the photographs that I make?

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:52.260
And each time you
see photographs,

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.010
I think it's helpful
to ask that question,

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:55.680
why is this resonating?

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.650
And why is this resonating
with me right now?

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:01.110
What makes this photograph good?

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:03.360
The more we can start to
shape and form and answer

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.320
that question, the
more we can, then,

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:09.020
create those photographs which
actually mirror who we are,

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:13.440
versus just say something
plain, mediocre and blah.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.860
All right.

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.640
Ben Harper, the musician.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:20.240
"Sometimes the story
or the narrative arc

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.990
is best when it's subtle."

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:25.790
Moments before I took
this picture of him,

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.150
there was someone else
capturing a photograph of him.

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:30.610
And she was trying
to get Ben to smile.

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:34.520
And Ben's kind of the uber
cool rock star musician guy.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.510
And she was saying, Ben,
smile, smile, smile.

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:40.090
And finally she said,
Ben, say cheese.

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:41.570
And he snapped back.

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:44.950
And he said, lady, I
smile with my eyes.

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:47.610
She was kind of frustrated
and then walked away.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:50.150
And then in my
picture I think he is.

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:54.250
He isn't showing his teeth, but
I think there's a smile there.

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:58.400
And sometimes in photography,
the best photographs

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.380
are those ones which
sort of just draw you in.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:05.580
There's a subtlety to it
which keeps pulling you in.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.270
There are other pictures which
are big and bold, you walk by,

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:09.561
you can't help but notice them.

00:30:09.561 --> 00:30:12.140
But it's almost like it's
too loud or too much.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.110
It's stewed with too
much seasoning or salt,

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:17.115
or it's music which is
just that much too loud.

00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:18.220
Are you with me on that?

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.810
But the art which really
resonates and really stirs

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:24.590
and connects is the one
sometimes where that narrative

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:29.700
arc is just those two little
words, died of heart break,

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:32.506
or whatever it is, or a
smile, perhaps, with the eyes.

00:30:32.506 --> 00:30:34.880
And the beauty of these kind
of things is in photography,

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.754
say like for me, I love
photographing people.

00:30:36.754 --> 00:30:40.160
All of a sudden Ben Harper
taught me an important lesson.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:43.610
Happiness and smile isn't
just right here, right?

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:45.000
It can be the face.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.280
You can see someone
smiling with their posture.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.790
Just the way they're standing.

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.253
You can see a tree
that's smiling,

00:30:50.253 --> 00:30:55.630
or a tree that's really just
weathered, and sad, and worn.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:59.060
And the expression
isn't always typical.

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:01.420
It isn't always obvious.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.580
Sir William Empson wrote
about literature this way.

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:07.187
I like to compare literature
and writing to starter fuel.

00:31:07.187 --> 00:31:09.270
He said, "Great literature
makes us think and feel

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:13.070
conflicting things
at the same time."

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:15.710
And sometimes what that means
is we can see a photograph

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:19.020
and we can have these
different feelings all at once.

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.300
This is a picture of
another world famous surfer,

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.800
world champion surfer.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.010
And this photograph
was captured the year

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:28.850
that he lost his
18-year-old son.

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:30.400
And I think in this
photograph, now

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.860
that you know that, you
can kind of see that.

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.790
You can see that
there's strength,

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:38.020
there's a life well lived,
there's strong character,

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.500
but there's a bit of sadness.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.207
And sometimes when it comes to
stories, especially when we're

00:31:43.207 --> 00:31:45.540
new to writing stories, we
think it has to be one thing.

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.740
It's just like a strong
story, or it's just a--

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.180
But no, the story's, and
the music, and the art

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.810
that we like the most, it
has this duality to it.

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:55.630
This subtlety to it.

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:58.090
And so, what we have
to do is as we think

00:31:58.090 --> 00:31:59.694
about creating our
own photographs,

00:31:59.694 --> 00:32:01.610
or creating better
photographs, because that's

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:04.840
why we're all here, right, is
say well, how do we do that?

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.790
One way I think
is by simplifying.

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:11.420
And this isn't just simplifying
reframing, like we said.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:14.350
This is simplifying
more like the poet.

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:17.890
The poet will take what the
novelist does in 20,000 words

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:20.520
and say it in 20.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.240
And after a poem,
what I found is we

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.690
not only have more information,
but we have more experience,

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:27.720
and somehow they
reduce and simplify.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.580
But not just that.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.250
It's like a reduction,
a simplification,

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:33.400
and then they also deepen.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.350
If you don't like
poetry, take song lyrics.

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:37.100
Usually a song's only
three minutes long.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.862
If a song's 20 minutes
long, it's just too much.

00:32:39.862 --> 00:32:41.570
It's like they're
going on and on and on.

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:44.780
But when you reduce and
simplify it to something,

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.870
somehow you can say more.

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:49.910
And so some of the pictures
that are interesting,

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:52.020
or as you start to
compose those pictures,

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:56.280
is to ask yourself well,
how can I work like a poet?

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:59.650
And what poets do is
something which is intriguing.

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:02.930
W.B. Yeats gives us some
insight into the life

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:04.940
of a poet with these lines.

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:07.250
"A line will take us hours.

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:09.990
Yet if it doesn't seem
a moment's thought,

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:14.790
our stitching and
unstitching has been naught."

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:17.814
Ever seen a fake photograph--
posed, overproduced?

00:33:17.814 --> 00:33:19.980
Have you ever listened to
music that's overproduced?

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.110
It's just too perf--
and you're like--

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:24.040
In food photography,
which I mentioned before,

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.620
that type of photography taught
me really important lesson.

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:28.203
What someone does
in food photography,

00:33:28.203 --> 00:33:30.410
they styled a dish
so it looks amazing.

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:31.570
It looks perfect.

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:33.270
And then they had crumbs.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:36.075
They add a few flaws,
because that flaw,

00:33:36.075 --> 00:33:37.700
it somehow draws it in.

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.350
And I think that's what,
somehow, good poets do.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:41.575
They make it real.

00:33:41.575 --> 00:33:45.580
They make it somehow authentic
and believable so that we're

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.455
drawn into it, and
it slows us down so

00:33:48.455 --> 00:33:50.030
that we can absorb that.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.410
Silence obviously
does this, as well.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:34:00.374
Photographers or
cameras can be noisy.

00:34:00.374 --> 00:34:02.290
Not all cameras, and I
think that's the beauty

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:05.700
of a lot of our pocket cameras
is there's no click, right?

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.280
And they're quiet.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:11.130
And so there's the camera,
but then there's also us.

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:16.139
Silence is an incredibly
powerful mode of communication.

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:18.590
This is my daughter,
Sophie, and this is just

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:20.600
captured with a camera phone.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.800
Christmas morning at
her grandparent's house.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.920
And I just love
this simple moment.

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:29.510
And it couldn't have been
captured had I said something.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:31.439
She didn't know the
frame was being made.

00:34:31.439 --> 00:34:33.605
If I had said, wait, Sophie,
Sophie, look towards me

00:34:33.605 --> 00:34:36.699
and smile, would you
like the photograph?

00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:38.750
My mom might like
it, but would you?

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:40.010
No, right?

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:41.719
But this one it's
kind of interesting.

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:43.469
Or my other daughter
Annie after a day

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:45.120
of skiing up in
Mammoth Mountain.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.639
And again, a photograph
captured without words.

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:50.659
So often in photography,
let's say people

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:52.710
photography, where you
get that caricature

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:54.787
that you're supposed
to say something.

00:34:54.787 --> 00:34:56.370
Work it, work it,
great, great, great.

00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:57.910
But sometimes what
we can do is just

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:01.050
be quiet and let the
picture take place.

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:03.130
And by doing that
often, it can let

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:08.400
the photograph have perhaps
a bit of a voice of its own.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.510
William Penn writes,
"True silence

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.690
is the rest of the
mind, and it is

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:16.380
to the spirit what
sleep is to the body,

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:19.800
nourishment and refreshment."

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.390
The camera I think is
an amazing teacher.

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:24.400
And one of things
that it's taught me

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.450
is that there is a
time to be quiet.

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:30.560
It's not always about
me saying something.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:34.850
Sometimes it's about slowing
down, simplifying, reframing,

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:37.490
and just letting things be.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:50.500
In our current era, we have
access to amazing cameras

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:55.240
which capture near
perfect pictures.

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.270
And as a result, we
kind of have this idea

00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:00.170
that good photographs are
photographs which somehow

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:03.090
have everything
sort of just right.

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:05.150
But what I have found
is that sometimes it's

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:07.280
a flaw that makes the frame.

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.472
These are a few portraits.

00:36:08.472 --> 00:36:10.930
One of the characters we've
seen before, Jack O'Neil there,

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:12.730
captured with old expired film.

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:15.310
And it's almost like
the mistake there

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:19.420
allows us to be drawn in to
what the narrative arc is.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.850
Here's a photograph of
the singer and songwriter

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:24.437
Seal at his home, sitting
there at his desk.

00:36:24.437 --> 00:36:27.020
And while we were sitting there
he said something interesting.

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:30.760
He said when I shoot
with film cameras-- Well,

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.180
he started off saying, when
I shoot with digital cameras

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:35.610
and open up those files,
I look for the problem.

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:36.760
I look for the mistake.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:40.145
I find the flaw, and then
I correct it with software.

00:36:40.145 --> 00:36:43.320
He said when I shoot
with film, I embrace it.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.200
And this isn't about
film versus digital,

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.860
this is about photography.

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.100
And this is about as
we capture images,

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:53.120
are we willing to embrace
those little flaws,

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.680
those crumbs, maybe
even add a few crumbs.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.790
Or are we in this pursuit
for perfect pictures?

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:00.520
And this could mean
something like this,

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.020
a portrait of someone-- there's
some guys in the background.

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.910
Should we shoo them
out of the picture?

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:06.330
Why not leave them there.

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:08.300
It adds some ambiance
or some depth.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.840
And sometimes it
means other things.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.370
Like my daughter Annie,
she was leaving for school

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:13.556
and it was crazy hair day.

00:37:13.556 --> 00:37:15.930
And so I said, Annie, let me
capture a picture real quick

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:16.660
before you go.

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:17.695
And I took that one.

00:37:17.695 --> 00:37:19.490
Then I said, hey, let
me capture one more.

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:22.360
And this is the face of a
photographer's daughter, right?

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.800
And I almost like that one more.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.250
And it's the flaw
that she intentionally

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:31.100
made the crazy hair, and that
moment, and those bright eyes,

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.870
and that stage in life.

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:36.330
So we're getting near the end.

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:37.310
Tips and review.

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:39.270
How to make better
photographs, at least

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:41.570
for our conversation here.

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:43.890
The first thing I want you
to really walk away with

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:46.820
is this idea of
finding the photograph.

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:49.140
And I'm going to walk
through two pictures.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:52.690
This is of my daughter Sophie
last weekend at the beach.

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:55.990
And I want to kind of review
or walk through a few ideas.

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:58.060
The first one is
when you see a scene,

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:01.380
or when you go out to capture
a scene, at least in my mind,

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:03.946
you want your heart
to be beating fast.

00:38:03.946 --> 00:38:05.070
You want to say this is it.

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:06.486
I'm so interested
in photographing

00:38:06.486 --> 00:38:09.060
this gorilla or this
hawk, or this mountaintop,

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:10.530
or this person, whatever it is.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.690
And this is savoring
what that item is.

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:14.240
And I want to do that right now.

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.940
And so you capture the frame.

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.770
And you kind of get
caught up, maybe even

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:18.830
in the passion of it.

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:22.230
Because photography, for the
photographs that are best,

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:26.470
they're not taken from a
distance, cold and isolated.

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:29.460
They're you're in there
and you capture the image.

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:32.640
And then you have to
say, OK, you know what?

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.550
This first frame may
not be the best frame.

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:38.040
I'm going to embrace
the amateur advantage.

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:39.990
And for myself,
personally, I always do.

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:41.573
In other words, I
capture this picture

00:38:41.573 --> 00:38:43.530
and it actually isn't great.

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:45.630
It's not the right
picture for me.

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:47.380
And the reason it's
not the right picture,

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:49.112
there's some stuff
in the foreground,

00:38:49.112 --> 00:38:50.570
she's turned a
little bit too much,

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:52.110
she's not quite
right in the middle.

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:52.842
It's low tide.

00:38:52.842 --> 00:38:54.925
Low tide in the fall in
Santa Barbara where I live

00:38:54.925 --> 00:38:56.090
is the best time of year.

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:57.267
I just love it.

00:38:57.267 --> 00:38:58.850
And you can either
say, you know what?

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:00.560
I'm no good.

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:05.340
You can say, I'm an amateur,
and what else is possible?

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.580
And why do I want to
make this picture?

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:08.970
And how can I grow?

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:12.420
And then so you say, well,
maybe what I can do is reframe.

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:15.689
Maybe I can find a
picture within a picture.

00:39:15.689 --> 00:39:17.230
Or maybe I can do
what Gutenberg did.

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:19.940
I can take the wine press and
convert it for something else.

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:20.930
And that's the frame.

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:22.430
That's what my I saw.

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:24.160
I just wasn't
quite close enough.

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.170
I need to move somehow
physically to get there.

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:29.510
And then what I can do
is move and get closer,

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:32.200
and I got closer to her and
had her turn just a little bit.

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.100
And I like this photograph much
more because I'm connected.

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.790
I can actually see her, right?

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:39.450
You're getting a
little bit up close.

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:41.840
But then at that moment, I
think it's really important

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:45.920
to slow down and be quiet, and
almost listen to the photograph

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.780
and say, well, yeah,
this is a good picture.

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.320
This is a rough draft
that's been revised.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:54.609
But maybe, is there more?

00:39:54.609 --> 00:39:57.150
And I'll talk a little bit more
about this idea of listening,

00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:58.879
but one of the things
that I want to do

00:39:58.879 --> 00:40:00.670
is I know that when
the waves come through,

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:02.790
and you guys all know this,
it just cleans out the sand,

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:03.390
right?

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:05.940
Ever seen sand which
is just perfect?

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:09.980
And so I can sort of listen
or slow down or stop or say

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:11.400
what would the poet do?

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.850
And then it's this frame.

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:17.000
And it's just that
next little moment.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.950
And when you get
to those moments,

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:21.420
there also always
has to be this point

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:24.500
where you resist perfection.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.080
In photography,
you'll hear people

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.630
say your horizon
needs to be level.

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:30.440
It isn't perfectly level.

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:34.050
Or maybe your hair isn't styled
just right, or whatever it is.

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:35.440
You have to say you know what?

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:37.100
This is the moment.

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:39.060
I'm going to embrace that frame.

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:41.240
You have to sort of let
go of critique in a sense

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.420
and let it be what it is.

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:48.520
And so here is the process.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.180
Find the photograph.

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:52.190
So, again, if you walk
away with one thing,

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:54.470
ask yourself in this
process, how can

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:58.680
I do this the next time I hold
up my camera, whatever it is.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.720
The second thing that
I would suggest to you

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:04.880
is to spend some time
to study and learn.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.820
We are all photographers to
a greater or lesser degree.

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:10.640
Yet what's so interesting
is very few of us

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:13.070
actually study the craft.

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:14.790
Out of those 300
million photographs

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:17.930
which are posted on
Facebook or wherever today,

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:20.950
very few of those are
thoughtful photographs,

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:24.640
or ones which are trying to
accomplish or say something.

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.830
There isn't much maybe study
or practice behind them.

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:30.000
And so what I
recommend you do is

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.180
begin by trying to absorb
greatness through a book.

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:36.874
An old-fashioned paper book.

00:41:36.874 --> 00:41:38.790
I have a friend who's a
great cinematographer,

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:41.100
and what he'll do is
he'll sit down with a book

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:42.830
rather than watch TV.

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:45.400
And he'll give it an
episode's length amount

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.995
of time, half an hour.

00:41:46.995 --> 00:41:50.270
And he'll just absorb
the photographs.

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:52.760
And if you can be
around good photographs,

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:57.290
all of a sudden you can discover
little insights and nuances,

00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:00.660
which you may want to
integrate into what you do.

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:02.920
The other thing
that I recommend is

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.950
to try to learn
from the legends.

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:08.450
I'll show you two photographs
captured by John Sexton,

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:12.230
an amazing photographer-- used
with permission, of course.

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:16.580
And this is one picture
and then another.

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:21.460
One of the things that I have
learned from John is this.

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:24.770
He once said, and I've seen
he's written in other places,

00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:28.167
that he listens to the trees.

00:42:28.167 --> 00:42:29.750
And at first I kind
of wrote that off,

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:31.624
like what is this some
kind of new age speak?

00:42:31.624 --> 00:42:35.129
And then I realized no,
this is incredibly profound.

00:42:35.129 --> 00:42:36.670
Have you ever seen
two people talking

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:38.878
to each other and you can't
hear what they're saying?

00:42:38.878 --> 00:42:41.570
And one person is
completely disinterested,

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:43.190
and you can tell
how they listen--

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:45.620
posture's a little bit
down, sort of looking away.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:46.610
Or the opposite, too.

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:49.104
Lovers are good friends, and
you can see someone listening.

00:42:49.104 --> 00:42:50.520
And if they have
really good news,

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.780
you can see the person just
respond, and they're so

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.260
with them and present.

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.690
Or maybe if it's sad news
and they're listening,

00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:03.400
you can see them just absorb--
that there's thoughtfulness--

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.530
absorb whatever has been said.

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:07.740
And I think that listening
is about a posture,

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.870
being open to what's before us.

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:13.680
And great photographs happen
from moments like this.

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.242
So when you study these
legends, all of a sudden you

00:43:16.242 --> 00:43:17.450
discover these little truths.

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:19.640
And while I don't
photograph trees,

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.720
I do photograph other
things, and listening

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.770
has become a part of my craft.

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:24.770
You with me?

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:25.930
Study.

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:28.580
Study the legends.

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:30.240
Last one.

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:33.460
Photograph what matters most.

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:36.310
If you can make photographs
that are more meaningful to you,

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:39.460
there's a chance they'll be
more meaningful to someone else.

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:41.560
Like with this picture
here, it was such a journey

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:42.940
to try to get to the
top of the mountain.

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:45.100
By the time I was at
the top, I was curled up

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.040
in a ball in my tent
because I was so tired.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:50.130
And finally I just crawled
out and I captured this frame.

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:51.500
But it meant something to me.

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:52.280
The view.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.660
I sort of earned the view.

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:55.240
And it was painful to get there.

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.870
And if you can create
a photograph that

00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:58.800
has meaning to
you, it might just

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.300
mean something to someone else.

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.390
This is one of my favorite
spots to go surfing.

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:05.260
This is one of my best
friends and his son.

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:07.820
And if you make your
own photographs, ones

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:11.980
that have meaning to you, rather
than someone else's, they'll

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:12.960
go farther.

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.150
They'll become better.

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:19.360
For a long time I've tried
to photograph oak trees.

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.340
And I tried, and I
tried, and I tried,

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:24.636
and I couldn't get any
good pictures of them.

00:44:24.636 --> 00:44:26.260
And I realized because
what I was doing

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:28.720
was impersonating other
photographs of oak trees

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.190
that I had seen.

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:32.080
And it wasn't until
this picture that I

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.590
feel like I finally got closer.

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:36.940
I was no longer impersonating.

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.540
I was trying to
capture one of my own.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:42.040
Because this was my tree, in
my parents' backyard where

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.230
I grew up.

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:45.980
Whereas I grew up, I climbed
a little bit higher and higher

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:48.290
and higher, and there are
rope swings and forts.

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:50.930
This is my tree.

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:54.440
And if you can make photographs
that are meaningful to you,

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:58.220
that you sort of own,
they'll become better.

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:02.240
They'll be that clear reflection
of the mirror of who you are.

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.800
This is my wife and
our daughter Annika,

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:08.010
after a little dance recital.

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:09.540
And with all of
this, I think what

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:13.600
it means is to get
started where you are.

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.660
The trick with
photography is like well,

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:20.150
if only I was in Italy, then
I could get some great travel

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.950
photos.

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:23.060
Or if only I was working
with this celebrity,

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:26.020
then I would create
a great portrait.

00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:28.320
But photography, and
the best photography

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:32.310
starts where you are
and emanates out.

00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:37.060
You bring that with
you wherever you go.

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:39.540
Photograph what matters most.

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:44.060
One link.

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:45.700
My website /learn.

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:47.170
There's some
resources there if you

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:51.640
want to dig into other topics in
regards to specifics, like how

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.550
do you do certain things, and
composition, and lighting,

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:56.960
and software, which
we didn't cover.

00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:59.510
Really, this was
more about the heart,

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:02.540
and about the pursuit of
getting better at photography.

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:05.277
And then, of course last,
but not least, thank you.

00:46:05.277 --> 00:46:06.110
It was a real honor.

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:13.135
[APPLAUSE]
