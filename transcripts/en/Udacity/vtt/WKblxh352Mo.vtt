00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.144
By comparing multiple sequence alignments, we can arrive at

00:00:03.144 --> 00:00:06.108
a consensus sequence for a transcription factor binding site

00:00:06.108 --> 00:00:10.240
that's optimal. Now when scientists normally carry experiments like

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.100
this out, they may compare tens, hundreds, and even thousands

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.560
of sequences. And what this means is, that we

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.890
will end up with a consensus sequence that no

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.260
individual sequence in our analysis actually had, and that's

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.410
okay. We still reason that the consensus sequence itself is

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.090
the optimal binding site. And that any deviation, any

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.549
variation from this sequence would result in reduced binding

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.730
or activity. Of course in the end, any claim

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.510
like that must be tested empirically in the lab.
