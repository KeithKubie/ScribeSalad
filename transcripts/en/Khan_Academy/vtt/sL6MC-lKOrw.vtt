00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.293
Welcome to the video on
implicit differentiation.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.560
Let's just explain the
difference between implicit

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.590
and explicit first.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.280
So if I had a function that
was, let's say, y is equal to

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.090
x squared plus 2x plus 3.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.230
In this situation, y, the
variable y, is defined

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.710
explicitly in terms of x.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.730
How do I know that?

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.650
Well, if you give me an x, I
can just input it into this

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.220
expression right there,
and I explicitly get y.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.440
Right?

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.830
It just pops out
of the equation.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.800
But on the other hand, what if
I had something like this.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:46.220
What if I had x squared plus
y squared is equal to 100.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.470
Well now, if I give you an x,
you still can figure out a y,

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.180
but it's just not as easy.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.200
Right?

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.260
If I said, x is equal to, I
don't know, x is equal to 9,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.310
you would put 9 in here, you
would get 81, plus y squared is

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.570
equal to 100, you'd subtract
that, you'd get y squared

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.780
is equal to, what, 19?

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.950
Those numbers are weird.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.980
And then you'd get y is
equal to the plus or

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.790
minus square root of 19.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.470
So you still could solve for
y, but this expression right

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.890
here, or this equation,
defines y implicitly.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.610
And that's a different, you
know, when people use the

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.730
word explicit or implicit
in everyday language,

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:31.360
it's the same thing.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.670
When you say, he
explicitly said this,

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.020
it means, I am hungry.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.230
I explicitly stated
that I'm hungry.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.840
But you could implicitly
state that you're hungry.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.040
You could say, oh well, you
know, I haven't eaten for a

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.300
long time, and you know, boy,
it would be nice to maybe eat

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.290
something, and that would
be kind of an implicit

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.500
expression of your hunger.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.480
Because someone would have to
kind of do a little bit of work

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.580
to come to the conclusion that
you're hungry, instead

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.140
of you telling them.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.600
So with that out of the
way, let's actually do

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.120
some differentiation.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.160
So everything you've learned
about differentiation right

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.260
now has been explicit
differentiation.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.070
So example.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.030
For this function, we know
how to take the explicit

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.940
derivative here.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.730
Well, it's an explicitly
defined function, so we

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.430
just take the derivative.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.210
We apply the
derivative operator.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.390
We take the rate of change of
both sides of this equation

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.420
with respect to x.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.050
You could do it like this.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.540
We're taking the derivative
operator, I know this is

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.180
getting messy, we're taking the
derivative operator on that

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.130
side, and we're also taking the
derivative operator

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.640
on this side.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.940
I didn't plan to write
that there that's

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.090
why-- so it happens.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.500
On the left side, the rate
of change at y changes

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.770
with respect to x, well
we just write that.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.110
The rate of change of y,
for every small change in

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.720
y, what is change in x.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.900
That equals-- and then,
we know how to do this

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.630
type of derivative.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.650
This is just a
simple quadratic.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.620
So it equals 2x plus 2 plus 0.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.960
So there.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.310
We just did some explicit
differentiation.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.090
So how do we do the
same thing here?

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.270
Well, we're going to
do the same thing.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.150
We're going to apply the
derivative operator to both

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.515
sides of this equation.

00:03:08.515 --> 00:03:10.740
So let me do that, I'll do
that in a different color.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.650
Let me erase all of this,
too, because this is kind

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.310
of obvious things that
you might already know.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.060
Let me erase all of that.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.110
OK, so I'll take the derivative
operator to both sides

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.090
of this equation.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.630
So this is no different
than what we did up here.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.905
And as you learned in algebra,
anything you do to one side of

00:03:28.905 --> 00:03:30.920
the equation, you have to do to
the other side of the equation.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.580
Otherwise it would no
longer be an equation.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.830
Take the derivative operator--
because we're taking the

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:37.703
derivative with respect to x.

00:03:37.703 --> 00:03:41.510
We could've taken it
with respect to y.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.150
x squared plus y squared is
equal to, have to take the

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.480
derivative of both
sides, right?

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.440
Derivative of 100 with
respect to x, right?

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:01.212
So this equals the derivative
with respect to x, let

00:04:01.212 --> 00:04:02.090
me put it in brackets.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.270
I was going to do parentheses,
but I think brackets.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.000
Of x squared, plus the
derivative with respect

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.440
to x of y squared.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.470
And what's the derivative
with respect to x of 100?

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.040
For every change in x, how
much does this change?

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.960
Well, it doesn't change at all.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.830
It's going to stay 100, right?

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:22.690
So this is 0.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.870
The derivative of a constant,
really with respect to any

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.840
changing variable,
is going to be 0.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.570
So that was just 0.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.595
And what's the derivative of
x squared with respect to x?

00:04:32.595 --> 00:04:34.530
Well, we did that
up here, right?

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.500
When we took this derivative,
we just took the derivative

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.400
of each of these terms, the
derivative of x squared with

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.620
respect to x, that's just 2x.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:49.030
So we get 2x plus-- now this
term here is where you might

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.050
get a little bit confused.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:57.500
I am taking the derivative of
y squared with respect to x.

00:05:00.335 --> 00:05:01.795
So let me take you
[? on the side. ?]

00:05:01.795 --> 00:05:04.480
You know you shouldn't do this
every time that you do one of

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.210
these implicit differentiation
problems, but I'm doing this

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.950
because I want you to
understand what we're doing.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:16.890
So let's say I just defined g
as equal to y squared, right?

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.750
So let's say this was g.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.200
And I want to take
the derivative of g

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.220
with respect to x.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.890
So I apply the derivative
operator on both sides of

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.070
this, so let me do that.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:33.130
So the derivative, let me
do a d of x on that side,

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.530
d of x on that side.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.720
That's a d, there you go.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.677
So what we get is the
derivative of g with respect to

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:50.760
x is equal to the derivative
with respect to x of y squared.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.080
And so far, we haven't
really done much.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.190
I've just rewrote things.

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.970
But what does the
chain rule tell us?

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.660
The chain rule tells us that
the derivative, let me

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.550
stay in the same color.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.620
I'm always switching colors.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.510
The derivative of any variable
with respect to x, or with

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.520
respect to another variable, is
equal to the derivative of g

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.340
with respect to y times
the derivative of y

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.080
with respect to x.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.010
And if you don't have the full
intuition of the chain rule

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.740
yet, there's a couple
of ways to do it.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.450
You know, all of these dg's and
dy's that you see throughout

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.460
integral and differential
calculus, all these really mean

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.830
are really, really, really,
really, small change in g, a

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.910
really, really, really, small
change in y, a really,

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.420
really, small change in x.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.290
So you can almost view these,
if you multiply this out, this

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.920
really, really small change in
y is the same as this really,

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.870
really small change in y.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.390
So these are
essentially fractions.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.130
So you could cancel these out,
and that's why you would get

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.320
the change in g with respect to
x, or the derivative of

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.260
g with respect to x.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.540
So this is what the
chain rule tells us.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.430
So given that this is what the
chain rule tells us, how does

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.160
that help us figuring out this?

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.985
Well, we know that the
derivative of g with respect to

00:07:10.985 --> 00:07:14.230
x is equal to the derivative
of g with respect to y.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.770
But we already know that
g is equal to y squared.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:17.890
I just made that definition.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.340
That's where we started from.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.800
So what's the derivative
of g with respect to y?

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.810
Well, that's just 2y, right,
just using our derivative

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.800
rules, or our polynomial rules,
which hopefully you believe

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.230
actually work, because there
are several videos

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.680
where we prove it.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.780
And then, times the derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.650
Which we don't know, and that's
actually kind of what we're

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.470
going to try to solve for.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.700
So the derivative of g with
respect to x is 2y times

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.800
the derivative of y
with respect to x.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.850
Well, g is just the same
thing is y squared, right?

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.280
So the derivative
of, this is g.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.450
And normally when you do this,
you don't have to go through

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.510
the whole problem of
substituting for g.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.010
I just wanted to give
you that intuition.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.270
So what's this
derivative right here?

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.870
Well, it's going to be the
derivative of this expression

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:10.920
with respect to y, from the
chain rule, so that's 2y.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:20.050
Times the derivative of y with
respect to x is equal to 0.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.450
When you do it mechanically,
it's actually quite simple.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.710
You just say, oh, well, let me
pretend like y is like an x,

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.130
take a derivative, and
I multiply it times

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.630
the derivative of y
with respect to x.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.060
Mechanically it's very simple,
but I really want you to

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.640
understand that intuition that
this is coming out

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.175
of the chain rule.

00:08:33.175 --> 00:08:34.660
And actually, the chain
rule itself is not

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.760
this bizarre concept.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.230
It's really, you're just
multiplying fractions.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.870
So let me clear up some
space here, and we can

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:42.850
finish this problem.

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.670
And then I'll do a problem
where you have to do

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:45.850
implicit differentiation.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:47.950
And even in this one that I
just gave, it's really useful

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.320
to do implicit differentiation.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:57.680
So let me, I could clear this
guy out up here, clear that

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.080
out, clear all of this
stuff out, there we go.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.070
Clear all of that out.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.470
Ready to do some more work.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.390
So now we can solve this
for the derivative of

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.630
y with respect to x.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.960
So we get, let's subtract
2x from both sides.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:21.050
We get 2y dy dx is equal to--
I'm just subtracting 2x

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:24.560
from both sides-- minus 2x.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.730
And then what do we get?

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:31.925
We get dy over dx is equal to,
divide both sides by 2y, the

00:09:31.925 --> 00:09:38.340
2's cancel out, you
get minus x over y.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.650
And this is interesting,
just as it is, right?

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:41.760
Because what was this?

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.620
This was the equation for a
circle with radius 10, right?

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.110
You know, r squared.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.540
And if you know your
trigonometry and all of that,

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:55.730
this tells you that the slope
of a circle, at any point, is

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.950
equal to the negative
of x over the y.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.440
Well, we know from trigonometry
that the x is the cosine, and

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.490
the y is the sine, and so that
tells you something interesting

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.280
about how the derivative is
related to the tangent

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:06.790
and all of that.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:07.790
But I won't go into that.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.390
We're just learning implicit
differentiation here.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.270
But it's sometimes it's fun
to just think about things.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.730
So how's this different
from everything else

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:14.720
we learned so far?

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.690
Well, here we have the
derivative, the derivative is

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.800
actually a function of both
the x and the y value.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.080
And if we feel really
uncomfortable having this y

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.140
here, if we don't like that,
what we could do, is

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.030
we can substitute.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.300
So let's solve for y here.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:37.930
We get y squared is equal to
100, minus x squared, and then

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:41.610
you get why is equal to the
plus or minus square root

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.830
of 100 minus x squared.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:47.460
So you just substitute
that in here.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.060
Another way of writing
the derivative of y with

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.710
respect to x, sometimes
you'll see y prime.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.010
I'm just switching
notation, just so you're

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:53.660
familiar with it.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:11:02.050
Is equal to minus x over the
plus or minus square root

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.170
of 100 minus x squared.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.170
And to some degree, since we
have plus or minus down here,

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.190
this minus sign kind of
doesn't matter, right?

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.240
Because when it's a minus here
it becomes a plus, when it's

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.150
plus it's minuses, so you
can kind of ignore this.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.090
That's something interesting
for you to think about as well.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.420
Anyway.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.170
And this is interesting,
because our traditional way of

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.950
solving derivatives, we had
never seen a plus

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:24.580
or minus here.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.480
So that might be a little
bit interesting to you.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.500
So now let's do a problem
that is actually a bit

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.940
of a trick problem.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.920
It's not a trick problem but
it's actually something, that I

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:38.050
think, I first saw it either
when I was practicing for the

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.850
AP Calculus exam, or actually
saw it on the AP Calculus exam.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.080
So it's something that
you might encounter.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.870
But it's really neat.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:50.060
Let's say I have y is
equal to x to the x.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.600
So first, you say,
oh, this looks easy.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.690
Maybe I could use the
power rule, but no.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:56.700
Chain rule, you have 2 x's
here, and I mean, you might

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.600
want to just pause and think
about this for a little bit,

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.620
because this actually isn't
that straightforward

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.890
of a problem.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:05.780
And even though right here, y
is explicitly defined in terms

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:09.560
of x, right, if I give you x,
if I say x is 3, well then y

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.200
is 3 to the third, y is 27.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.730
So this is an
explicit function.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.100
I explicitly defined
y in terms of x.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.340
But it's very hard to
differentiate explicitly.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.520
And here's the trick.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.610
Let's take the natural log, or
actually you could take any

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:24.510
logarithm, but let's take
the natural log on both

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.060
sides of this equation.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:31.190
So you get the natural log of
y is equal to the natural

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:34.370
log of x to the x.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.420
And why did I do that?

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.450
Because now I can use
what we know about

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:39.590
logarithm properties.

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:46.310
We know that log of a to the
b is equal to b log of a.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.430
And you can watch the
exponent properties videos,

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:49.790
if you forgot that.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:53.650
So let's rewrite this
using this property.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.340
And I'm going to switch colors.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:13:00.410
So we get the natural log
of y is equal to x times

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:03.740
the natural log of x.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:07.890
And now we can implicitly
differentiate this.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:10.440
So let's take the derivative
with respect to x of both

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.500
sides of this equation.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.765
And I'll switch colors again.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.500
d dx.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.750
And I'm writing this just so
you know what I'm doing.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:27.710
is equal to d dx of
x natural log of x.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:31.690
So the derivative of this
expression with respect to x is

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:35.210
equal to the derivative of this
expression with respect to y,

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:37.260
times the derivative of
y with respect to x.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.000
So what's the derivative of
this with respect to y?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.295
What's 1/y?

00:13:41.295 --> 00:13:45.360
1/y times the derivative, just
the chain rule, the derivative

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.520
of y with respect to x.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:52.410
dy dx is equal to-- and
remember, just mechanically, if

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.140
you want to make sure you're
doing it right, you just take

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.900
the derivative with respect to
y, and you multiply

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.530
it times dy dy.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.340
That's just the chain room.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.160
Equals, and now we take
the derivative of this.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.130
Well, now we can just
use the product rule.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.000
The derivative of
the first, right?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.280
It's this times this.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.610
So what's the derivative of x?

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:08.880
It's 1.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.450
So it's 1 times the natural log
of x plus the derivative of

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:18.420
the second term, 1/x, times
the first term, times x.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.400
Let me clear that out up there.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.190
I'm already over time, but I've
become a YouTube partner,

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:24.875
so my videos can be longer.

00:14:24.875 --> 00:14:26.410
But I don't want to make
them too long, because

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:28.030
you'll get bored.

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:30.210
All right.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:31.370
So let's simplify this.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:43.840
We get 1/y dy dx is equal to
the natural log of x, plus,

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.580
well, that just cancels
out and becomes 1, right?

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.900
And so we have the derivative
of y with respect

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.510
to x is equal to y.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:55.220
I'm just multiplying both sides
of this equation times y.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:00.270
y times the natural
log of x plus 1.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:02.520
Now, you might say you're done,
but some people just don't like

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:06.040
it, the change of y with
respect to x, they don't like

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.810
it being defined in terms of y.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:08.620
So let's substitute.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:12.820
We know that y is
equal x to the x.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:21.900
So that equals x to the x times
the natural log of x plus one.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.380
So another way of saying it is
that y prime, or the change in

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.180
y with respect to x, or the
slope at any point of this

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:34.690
curve, is equal to x to the x,
natural log of x,

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.020
plus x to the x.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.530
I just distributed
the x to the x.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:38.770
But that's pretty neat.

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:41.430
This is kind of a, you know, a
five-star problem that you

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.560
might see in your books, and
you might see it in a math

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.690
competition, and people
will be really impressed.

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:47.390
And they'd be even more
impressed if you kind of

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.635
recognized this pattern, and
you're able to find the

00:15:49.635 --> 00:15:51.290
antiderivative of it, and
recognize that it

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:52.460
is x to the x.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.230
Anyway, I've talked
for too long.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.580
I will see you in
the next video.
