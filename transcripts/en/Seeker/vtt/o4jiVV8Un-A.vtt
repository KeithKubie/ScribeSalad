00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.660
Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder
that has been fascinating scientists for hundreds

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.320
of years because we just don’t understand
it.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.430
But now we may have finally found the root
of this devastating disorder… it starts

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.300
when the brain is forming in the womb.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.849
Schizophrenia causes people to hallucinate,
have a distorted view of reality, and experience

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:19.980
extremely disordered thinking.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.569
Brain function can be so badly affected that
it’s disabling.

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:27.130
Symptoms usually appear in adolescence or
young adulthood and while some research has

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.369
suggested a link between schizophrenia, drug
usage, and trauma it’s has never been well

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.529
understood.

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.210
Because the symptoms appear later in life,
researchers have long assumed the root cause

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.600
is a mix of genetics, brain chemistry and
environmental factors — environmental being

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.789
your upbringing not the air you breathe.

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:47.870
In the past patients have long been misdiagnosed
and mistreated, sometimes even being jailed.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.610
But new technology has helped us understand
what’s really going on.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.770
Medical imaging has shown that a patient with
schizophrenia has a brain and Central Nervous

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.789
System that look different than an unaffected
patient’s.

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.210
There are hundreds of genetic mutations that
might cause schizophrenia, but scans all show

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.280
affected brains share the same "faulty genomic
pathway.”

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.440
It’s clear from mounting evidence that schizophrenia
is a brain disease.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.610
Armed with this new information, researchers
turned to consider how that one pathway can

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.510
be consistently faulty among so many patients.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.000
And they used a little mad-science-sounding
technique: they grew mini-brain structures

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.430
in a lab.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.830
Specifically, they grew cerebral organoids,
recreating the first phases of human brain

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.640
development, using skin cells from test subjects.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.800
Four of these subjects had schizophrenia and
three did not.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.470
The cells grew into tiny organs that mimicked
brains in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.610
And the mini-brains grown from schizophrenic
patients showed critical malformations in

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.280
the cortex, the part of the brain that controls
things like memory, attention, and cognition.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.110
The cells that become neurons weren’t distributed
normally.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.080
The mini-brains showed there would be too
few mature neurons in the cortex for normal

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.640
functionality when the fetus became a full
grown adult.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.880
This results suggest that schizophrenia likely
starts in the FIRST TRIMESTER.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.910
The cells that develop into neurons don’t
connect the same way in a schizophrenic cortex

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.000
as they do in an unaffected one.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.210
If your brain was a computer, a brain with
schizophrenia would be [to quote a source]

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.410
“improperly wired.”

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.520
There would be only so much you could do from
the outside to fix it.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.980
Which is why schizophrenia is so hard to treat,
and, it seems, impossible to prevent.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.910
But knowledge is power and researchers are
now starting to look at schizophrenia treatment

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.280
with prenatal care, drugs, and supplements
so brains have a better chance of forming

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.170
with the right neural pathways.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.170

We’re still learning about how our own brain
works, check out Trace’s video about the

00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:41.100
giant neurons that could explain where consciousness
comes from

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.730
Fun fact: The first recorded case of schizophrenia
was in 1550 BC in one of the oldest Egyptian

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.540
medical texts, the Ebers Papyrus.
