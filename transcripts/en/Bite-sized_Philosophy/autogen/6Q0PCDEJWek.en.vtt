anything on any dimension right it's
 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.560
anything on any dimension right it's
really important to know that and then

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570
really important to know that and then
 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.220
really important to know that and then
you have these horrible people out here

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230
you have these horrible people out here
 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.019
you have these horrible people out here
right they do everything they do

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029
right they do everything they do

your heart the square root of the number
of people in a domain do 50% of the work

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050
of people in a domain do 50% of the work
 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.569
of people in a domain do 50% of the work
okay so let's go through that you have

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579
okay so let's go through that you have
 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.310
okay so let's go through that you have
ten employees three of them do half the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320
ten employees three of them do half the
 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.889
ten employees three of them do half the
work makes sense that's reasonable you

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899
work makes sense that's reasonable you
 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.440
work makes sense that's reasonable you
have a hundred employees ten of them do

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450
have a hundred employees ten of them do
 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.170
have a hundred employees ten of them do
half the work that's problem so the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180
half the work that's problem so the
 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.049
half the work that's problem so the
other 90% are doing the other half who

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059
other 90% are doing the other half who
 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.580
other 90% are doing the other half who
cares about them you have 10,000

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590
cares about them you have 10,000
 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.180
cares about them you have 10,000
employees 100 of them do half the work

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190
employees 100 of them do half the work
 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.500
employees 100 of them do half the work
right so here's that here's a nasty

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510
right so here's that here's a nasty
 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.729
right so here's that here's a nasty
little law as your company grows

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739
little law as your company grows
 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.170
little law as your company grows
incompetence grows in it exponentially

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180
incompetence grows in it exponentially
 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.529
incompetence grows in it exponentially
and confidence grows linearly got it

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539
and confidence grows linearly got it
 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.750
and confidence grows linearly got it
right because it with ten it's three who

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760
right because it with ten it's three who
 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.460
right because it with ten it's three who
are doing half the work but at 10,000

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470
are doing half the work but at 10,000
 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.990
are doing half the work but at 10,000
it's 100 that are doing half the work so

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000
it's 100 that are doing half the work so
 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.700
it's 100 that are doing half the work so
nine thousand nine hundred of your

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710
nine thousand nine hundred of your
 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.770
nine thousand nine hundred of your
employees are doing as much as the best

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
employees are doing as much as the best
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.200
employees are doing as much as the best
100 you might not even know who the best

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210
100 you might not even know who the best
 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.660
100 you might not even know who the best
100 are but probably they know and maybe

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670
100 are but probably they know and maybe
 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.820
100 are but probably they know and maybe
their peers know too and so one of the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830
their peers know too and so one of the
 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.200
their peers know too and so one of the
things that's really interesting when

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210
things that's really interesting when
 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.999
things that's really interesting when
big companies start to shake which means

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009
big companies start to shake which means
 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.770
big companies start to shake which means
maybe they've had a bad quarter too bad

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780
maybe they've had a bad quarter too bad
 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.719
maybe they've had a bad quarter too bad
quarters and the stock price starts to

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729
quarters and the stock price starts to
 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.090
quarters and the stock price starts to
tip down and the people the hot people

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100
tip down and the people the hot people
 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.800
tip down and the people the hot people
who have options are not very happy

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810
who have options are not very happy
 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.569
who have options are not very happy
about that and maybe they start to

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579
about that and maybe they start to
 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.130
about that and maybe they start to
announce layoffs all the hundred people

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
announce layoffs all the hundred people
 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.230
announce layoffs all the hundred people
who have opportunities leave and they're

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240
who have opportunities leave and they're
 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.880
who have opportunities leave and they're
the ones who were doing half the work so

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890
the ones who were doing half the work so
 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.440
the ones who were doing half the work so
boy that puts your company in a pretty

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450
boy that puts your company in a pretty
 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.850
boy that puts your company in a pretty
rough situation because now you've got

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860
rough situation because now you've got
 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.280
rough situation because now you've got
the ninety nine hundred people left over

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290
the ninety nine hundred people left over
 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.990
the ninety nine hundred people left over
who we're only doing half the work and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000
who we're only doing half the work and
 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.789
who we're only doing half the work and
the next time you announced layoffs the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799
the next time you announced layoffs the
 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.310
the next time you announced layoffs the
next most productive hundred leave and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320
next most productive hundred leave and
 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.080
next most productive hundred leave and
so then you're left with nobody who's

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090
so then you're left with nobody who's
 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.460
so then you're left with nobody who's
productive at a massive overhead payroll

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470

was looking at scientific productivity

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
was looking at scientific productivity
 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.899
was looking at scientific productivity
and one of the things he found was when

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909
and one of the things he found was when
 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.700
and one of the things he found was when
he was looking at PhD students is that

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710
he was looking at PhD students is that
 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.910
he was looking at PhD students is that
the median number of publications for a

surreal stepped out and one of the
 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.349
surreal stepped out and one of the
corollaries of that is that there's a

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359
corollaries of that is that there's a
 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:22.610
corollaries of that is that there's a

out of the game so zero is a weird
 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.550
out of the game so zero is a weird
number because when you hit zero you're

number because when you hit zero you're
 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.580
number because when you hit zero you're
out of the game so so then if you keep
