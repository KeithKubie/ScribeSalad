00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.070
HOST: Good afternoon.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.500
Welcome to Talks at
Google in Cambridge.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.650
Today it's my great pleasure
to introduce Paul Roberts, who

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.820
is the author of "The
Impulse Society."

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.170
He is also the author
of "The End of Oil,"

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.310
and "The End of Food."

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.770
As a journalist, his writing
has appeared in the "Los Angeles

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.370
Times," the "Washington Post,"
"The New Republic," "Newsweek,"

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.100
"Rolling Stone," and elsewhere.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.420
He was a finalist for
the National Magazine

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.440
Award in 1999, and for the
New York Public Library Helen

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.900
Bernstein Book Award in 2005.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.330
In "The Impulse
Society," he talks about

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.540
how the urge for instant
self gratification

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.360
has permeated every aspect of
our culture, why that's bad,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.500
and how we can
find a way forward.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.565
Please join me in
welcoming Paul Roberts.

00:01:02.565 --> 00:01:10.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.645
-Hello, Cambridge.

00:01:12.645 --> 00:01:14.670
Can everyone hear
me, who wants to?

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.170
Good.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.980
Right on.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.210
So thank you for the kind
introduction, Jonathan.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.270
And thank you all
for coming out.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.330
Especially to hear someone
who writes books with titles

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.300
like, "The End of Oil,"
and "The End of Food."

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.080
Because you know it's probably
not going to be super cheery.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.970
So yeah.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.450
I've just published a book
called "The Impulse Society."

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.516
There are some
copies over there.

00:01:35.516 --> 00:01:36.890
We're going to be
discussing some

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.300
of the ideas and
arguments in there.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.730
But before I get
to that, I wanted

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.290
to preface that with a few
remarks about publishing,

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.916
generally.

00:01:43.916 --> 00:01:45.415
Because as you guys
know, publishing

00:01:45.415 --> 00:01:49.820
is sort of being transformed
by the nanosecond.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.820
I mean, the business is going
through some great changes.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.940
And the act of publishing is
just-- I mean, for someone

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.590
in the middle of
it, it's bizarre.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.840
You know, if you publish a book,
you're expected to promote it,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.730
which means writing,
among other things,

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.110
writing op eds and articles,
and then publishing them.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.180
Because they're being
published online,

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.100
it means sooner or later you're
going to be confronting who?

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.320
The troll, right?

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.900
And you all know the troll.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.750
They operate in the
comments section.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.740
And you know,
they're pretty nasty.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.050
But when is it's at you,
or something you've done,

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.660
it's like getting
punched in the nose.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.070
It's amazing.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.200
These guys are just brutal.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.460
And I'm reading these
comments last week,

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.150
and it just-- oh, you're
just going smack, smack.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.870
And my reaction
isn't to get angry.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.710
I'm like, ugh, the guy
just doesn't understand me.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.090
We need to straighten this out.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.500
Like, if you just text me--
text me your number, dude,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.190
and we'll like, hang out.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.810
My editor's saying,
don't read the comments.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.547
And don't treat these
people like people.

00:02:49.547 --> 00:02:50.380
Because they're not.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.050
By the time they're
trolling, they're not people.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.720
He's being really
protective and fierce.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.830
But there's some truth in that.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.040
Right, because the
circumstances of trolling

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.200
are pretty dehumanizing.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.150
I mean for the troll.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.945
If you think about,
it's like we give them

00:03:05.945 --> 00:03:07.861
this technology, and
this sort of culture that

00:03:07.861 --> 00:03:09.450
rises around that
technology that

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.620
allows them to sort of disengage
from a lot of the social rules

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.730
and norms that would
ordinarily prohibit

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.169
that kind of nastiness.

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:17.960
Now think about it.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.650
They're sitting there in
near-total social isolation.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.190
You know, their
parents' basement.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.310
And they've got
this technology that

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.230
allows them to just sort
of gratify any thought.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.980
The nastiest thought,
instantly and without fear

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.540
of consequences.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.460
They're operating
totally anonymously.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.100
And I think as
importantly, they're

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.197
not there when their
comments are read.

00:03:42.197 --> 00:03:43.780
So they don't see
me burst into tears.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.160
So they don't have to
bear witness and feel

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.450
that social pressure that again,
would ordinarily sort of keep

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.030
that kind of nasty
impulse in check.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.140
And you realize that when you
give people the capability

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.710
to disengage from
these social norms,

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.780
and to pursue immediate,
narrow self interest,

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.760
the temptation to do just
that is really strong.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.580
And I'm talking about
trolls, of course.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.420
But it does raise the
question, at least in my mind.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.200
What would happen if you ran
a whole society like that?

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.990
I mean, what would it look
like if it was, hypothetically,

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.149
this socioeconomic system
that one of its functions

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:25.080
was to provide individuals and
institutions with a huge amount

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.460
of capability-- some of which
could be used to disengage

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.860
from restrictions, including
social restrictions.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:30.550
You know, norms.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.020
What would that
society look like?

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.170
And if you look at
the title of my book,

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.240
you know that I think we
know what it looks like.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.600
I think we live in
a society like that.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.040
Or we live in a society
that's becoming like that.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.450
Now, we're not all
trolls in basements.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.300
At least, I really
hope you guys aren't.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.230
But we do live in this
socioeconomic system

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.700
whose function is to
provide a lot of capability.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.880
The capability to sort of order
your life the way you want.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.040
And part of that reordering
is to engage and disengage

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.160
from the social
structures at will.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.750
And as you're able
to do that, you're

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.230
able to do a lot of things.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.820
But one of those things is to
pursue narrow, immediate self

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.320
interest.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.290
And I think that's
what we're doing.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.680
It's not happening all at once.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.732
We're not always
doing it all the time.

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:17.190
I mean, you all
managed to get here

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.460
to work without
running over people.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.020
I'm assuming.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.110
And shouting invective
out the window.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.140
But incrementally, I think
we are becoming a society--

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.172
that because we have
this capability,

00:05:27.172 --> 00:05:29.380
we're focused more and more
on immediate, narrow self

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.780
interest.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.029
And you can see it everywhere.

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:34.470
I mean, you can see it in
the way individual struggle

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.790
to sort of manage
all this power.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.580
But you can see it
institutionally.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.930
And importantly, you can
see it in institutions

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.200
that, traditionally, we relied
on to sort of help individuals

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.280
manage all that capability.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.430
So obviously, the
political sphere

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.215
and the financial sphere.

00:05:50.215 --> 00:05:52.931
Now we've seen individuals
and institutions

00:05:52.931 --> 00:05:55.590
in the financial sphere gain
a huge amount of capability

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.050
to sort of pursue immediate,
narrow self interest.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.400
And they have.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.680
And the effects
haven't been all great.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.350
So it turns out--
I'd argue that you

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.415
can't run a society like that.

00:06:10.415 --> 00:06:11.790
You need to have
a society that's

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.000
more focused-- at least some of
the time-- on some of what I'd

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.690
call more traditional values,
including patience, and self

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.810
discipline, and a belief in
something larger than the self.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.580
At least some of the time.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.670
Because if you don't have that,
society can't sustain itself.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.940
And it seems to me
that figuring out

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.730
how to restore some
of those values

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.830
in a socioeconomic system
that's busy giving us

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.370
all this capability,
somehow finding a way

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.300
to balance all that is one
of the top questions we need

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.984
confront.

00:06:42.984 --> 00:06:44.400
So that's sort of
what we're going

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.092
to be talking about today.

00:06:46.092 --> 00:06:48.550
And there will be, obviously,
an opportunity for questions.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.710
And you can throw things,
and things like that.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.970
So, I started looking
into this a few years ago.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.420
I was doing this book on food.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.110
And initially, my interest was
understanding the economics

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.920
of the food industrial complex.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.957
But I got into it, and
it didn't take too long

00:07:05.957 --> 00:07:08.290
to realize that the more
interesting narrative, at least

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.480
to me, was the way the food
industry has sort of dissolved

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.569
the social bonds that were
once associated with food.

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:18.610
Because if you think about
it, food traditionally

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.690
has been this intensely
social affair.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.650
You couldn't consume
a single calorie

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.460
without engaging in one
social hierarchy or another.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.600
And that's been that way for--
since the beginning, really.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.970
And what the food industry
has done is changed all that.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.910
And I mean, think about
the last 150 years.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.130
The food industry has made
food a heck of a lot cheaper.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.852
And it's made it so much
safer, more convenient,

00:07:42.852 --> 00:07:43.560
more interesting.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:49.530
It's allowed us to-- we
have so many food options

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.110
that we can kind of create the
perfect menu for ourselves.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.405
And we have total
caloric self expression,

00:07:55.405 --> 00:07:56.399
if you think about it.

00:07:56.399 --> 00:07:58.440
I mean, the food industry
has even gone so far as

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.650
to help us not
even pay attention

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.460
to the social and political and
environmental realities that

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.740
go along with food production.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.330
We can eat guilt
free, if we want.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.580
We're allowed to do that.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.200
And if you consider
what that means,

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.450
it means we have this freedom.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:17.732
We're no longer required to
wait on our mom to feed us.

00:08:17.732 --> 00:08:19.190
Because it used to
be the homemaker

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.150
controlled food output
in the household.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.050
And you ate what she
cooked when she cooked it.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:25.125
And you didn't complain.

00:08:25.125 --> 00:08:27.250
And you probably had to
sit through two, maybe even

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.750
three family meals, and endure
the socialization process that

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.110
went along with those.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.360
And it was pretty restrictive.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.020
And now that's gone.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.190
Or it's disappearing.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:36.690
Right?

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.909
So we've got this incredible
amount of freedom.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:41.465
And that's the good news.

00:08:41.465 --> 00:08:42.590
We've got all this freedom.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.290
But the bad news is, we've
got this incredible amount

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:44.790
of freedom.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.072
And in some cases, we
go too far with it.

00:08:47.072 --> 00:08:48.030
Sort of a free for all.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.460
And I wanted to share this
picture from my favorite news

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:56.180
source these days, "The Onion."

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.120
This is-- true
story, naturally--

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.280
this is about a new ad
that Arby's is running.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.960
And for $2.99, customers
will be allowed

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.780
to leap behind the
counter and scoop up

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.890
big handfuls of roast
beef, right? [LAUGHTER]

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.860
And to the degree that
you find that funny,

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.200
the joke is that it's
not-- it's only like,

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.550
an angstrom from
being true, right?

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.850
I mean, you drive by
Arby's, and if you're not

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.180
familiar with the place, you
might look through window

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.130
and kind of expect
to see this going on.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.010
And it's not just
Arby's or fast food.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:28.580
It's the whole food
system, really.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.210
We've sort of become
this free for all,

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:35.170
where we are encouraged
and empowered to dispense

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.280
with any norms that
would otherwise

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.920
help us think about
managing our consumption.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.860
And it's not just
the food industry.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.940
Anywhere you look-- credit,
automotive, personal

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.940
technology.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.540
I mean, the financial
industry, to go back

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.380
whipping on them--
it kind of reminds

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.430
you a little bit of what
goes on Wall Street.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.700
I think the one guy there--
isn't that Jamie Dimon?

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.630
I mean, it sort
of looks like him.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.130
OK.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:05.620
So I think we've seen enough.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.150
We can move on now.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.900
But we can go back to that
later for a second look,

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.450
if we need to.

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.752
So I'm not suggesting
that we're all

00:10:16.752 --> 00:10:18.960
practicing the equivalent
of leaping over the counter

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.270
and scooping up big
armloads of roast beef.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:26.290
What I'm talking about is much
more of an incremental process.

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.419
We've added,
incrementally, the sorts

00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:30.460
of capabilities that are
available to individuals

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.520
and institutions to
pursue self interest.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.290
And incrementally, our
behavior has changed.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.967
And the way incremental change
works-- you don't notice it,

00:10:38.967 --> 00:10:39.800
you don't notice it.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.716
And then one day, you
wake up and you go, wow.

00:10:41.716 --> 00:10:43.660
Things really are different now.

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.060
I mean, look at social media.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.310
It's cliched to
even bring this up.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:48.850
But I'll bring it up.

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.350
We do things now,
routinely, that we

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:55.684
would have considered
obscene two decades ago.

00:10:55.684 --> 00:10:57.350
I mean, for me to do
back in high school

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.558
what I do routinely today--
and I went to high school

00:10:59.558 --> 00:11:00.310
in the late '70s.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:02.070
So a long time ago.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.900
What I'd have to do is
get up super early, right,

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.300
and spend the morning
taking pictures of things,

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.624
like my face, and my
breakfast, maybe the cat.

00:11:10.624 --> 00:11:13.040
And then I'd have to go to
school with a stack of pictures

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.672
and hand them out to people.

00:11:14.672 --> 00:11:16.380
Saying, with each time
I handed out, hey,

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.710
like me, like me, like me.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:18.420
Me

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.250
And the thing is-- I don't
know about your high school,

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.860
but if I had done that back in
the '70s, every time I tried,

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.207
I'd have gotten punched.

00:11:24.207 --> 00:11:25.540
Because you just didn't do that.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.660
You didn't self promote.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.660
Dude, who the hell
do you think you are?

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.330
It was just unheard of.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.810
And yet now we just
share, we post,

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.400
we declare the most mundane, or
intimate, or mundane intimate

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.230
thing.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:42.480
And plus, we expect to
get affirmed for it.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.690
We expect to get a reward.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.287
We expect that
someone will like it.

00:11:45.287 --> 00:11:47.620
And admit it, how bummed you
are when you post something

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.287
and no one likes it right away.

00:11:49.287 --> 00:11:50.620
I spend the day kind of pouting.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.911
It's like, what did I do wrong?

00:11:51.911 --> 00:11:54.180
And how come he posted a
picture of the same cat?

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.487
He got, like, 130 Likes.

00:11:56.487 --> 00:11:58.070
So if you think about
what's happened,

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:01.897
we've incrementally
added this power.

00:12:01.897 --> 00:12:03.480
And it's sort of
changed our behavior,

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.930
such that not only are we
posting all this stuff,

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.790
but we've created this new
system for valuing ourselves.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:14.060
And the provocative
postings get more Likes.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.555
So naturally, what happens?

00:12:15.555 --> 00:12:17.180
The incentive system
changes, so people

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.680
are more provocative
in their posts.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.980
So you have these kids
killing themselves

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.650
to take these wild selfies.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:27.240
And you know that woman in San
Francisco after the earthquake?

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.760
So she crosses the
police safety line

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.810
to stand underneath
this collapsing cornice

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:33.730
to get a selfie.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.146
And the only reason
she's not dead

00:12:35.146 --> 00:12:36.790
is because there was
not an aftershock.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.724
And she just couldn't
see the absurdity

00:12:38.724 --> 00:12:39.640
of what she was doing.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.290
Because she was so
excited-- I mean, guessing.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:42.165
I didn't talk to her.

00:12:42.165 --> 00:12:44.030
She was so excited
about this thing

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.170
that she was going
to be able to post.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.690
And that really, for me,
underscores the danger

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:53.427
of this self-centered
ecosystem that we're creating.

00:12:53.427 --> 00:12:55.010
And it's not just
that we overindulge.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:58.519
And it's not just that
we bankrupt ourselves.

00:12:58.519 --> 00:13:00.310
And it's not just that
we're having trouble

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:03.822
thinking about
long-term challenges.

00:13:03.822 --> 00:13:05.530
On top of all those
things, it's the fact

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:08.400
that we're so focused
on self gratification--

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.400
and by extension, the
self-- that the self begins

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.600
to balloon in our
field of vision.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.114
It gets so big we can't
even see around it.

00:13:16.114 --> 00:13:17.780
We stop thinking there
are other things.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:18.630
It's just wow, it's there.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:19.130
This is me.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:19.970
This is great.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:25.240
And humans have a
finite attention span.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.070
It's a finite resource.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.190
And that may change.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.880
But right now, we have
a limited bandwidth.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.880
And if we're focused
on self gratification,

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.460
and by extension itself-- in
part because the marketplace

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.770
keeps delivering all this
capability to allow us to focus

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.220
on the self, and
self gratification--

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.930
if we're doing that,
we have less attention

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:47.590
to devote to other
things, including

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:51.050
complex, long-term things that
aren't directly about the self.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.300
And I don't think I
need to tell you guys

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.860
that this is the wrong
time to be self-absorbed.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.640
There's so many things we need
to be looking at-- long term

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.634
challenges.

00:14:01.634 --> 00:14:04.050
And one of the reasons I think
we are struggling with that

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.230
is because the whole
socioeconomic system

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:11.060
is reorienting itself
around the self.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.420
So what do we do about that?

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.280
How do we step back from that?

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.630
As soon as you start
talking about self,

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.717
and self gratification, and
the power to self gratify,

00:14:24.717 --> 00:14:25.550
it's pretty awkward.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:26.675
Especially in this country.

00:14:26.675 --> 00:14:29.600
Because this culture,
in particular,

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.590
doesn't take kindly
to suggestions

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:33.940
that we curb the
power of the self.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.040
We don't like curbs
on individual power.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:36.810
It really bugs us.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.170
And it has since the beginning.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:44.690
And on top of that, optimizing
or maximizing individual power

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.740
has been the point
of our economy,

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.930
for like, what, the
last 10,000 years?

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.790
I mean, that's the goal
of economic development--

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:57.960
to give individuals the power
to order their lives in ways

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.540
that suit their preferences.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.760
More of what you want, less
of what you don't want.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.290
And that's what
technology is about.

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.210
I mean, if you take
technology as a subset

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:07.910
of economic development.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.780
Technology allows us
to do those things.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.180
And allows us to
do great things.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.730
I mean, again, I don't
need to remind you

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:18.050
the cusp, the edge of the
thing we're on right now,

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.460
about to embark on this
entirely new way of being,

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.000
is being driven by
data technology.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.430
And the power
that's going to give

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.920
the individual and
institutions to focus on,

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.900
among other things,
self interest.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.576
And so we really need to
understand this power.

00:15:34.576 --> 00:15:36.200
Not just the double
edged nature of it,

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.520
but how do we manage this?

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.390
How do institutions
and individuals

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:41.090
manage the pursuit
of self interest

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:44.740
in ways that don't completely
wipe out the rest of us?

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:50.150
And again, without imposing some
top down solution that A, never

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.310
works, and B, will be
resisted ferociously?

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:56.650
And for me, really the only
way to even talk about this

00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:00.310
without getting stoned-- I mean
having rocks thrown at you--

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:07.515
is to approach it by discussing
the nature of the power itself.

00:16:07.515 --> 00:16:09.390
Understanding the nature
of the power itself.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:10.970
This capability
that the marketplace

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.750
is producing so much.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:14.340
Because I think when
we would do that,

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.910
people can begin to
at least consider

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.909
how useful it is to use it.

00:16:19.909 --> 00:16:20.950
And how they're using it.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.622
And whether they want to keep
using it in the same way.

00:16:23.622 --> 00:16:26.080
When we look at, say, the nature
of a lot of the power that

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.809
comes out of the
digital realm, we

00:16:27.809 --> 00:16:29.600
see that there are a
lot of risks involved.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.850
I mean, clearly data
breach is just one example.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.060
And it's forcing people
to recognize that wow,

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:36.190
on the one hand I'm
getting all this power.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:37.773
On the other hand,
I'm exposing myself

00:16:37.773 --> 00:16:41.010
to all these risks
that are unprecedented.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.450
We don't even know how
to catalog them all.

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:47.660
And so that points up one
of the risks of the power.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.730
And you can go through and
can help people understand

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.290
that all this power comes
with all these caveats.

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:56.072
And more and more caveats.

00:16:56.072 --> 00:16:58.530
And some of those caveats we're
still sort of figuring out.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:16:59.970
So that's one angle.

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:04.550
I think more fundamentally, what
I think is critical for people

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:07.930
to understand is that the power
the marketplace is ladling out

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:12.010
at such copious volumes
doesn't really have anything

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.480
to do with us, with the
recipients, in many respects.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.660
It's not our power.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.200
We didn't make it.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.960
In many cases, it's produced by
a producer thousands of miles

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.800
away.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.810
An automaker, Google-- you're
creating all this power.

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.104
And your agenda
may not be the same

00:17:31.104 --> 00:17:33.270
as the agenda of the people
who are using the power.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.170
You might not even care.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:35.711
And I'm not saying
you, as in Google.

00:17:35.711 --> 00:17:37.460
I'm saying you, as in producers.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:42.267
And companies are producing
all this power for consumers.

00:17:42.267 --> 00:17:44.100
Not because they care
about those consumers,

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.724
but because it's the
most efficient way

00:17:45.724 --> 00:17:47.030
to meet their revenue targets.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.690
And that's how
business works, right?

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:52.020
But in the context
of this concern

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.550
that we might have about a
socioeconomic system that's

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:57.580
becoming more and
more self-absorbed,

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.960
this gap between the agendas of
the producers of all this power

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.200
and the agendas of
the users-- namely,

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.840
the individuals--
that gap becomes

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.045
really important in
this consideration

00:18:08.045 --> 00:18:10.420
of how we're using this power
and how we might manage it.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:14.320
So one way to
think about this is

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.020
what I call the Horsepower Race.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:21.490
So this is the huge
competition between automakers

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:23.120
during the middle
of the last century.

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.550
It begins in the
middle last century,

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.300
to make more and
more powerful cars.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.177
And it was discovered by
accident in the late 1940s.

00:18:30.177 --> 00:18:32.010
Oldsmobile, they come
out with this new car.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:33.160
It's a midsize car.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.745
And they're about to release
it with a midsize engine.

00:18:35.745 --> 00:18:38.469
And the one guy says, yo, let's
put this V8 in it we've got.

00:18:38.469 --> 00:18:39.510
We just invented this V8.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:40.484
So they did.

00:18:40.484 --> 00:18:41.275
It goes super fast.

00:18:41.275 --> 00:18:43.430
It wins all these
races at NASCAR.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.970
It just sold like potato
chips or whatever.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:48.665
And all of a sudden,
all the automakers

00:18:48.665 --> 00:18:50.790
realize they've got to have
these performance cars.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:53.044
And so, the industry
totally reorients.

00:18:53.044 --> 00:18:55.460
All these engineers that have
been spending all their time

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.260
trying to make engines
more fuel efficient

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.920
are now like, screw that.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.420
Every year they're coming out
with more and more horsepower.

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.880
So it's like, turbo chargers,
and then superchargers,

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.690
then two barrel carburetors,
then four barrels,

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:07.980
then six-barrel carburetors.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.980
You might as well have,
just, a monkey up there,

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.070
pouring gasoline
into the engine.

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:15.420
And the horsepower
curve is just going up.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.460
And we're sucking it up.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.240
We're loving it, we motorists.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:26.010
And part of that is because cars
were a little bit underpowered.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:28.552
And it was nice to have a
little more go-- a little more

00:19:28.552 --> 00:19:30.260
juice when you were
merging with traffic.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.771
But for the most part it
was just-- we wanted it.

00:19:32.771 --> 00:19:33.520
We didn't need it.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.270
We just wanted it.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.400
And why did we want it?

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.750
Well, Detroit was super
interested in this.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:41.360
This was the beginning of the
psychological era of marketing.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.790
And they put teams
of psychologists on.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.390
There's a lot of Freudians.

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.106
They're surveying
their consumers.

00:19:47.106 --> 00:19:48.730
And they're finding
out, the top reason

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.434
was we just like to go fast.

00:19:50.434 --> 00:19:51.100
We just like it.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.160
It's fun to accelerate.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.335
I mean, for the same reason
you like a roller coaster.

00:19:57.335 --> 00:19:59.540
But there was all the
psychological reasons, too.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.260
We're using power to
compensate for a feeling

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.450
of a lack of power in
other parts of our lives.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:08.480
So lack of power at work,
maybe, or in our suburban lives,

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.770
our marriages, or whatever.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.170
And of course, these
are all Freudian, right?

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.795
So of course they're
going to say that.

00:20:12.795 --> 00:20:15.740
But the story is--
it makes sense.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.820
And so, Detroit's loving this.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.410
Because, like all
industrial sectors,

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.392
they built these
huge plants that

00:20:22.392 --> 00:20:24.100
were necessary to get
the scale, in order

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.519
to bring the price
of cars down so

00:20:26.519 --> 00:20:27.810
that everyone could afford one.

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.040
But once you have
that scale, you've

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.956
got to keep the throughput--
the volume going.

00:20:30.956 --> 00:20:32.460
Or you can't pay for it.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.750
And you can't run volume
on a needs based economy.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.522
So you need to focus on wants.

00:20:38.522 --> 00:20:39.730
I mean, this is all old news.

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:42.830
But the way they were
focusing was horsepower.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.170
So, that's all
great for Detroit.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:47.049
But of course, the
problem is consumers

00:20:47.049 --> 00:20:48.090
are using all this power.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:51.670
And the way you use the power--
get value out of the power--

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:52.940
is you go faster.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.180
And they tripled the
horsepower-- more than tripled,

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.120
between 1940 and the early '60s.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.640
And the top speed went from
85 miles an hour to 145.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.340
And we weren't all going 145.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.462
But our speed is up
high enough that we

00:21:05.462 --> 00:21:07.170
were getting in these
horrific accidents.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.960
The rate of fatal
crashes is pretty much

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.450
paralleling the
horsepower curve.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:14.000
And the carnage
is just piling up.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.580
And you think about
what's going on.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.710
It's like, we're taking
all this power that Detroit

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.650
is giving us, because
it sort of has to.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:25.770
And we are using it to
project our inner turmoil

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.800
on our neighbors, with
sometimes lethal effect.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.450
Right, we're sort
of using the power

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:34.180
to rebalance our internal
imbalances, which

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.280
is kind of nutty, if
you think about it.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.090
And what's, I think,
the important thing

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:40.580
is the decision about whether
we're going to do that.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:45.280
Use all this power to
project our idiosyncrasies

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.790
and insecurities
onto our neighbors,

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:49.509
with sometimes lethal results.

00:21:49.509 --> 00:21:51.550
That decision is-- think
where that's being made.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.299
It's not just being
made in our own heads.

00:21:53.299 --> 00:21:56.100
It's being made throughout
this whole system.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.600
It's being made in part by
the designers and financiers

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.970
in Detroit who are deciding
how much horsepower they

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:04.860
have to offer each year.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.750
New horsepower
they have to offer,

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.220
to meet their own targets.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:12.380
And this isn't to let the
consumer off the hook.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.620
Ultimately, the motorist
has to make the decision.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:18.860
But if you think about it, that
decision has been outsourced.

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:21.680
And what's happened is,
what would have been,

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.670
I think traditionally much
more of a moral decision.

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:27.370
Or at least, considered
in a moral framework.

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:30.540
Do I want to take my, say,
anger or my insecurity,

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:31.980
and take it out on my neighbor?

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:35.660
That question, which
would have been discussed

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:39.360
in human moral terms-- that's
been left to the marketplace.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.210
And the marketplace is all about
yes, yeah, of course you would.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:43.870
The marketplace just says, yeah.

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.078
We're going to put out more
power because we need to.

00:22:46.078 --> 00:22:48.980
And so we've effectively
embraced, and absorbed,

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:50.940
and internalized the
values of the marketplace,

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.148
without really discussing it.

00:22:52.148 --> 00:22:54.300
I mean, there was no
referendum held in the mid

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.920
'50s-- should we be doing this?

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.120
It was just sort of
done, incrementally.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.450
And that became the model.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:03.160
And there was no debate over it.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.800
And it's not just
obviously in Detroit.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.750
It's everywhere you look.

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.333
It's pretty much
every consumer sector

00:23:07.333 --> 00:23:10.540
where power is being handed out.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.960
And that became the model.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.520
And there were people
concerned about it.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.950
But at the time-- this
is the Mad Men era--

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:21.500
there's still a
lot of safeguards.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.200
Namely, there's a regulatory
state that's so powerful,

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.575
it's not afraid to get in
there and regulate the hell out

00:23:26.575 --> 00:23:29.100
of business, and
penalize, and intervene

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.860
in all these different ways.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:35.720
And business is much more
cowable-- more easily cowed.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.670
And we kept things in line.

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:42.625
But all that goes out the
window in the '70s and '80s.

00:23:42.625 --> 00:23:45.000
When we have these-- how many
people here are like, super

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.521
familiar with economic
history of the '70s?

00:23:47.521 --> 00:23:48.020
None.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.530
OK, so I'll keep it super brief.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:51.970
But I mean, basically we
had these two huge shocks

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:52.600
to the system.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.240
And the first was the
computer revolution,

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.530
which among many other
things allows business

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:59.500
to accelerate, and
intensify, and render

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.980
more efficient this process of
creating capability and selling

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:03.699
it.

00:24:03.699 --> 00:24:04.740
So there's that going on.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:06.198
And then, at the
same time, there's

00:24:06.198 --> 00:24:09.700
this ideological slash financial
revolution, which we sometimes

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.499
call the shareholder
revolution, when

00:24:11.499 --> 00:24:13.290
we're feeling like
having a sense of humor.

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.250
And what happens
there is that we

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.560
have this massive recession
in the early '70s.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.051
Oil prices, foreign
competition, the bottom

00:24:20.051 --> 00:24:21.050
falls out of the market.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.120
The postwar economic
miracle that America

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.950
had been so proud
of just evaporates.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:27.670
And everyone is hurting, right?

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:30.330
But the people that
complained the loudest

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:31.270
were the shareholders.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.061
And they basically told
corporate America--

00:24:33.061 --> 00:24:35.790
they said, if you ever let
share prices fall as far as they

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:39.080
have-- and the stock market lost
half its value-- if you ever

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.134
do that again, here's
what's going to happen.

00:24:41.134 --> 00:24:42.800
We're going to take
over your companies.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.760
We're going to fire your asses.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.050
And we're going to break the
companies up and sell them.

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:46.799
And they did that.

00:24:46.799 --> 00:24:48.640
They demonstrated
they could do that.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.882
And corporate America
was like, whoa.

00:24:50.882 --> 00:24:52.090
That's some serious business.

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:55.740
So they completely
reoriented their strategy.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.120
And they began to focus
primarily on share price.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.110
And on the things that
contribute most readily

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:04.250
to share price,
which is generally

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:05.699
next quarter's earnings.

00:25:05.699 --> 00:25:08.240
Lot of debate about this, about
what actually is share price.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.220
But really, what it comes down
to is next quarter's earnings.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:13.530
And that became the thing
that you would fight for.

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:16.030
That became the thing you would
do pretty much anything for.

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:20.970
And to make sure that corporate
management got this lesson--

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:25.830
to embed this idea,
this ideology, deeply

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:27.620
and permanently in
corporate management,

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.250
we change the
incentive structure.

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:31.090
So no longer would
you be compensated

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:32.680
with mainly salary and bonus.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.170
You would be compensated
increasingly with what?

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:36.586
AUDIENCE MEMBER:
Stock incentives.

00:25:36.586 --> 00:25:37.470
-Yes, that's right.

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:38.719
And so think what happens now.

00:25:38.719 --> 00:25:41.400
The manager, sort of
overnight, relatively speaking,

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.410
goes from being a
manager to an investor.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:47.410
And suddenly
realigns, to a degree

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:52.800
that was unprecedented,
with the stock market.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.390
Now this is a-- from a
historical standpoint,

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:59.511
this marks a radical,
fundamental break

00:25:59.511 --> 00:26:01.510
with what had been going
on in corporate America

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:02.801
for most of the postwar period.

00:26:02.801 --> 00:26:05.420
For as much as we
like to-- "We."

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.980
Some of us-- like to poke the
corporate world in the eye

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:17.180
today, corporate America
had been the sensible parent

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.670
of the economy in
the postwar era.

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:21.460
In the sense that
these companies

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.380
were the ones who made
the long term decisions

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.000
and had the discipline.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.050
They made huge, long term
investments in new plants,

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:31.450
opening new markets,
developing new products.

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:33.910
Huge investments
in R&amp;D. The money

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:35.590
that was put into
basic research--

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:36.910
the kind of research
that you don't even

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:39.350
know if it's going to come up
with anything for 20 years--

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:42.670
a lot of that was coming
from private industry.

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:44.670
And investments they
made in their workers.

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.016
It was constant training.

00:26:46.016 --> 00:26:47.640
Because you had to
keep your workers up

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.505
to speed with all
this technology

00:26:48.505 --> 00:26:49.920
that was being developed.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.330
Now all these companies
had internal universities.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:55.660
So there were these constant,
long term investments.

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.860
And they weren't doing
this because they loved us.

00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.443
They were doing it
because this seemed

00:26:59.443 --> 00:27:03.370
to be the most practical
way to sustain prosperity.

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:05.710
And at the same time,
government was leaning on them,

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:07.460
because government was
willing to do that.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:08.960
And labor was much stronger.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.620
But there was also
a sense that this

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.119
was the way to long
term prosperity.

00:27:12.119 --> 00:27:14.850
So all of a sudden, that's
pretty much out the window.

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:19.560
There's this much more intense
focus on near term results.

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.940
Lots of ramifications of
that--and I'll just limit it

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:22.802
to a few.

00:27:22.802 --> 00:27:24.260
One is that companies
are much more

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.570
willing to do whatever it
takes to get those earnings.

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:29.560
And so we see, not
coincidentally, the rise

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.270
of the accounting
fraud scandals.

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:37.010
So you go from companies-- there
would be, like, six earning

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:39.770
restatements a month,
back in the '80s,

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:43.660
to like-- or six earnings
restatements a year to like,

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:44.360
20 a month.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.776
An earning restatement, for
the few of you who don't know,

00:27:46.776 --> 00:27:48.941
is basically where
you say, we lied.

00:27:48.941 --> 00:27:51.590
We made a huge mistake in our
earnings, and for some reason

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:53.280
they're not as
high as we thought.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.220
So you have that going on.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:58.350
You know, the Enron scandal is
a great, sort of extreme example

00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:59.230
of that.

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:01.530
And then you have the
focus on cost cutting.

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:05.520
Because one of the quickest
ways to raise earnings

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.709
is to cut costs.

00:28:06.709 --> 00:28:09.000
Even though it can be hugely
problematic down the line.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.719
So all of sudden,
downsizing-- it it

00:28:10.719 --> 00:28:12.510
goes from being an
emergency measure, which

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:15.240
is what it had been during the
post-war period, to something

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.571
that's almost routine, with
all sorts of effects on the job

00:28:19.571 --> 00:28:20.070
market.

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:22.130
So we not only
lay off routinely,

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:24.520
but we've cut so much
on employee training.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.840
It's just unbelievable.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:29.950
We've left employee
advancement to employees.

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:32.340
You're sort of on
your own, dude.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:36.360
And we've taken up
all these gimmicks.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.400
I mean, the share buyback
is a classic example.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.900
You basically-- companies
are spending billions,

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.120
I mean, trillions of
dollars collectively,

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.297
buying not new products,
new technology,

00:28:45.297 --> 00:28:46.630
certainly not hiring new people.

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:48.707
But they're buying
their own shares.

00:28:48.707 --> 00:28:51.290
Because you take shares off the
market-- the remaining shares,

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:52.252
the price goes up.

00:28:52.252 --> 00:28:53.460
Makes the company look great.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.660
But you haven't really
done anything, right?

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:56.910
You haven't expanded business.

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:59.130
And you sure as heck
haven't hired anyone new.

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:00.510
And that's become so routine.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:05.300
So in the two years before
the financial meltdown,

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.310
the 500 companies
on the S&amp;P 500 were

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:11.241
spending 70% of their
profits on share buybacks.

00:29:11.241 --> 00:29:12.240
OK, so think about that.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.616
It's like, well, let's make
the bubble even higher,

00:29:14.616 --> 00:29:16.490
so when it crashes, the
damage will be worse.

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:18.479
And let's so deplete
our cash reserves

00:29:18.479 --> 00:29:20.020
that, when it does
happen, we'll have

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.680
to go to the government
for a bailout.

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.420
I mean, it's like
a win-win, right?

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:24.830
And you'd think they'd learn.

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:25.360
Well, no.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.735
You probably
wouldn't think that.

00:29:26.735 --> 00:29:27.680
But they haven't.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:31.150
So that last year, we spent
$600 billion in share buybacks.

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:35.574
And so, if you think
about what's happening,

00:29:35.574 --> 00:29:36.990
it's almost like
corporate America

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:39.270
and the consumer traded places.

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:41.910
Corporate America now acts
like a consumer-- sort

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:43.630
of a youngish consumer.

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:46.070
And the consumer is acting
like corporate America.

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:49.490
We're really focused on
quick returns, our self.

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:55.750
And you can see
this personalisation

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:57.600
of the entire economy.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.530
The entire economy
begins to shape itself

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:03.260
around this short term agenda.

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.080
So it's everything
from the way we invest,

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.200
the kinds of innovations
we invest in.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:13.350
You look at things like--
Well, so, Amazon Fire.

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:15.990
You probably read today they've
lowered the price to $0.99.

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:17.810
Way to go.

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:21.642
But think about what
the Fire is about.

00:30:21.642 --> 00:30:23.100
I think this is
really fascinating.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.310
So the Fire-- for the few of you
who don't know-- its killer app

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:28.060
is that you can take
pictures of anything,

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.470
and it will identify it
automatically and then

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:32.780
take you to a link on
Amazon where you can buy it.

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:35.037
And they act like, no,
it's sort of a world phone.

00:30:35.037 --> 00:30:36.120
Like you're walking along.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:36.745
You see a rock.

00:30:36.745 --> 00:30:39.240
And you can scan it and
see if Amazon sells it.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.460
Of course they do, right?

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:44.010
But really, what it's
about is showrooming.

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:48.610
It's like going to a showroom--
going to Target, or JC Penney,

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:49.500
or whatever.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.440
The more hapless,
the better, right?

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.460
And walking in there, and
buying the stuff in there.

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:57.370
And of course, the phone comes
with a year of Amazon Prime.

00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:59.790
So you could buy the thing
while you're in the store.

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:01.748
Then have it delivered
for free two days later.

00:31:01.748 --> 00:31:02.380
So it's super.

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.255
I mean, think about the
individual capability

00:31:04.255 --> 00:31:05.213
you've just been given.

00:31:05.213 --> 00:31:05.800
It's great.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.890
But now think socially
what's going on there.

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:10.770
So you walk in, and you
ask the sales guy, hey,

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:13.630
can you take me to
the big screen TVs?

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:15.680
And you've got your
phone in your hand.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.184
And you do the scanning.

00:31:17.184 --> 00:31:19.600
And you look at this guy while
you're one-clicking him out

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.330
of a job, right?

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:21.664
Because that's what's happening.

00:31:21.664 --> 00:31:23.996
So there's going to have to
be this new social form that

00:31:23.996 --> 00:31:26.470
will arise, where the facial
expression that you have,

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:28.417
and the tone of voice
when you're one-clicking

00:31:28.417 --> 00:31:29.500
a person out of their job.

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.280
It's sort of like,
hey, sorry man.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:32.530
But you understand, you know.

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:33.420
Of course they don't.

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:34.820
But so there's that.

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:37.110
It's like this
economic violence.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:39.610
I mean, there's been economic
brutality since the beginning,

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:40.110
right?

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:41.350
But this is so intimate.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:43.220
It's right there, you know?

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.660
And I just think that's brutal.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:47.460
And on top of that,
it's so short term.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.940
Because if we're
all showrooming,

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.230
there can't be any showrooms.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:53.715
I mean, even if you remove
20% of their business,

00:31:53.715 --> 00:31:55.840
you're going to hammer so
many showrooms that there

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:56.770
won't be any left.

00:31:56.770 --> 00:32:01.140
Why would they fund something
that Amazon or anyone else--

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.070
So basically, what are you going
to do with your great phone?

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:06.700
You're going to take a selfie in
front of this abandoned store.

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:10.160
I mean that's kind of the--
And so much of our innovation

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.960
is really so focused on
the near term, without--

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.010
and it makes it easy not to
think about those long term

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:17.580
consequences.

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.450
And more and more, that's what
our economy does, you know?

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:22.110
And not to take away
from all the stuff

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:23.160
that's completely the opposite.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.860
I mean, there's so
much stuff where

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:28.870
the potential for good and
things that build society

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:29.726
is out there.

00:32:29.726 --> 00:32:31.350
I'm not suggesting
that's not the case.

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:33.710
But look at where
our investment flows.

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:36.860
And look at where our
attention is directed.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:41.560
Often as not, it's not at that
those positive developments.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.320
And that's not entirely
the media's fault.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:49.370
And think about the way that big
data-- the potential for that

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:52.420
is just massive.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:54.740
Personal medicine
is just one example.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:59.067
But big data also has a lot of
other ways they can be used.

00:32:59.067 --> 00:33:00.650
I mean, I don't need
to tell you this.

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:01.840
But I will anyway.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.977
I mean, think about
the porn industry.

00:33:05.977 --> 00:33:07.560
How's that for a
conversation stopper?

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.950
[LAUGHTER] I've done
a lot of research.

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:12.360
And, uh-- [LAUGHTER]

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.360
But I mean, the porn
industry is a great example

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.310
of how technology
has altered behavior.

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:20.700
Because up until
the '70s, porn--

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.680
it was sequestered away
in these dark places.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.630
Because we had a lot of
social rules against it.

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:28.970
But we also had no
technological way

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:32.440
to liberate everyone's
porn appetites.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.630
So you had to go to
the seamy side of town.

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:38.484
Or watch it in your house
with the little 8-millimeter

00:33:38.484 --> 00:33:39.275
[MOVIE REEL NOISE].

00:33:41.754 --> 00:33:42.420
And that was it.

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.810
And so it was this tiny
little marginal activity.

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:46.430
And then video comes along.

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:49.150
And all of a sudden, the cost of
making a porn flick just drops.

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:51.160
I mean, the cost of
making a color porn flick

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.380
dropped by a factor of 20.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.120
So all of a sudden, you could
just churn these things out.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.670
And they just poured
into the marketplace.

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:01.039
I mean, the number of titles
released just goes up.

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:02.830
It's more than the
horsepower thing, it's--

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:05.170
And so what happens
is, not only does it

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:09.699
become more easy to access--
so there's freedom there.

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:11.900
And people can watch
it if they want.

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.159
They can watch it in the
privacy of their home.

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:14.969
And they don't have to worry
about what other people say.

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:17.469
And that's their business,
as far as I'm concerned.

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:19.590
But consider this.

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.780
Porn is now so varied.

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.320
And there's so many options.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:26.610
And there's so many genres, and
subgenres, and sub- subgenres.

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:29.980
I mean, you have
no idea, the things

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:31.739
that you can find
out there, that

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:33.159
are sort of designed
specifically

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:35.685
for very particular tastes.

00:34:35.685 --> 00:34:37.060
And so what you
have is this sort

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:44.080
of porn world, where people can
watch the bizarrest activities.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.820
And they can talk about them
with other people that share

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:50.420
that taste, because there's
a nice little network for it.

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.757
And so it normalizes it.

00:34:51.757 --> 00:34:53.340
It becomes this thing
that like, well,

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.469
doesn't everyone do this thing?

00:34:55.469 --> 00:34:57.310
And so when they
attempt-- if they ever

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:00.645
do-- to re-engage with
mainstream society

00:35:00.645 --> 00:35:03.320
and go on a date, it
can be really tough.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.380
Because the real world
doesn't look a thing

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.670
like what they've
just gotten used to.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:11.239
And OK, it's sort of amusing.

00:35:11.239 --> 00:35:12.530
And porn is an extreme example.

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:15.040
But we are allowing people
to do that in every realm.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.660
It's not just porn.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:20.030
And so, it raises this
really interesting question.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:23.500
How do we optimize this
capacity for the individual

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:27.200
to create these worlds that
are totally personalized,

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.640
and so give you the freedom
that people deserve to have,

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:35.590
and yet at the same time allow
people to have the capacity

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:37.230
to re engage socially?

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:37.890
How we do that?

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:38.973
How do we re-balance that?

00:35:38.973 --> 00:35:39.900
Re

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.160
I think that's just super tough.

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:46.080
And I guess more generally,
how do we step back

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:51.080
from this impulsive,
self-absorbed society

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:52.420
that I've been describing?

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.620
And I'll tell you.

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:57.010
And it'll sound like I'm just
giving you more bad news.

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:58.220
But I'll tell you the
story about this guy

00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:59.303
I met when doing the book.

00:35:59.303 --> 00:36:00.646
His name is Brett.

00:36:00.646 --> 00:36:02.520
And he was a fellow--
he was an online gamer.

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:05.440
And he played World of
Warcraft obsessively.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.900
He just had played
it for 4 years.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:11.330
And his online self
was super successful.

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:15.180
He was one of the best
players in the world.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:16.540
And he was sought after.

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.460
And it was like
being a rock star.

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:21.850
In his real life, things
were just falling apart.

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:24.370
His health was declining.

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:27.750
His schoolwork
wasn't going so well.

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:30.560
Socially, he could hardly
even have a conversation.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.970
And he finally reached
the point where

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:36.220
he knew that he was
in serious trouble.

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:39.530
And he recognized
that this world that

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.474
kept giving him
more capabilities,

00:36:41.474 --> 00:36:43.140
keeping him on this
treadmill-- but they

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.810
weren't real
capabilities at all.

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:47.900
He finally had to
go cold turkey.

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.940
He completely just pushed back.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:53.950
And checked himself
in for treatment.

00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:57.590
And I'm happy to report that
he's actually doing great.

00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:00.090
And there's a lot of people who
are in the same boat, who've

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:01.440
had to make that same decision.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.648
And you're thinking, what
does it have to do with me?

00:37:03.648 --> 00:37:05.870
Because you, or
anybody-- the whole world

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:09.710
doesn't spend all its
time battling aliens.

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:11.310
But in a sense, the
world that we're

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:14.910
creating-- this
hyper digitalized

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:18.690
socioeconomic system does give
us-- there's an analogy there.

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:22.549
We are being given powers
that are approaching those.

00:37:22.549 --> 00:37:24.340
And the question is,
where we go from that?

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.240
And I think that
Brett's example is

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.490
a good one for us to consider.

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:29.490
He pushes back.

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:31.980
And what happens when he
creates space between himself

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:36.660
and this market-driven system,
with its market-based values,

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:41.780
is he allows his own values
to reassert themselves.

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:43.230
And at first, it's very basic.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:45.521
It's like, wow, I just needed
to develop some patience.

00:37:45.521 --> 00:37:48.670
I needed to develop some
hobbies other than this, right?

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:49.190
A real life.

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:53.440
But he gradually begins
to discipline himself

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.150
and to reengage with society.

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:58.835
And he's actually finishing
up a degree in sociology.

00:37:58.835 --> 00:38:00.310
And he wants to
become a counselor.

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:03.559
So I mean, that example.

00:38:03.559 --> 00:38:04.350
So there's one guy.

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:05.280
Great.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.210
What does that mean?

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:08.530
Well, I think it's an example
for the rest of society

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:11.530
to at least consider
this idea of creating

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:14.580
space between ourselves and
the system that we have come up

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:17.530
with, and its values.

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:18.700
Its market-driven values.

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:22.070
And to start asking-- and being
much more deliberate about how

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:24.820
we use power that's
coming out of this system.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:27.580
It's not to suggest that
we're going to stop using it.

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:29.390
I mean, we can't.

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:31.450
That system is going to
keep producing power.

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:33.158
And it would be
irresponsible on our part

00:38:33.158 --> 00:38:35.420
to completely disengage from it.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.830
Because someone
will use the power.

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:39.710
The question is,
how do we use it?

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:41.510
And how deliberate
is our decision,

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:44.070
O or are our decisions,
about using it?

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:48.110
And I think that's really where
we need to do a lot of work.

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:50.260
And you can see this
happening all across society,

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.130
sort of informally.

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:55.520
Like families who unplug because
they don't like what they think

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.550
personal technology is
doing to their kids.

00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:03.440
It's people who back away
from Fox News and CNBC.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.590
Sort of the echo chambers.

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:08.300
Because they don't like how
that is changing their--

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.670
is poisoning their
faith in democracy.

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:15.270
It's people who are considering
local production, local food,

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.770
whatever.

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:18.870
I mean, it's folks who are
at least taking a moment

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:21.730
to ask themselves-- all
this capability that's

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:23.431
coming to the marketplace.

00:39:23.431 --> 00:39:24.430
It can do a lot of good.

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:26.110
But it won't be able
to do a lot of good

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:28.540
unless we are considered
and deliberate

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:30.430
in our application of it.

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:33.660
And that's really
where I've come down,

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.210
after a lot of research and
a lot of talking to folks is,

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:37.340
this is happening.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.402
This power is coming.

00:39:39.402 --> 00:39:40.110
And it will come.

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:42.151
And it will increase-- it
will come increasingly.

00:39:42.151 --> 00:39:44.170
And the question is,
how do we manage it?

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:46.550
And obviously, you guys are
in the driver's seat there.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.040
Because a lot of
that management is

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:49.830
going to come from
better understanding.

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:53.150
I mean, having better data
tools to ask ourselves, geeze,

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:56.540
what will this new increment
of power mean for x?

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:57.990
And are there ways to manage it?

00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:59.730
And what will the
costs and benefits be?

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:01.360
So having a better
handle on that, I think,

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.220
is going to be fantastic.

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:04.480
And there's a lot of apps that
will allow you to do that,

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.563
sort of in a handheld way.

00:40:05.563 --> 00:40:10.360
But I think that has to go
hand and hand with a much more

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.510
personal, individual
approach which

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:16.140
is in some ways old fashioned.

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.970
You can't outsource
all your decisions.

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:20.470
You can't keep relying on
another sort of data system

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:22.362
to tell you how to act.

00:40:22.362 --> 00:40:23.820
At the end of the
day, you're going

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:27.200
to need to have
some basic patience.

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.740
Some basic self discipline.

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:30.990
And a basic willingness
to look beyond the self

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:32.180
to the greater good.

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.760
So that is my message today.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.599
I appreciate the attention.

00:40:36.599 --> 00:40:38.140
And I look forward
to your questions.

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.369
Thanks very much.

00:40:39.369 --> 00:40:47.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.644
My work is done.

00:40:48.644 --> 00:40:50.060
Oh-- no.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:56.050
AUDIENCE: You were saying
that this social change,

00:40:56.050 --> 00:41:00.260
this anti-enlightenment,
you could call it,

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:01.840
has come little by little.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.520
That's the United States.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.070
That's much of the
developed world.

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:10.660
But socially conservative
cultures in other parts

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:15.090
of the world-- for example,
many Islamic countries.

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:22.640
Their elders, their leaders,
see the American entertainment

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:26.550
industry, or you could
say industry in general,

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:30.300
turning their young
people into this impulse

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:32.760
society within
their own country.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:36.190
And that, in my view,
is much of the rage that

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:39.630
drives the hatred
from that side.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:45.849
And because it's such a
stark difference there.

00:41:45.849 --> 00:41:48.390
Because it isn't something that
happened gradually with them.

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:50.870
It's a generational skew.

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:56.360
It is the parents trying to
keep their households cut off

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.820
from this.

00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:00.790
But not being able
to prevent it.

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:03.970
That it provides a good
example of the challenges

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:07.110
and the remedy
that you suggested.

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:11.250
If we all grow up to learn
to become part of the impulse

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:13.172
society, we drown in it.

00:42:13.172 --> 00:42:15.940
And we crawl our way
out, and break free.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:18.360
That doesn't help
the next generation.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.510
That only helps that individual.

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:24.360
And then, if those people
start voting in order

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.430
to try to do something,
society wide,

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:29.990
you again get to the
top down approach.

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:31.800
It becomes like Prohibition.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.300
-Exactly.

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.791
A reactionary, top
down-- Yeah, exactly.

00:42:34.791 --> 00:42:36.290
AUDIENCE MEMBER:
Thoroughly resisted

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:37.890
by everyone who isn't
already a convert--

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:38.390
-Right.

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:40.171
And creating all
sorts of new problems.

00:42:40.171 --> 00:42:40.670
Yeah.

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:43.070
Right.

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:43.661
So.

00:42:43.661 --> 00:42:44.660
Did you have a question?

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.460
That's a great set
of observations.

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:47.950
I could riff on that for a bit.

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:49.590
Or you have a question?

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:55.330
-I find your recommended
remedy unsatisfying.

00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:58.620
Because I don't feel
like it can get traction.

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:02.380
And the example of a society
where all of the parents

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.740
are trying to keep all of
the kids away from this,

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.430
and failing-- well,
failing eventually.

00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:09.070
Maybe not until the
kids grow up enough

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:11.570
that they get on their own.

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:14.520
It makes me seriously
doubt that that

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.300
can make much of a difference.

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:18.730
So I'm looking for
another option, which

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:20.690
I'm guessing you don't
have a good answer to,

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:22.560
or you would have
already said it.

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.334
-Well actually, I
wanted to wrap things up

00:43:25.334 --> 00:43:26.500
so we could start questions.

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.590
But since you've
called me on it,

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:32.090
I have no choice but to answer.

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:34.640
So, that's a great
example, because it really

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.660
shows the paradoxical
nature of this, right?

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.960
I mean, we want those
repressive societies

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.460
to face a rebellious
younger generation.

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:45.262
Because in many
respects, the traditions

00:43:45.262 --> 00:43:46.970
that are being held
onto are not the kind

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:50.180
that I'm arguing we
need to hold onto.

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.760
On the other hand, it's sort
of, you toss out-- I mean,

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.470
it's very hard to
define. "I want

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:56.520
you to keep that old
value, but not that one."

00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:00.180
And who are we to
be saying that?

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:02.250
And we run into the
same issue here.

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:07.610
So it's a question of, whose
freedom, and toward what end?

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:10.599
The idea that this is all
going to happen and be remedied

00:44:10.599 --> 00:44:12.640
because individuals will
be pushing back-- you're

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.348
absolutely right.

00:44:13.348 --> 00:44:14.780
To say that that's
a piece of it.

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:18.370
But that can't-- that simply
just repeats the problem every

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:19.230
generation.

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:21.264
So we do need a top
down-- but I think

00:44:21.264 --> 00:44:23.430
we have to be careful in
our top down prescriptions.

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:25.180
So I would say
that you definitely

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:28.070
need a top down in areas
like finance reform.

00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:30.890
There's no way that we're going
to-- I mean, why would you

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:33.460
convince your kids to follow
these values that I'm espousing

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:35.880
if at the same time, Wall
Street can do a pretty

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.890
much act like five year
olds anytime they want?

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:41.930
So it's not like we're simply
building role models here.

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:43.090
But it's important.

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:45.130
It's absolutely important
beyond the damage that

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:48.220
gets done to our economy and our
individual sense of security.

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:51.720
So there are definitely
calls-- opportunities--

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:56.550
for top down remedies in things
like finance reform, campaign

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:57.320
finance reform.

00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.050
Since the entire
political sphere

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:01.910
is in the capture of
this same-- I mean,

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:04.330
there's so much
money in politics,

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:06.650
it's essentially an arm
of the financial sector.

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:09.367
So donors are really
thought of as investors.

00:45:09.367 --> 00:45:10.950
The amounts of money
they're investing

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:13.480
are so large that they
expect a fast return.

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:16.050
And the most efficient way
to deliver a fast return

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:17.760
in politics is to go extreme.

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:19.780
So you've just built
in this little feedback

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:24.110
loop that creates
partisan gridlock.

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:26.602
Campaign finance reform is
not the entire solution.

00:45:26.602 --> 00:45:27.560
But it's a piece of it.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.140
But I think that if-- and
this is a dream world,

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:31.890
if I was put in
charge-- I would want

00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:33.710
to see these top down reforms.

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:36.270
But I would also
want to see some way

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:39.170
to help articulate and support
a grassroots movement where

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:41.540
people individually are
pushing back and sending

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:43.840
a message to the
politicians that the status

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.530
quo doesn't work anymore.

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:47.670
We're tired of losing
things that matter to us.

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:49.450
So that we're not
having to wait until we

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:51.380
go to rehab to
pull ourselves out.

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:55.310
And meanwhile, our
kids are totally lost.

00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:56.560
So it has to be a combination.

00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:58.390
And I am far from having
it all worked out.

00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.890
Believe me.

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:00.960
And I even know that.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.460
But I think we need to start
with this idea of pushing back.

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:05.190
Creating space.

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:07.273
And that space might be
filled from the bottom up.

00:46:07.273 --> 00:46:09.640
And it also might be
filled from the top down.

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:12.500
I was actually looking
at the government

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:13.820
shutdown as an opportunity.

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:16.500
Because in the
aftermath, you have

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.720
a lot of political leaders
sort of just going, whoa.

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.020
You see what just happened?

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:22.000
I mean, that was close.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.620
And I think it caused
some to be willing to step

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:27.550
back, and reconsider
some slightly

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:29.950
older political criteria.

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:31.450
I mean, they were
just as corrupt.

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:33.900
But at least they were able
to get a few things done.

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:38.630
And I suspect that there
is a hunger, an appetite,

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:42.100
for more of that,
than one might have

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:44.020
thought before two years ago.

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:46.380
So I remain marginally hopeful.

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:49.440
But absolutely we need a
combination of top down

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.490
and bottom up
approaches to this.

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:54.550
So thanks very much.

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:57.690
Another question?

00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:02.630
-So I find it very interesting
that you brought up

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:06.360
technological solutions to
some of the questions of power.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:11.640
How do we step back and
look at the implications

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:14.660
of using certain kinds of power
the marketplace brings us,

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:17.944
after talking about
Amazon Fire phone?

00:47:17.944 --> 00:47:19.360
Right, so the
interesting question

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:24.180
here is, the technological
model today is all

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:26.850
driven from the same
marketplace that you

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:28.940
are kind of defending
yourself against.

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:36.320
And I'm not sure how
to reconcile this.

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:39.700
How can we, as
technologists, if we

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:44.810
wanted to solve this or make an
incremental amount of progress

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:49.690
toward solving this, how can
we-- even if we're meaning,

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:52.420
convince the public
that we're not

00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:55.120
building another Amazon Fire.

00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:58.500
That the tool that
we're trying to provide

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:02.730
to make it easier for
people to step back is not,

00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:04.940
in fact, skewed just
simply in our favor.

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:08.600
I mean, this is the crux of
some of the arguments being made

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.110
in Europe right
now, with respect

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:13.960
to a lot of American
technological companies.

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:22.360
Is that we don't respect some
of their traditions in the way.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.666
Like, right to be
forgotten, for example.

00:48:24.666 --> 00:48:26.040
Something that
they traditionally

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.030
thought of as very important,
that level of privacy.

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:30.550
And all of these
American companies

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:32.670
coming in and just saying, nah.

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:35.380
Doesn't matter.

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:39.530
So do you have any
thoughts on how can we

00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:41.790
find that balance
slash regain the trust?

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:46.230
Because it seems like we lost
it as a sector of the economy,

00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:47.214
if you will.

00:48:47.214 --> 00:48:49.380
-Right, and you're sort of
front and center of that.

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:50.630
That's a really good question.

00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:53.820
I think part of what's
going on here is that--

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:55.811
and I'll speak in gross
generalizations here,

00:48:55.811 --> 00:48:57.310
because it's a safe
thing to do when

00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:58.601
you're at a particular company.

00:48:58.601 --> 00:49:04.720
But essentially what we've
done since the '80s is

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:07.870
we've basically said,
if it's efficient,

00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:11.627
if it will cut
costs, if it's legal

00:49:11.627 --> 00:49:13.460
and it adds to the
bottom line, we'll do it.

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:15.660
And that is going
to be our guideline.

00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:18.390
And we'll hem and
haw around the edges

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:20.140
with social
responsibility and we'll

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:24.810
plant a tree for every share
we buy back, or whatever.

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:26.474
But generally
speaking, we're going

00:49:26.474 --> 00:49:27.640
to be pursuing those things.

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:31.210
And we're going to let the
market make the determination.

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:32.070
And why wouldn't we?

00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:34.320
Because we are responsible
to our shareholders.

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:35.550
That's always a thing.

00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:37.110
What can we do?

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:41.500
And so you have to fiddle a bit
with that nexus, as they like

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:44.760
to call it, between--
It's the agency theorem.

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.230
It's like, who's really
running the show here?

00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:49.100
I mean, the shareholder
can kind of say,

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:50.770
well I bought the shares
but it's not my fault.

00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:51.603
It's not my company.

00:49:51.603 --> 00:49:53.400
And the company is
saying well, this

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:55.120
is all for the shareholders.

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:57.760
So I think we need-- that's
where more top down work needs

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.110
to come in and say,
well, for example.

00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:03.720
Let's see if we can reduce the
emphasis on quarterly earnings.

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:04.680
So how do we do that?

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:06.890
Well maybe we could
reduce-- make it

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:11.770
more expensive, or more
awkward, to pay in shares.

00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:13.850
So we can reign
that in somewhat.

00:50:13.850 --> 00:50:17.000
Let's maybe make it illegal
again to do share buybacks.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.080
I mean, it used to be
recognized for what it is.

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:21.020
It's price manipulation.

00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:23.560
But we decided in the
'80s that it wasn't.

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:25.980
Or if it was, it
was worth the cost.

00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:29.819
And parenthetically, there are
times when share buyback is

00:50:29.819 --> 00:50:31.110
absolutely defensible, I think.

00:50:31.110 --> 00:50:33.350
When you're being
threatened with a takeover.

00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:35.692
Or if there's
nothing to invest in.

00:50:35.692 --> 00:50:37.400
You've got a pile of
cash, and you simply

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.060
can't find something
to invest in.

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:42.650
But because we've linked share
buybacks with compensation,

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:44.520
it's very difficult
to trust that.

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:45.550
You talk about trust.

00:50:45.550 --> 00:50:47.760
It's very difficult to
believe that what's going on

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:51.340
is in the actual interest
of the corporation,

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:54.090
and not just the interest of
the wallet of the executive

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:55.730
making the decision.

00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:58.510
So there are things
we can do there.

00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:00.750
But in terms of--
but really, I think

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:02.530
it's a philosophical question.

00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:05.180
We're sort of hoping that
someone will come and impose

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:06.700
a new algorithm, right?

00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:09.747
And it'll be what we used
to rely on the Church for.

00:51:09.747 --> 00:51:12.080
I mean, the church said, here
was good, and here is bad.

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.371
And here's how you conduct
yourselves to get to heaven.

00:51:14.371 --> 00:51:16.920
And here's how you conduct
yourselves if you don't care.

00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:19.100
And that was pretty
black and white.

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:20.994
And we have gotten rid of that.

00:51:20.994 --> 00:51:22.910
And that has been the
sort of the big struggle

00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:23.743
of the 20th century.

00:51:23.743 --> 00:51:26.310
It's, like, well, we'll have a
cultural replacement for that,

00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:26.809
right?

00:51:26.809 --> 00:51:29.309
And our decision on what that
cultural replacement would

00:51:29.309 --> 00:51:30.850
look like, at least
from the '80s on,

00:51:30.850 --> 00:51:32.070
was obviously the market.

00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:33.629
Because Adam Smith said.

00:51:33.629 --> 00:51:35.420
But Adam Smith also
said a few other things

00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:37.310
about the moral
imperative that had

00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:41.660
to accompany the free market and
in pursuit of individual self

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:43.660
interest, for the
invisible hand to work.

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:45.160
And that's sort
have been forgotten.

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:47.060
It comes down to
individual decisions.

00:51:49.765 --> 00:51:51.640
I think a lot of times,
what individuals want

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.020
is not to have to
worry about it.

00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:55.394
To be able to say to themselves,
if that button is there,

00:51:55.394 --> 00:51:56.530
I'm going to click it.

00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:58.090
And if it's there, it's fine.

00:51:58.090 --> 00:52:00.270
And that's really the extent
of my decision making.

00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:03.565
If I've got 450 horsepower under
the hood of my Dodge Viper--

00:52:03.565 --> 00:52:06.910
and if anyone has one, I'm
sorry, because they're cool--

00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:08.760
I'm going to use it.

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:12.270
I was out in Las Vegas
doing some deep research

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:12.900
for this story.

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:13.970
And there's a
place where you can

00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:16.178
go rent pretty much anything
out there, to try it out

00:52:16.178 --> 00:52:16.960
for the weekend.

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.530
And the Dodge Viper
is super popular.

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:20.842
Like, half the cars get
wrecked in the parking lot,

00:52:20.842 --> 00:52:23.050
because the guy's like
[VROOM NOISE] you know, just--

00:52:23.050 --> 00:52:23.549
anyway.

00:52:23.549 --> 00:52:25.730
Just put that in your
pipe and smoke it.

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:27.790
But it comes down
to individuals.

00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:30.765
And individuals make
decisions based on the culture

00:52:30.765 --> 00:52:32.240
that they're raised in.

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.050
And I think we have to go back
to imposing a moral framework.

00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:37.330
And then the question is,
well, whose moral framework?

00:52:37.330 --> 00:52:39.600
But that's a debate
we don't want to have.

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:42.089
We thought we'd eliminated
the need for that debate.

00:52:42.089 --> 00:52:44.130
Because we're going to
have the market handle it.

00:52:44.130 --> 00:52:46.200
And it turns out, no.

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.890
It's a moral discussion
we need to have.

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:50.302
And that's sort of what we're
on the cusp of, as well.

00:52:50.302 --> 00:52:52.260
And isn't necessarily
something that technology

00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:53.180
will help us in.

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:54.710
But it's also
something technology

00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:56.560
doesn't need to
hinder us in, either.

00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:59.090
But it's still a
discussion we need to have.

00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:01.620
So I know that's an
unsatisfactory answer.

00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:03.780
But it's what I've got today.

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:06.279
But thanks for the question.

00:53:06.279 --> 00:53:06.820
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:09.970
It seems like we're
on the brink of having

00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:14.210
the capability for people
to design and have things

00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:17.120
fabricated to their
own specifications.

00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:18.760
And I'd just like to
hear your thoughts

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:20.960
on how that's going to play out.

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.210
PAUL ROBERTS: So
do you mean, like,

00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:24.710
3D printing, as an example?

00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:25.460
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:27.335
PAUL ROBERTS: I mean,
this is a great example

00:53:27.335 --> 00:53:30.660
of the double-edged
nature of technology.

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:34.300
I mean, the ability
to make what you need

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:36.990
and not have to go somewhere
and waste all these resources.

00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:39.020
And to only make one
of them, as opposed

00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:42.570
to buying a three
pack at Costco.

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:44.782
And maybe the extra
labor and thought

00:53:44.782 --> 00:53:47.240
that goes into making it at
home, even though it's supposed

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:50.420
to be super easy, will
kind of reimpose this sense

00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:52.260
of deliberation on the decision.

00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:54.260
You know, now if you just
go in, and think well,

00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:57.360
jeez, I need a disposable razor.

00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.720
Oh look, there's a pack of 100.

00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:00.140
I'll get those.

00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:03.570
If you had to make each
razor, it's like, wow.

00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:06.420
I guess I can grow
a beard, you know.

00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:12.540
But I think that by bringing
back the act of production

00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:16.330
into individual life,
I think that can only

00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:17.370
have positive effects.

00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:22.260
Because we've really lost the
whole notion of production.

00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:24.109
That's why we call
ourselves consumers.

00:54:24.109 --> 00:54:25.150
We used to make a living.

00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:26.650
And now we just buy it.

00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:29.066
And by bringing that back in,
I think that could be great.

00:54:29.066 --> 00:54:31.010
I mean, clearly, if what
we're making is Uzis,

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:35.080
then there's a problem.

00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:36.010
And that concerns me.

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:38.210
But I don't think it's that.

00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:41.300
I think that issue will
have to be addressed along

00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:44.190
with the issue of other
potential abuses of all

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:46.830
this technological capability
we're putting out there.

00:54:46.830 --> 00:54:50.030
So I'm actually pretty hopeful
specifically for this notion

00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:52.020
of bringing the
act of production

00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:55.077
back into the lives
of individuals.

00:54:55.077 --> 00:54:55.577
Thanks.

00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:01.670
AUDIENCE: If the
human conscience

00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:04.930
fails to counteract
the selfishness

00:55:04.930 --> 00:55:10.720
and the overwhelming ability
that it is not balanced out

00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:15.532
by responsibility, what does the
Orwellian nightmare look like?

00:55:15.532 --> 00:55:17.240
PAUL ROBERTS: Well,
I think it looks more

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.920
like what we're
living in right now.

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:24.121
I mean, it's definitely more
inequality because-- I mean,

00:55:24.121 --> 00:55:25.870
I want to blame
everything on Wall Street,

00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:26.840
but why not, you know?

00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:27.340
No.

00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:30.320
There's so much
capability in that sector.

00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:33.966
And it's being used in ways that
are not entirely pro-social.

00:55:33.966 --> 00:55:35.340
I think what we'll
end up looking

00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:38.160
at is a more in-egalitarian
society-- one that

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:40.710
has a smaller and
smaller middle class.

00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:47.600
Because all the ways we sort
of propped up the middle class,

00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:50.110
and the circumstances that
allowed the middle class

00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:52.029
to flow, we're not
interested in restoring,

00:55:52.029 --> 00:55:53.570
in a society that's
solely interested

00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:55.215
in instant gratification.

00:55:55.215 --> 00:55:58.080
You know, Tyler Cowen, his
book "The End of Average"--

00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:02.740
I think he paints a pretty
plausible picture for what

00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:04.750
such a society would look like.

00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:07.350
And then once you've split
a society so effectively

00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:10.770
between those in the top, the
expert class, and everyone

00:56:10.770 --> 00:56:13.950
else, then democracy
becomes, in fact, a joke.

00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:17.040
Because why would
you politically

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.710
buy into a situation like that?

00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:21.140
And once democracy is a
joke-- or I should say,

00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:24.010
more of a joke than it already
is-- then everything sort of

00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:24.990
falls apart.

00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:28.650
And because we've
developed this capacity

00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:30.790
for incremental change,
and change that's

00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:35.410
so massive and yet so
hard to detect sometimes,

00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:38.260
all this could have happened,
like, last year, already.

00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:40.149
I mean, I might
not even be here.

00:56:40.149 --> 00:56:42.690
It's just one of those things
where you realize-- seriously--

00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:46.320
that so much of this stuff
is already under way.

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:50.720
And I think when I'm
being really paranoid--

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:54.126
and I come from Washington
state, where pot is now legal.

00:56:54.126 --> 00:56:55.500
When I'm being
really paranoid, I

00:56:55.500 --> 00:57:00.690
sort of think that we're
past the point where

00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:02.936
we can make a difference.

00:57:02.936 --> 00:57:04.310
And in part, we're
past the point

00:57:04.310 --> 00:57:08.450
because we're so accustomed
to having what we want now

00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:12.920
that the idea of systematically
delaying gratification

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:15.140
is beyond our capacity.

00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:20.240
Now, it may be done for us,
when systems break down.

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:24.490
But maybe the worst nightmare is
that we sort of continue along

00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:27.880
well enough to sort of keep
the cloak in front of our eyes.

00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:30.250
So that's, you know,
when I'm feeling

00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:32.240
super paranoid and pessimistic.

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:36.540
On the other hand, when I see
people in my own community

00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:41.900
who are stepping back and like,
quitting a high-powered Wall

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:43.280
Street job to become a teacher.

00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:44.050
I love these stories.

00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:45.758
I mean, I'm reading
them on the internet.

00:57:45.758 --> 00:57:47.340
And actually, I cry every time.

00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:49.250
Because it's corny.

00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:50.920
But I mean, the idea
that someone says,

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.357
ugh, this thing
isn't working for me,

00:57:53.357 --> 00:57:54.940
even though I'm
making a lot of money.

00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:56.820
It's stressful and
it feels wrong.

00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:59.310
And then they end up teaching
math in an inner city.

00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:02.000
And you know, maybe it
doesn't last forever.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.550
But I mean, that
potential is there.

00:58:04.550 --> 00:58:07.635
That sort of
individual capability

00:58:07.635 --> 00:58:09.760
and individual willingness
to think beyond the self

00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:10.384
is still there.

00:58:10.384 --> 00:58:12.170
And I guess that's
what gives me hope.

00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:14.480
So, yeah, thanks.

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.980
AUDIENCE: A lot of
what you describe

00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:18.100
is just technological
progress to me.

00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:20.870
You know, if showrooming
eliminates showrooms,

00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:23.985
I guess it's just like
trains eliminated coaches.

00:58:23.985 --> 00:58:28.180
And maybe cars
diminished the role

00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:30.020
of trains in individual
transportation.

00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:33.710
That's [INAUDIBLE] of
many examples out there.

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:35.044
So I'm not so concerned.

00:58:35.044 --> 00:58:36.710
I mean, maybe concerned
about, you know,

00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:38.904
that's just the way
things have been.

00:58:38.904 --> 00:58:41.070
What about-- but there's
something bigger, I think--

00:58:41.070 --> 00:58:44.720
and that's-- you and me simply
had some conversation over

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:50.060
lunch-- what about
optimization of jobs?

00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:54.190
That robots not only replace
many manufacturing jobs,

00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:59.180
but many other jobs--
white collar jobs.

00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:03.712
The biggest social question I
see, and I kind of worry-- I

00:59:03.712 --> 00:59:06.170
don't know if it's the question
of next five years or maybe

00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:07.394
next 20 years.

00:59:07.394 --> 00:59:08.852
But I think it's
a question we have

00:59:08.852 --> 00:59:13.740
to face soon is there will
be no jobs for people.

00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:15.052
And we're done.

00:59:15.052 --> 00:59:17.020
What are your thoughts?

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:17.360
PAUL ROBERTS: Well,
that's all the time we've

00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:18.867
got for questions
today. (LAUGHS)

00:59:18.867 --> 00:59:20.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:22.700
Yeah, I mean, that's sort of
the 64 trillion question, right?

00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:24.658
It's like, well, so this
automation has kind of

00:59:24.658 --> 00:59:25.850
gone past the assembly line.

00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:27.760
It's now moving into
the white collar.

00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:30.160
Half the sports stories
you read on the wire

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:31.990
are all done by robot.

00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:34.840
And not that you'd know.

00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:37.680
And lawyers-- I mean, the
whole legal profession

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:40.310
is just being turned inside
out by these algorithms that

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:41.979
can do-- And so
yes, it's happening.

00:59:41.979 --> 00:59:43.770
And I think you raise
an interesting point.

00:59:43.770 --> 00:59:45.570
Because you made
initially the point

00:59:45.570 --> 00:59:47.600
that well, we didn't
worry too much

00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:51.980
about when cars replaced
horse and buggy, right?

00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:53.820
And that's just sort
of the way things go.

00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:55.670
But think what cars brought.

00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:57.820
The car was part
of a much larger,

00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:00.650
massive multi-phase
Industrial Revolution that

01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:02.400
included not just cars
and transportation,

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.316
but included all the
ancillary industries that

01:00:04.316 --> 01:00:05.290
had to feed into cars.

01:00:05.290 --> 01:00:06.716
So it was like,
tires, and steel.

01:00:06.716 --> 01:00:08.090
And all the
engineering expertise

01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:08.950
that had to go into that.

01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:11.033
And the petrochemical
business, and road building.

01:00:11.033 --> 01:00:13.917
So you have all these massive
multiplier effects going along.

01:00:13.917 --> 01:00:15.500
And in many of these
sectors, the jobs

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:18.340
were higher paying than they
had been in the horse and buggy.

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.220
So you have this
massive explosion.

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.670
A lot of destruction, but
a lot of creation, as well.

01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:27.490
We have not seen that happen
in the automation revolution,

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:29.450
as you point out.

01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:31.390
We're coming up with new jobs.

01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:34.830
But they don't replace the
jobs in terms of wages,

01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:35.521
by any means.

01:00:35.521 --> 01:00:37.270
I know you've heard
this statistic before,

01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:46.000
but 60% of the jobs that
were lost in the recession

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.946
were mid wage jobs.

01:00:47.946 --> 01:00:49.570
And 60% of the ones
that have come back

01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:50.742
are service, are low wage.

01:00:50.742 --> 01:00:52.450
And you know, people
keep thinking, well,

01:00:52.450 --> 01:00:53.841
that's just an anomaly.

01:00:53.841 --> 01:00:54.840
Things are going around.

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:56.096
It's like-- oh, well.

01:00:56.096 --> 01:00:58.220
And it's really making it
tough for a lot of people

01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:01.050
who have always supported
creative destruction

01:01:01.050 --> 01:01:03.610
as this thing that's
worth the pain.

01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:06.060
And that argument is
getting-- I mean, who knows?

01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:07.310
Maybe things will turn around.

01:01:07.310 --> 01:01:11.360
Maybe that pattern will
return to the mean.

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.510
But maybe not.

01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:14.410
And then we have a
real question to ask.

01:01:14.410 --> 01:01:16.410
So is the answer basic income?

01:01:16.410 --> 01:01:18.370
Do we just acknowledge
that we've lost,

01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:21.230
and let's just start
taxing the rich even more,

01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:23.000
and creating a basic income?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.116
And then, OK, so that allows
a certain level of security

01:01:26.116 --> 01:01:26.990
that people can feel.

01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:28.630
And maybe that level
of security allows

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:30.275
them to be more civic minded.

01:01:30.275 --> 01:01:30.900
So that's good.

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:32.310
But then what about
the incentives

01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:33.684
for giving people
a basic income?

01:01:33.684 --> 01:01:35.760
What does that do to
their willingness to work?

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:39.410
And so, I mean,
it's really tough.

01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:41.030
And at the end of
the day, there's

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:44.300
no constitutional guarantee
that we get through this mess.

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:48.110
I think we've come through
so many things in the past.

01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:50.990
And we've conquered some pretty
complex challenges in the past.

01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:52.440
And we've done so collectively.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:55.380
And I think that's what
gives us the optimism.

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:57.589
And we know what
the worst case is.

01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:59.880
We're sort of talking, we're
describing the worst case.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.421
And what I'm interested
in is, what's

01:02:01.421 --> 01:02:05.080
the next step away
from the worst case?

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.670
Now that's the thing I want
to focus on, because I mean,

01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:09.520
I sort of grew up
professionally covering

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.470
the environmental movement.

01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:14.776
And you have not met a bunch
of gloomier, grumpier people

01:02:14.776 --> 01:02:15.900
than the environmentalists.

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:18.420
It's just like, geeze
Louise, you guys.

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:22.182
I mean, I get that the world is
ending, but come on, you know?

01:02:22.182 --> 01:02:24.140
And then you go talk to
the business community,

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:25.800
and they're like-- that's
where all the optimists are.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.170
They're all like,
yeah, this is great.

01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:29.477
And you realize, you've got
to have some combination.

01:02:29.477 --> 01:02:31.560
You've got to have that
energy of the marketplace.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.310
And I know-- ah, gee,
I should slap myself

01:02:34.310 --> 01:02:35.780
for being so cliche,
but I mean, it

01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:39.170
has to be a solution that
involves the market, you know?

01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:43.364
But we omitted ourselves
as the decision makers

01:02:43.364 --> 01:02:45.280
for so long, because we
basically said, oh, we

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:46.821
don't have to have
a moral framework.

01:02:46.821 --> 01:02:47.740
This is so great.

01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:50.190
It's just a vacation
all the time.

01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:51.290
And it isn't the case.

01:02:51.290 --> 01:02:52.290
That's got to come back.

01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:54.030
So we have to make
decisions about,

01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:56.010
how much are we willing
to pay for food?

01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:57.030
Because it turns
out, if we follow

01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:58.880
that trend toward
automation and outsourcing,

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.296
well, we can get
food super cheap.

01:03:00.296 --> 01:03:04.000
And we'll have truckloads
of beef for like, $0.99.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.530
But the cost to the economy,
and to the job market,

01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:11.500
and to society, and our civic
fabric will be intolerable.

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:14.830
So that's why I like
the local food movement

01:03:14.830 --> 01:03:16.750
as a way to consider this.

01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:18.710
Because it forces you
to kind of go, wow.

01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:20.230
This food is good.

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:21.490
And it's fresh.

01:03:21.490 --> 01:03:22.800
And I can see the producer.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.700
And I realize that
it involves work.

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.590
And it involves a
person doing this work.

01:03:27.590 --> 01:03:30.930
And OK, it makes sense.

01:03:30.930 --> 01:03:35.530
I at least have some insight as
to why food should cost more.

01:03:35.530 --> 01:03:37.680
Is that the way to
reorient society?

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:38.290
I doubt it.

01:03:38.290 --> 01:03:40.590
But I mean, it offers us a clue.

01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:42.799
So anyway, that's my two bits.

01:03:42.799 --> 01:03:43.840
Or actually my four bits.

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.689
It's special today.

01:03:45.689 --> 01:03:46.675
Any other questions?

01:03:52.098 --> 01:03:55.056
AUDIENCE: Over the
last couple of decades,

01:03:55.056 --> 01:04:02.740
this civilization has been
willing to throw bombs

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:05.100
in order to spread itself.

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.770
I'm making it very provocative.

01:04:06.770 --> 01:04:11.836
But in light of what
you are discovering,

01:04:11.836 --> 01:04:14.210
does it shed doubt that we
have the moral right to do so?

01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:18.890
And maybe their
ways might actually

01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:23.030
be not inferior in
some certain respects?

01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:25.874
PAUL ROBERTS: Now, whose way?

01:04:25.874 --> 01:04:28.290
AUDIENCE: Well, I'm talking
about the Western civilization

01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:30.500
that we're all embedded in.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:34.730
And I'm talking about the
turmoil in the Middle East

01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:35.880
and so on.

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:36.975
So--

01:04:36.975 --> 01:04:38.100
PAUL ROBERTS: You mean so--

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:40.308
AUDIENCE: There are countries
and societies out there

01:04:40.308 --> 01:04:42.060
that violently
and aggressively--

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:48.150
and energetically oppose our
ways of liberty and that.

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:55.290
And sometimes those oppositions
end up being armed conflicts.

01:04:55.290 --> 01:05:01.300
And the narrative behind that
is Enduring Freedom-- the catch

01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:04.047
phrase.

01:05:04.047 --> 01:05:04.880
Is that still right?

01:05:07.382 --> 01:05:08.840
PAUL ROBERTS: I
mean, well, one way

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.920
to answer that would
be to sort of ask,

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:14.790
what of these traditional
value sets is worth preserving?

01:05:14.790 --> 01:05:19.950
And is our privilege to select?

01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:22.677
And I think, in any society
that's in a tumultuous stage

01:05:22.677 --> 01:05:24.760
like we are right now,
there's always the instinct

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:26.862
to reach back for more
conservative-- I mean,

01:05:26.862 --> 01:05:28.570
that's the whole notion
of reactionaries.

01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:29.750
I mean, that's what happens.

01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:32.340
It's a potentially
dangerous time.

01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:34.580
But you look back--
I'll just use

01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:37.539
a mundane example
of the Victorians

01:05:37.539 --> 01:05:39.580
and how they dealt with
subjects that were taboo.

01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:42.080
I mean, you never discussed
politics or religion

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:43.150
at the dinner table.

01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:45.410
And you do that because
you avoided arguments.

01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:48.060
And you allowed other
sort of social engagement

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:49.830
to go forward.

01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:53.510
And, you know, I don't know
that the Victorians had

01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:56.080
the answer to everything,
or even a few things.

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:59.260
But they did have a
few things figured out.

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:00.860
And you look at
the way that we're

01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:03.199
so willing to share
anything with a stranger.

01:06:03.199 --> 01:06:04.740
I mean, you sit down
on a plane, it's

01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:08.059
like, wow, at the end of a
45 minute flight-- you know,

01:06:08.059 --> 01:06:09.850
(SILLY VOICE) "I'll
promise I'll write you.

01:06:09.850 --> 01:06:13.100
We're best buds now."

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:15.510
Some things, I think,
should be withheld.

01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:17.600
That's just-- I'm 53 years
old and sort of coming

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:18.989
to that conclusion, finally.

01:06:18.989 --> 01:06:21.280
And maybe there is something
to these older traditions.

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:24.950
But I think you can't run
to them as total solutions.

01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:26.680
You have to understand
what they offer.

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.744
And what the costs
and benefits are.

01:06:28.744 --> 01:06:30.160
You know, we're
sort of wishing we

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.740
had this-- like,
you buy a house.

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:33.340
You lock in your
30-year mortgage.

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:34.881
And you don't have
to worry about it.

01:06:34.881 --> 01:06:37.190
And there's no analog here.

01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:39.250
We're going to have
be fighting over this

01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:40.830
and debating this forever.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:44.580
And this tension between the
individual and the collective

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:45.552
is inherent.

01:06:45.552 --> 01:06:46.510
And will never go away.

01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:48.319
And if it did, that
would be scary.

01:06:48.319 --> 01:06:49.860
So it's a battle
we're going to have.

01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:52.060
And you guys are sort
of front and center.

01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:56.580
So thank you very much for the
attention and the questions.

01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:59.400
And all the best with
everything you're doing.

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:00.950
Thanks.
