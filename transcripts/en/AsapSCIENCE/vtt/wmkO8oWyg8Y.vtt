00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
With the 2012 London Olympic games beginning in under a month

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.820
many athletes have been hard at work, training day in and day out. But some endurance competitors have found a secret advantage...

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.400
One that lurks high above sea levels and upon mountain tops.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.180
No, it's not Julie Andrews, but rather the altitude itself.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.660
These athletes are using Altitude Training.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.660
Most of us have experienced being under water,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.120
and the pressure that comes along with swimming too deep.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.900
This is because the further down you go, the more water molecules you have above you, compressing the water down on you.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.340
This pressure can even cause your ears to pop

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.820
The same goes for air.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.580
At sea level, the air particles exist at a particular distance from one another.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.500
And the higher up you go, the less pressure they have on them,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.680
allowing them to spread apart more freely.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.900
But because of the spreading, the availability of oxygen for you to breathe in actually decreases.

00:00:47.976 --> 00:00:50.316
So how could this possibly create an advantage?

00:00:50.356 --> 00:00:53.436
Well, to compensate for the lack of available oxygen in your body

00:00:53.596 --> 00:00:56.216
A protein in your body called Erythropoictin is triggered.

00:00:56.216 --> 00:00:59.336
And begins the production of more and larger red blood cells.

00:00:59.416 --> 00:01:05.856
Blood cells carry oxygen around the body, so the more blood cells you have, the more oxygen can be transported to your muscles and organs.

00:01:05.856 --> 00:01:11.076
But this process takes some time, which explains why some people feel sick when quickly travelling to high altitudes.

00:01:11.076 --> 00:01:14.160
Their body is simply isn't receiving enough oxygen.

00:01:14.176 --> 00:01:18.036
Once the extra Erythropoictin kicks in, their body will slowly acclimatise.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.840
But just as it takes time for the process to kick in, it can take a while for it to turn off as well.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.900
In fact, it can take up to 10-14 days after returning to lower altitudes.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.280
For this reason, many athletes will subject their bodies to high altitudes.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.320
Preferably, over 2400m.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.060
So that when they come back down to lower levels, the body has increased blood cell mass and volume.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.100
This method has been dubbed the "live high, train low" principle.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.320
Whereby, the athletes train at low altitudes in order to not over exhaust their bodies or get sick.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:54.100
This extra oxygen in the body, not only creates a distinct advantage for aerobic athletes, but could be the distinction between bronze, silver or gold

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.480
In fact, some facilities are now being created as low oxygen level houses.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.820
The athletes live and sleep inside of the house but train outside where their bodies will take in higher oxygen levels.

00:02:04.852 --> 00:02:07.392
Yeays, somewhat natural alternative to drug enhancements.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.460
