Bayne: Hi, my name
is Michael Bayne.

00:00:02.067 --> 00:00:03.534
I'm the CTO
of Three Rings,

00:00:03.534 --> 00:00:05.133
and also the lead engineer
on Whirled,

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.133
which is the project
that I want to show you today.

00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:10.067
We used the Google Web Toolkit
to build Whirled.

00:00:10.067 --> 00:00:13.267
Whirled is a social
virtual world Web site,

00:00:13.267 --> 00:00:15.868
um, which means that it's part
social networking Web site,

00:00:15.868 --> 00:00:18.901
and it's part
virtual world.

00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:21.667
As a social networking Web site,
we have a lot of things

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:23.167
that you would come
to expect.

00:00:23.167 --> 00:00:24.200
Uh, there's a feed
that tells you

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.467
what your friends
have been up to.

00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:28.634
You have friends.
Those friends have profiles.

00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:31.234
Um, you can be
members of groups.

00:00:31.234 --> 00:00:33.701
In the groups,
there are discussion boards,

00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:35.467
so you can talk
to people about things

00:00:35.467 --> 00:00:36.868
that are going on
in the world.

00:00:36.868 --> 00:00:39.000
Um, you can send people mail.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.601
You know,
we have photo galleries,

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:43.100
and all sorts
of stuff like that.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.734
And then it's also
part virtual world,

00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:47.200
which is a little more like

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.234
massive multiplayer
online games.

00:00:49.234 --> 00:00:50.467
You have an avatar.

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.501
You're wandering around
in virtual spaces.

00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:54.501
We can go and find some people
here and talk to them.

00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:55.667
Howdy, guys.

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:57.267
Everything kind of happens
in real time.

00:00:57.267 --> 00:01:01.300
Um, and there's also, um,
games that you can play

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.968
with people
in the virtual world.

00:01:02.968 --> 00:01:04.534
It's kind of
a casual games Web site

00:01:04.534 --> 00:01:06.868
on top of all these
other things.

00:01:06.868 --> 00:01:09.767
So here we can see
one of our games

00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:11.000
called Corpse Craft.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.067
It's a pretty popular one

00:01:12.067 --> 00:01:14.501
where you play
this little puzzle game,

00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:17.467
and you--in doing that,
you reanimate corpses,

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:19.200
and then you
send them to go

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.734
and destroy the base
of your enemy.

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:23.434
We used GWT to build
the social networking Web site

00:01:23.434 --> 00:01:24.567
part of Whirled.

00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:25.667
Um, and it's done a lot

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:26.734
of the heavy lifting
for us there,

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:27.834
which has been
really great.

00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:29.400
Um, it has a module system,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.067
and we broke Whirled up
into a bunch of little modules,

00:01:32.067 --> 00:01:34.100
and then we put it
all together

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.701
into actually
a bunch of different

00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:37.701
little GWT applications.

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:39.567
And having the ability to factor
everything out like that

00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:42.200
has been a huge bonus.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.033
Uh, we also use
the internationalization system,

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:45.467
uh, which is great.

00:01:45.467 --> 00:01:48.033
Hopefully the Whirled will
someday take over the world.

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:51.367
Um, and that has
saved us some time.

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:52.868
And we've also even been able
to extend that

00:01:52.868 --> 00:01:56.100
using GWT's generators to do
some sort of custom stuff

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.467
that we needed.

00:01:57.467 --> 00:01:58.534
We've also been able to use

00:01:58.534 --> 00:02:00.167
third-party libraries
very easily

00:02:00.167 --> 00:02:01.968
when we need to do
drag and drop.

00:02:01.968 --> 00:02:04.567
Or if we need
to use a date-picker widget,

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:07.400
then we can integrate someone
else's third-party library

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.400
without a whole lot
of headache.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.934
Um, and Whirled's
actually grown quite a lot

00:02:11.934 --> 00:02:13.200
over the last two years,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.133
and it's now about 60,000 lines
of code

00:02:15.133 --> 00:02:16.467
just for the client.

00:02:16.467 --> 00:02:18.834
And so being able
to sort of enforce the same kind

00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:20.067
of engineering discipline
that we do

00:02:20.067 --> 00:02:21.934
everywhere on the project
has been a huge help

00:02:21.934 --> 00:02:23.434
in keeping the client
from turning

00:02:23.434 --> 00:02:25.434
into a sort of hairy mess.

00:02:25.434 --> 00:02:28.234
It's also great to be able
to use Java on the client

00:02:28.234 --> 00:02:29.701
and the server.

00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:31.567
We also use ActionScript
on the project,

00:02:31.567 --> 00:02:34.067
and when we have to coordinate
between Java and ActionScript,

00:02:34.067 --> 00:02:35.167
it's really kind of a pain.

00:02:35.167 --> 00:02:36.467
And so not having
that extra pain

00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:38.734
when we're doing the client
is a huge benefit.
