let's write that symbolically that's

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829
let's write that symbolically that's
 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.130
let's write that symbolically that's
first-order logic but we can just

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140
first-order logic but we can just
 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.049
first-order logic but we can just
simplify that even further with the two

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059
simplify that even further with the two
 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.260

using any two propositions a and B where
 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.040
using any two propositions a and B where
a implies B we can get to the inverse

even more playful with your logic is

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:44.939
even more playful with your logic is
 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:46.910
even more playful with your logic is
that you can use the concepts

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920
that you can use the concepts
 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.789

for example the inverse isn't just the

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739
for example the inverse isn't just the
 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.830
for example the inverse isn't just the
inverse of the statement it's also the

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840
inverse of the statement it's also the
 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.649
inverse of the statement it's also the
converse of the contrapositive because

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659
converse of the contrapositive because
 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.809
converse of the contrapositive because
it switches the two propositions around

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819
it switches the two propositions around
 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.929
it switches the two propositions around
and the contrapositive isn't just the

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939
and the contrapositive isn't just the
 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.690
and the contrapositive isn't just the
contrapositive it's also the converse of

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700
contrapositive it's also the converse of
 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.270
contrapositive it's also the converse of
the inverse this is possible because

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280
the inverse this is possible because
 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.420
the inverse this is possible because
every statement can be reevaluated just

every statement can be reevaluated just
 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.780
every statement can be reevaluated just

precisely so take this first step to
 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.020
precisely so take this first step to
straighten out for yourself the

straighten out for yourself the
 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.509
straighten out for yourself the
relationship between a statement and the

relationship between a statement and the
 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.719
relationship between a statement and the
ways it can be twisted up
