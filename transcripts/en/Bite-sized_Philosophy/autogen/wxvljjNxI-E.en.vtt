way I think I think I've read if they're
a bit offical and I think everything he

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309
a bit offical and I think everything he
 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.759
a bit offical and I think everything he
says is obvious so for example he

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769
says is obvious so for example he
 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.640
says is obvious so for example he
criticizes the idea of mental illness as

obviously I mean it's not like
 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.269
obviously I mean it's not like
psychiatrists and psychologists and

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279

relatively well-informed haven't known
 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.540
relatively well-informed haven't known
about that since for the last 60 years I

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550
about that since for the last 60 years I
 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.720
about that since for the last 60 years I
mean it might be a revelation to people

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730
mean it might be a revelation to people
 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.440
mean it might be a revelation to people
who who don't notice that psyche

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450
who who don't notice that psyche
 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.479

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489
psychiatry for example is something like
 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.779
psychiatry for example is something like
a compromise between the patient biology

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789
a compromise between the patient biology
 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.830
a compromise between the patient biology
and the social world you know I mean

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840
and the social world you know I mean

psychiatric ailments often have a
biological tilt but the way they

biological tilt but the way they
 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.979

at the point that the person who has
that biological predisposition exists

see them saying well that wasn't real

Marxism which i think is a cop-out of

Marxism which i think is a cop-out of
 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.810
Marxism which i think is a cop-out of
staggering proportions it usually means

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820
staggering proportions it usually means
 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.910

country that wouldn't have happened you

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110
country that wouldn't have happened you
 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.900
country that wouldn't have happened you
know that's the logic behind it

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910
know that's the logic behind it
 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.430
know that's the logic behind it
they didn't put the principles into

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440
they didn't put the principles into
 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.200
they didn't put the principles into
practice properly it's like yeah well

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210
practice properly it's like yeah well
 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.820
practice properly it's like yeah well
lots of people put the damn principles

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830
lots of people put the damn principles
 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.140
lots of people put the damn principles
into practice and the same thing

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150
into practice and the same thing
 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.660
into practice and the same thing
happened everywhere so at some point you

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670
happened everywhere so at some point you
 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.010
happened everywhere so at some point you
have to kind of wonder if there's

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020
have to kind of wonder if there's
 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.330
have to kind of wonder if there's
something wrong with the principles

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340
something wrong with the principles
 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.890
something wrong with the principles
anyways what Foucault did was take the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900
anyways what Foucault did was take the
 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.900
anyways what Foucault did was take the
Marxist presupposition that everything

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910
Marxist presupposition that everything
 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.020
Marxist presupposition that everything
was could be boiled down to economics

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030
was could be boiled down to economics
 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.270
was could be boiled down to economics
and economic power and translated it

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280
and economic power and translated it
 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.890
and economic power and translated it
into the idea that everything just

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900
into the idea that everything just
 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.530
into the idea that everything just
boiled down to power you know and that

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540
boiled down to power you know and that
 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.540
boiled down to power you know and that
the reason that we have institutions is

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550
the reason that we have institutions is
 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.150
the reason that we have institutions is
to include and to exclude and that the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160
to include and to exclude and that the
 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.449
to include and to exclude and that the
institutions always run for the benefit

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459
institutions always run for the benefit
 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.820
institutions always run for the benefit
of those at the top it's like well yeah

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830
of those at the top it's like well yeah
 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.580
of those at the top it's like well yeah
that's a little bit true but it's you

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590
that's a little bit true but it's you
 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.890
that's a little bit true but it's you
know it's it's a scientist would look at

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900
know it's it's a scientist would look at
 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.570
know it's it's a scientist would look at
that and say yeah well probably you know

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580
that and say yeah well probably you know
 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.890
that and say yeah well probably you know
power dynamics in a in a functioning

power dynamics in a in a functioning
economic and political system maybe

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980
economic and political system maybe

account for 10% of the variance
 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.110
account for 10% of the variance
something like that maybe 15% so for

something like that maybe 15% so for

to an Ivy League school well if your

to an Ivy League school well if your
 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.600
to an Ivy League school well if your
parents went to the school you're more

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610
parents went to the school you're more
 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.310
parents went to the school you're more
likely to get in but you're not that

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320
likely to get in but you're not that
 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.380
likely to get in but you're not that
much more likely to get in and you still

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390
much more likely to get in and you still
 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.330
much more likely to get in and you still
have to be you know roughly speaking

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340
have to be you know roughly speaking
 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.400
have to be you know roughly speaking
what happens is that if you have a

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410
what happens is that if you have a
 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.759
what happens is that if you have a
pretty decent you know high school GPA

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769
pretty decent you know high school GPA
 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.729
pretty decent you know high school GPA
and you do very well on the SATs and you

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739
and you do very well on the SATs and you
 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.500

because that's also necessary then they

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580
because that's also necessary then they
 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.490
because that's also necessary then they
might pick you over someone else who's

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500
might pick you over someone else who's
 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.590
might pick you over someone else who's
roughly equally qualified if you have a

could do that and there's some truth in

presupposition the problem with that
 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.340
presupposition the problem with that
presupposition is that everything is

applied to Foucault himself so you'd

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760
applied to Foucault himself so you'd
 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.460
applied to Foucault himself so you'd
have to ask if you were a student of

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470
have to ask if you were a student of
 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.480
have to ask if you were a student of
Foucault what power aims drove his

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490

attempt to analyze everything in terms
 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.220
attempt to analyze everything in terms
of power and I actually think with

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:58.230
of power and I actually think with
 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.610
of power and I actually think with
Foucault it's pretty obvious so but it's

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620
Foucault it's pretty obvious so but it's
 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.970
Foucault it's pretty obvious so but it's
a game that never goes anywhere
