00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.250
The debt limit is kind of a financial weapon
of mass destruction chained to the United

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.450
States government by the United States government.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.450
Confused?

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.660
Then it's time for The United States debt
limit Explained.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.679
To understand the debt limit you need to know
the US splits financial responsibility between

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.360
the president and congress.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.810
The president has two jobs when it comes to
money:

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.810
1.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.810
Collect taxes and...

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.810
2.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.990
Spend those taxes to run the government.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.559
This might give you the impression that the
president, with regards to money, is all-powerful.

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:30.119
Especially when you hear news reports on 'the
president's new budget' or his plan to 'raise

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.460
taxes on haberdashers' or 'lower taxes on
apiarists'.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.460
But reality is just the opposite and the president
is the one who takes orders.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.600
From whom?

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.600
Congress.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.660
Congress has the jobs of setting the tax level
and determining how much the government will

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.489
spend by writing a budget.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.859
So while the president does get to submit
budgets to congress, and asks for changes

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.079
in the tax level, these are just requests
that congress doesn't have to pay attention

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.079
to.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.780
Congress can add or subtract anything they
want from the president's budget or throw

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.020
it out entirely and write a new one.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.340
The same goes for the level of taxes.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.170
So congress decides what it wants: bridges,
tanks, buildings, courts, robots on Mars,

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.980
robots on Earth, National Parks, whatever
and approves a budget with that stuff in it.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.020
Once approved the president's is required
by law to spend the money Congress listed

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.090
in the budget and pay for it using the taxes
that congress set.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.100
As long as more taxes come in than spending
goes out everything is fine.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.700
But, almost always, Congress puts more stuff
in the budget than they cover with taxes which

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.509
means the president must borrow money to cover
the difference.

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.470
In most countries the story ends here because
if their legislatures approved more spending

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.600
than they have income, they've also implicitly
approved the necessary borrowing -- but not

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.600
in America.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.799
Here Congress *also* limits the total amount
of debt the United States can have.

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.100
A debt limit sounds like a good idea until
you see the real-world consequences of these

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.450
two branches of government interacting.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.460
As the total amount borrowed gets closer to
the limit, Congress usually points to the

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.119
president and acts shocked, *shocked* that
his reckless spending has brought us so close

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.869
to the debt limit that they, reasonable, prudent
Congress have set.

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.280
And while it's technically correct that the
president has borrowed this money, congress

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.660
has forced him to do it, by approving a budget
that the president is legally obligated to

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.450
spend without also approving the necessary
taxes to cover that spending.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.280
So the debt limit fight is essentially the
government version of the playground favorite:

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.220
'stop hitting yourself' except with added
terror for everyone watching.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.830
For, it's important to note, the debt limit
is not about future spending -- it's not a

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.870
credit card on which the limit will be raised
so a crazy government party can be thrown

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.750
-- the debt limit is about paying bills already
incurred.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.250
For example, the government hires a company
to repave a federal highway.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.990
But if the US is at the debt limit, when the
company asks to be paid after the work has

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.750
been done, the government can't.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.950
This shakes trust in the US and since large
parts of the global economy depend on the

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.470
dollar being trust worthy, messing with that
trust is a big deal.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.350
But there is a way out: Congress can raise
the debt limit and, because of the aforementioned

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.000
terror, they always have.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.290
So… if not raising the debt ceiling is potentially
disastrous and the solution is simple and

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.700
always taken in the end: *why does this debate
last months‽*

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.700
Because: politics.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.730
The debt limit isn't in the constitution,
congress created it themselves and from their

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.620
point of view, the debt limit is awesome because:

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.620
1.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.910
It creates a problem that
2.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.680
Congress can (technically) blame on the president
who

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.680
3.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.890
Needs the solution that only they can provide

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.850
Congress gets to use the threat of mutual
financial self destruction as leverage in

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.040
negations that they benefit from extending
until the last… possible…

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.900
second.
