00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.333
- [Voiceover] Hey everyone.

00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.560
So, in the last video I was
talking about divergence

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.480
and kind of laying down the
intuition that we need for it.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.400
Where you're imagining a
vector field as representing

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.900
some kind of fluid flow
where particles move

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.920
according to the vector
that they're attached to

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.420
in that point in time and as they move

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.060
to a different point the
vector they're attached to

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.300
is different so their
velocity changes in some way.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.241
And the key question that
we want to think about is

00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:24.200
"If you have a given
point somewhere in space,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.500
"does fluid tend to
flow towards that point

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.200
"or does it tend to
flow more away from it?"

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.580
Does it diverge away from that point?

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.940
And what I wanna do here
is start kinda closing

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.400
our grasp on that intuition
a little bit more tightly,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.300
as if we are trying to
discover the formula for

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.140
divergence ourselves, because
ultimately that's what

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.760
I'm gonna get to, a
formula for divergence.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.340
But I want it to be
something that's not just

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.100
plopped down in front of
you, but something that you

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.640
actually, you know,
feel deep in your bones.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.520
So a vector field like the
one I have pictured above

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.601
is given as a function, a
multi-variable function,

00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:57.041
with a two-dimensional input,

00:00:57.041 --> 00:00:59.360
since it's a two-dimensional vector field,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.841
and then some kinda
two-dimensional output.

00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:05.924
And it's common to write
P and Q as the functions

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.601
for these, the components of the output.

00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:12.960
So P and Q are each just
scalar value functions

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.360
and you think of them as the components of

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.940
your vector valued output.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.860
And the divergence is
kinda like a derivative,

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.540
where you might denote it by just div,

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.900
and in the same way that your
derivative, you have this

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.241
operator and what it does
is it takes in a function.

00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:27.880
And what you get is a whole new function.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.200
This div operator you
think of as taking in

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.320
a vector field of some kind
and you get a new function.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.681
And the new function you
get will be scalar valued,

00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:38.780
it'll be something that just
takes in points in space

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.220
and outputs a number,
because what you're thinking,

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.740
the thing that it's trying to do

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.780
is take in some specific
point with XY coordinates

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.020
and just give you a
single number to tell you

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.820
"Hey, does fluid tend
to diverge away from it?

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.200
"How much, or does it tend to
flow towards it and how much?"

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.480
So this is the kind of, the form

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.381
of the thing that we're going for.

00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:00.062
So here what we're gonna
do is just start thinking

00:02:00.062 --> 00:02:03.561
about cases where this divergence
is positive, or negative,

00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:05.561
or zero and what that should look like.

00:02:05.561 --> 00:02:08.881
So for example, let's say we
want cases where the divergence

00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:13.048
of our vector field at a
specific point XY is positive.

00:02:15.461 --> 00:02:17.341
What might that look like?

00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:20.121
So one case would be where your
point, nothing is happening

00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:22.301
at that point and the vector
attached to it is zero,

00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:25.241
and everyone around it is going away.

00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:28.342
This is kinda the extreme
example of positive divergence.

00:02:28.342 --> 00:02:31.222
And I animated this in the
last video where we have

00:02:31.222 --> 00:02:33.921
you know, all of the vectors
pointing away from the origin

00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:35.901
and if you look at a
region around that origin,

00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:38.421
all the fluid particles
kinda go out of that region.

00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:42.841
And that's the quintessential
positive divergence example.

00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:44.061
But it doesn't have to look like that.

00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:46.621
It actually, I mean, you
could have something where

00:02:46.621 --> 00:02:50.001
there is a little bit of
movement at your point

00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:52.381
and then maybe there's
movement towards it as well

00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:55.201
from one side, and vectors
are kind of going towards it,

00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:58.901
but they're going away
from it even more rapidly

00:02:58.901 --> 00:03:01.261
on the other side, so if
you think of any kind of

00:03:01.261 --> 00:03:03.462
actual region around your
point, you're saying,

00:03:03.462 --> 00:03:05.821
"Sure, fluid is going into
that region a little bit,

00:03:05.821 --> 00:03:07.701
"but it's much more
counterbalanced by how quickly

00:03:07.701 --> 00:03:08.921
it's going out."

00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:11.201
So these are the kind of
situations you might see

00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:13.041
for positive divergence.

00:03:13.041 --> 00:03:15.621
Now negative divergence,
negative divergence.

00:03:15.621 --> 00:03:18.263
Let's think about what examples
of that might look like.

00:03:18.263 --> 00:03:21.103
Divergence of V at a given point

00:03:21.103 --> 00:03:22.703
and you know, really it's
something that takes in

00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:24.064
all points of the plane
but we're just looking

00:03:24.064 --> 00:03:28.684
at specific points, so if
the divergence is negative,

00:03:28.684 --> 00:03:30.344
well the quintessential
example here is that

00:03:30.344 --> 00:03:32.604
nothing happens at your
point, but all of the vectors

00:03:32.604 --> 00:03:35.724
around it are kind of
flowing in towards it.

00:03:35.724 --> 00:03:36.985
And this is the thing where I animated,

00:03:36.985 --> 00:03:39.544
where we took this and we
flipped all of the vectors.

00:03:39.544 --> 00:03:41.624
And said, "Ah, there, if you
start playing the fluid flow,

00:03:41.624 --> 00:03:44.084
"then the density in any
region around the origin

00:03:44.084 --> 00:03:46.084
"you know, increases a lot,
all of the fluid particles

00:03:46.084 --> 00:03:49.364
"tend to converge towards that center."

00:03:49.364 --> 00:03:51.464
But again, this isn't the only
example that you might have.

00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:55.345
You could have a little bit of
activity at your point itself

00:03:55.345 --> 00:03:57.584
and maybe it is the case that
things do flow away from it

00:03:57.584 --> 00:03:59.065
a little bit as you're going away.

00:03:59.065 --> 00:04:00.904
And some of the fluid
particles are going away,

00:04:00.904 --> 00:04:03.025
and it's just the case
that the fluid particles

00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:05.104
flowing in towards it
from another direction

00:04:05.104 --> 00:04:07.024
heavily counterbalance that.

00:04:07.024 --> 00:04:08.824
Cuz then if you're looking
at any kind of region

00:04:08.824 --> 00:04:11.384
around your point, you say
fluid particles are coming in

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:13.764
quite rapidly, a lot
of particles per time,

00:04:13.764 --> 00:04:16.244
but they're not leaving too
rapidly round the other end.

00:04:16.244 --> 00:04:18.564
So kind of loosely,
intuitively, this is what a

00:04:18.564 --> 00:04:21.224
negative divergence case might look like.

00:04:21.224 --> 00:04:23.785
And finally, another case that
we wanna start thinking about

00:04:23.785 --> 00:04:26.305
as we're tightening our
grasp on this intuition

00:04:26.305 --> 00:04:28.604
is what happens, or
what does it look like,

00:04:28.604 --> 00:04:32.024
if the divergence of your
function at a specific point

00:04:32.024 --> 00:04:36.064
is zero, right, if it's
just absolutely zero?

00:04:36.064 --> 00:04:38.144
And one thing this could
look like is, you know,

00:04:38.144 --> 00:04:40.944
you have something going on
but nothing really changes

00:04:40.944 --> 00:04:44.344
and all of the fluid just kinda
flows in then it flows out

00:04:44.344 --> 00:04:46.761
and on the whole it balances.

00:04:47.604 --> 00:04:48.705
You know, if you take any kind of region

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:49.885
the amount flowing in is balanced

00:04:49.885 --> 00:04:51.785
with the amount flowing out.

00:04:51.785 --> 00:04:54.705
But it could also look like
you have fluid flowing in

00:04:54.705 --> 00:04:58.346
kind of from one dimension,
but it's cancelled out

00:04:58.346 --> 00:05:01.185
by flowing away from the point in a manner

00:05:01.185 --> 00:05:04.005
that sort of perfectly balances
it in another direction.

00:05:04.005 --> 00:05:05.625
So these are the loose pictures
that I want you to have

00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:08.066
in the back of your
mind as we start looking

00:05:08.066 --> 00:05:10.545
for the actual formula for divergence.

00:05:10.545 --> 00:05:12.185
And what I'll do in the next video or two,

00:05:12.185 --> 00:05:14.485
is start looking at
these functions P and Q

00:05:14.485 --> 00:05:16.785
and thinking about the
partial derivative properties

00:05:16.785 --> 00:05:19.285
that they have that will
correspond with, you know,

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:21.905
these positive divergence
images that you should have

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:23.805
in your head, or the
negative divergence images

00:05:23.805 --> 00:05:25.365
that you should have in your head.

00:05:25.365 --> 00:05:27.699
So with that, I'll see you next video.
