In the instructor notes,
you'll find the URL for this revel.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:09.080
The first step is, unsurprisingly,
on branch step one.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.760
So, make sure you checked
it out correctly.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.990
Now, let's go to Xcode.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.250
Let's first take a look
at the main storyboard.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.890
As you can see, it's very simple, and

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.670
it has one image view,
a slider, and three buttons.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.460
The slider changes the alpha channel or
transparency of the image view.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.920
So, it's basically there so
we can tell if the UI is blocked or not.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.960
If you can move it while it's downloaded
it means the UI is not blocked.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.730
Whenever you lick on
any of these buttons,

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.530
a large image will be downloaded.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.570
This is by far the easiest way to block.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.310
So for each button we'll
write a different action.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.550
The first button, over here, sync, will
use a naive serial code that blocks.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.740
The second button will use in
an asynchronous version using GCD.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.440
And the last button,

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.320
will use a more elegant version
that takes a completion closure.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.090
Let's get started.
