00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.105
Each of the projects in this course has three deliverables. The source code,

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:08.670
involving, solving a specific problem in several ways,

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.890
a project report containing project specific content, and a design study report.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.010
The design study represents an, the explicit knowledge about the design, that

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.250
you learned during the project. In summary, here are the expected sections to

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.940
be included in the design that are important. Section one includes the context.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.250
That is the background, motivation and vocabulary.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.340
Next section is the research questions. Then descriptions of the subjects,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.230
experimental conditions and the variables, both independent and dependent.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.560
Section six has the method. Then come the results, discussion and conclusions.
