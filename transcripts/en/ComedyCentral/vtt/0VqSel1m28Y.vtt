[indistinct radio chatter]

00:00:04.338 --> 00:00:06.548
- Sheriff's department!
- Sheriff's department!

00:00:06.548 --> 00:00:07.549
Frisbee!

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:09.259
(Garcia)
'Chandler, Ross, Joey'

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.303
'Oliver, Greg,

00:00:11.303 --> 00:00:13.513
'Get in the house!'

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.724
(Garcia)
'How are we doin' today?
How are we doin'?'

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:17.893
We got a call down there
at the department

00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:20.354

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:22.898

Reno airport's been receivin'

00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:26.318

some, uh, bullet rounds.

00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:28.028
(Frisbee)
'What airline was it?'

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.571
(Garcia)
Uh...

00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:32.908
Doesn't really matter, Frisbee,
honestly...

00:00:32.908 --> 00:00:35.160
I don't shoot at airlines.
Alien aircraft.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.578
(Garcia)
'You only shoot at
alien aircraft?'

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:39.623
What I think is alien aircraft,
ET stuff.

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:40.999
(Garcia)
Uh-huh, how would you
distinguish that

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:43.252
from regular aircraft?

00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:45.212
It's got aliens in it.

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:48.257
What if you start [beep]
spirits, uh, aircraft?

00:00:48.257 --> 00:00:50.968
What if they were just, you
know, doin', a little, uh

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:53.512
drive by and you start, uh,
takin' shots at 'em

00:00:53.512 --> 00:00:55.305
'and suddenly, holy [beep]'

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:58.183
we just took a first shot
at an alien spacecraft?

00:00:58.183 --> 00:00:59.810
That's a good question.
What's your name?

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:00.894
- 'Travis, Travis Jr.'
- Travis.

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.938
Travis, that's a good question.

00:01:02.938 --> 00:01:04.356
Thank you.

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:06.817
- I like your look.
- I like your, uh, lifestyle.

00:01:06.817 --> 00:01:08.318
(Frisbee)
'Thanks a lot.'

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:12.823
Got a nice house, got a good,
good wife, second cousin.

00:01:12.823 --> 00:01:14.491
- 'How you doin', ma'am?'
- Hi, I'm good, thanks.

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:17.411
If we were to look,
say, for example

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:19.329
'in that bunker
that you covered with tarp'

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:20.372
'right before we came over...'

00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:22.124
I ain't been in there
for so long

00:01:22.124 --> 00:01:23.333
I have not,
I haven't been over there--

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.294
You never make it
to this corner of the yard.

00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:28.130
- That's not even ours.
- This is not yours?

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.257
- Oh... Honey, is that ours?
- Shut up!

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:32.592
- I'm sorry.
- 'Oh.'

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:35.137
- Oh, ho ho ho ho!
- Oh, my lord!

00:01:35.137 --> 00:01:37.639
[police laughing]

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:40.517
(Garcia)
'Wow! Oh, Frisbee!'

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:42.394
(Frisbee)
'Yeah, I got this
at a yard sale.'

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:44.313
What? [beep].
I never find [beep].

00:01:44.313 --> 00:01:45.605
(Jones)
'You got a bargain too.'

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:47.107
You're just shootin'
at these cans right there?

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:48.275
'That and the oranges.'

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:50.485
- Alright, so just cock her up.
- 'Just hug up to it.'

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:52.404
Alright, put the hand
underneath. Here we go.

00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:53.697
- Whoo-hoo!
- Feed and bleed!

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:55.741
- Alright, here we go.
- Let it feed and bleed!

00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:57.159
[gunshots]

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.328
- 'Oh!'
- 'That's it!'

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.414
[explosion]

00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:12.049
That was pretty [beep] cool.

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:16.845
- Can I do it next?
- Sure, go ahead.
