General tessellation won't help. Adding vertices will just mean more triangles

00:00:04.491 --> 00:00:09.497
to join these up. The answer is 4 triangles in fact the rule is a polygon with n

00:00:09.497 --> 00:00:14.391
edges will need n minus 2 triangles to represent it. We don't care all that much

00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:18.370
in interactive rendering which triangulation is used. Here I've made a fan of

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.806
triangles, all radiating from 1 vertex but there are other ways to do it. The

00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:26.712
shape of the triangles is important in other fields such as stress analysis

00:00:26.712 --> 00:00:30.742
program that use meshes but isn't so important in interactive rendering. If

00:00:30.742 --> 00:00:35.164
you're a puzzle buff here's a bonus question for absolutely no credit and little

00:00:35.164 --> 00:00:39.133
use in computer graphics itself rather just for the sake of it. How many

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:44.070
different unique triangulations of this hexagon are there? Once you solve that,

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.213
is there a general rule for polygons? Feel free to discuss this on the forums.
