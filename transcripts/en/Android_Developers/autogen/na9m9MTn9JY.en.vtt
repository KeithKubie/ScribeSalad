regardless of the size but now it's a
bit more complicated because we'll have

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:40.700
bit more complicated because we'll have
 

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:47.470

the source code I think I also posted a
 

00:11:11.339 --> 00:11:15.140

you can split it on an end of a sentence

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:23.610
you can split it on an end of a sentence
 

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:25.790
you can split it on an end of a sentence
and running the paragraph so you're not

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800
and running the paragraph so you're not
 

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.410
and running the paragraph so you're not
doing text-to-speech and then you have a

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:27.420
doing text-to-speech and then you have a
 

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.810
doing text-to-speech and then you have a
random word at the end so you can do

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:29.820
random word at the end so you can do
 

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.910
random word at the end so you can do
more contextual sort of that makes sense

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920
more contextual sort of that makes sense
 

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.170

you know much more about the content
 

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.400
you know much more about the content
than we do so you can probably make a

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:34.410
than we do so you can probably make a
 

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.190
than we do so you can probably make a
more intelligent break I imagine that's

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200
more intelligent break I imagine that's
 

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.240

yeah this is a question we've seen this
 

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:34.130
yeah this is a question we've seen this
before so essentially a lot of people

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:34.140
before so essentially a lot of people

gonna be very good for you know

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:50.460
gonna be very good for you know
 

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.810
gonna be very good for you know
extremely large data tests and pay per

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:53.820

view pager is great and I'm not sure you

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:55.860
view pager is great and I'm not sure you

mean by the free pages thing I think

00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:57.630
mean by the free pages thing I think
 

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:59.150
mean by the free pages thing I think
you're talking about set partial page

00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160
you're talking about set partial page
 

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.190
you're talking about set partial page
width so that you can set page website

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:01.200
width so that you can set page website
 

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.960
width so that you can set page website
so you have more than one item on screen

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:02.970
so you have more than one item on screen
 

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.610
so you have more than one item on screen
but the problem with that is that it's

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:04.620
but the problem with that is that it's
 

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.720
but the problem with that is that it's
always left aligned so you're never

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:05.730
always left aligned so you're never
 

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.190
always left aligned so you're never
gonna get that centering type behavior

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:07.200

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.980
gonna get that centering type behavior
that you get with gallery so if that's

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:09.990

really what you want you can either use
 

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.450
really what you want you can either use

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.370
gallery or you could use view page and

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720
and so is there any strategy that you
 

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:27.909
and so is there any strategy that you
would recommend for such things

00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919
 

00:22:27.919 --> 00:22:30.200
not really me I'll be working on this

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:30.210
not really me I'll be working on this
 

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:31.850
not really me I'll be working on this
kind of stuff recently got a lot it's a

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:31.860
kind of stuff recently got a lot it's a
 

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:33.950
kind of stuff recently got a lot it's a
compatibility and the best way is to

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960
compatibility and the best way is to
 

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.110
compatibility and the best way is to
just drag the source into your source

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120
just drag the source into your source
 

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.539
just drag the source into your source
file in TESOL straight because you have

00:22:38.539 --> 00:22:38.549
file in TESOL straight because you have
 

00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:42.019
file in TESOL straight because you have
a control over it and there's no nice

00:22:42.019 --> 00:22:42.029
a control over it and there's no nice
 

00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:43.669
a control over it and there's no nice
way of doing it because the trouble that

00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679
way of doing it because the trouble that
 

00:22:43.679 --> 00:22:44.659
way of doing it because the trouble that
kind of stuff as well you have to drag

00:22:44.659 --> 00:22:44.669
kind of stuff as well you have to drag
 

00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:48.620
kind of stuff as well you have to drag
in all the styles yeah yeah and it

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:48.630
in all the styles yeah yeah and it
 

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:51.200
in all the styles yeah yeah and it
becomes a big problem but there's no

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:51.210
becomes a big problem but there's no
 

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.570
becomes a big problem but there's no
easy nice way of doing it unless you

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:53.580
easy nice way of doing it unless you
 

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.070
easy nice way of doing it unless you
still find a library that already has a

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.080
still find a library that already has a
 

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.570
still find a library that already has a
I assume someone's pretty late

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:56.580
I assume someone's pretty late
 

00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:00.500
I assume someone's pretty late
unnecessarily but yeah there's no easy

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:00.510
unnecessarily but yeah there's no easy
 

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:01.850
unnecessarily but yeah there's no easy
way here unless you find a library she's

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:01.860
way here unless you find a library she's
 

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.980
way here unless you find a library she's
already done the work okay yeah but

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:03.990
already done the work okay yeah but
 

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:06.500
already done the work okay yeah but
probably the work would be the same yes

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:06.510
probably the work would be the same yes
 

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:10.039
probably the work would be the same yes
so you use the the the new version of

00:23:10.039 --> 00:23:10.049
so you use the the the new version of
 

00:23:10.049 --> 00:23:11.419
so you use the the the new version of
the number picker and an older app and

00:23:11.419 --> 00:23:11.429
the number picker and an older app and
 

00:23:11.429 --> 00:23:13.419
the number picker and an older app and
if Ike was compatible way you're saying

00:23:13.419 --> 00:23:13.429
if Ike was compatible way you're saying
 

00:23:13.429 --> 00:23:17.360
if Ike was compatible way you're saying
yes if straight-4 if you run your

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:17.370
yes if straight-4 if you run your
 

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:19.310
yes if straight-4 if you run your
application in Eclipse everything is

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320
application in Eclipse everything is
 

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.649
application in Eclipse everything is
fine and you try to run it in the end

00:23:21.649 --> 00:23:21.659
fine and you try to run it in the end
 

00:23:21.659 --> 00:23:24.560
fine and you try to run it in the end
right to device it will crash because it

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:24.570
right to device it will crash because it
 

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:27.980
right to device it will crash because it
comes find a class and the class is

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:27.990
comes find a class and the class is
 

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:29.960
comes find a class and the class is
there with the signatures is different

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:29.970
there with the signatures is different
 

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.220
there with the signatures is different
so the first logo doesn't

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:32.230
so the first logo doesn't
 

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:34.290
so the first logo doesn't
I used the number pickers in the

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:34.300
I used the number pickers in the
 

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:37.860
I used the number pickers in the
ultimate stopwatch and I just API check

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:37.870
ultimate stopwatch and I just API check
 

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:39.180
ultimate stopwatch and I just API check
it and then use their thinking should

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:39.190
it and then use their thinking should
 

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.410
it and then use their thinking should
the right ones for two point three and

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:40.420
the right ones for two point three and
 

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.260
the right ones for two point three and
they're the new ones Ice Cream Sandwich

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:42.270
they're the new ones Ice Cream Sandwich
 

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.100
they're the new ones Ice Cream Sandwich
so if you look at the ultimate stopwatch

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:44.110
so if you look at the ultimate stopwatch
 

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:45.210
so if you look at the ultimate stopwatch
your source code

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:45.220
your source code
 

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.900
your source code
yeah will do

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:48.910
 

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:50.250
it's open source there and you can see

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:50.260
it's open source there and you can see
 

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:53.130
it's open source there and you can see
the way I did it I just used you have

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:53.140
the way I did it I just used you have
 

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.650
the way I did it I just used you have
the two separate chunks of code to make

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:55.660
the two separate chunks of code to make
 

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:56.780
the two separate chunks of code to make
the two different of the Pickers work

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:56.790
the two different of the Pickers work
 

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:59.670
the two different of the Pickers work
yeah that's more or less what I need and

00:23:59.670 --> 00:23:59.680
yeah that's more or less what I need and
 

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.540
yeah that's more or less what I need and
you didn't if check on it are you

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:03.550
you didn't if check on it are you
 

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:06.120
you didn't if check on it are you
finding that from Android to upwards you

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:06.130
finding that from Android to upwards you
 

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:07.500
finding that from Android to upwards you
can have code for newer versions as long

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:07.510
can have code for newer versions as long
 

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:09.690
can have code for newer versions as long
as you execute it in the older versions

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:09.700
as you execute it in the older versions
 

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.070
as you execute it in the older versions
you can have it just API can't it in

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:11.080
you can have it just API can't it in
 

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:11.370
you can have it just API can't it in
there

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:11.380
there
 

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.080
there
or you can have two different concrete

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:13.090
or you can have two different concrete
 

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:14.730
or you can have two different concrete
implementations and just instantiate the

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:14.740
implementations and just instantiate the
 

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.940
implementations and just instantiate the
right one depending on yeah yeah but at

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:17.950
right one depending on yeah yeah but at
 

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:20.400
right one depending on yeah yeah but at
a certain point you have told this that

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:20.410
a certain point you have told this that
 

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:25.110
a certain point you have told this that
if it's one game to use yeah but just

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120
if it's one game to use yeah but just
 

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:35.310
if it's one game to use yeah but just
target Ice Cream Sandwich okay all

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:35.320
target Ice Cream Sandwich okay all
 

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.850
target Ice Cream Sandwich okay all
righty right we've got too long we had

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:38.860
righty right we've got too long we had
 

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:43.190
righty right we've got too long we had
too much left

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200
 

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.720
which one stood here is one here so CN

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:45.730
which one stood here is one here so CN

that's pretty dang good stats do you say
 

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:58.950
that's pretty dang good stats do you say
well the application is now he doesn't

00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960
well the application is now he doesn't

uh yeah we get a lot of people asking
about top developer you haven't issued

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:03.310
about top developer you haven't issued

all that the player tutorial team
 

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:06.720
all that the player tutorial team
haven't issued any new top developer

haven't issued any new top developer
badges in them it must be every year now

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:08.650
badges in them it must be every year now
 

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:09.690
badges in them it must be every year now
cuz we were talking about it I Oh

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:09.700
cuz we were talking about it I Oh
 

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:14.190
cuz we were talking about it I Oh
last year the yeah the whole program is

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:14.200
last year the yeah the whole program is
 

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.120
last year the yeah the whole program is
kind of still on hold

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:15.130
kind of still on hold
 

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:16.770
kind of still on hold
yes they're trying to figure out what to

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:16.780
yes they're trying to figure out what to
 

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:18.480
yes they're trying to figure out what to
do with it I don't have too many details

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:18.490
do with it I don't have too many details
 

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:23.040
do with it I don't have too many details
on it but there haven't been any but

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:23.050
on it but there haven't been any but
 

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:24.330
on it but there haven't been any but
even before that they kind of guidelines

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:24.340
even before that they kind of guidelines
 

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:26.490
even before that they kind of guidelines
what you have like a string of very good

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:26.500
what you have like a string of very good
 

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.200
what you have like a string of very good
applications like normally multiple

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:28.210
applications like normally multiple
 

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:30.630
applications like normally multiple
unless you're you know a service which

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640
unless you're you know a service which
 

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.250
unless you're you know a service which
was only ever gonna have one application

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:32.260
was only ever gonna have one application
 

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.400
was only ever gonna have one application
right and so yeah normally one app one

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:35.410
right and so yeah normally one app one
 

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:37.500
right and so yeah normally one app one
gap isn't you know sufficient you know

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:37.510
gap isn't you know sufficient you know
 

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:38.880
gap isn't you know sufficient you know
we had to have a string of apps

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:38.890
we had to have a string of apps
 

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:40.620
we had to have a string of apps
yeah the program became a bit fragmented

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:40.630
yeah the program became a bit fragmented
 

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:41.610
yeah the program became a bit fragmented
they definitely used it for things like

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:41.620
they definitely used it for things like
 

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.140
they definitely used it for things like
banks as well even if the apples aren't

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:43.150
banks as well even if the apples aren't
 

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:44.310
banks as well even if the apples aren't
high quality they used it to put the

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320
high quality they used it to put the
 

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.200
high quality they used it to put the
tick next to

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:45.210
tick next to
 

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:46.399
tick next to
like a bank so you think it was the

00:25:46.399 --> 00:25:46.409
like a bank so you think it was the
 

00:25:46.409 --> 00:25:48.470
like a bank so you think it was the
trusted application and very light and

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480
trusted application and very light and
 

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.210
trusted application and very light and
verified so we should have split it into

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:50.220
verified so we should have split it into
 

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.250
verified so we should have split it into
two programs a verified trusted

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:52.260
two programs a verified trusted
 

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.510
two programs a verified trusted
developer didn't yes it's just kind of
