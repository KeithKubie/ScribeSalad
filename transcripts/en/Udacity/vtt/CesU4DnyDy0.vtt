00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.710
Today we're going to talk
about customer segments.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.470
Who are you building your
value proposition for?

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.830
What jobs do they want to get done?

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.590
What pains do they want to solve and
what gains that they want to see?

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.760
And at the end of this, what you want to
find is what's the archetype work or

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.602
persona of who you're
building the product for.

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:21.972
Now the last time we talked
about value propositions, but

00:00:21.972 --> 00:00:25.340
today we're going to focus
on customer segments.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.130
One of the interesting
things about customers

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.270
is that customers don't exist to buy.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.410
You actually exist for them.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.079
And especially if you're a technology
startup, that's really hard because you

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.087
always think it's about your product and
it's hard to remember that it's actually

00:00:41.087 --> 00:00:43.586
about the people on the other
side who are going to buy.

00:00:43.586 --> 00:00:47.227
And so one of the things you really
need to understand is who are they and

00:00:47.227 --> 00:00:48.906
why are they going to buy from you?

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:52.987
And one of the goals of
customer segments is trying to

00:00:52.987 --> 00:00:56.328
understand the archetype or
the persona or

00:00:56.328 --> 00:01:01.870
maybe just the details of who these
people are in specific detail.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.440
You want to know where they live,
what do they do, what's their age,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.460
are they in urban areas or
are they married, etc.?

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.910
And why do you want to know that?

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.950
Because it will help you figure out
how to not try to boil the ocean by

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.750
trying to get everybody in
the world to buy your product.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.400
But figuring out who
specifically is interested and

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.810
why makes it incredibly easy to sell.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.220
And have them want your product when
you understand who they are and

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.690
what their motivations are.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.830
So that's why we spend all this
time talking about customers and

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.300
customer segments.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.187
One of the things you'll also see
later in this lecture is that you

00:01:37.187 --> 00:01:39.865
might actually have multiple
customer segments, that is,

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:42.664
different types of customers
all interested in your product.

00:01:42.664 --> 00:01:46.420
They might be male 18 through
24 who live in urban areas.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.718
But you might also have women
who live in the countryside,

00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:52.353
45 to 55 in some cases, also interested.

00:01:52.353 --> 00:01:55.555
And the types of marketing or
demand creation you'll do to attract

00:01:55.555 --> 00:01:58.986
each segment will be different, but
if you didn't know who they were,

00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:01.330
you'd be creating the same
type of marketing and

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.790
in fact probably not
reaching any of them.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.400
So let's take a look at
this in more detail.
