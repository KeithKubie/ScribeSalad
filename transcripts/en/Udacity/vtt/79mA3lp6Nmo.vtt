00:00:05.363 --> 00:00:08.330
&gt;&gt; let's start with index.html.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.760
Don't worry HTML is pretty simple.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.868
It describes the content and layout of elements on a web page.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.250
We'll be comparing what we see here to the website.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.980
In this top section, we see the page's head tag defined.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.730
We'll often find CSS in JavaScript links, like these here.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.490
Inside the body of the text, we can see that we've got content that says,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.130
Hello world.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.820
And when we flip over to Chrome, there it is.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.212
If you want to learn more about HTML,

00:00:41.212 --> 00:00:43.694
check out the link in the instructor's notes.

00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:49.598
Looking through the HTML for our resume, there are a few elements worth noting.

00:00:49.598 --> 00:00:53.280
Like this one, div id equals main.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.810
I can see that it says, Hello world here, but showed up on the website.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.340
Div represents different elements on the page,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.860
you can think of them as starting like empty all purpose boxes.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.890
In this case, we've given this div a unique id of main,

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.810
which our JavaScript will be referencing later.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.840
Do you see anything else, James?

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.840
&gt;&gt; It doesn't look like a resume at all right now,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.220
but I do see some structure for one.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.530
It looks like there are sections for education, work and projects.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.970
What do you think about filling these in with our resume data?

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.920
You know, web developers have options for building great web pages.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.720
And I think there are two obvious strategies.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.260
They can either hard code the information by writing HTML that

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.690
explicitly defines the content users should see.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.530
Or they can use an HTML template and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.340
fill it in with data programmatically when a user requests a page.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.886
In this case, we can see the two work experience sections.

00:01:48.886 --> 00:01:52.426
In the hard coded version, we can see all of Phillip J.

00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:54.765
Fry's data listed here.

00:01:54.765 --> 00:01:57.549
While on the template side, we see the work experience section.

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:58.940
But right now, it's empty.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.900
&gt;&gt; The hard coded route is good to start, but it isn't a solution for

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.040
the long term.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.120
Anytime we want to make a change to the page,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.120
we have to open up the HTML, make the changes by hand, which can be a big pain.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.960
For the resume project, we'll be using the template strategy.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.440
What do you think?

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that works for me.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.168
Besides, if we weren't then this class would be about HTML.

00:02:21.168 --> 00:02:23.890
Which it isn't.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there are other great introductions to HTML online.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.060
See the instructor's notes for a few links.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.098
At the top of the HTML, there's a link to jQuery.js, the jQuery library.

00:02:35.098 --> 00:02:38.320
There's also helper.js,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.690
which contains some simple helper JavaScript we've prepared for your project.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.300
We'll be coming back to it in a few minutes.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.790
&gt;&gt; We've got two more script tags at the bottom of the HTML.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.150
This tag for resumeBuilder.js, tells the browser to download and

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.030
execute some JavaScript.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.760
We'll be using this script to add HTML content to the main section of the HTML.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.430
&gt;&gt; The browser will render this page just saying, Hello world.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.980
To give you a better overview of what's going on here,

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.340
we've zoomed out the page so you can see everything all at once.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.700
We have Hello world here, some empty resume sections and then some JavaScript.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.690
And over on this side,

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.770
we can see a general representation of how it would look in a browser.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.823
We're printing the Hello world and

00:03:23.823 --> 00:03:27.528
then after the Hello world, we have all of the resume sections.

00:03:27.528 --> 00:03:31.713
And when we hit the JavaScript section that includes resume builder down here,

00:03:31.713 --> 00:03:34.000
the browser will run the script.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.350
Which will change the HTML in these experience sections and

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.590
the page will now show our resume.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.780
&gt;&gt; But wait.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.260
You may ask yourself, what about all of these experience sections.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.570
It looks like they're in the resume, but

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.500
they aren't showing up on the page right now.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.130
That's because of these scripts at the bottom of our resume.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.070
Using JavaScript, we're checking to see if any of

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.250
these sections contain any content.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.130
And if not, we hide them.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.600
We'll get a chance to break down these JavaScript sections later
