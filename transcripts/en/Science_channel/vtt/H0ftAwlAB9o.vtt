YOU'VE SEEN IT ON BOBA FETT.
YOU'VE SEEN IT ON THE ROCKETEER.

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.377 line:0%
IT'S THE JETPACK --

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:14.246 line:0%
THE HOLY GRAIL
OF FUTURISTIC TRANSPORTATION.

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:17.217 line:0%
THE IDEA OF JUST BEING ABLE
TO STRAP ON A PACK

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:19.218 line:0%
AND FLY ANYWHERE
YOU WANT TO GO --

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:21.053 line:0%
HOW ABOUT THAT
FOR BEATING TRAFFIC?

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:24.390 line:0%
Narrator: TODAY, YOU WILL
BE BUILDING A JB-9 JETPACK,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.927 line:0%
THE ONLY TRUE JETPACK
IN OPERATION IN THE WORLD.

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:29.362 line:0%
I THOUGHT THIS WAS NOT A THING

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.231 line:0%
THAT HAD BEEN
PROPERLY INVENTED YET.

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.498
THIS EXISTS?

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:35.001
Narrator: YOU WILL NEED
TWO JET TURBINE ENGINES,

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.569
THROTTLE AND STEERING
HAND CONTROLS,

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:39.038
A KEROSENE FUEL TANK,

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:41.107
A CARBON-FIBER MOLDED HARNESS,

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:42.909
AND A HATRED
OF SITTING IN TRAFFIC.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:44.076
LET'S GET STARTED.

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:47.447
STEP ONE -- NECESSITY IS
THE MOTHER OF INVENTION.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:48.948
SO FIRST, BECOME FED UP

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:51.684
WITH EXISTING
PERSONAL-FLIGHT TECHNOLOGY.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:56.089
IN THE PAST, JETPACKS WERE
MORE LIKE ROCKETPACKS,

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.291
AND THEY USED A LOT OF VERY
HEAVY AND VERY EXPENSIVE FUEL,

00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:00.960
AND THEY COULD RUN OUT
OF THIS FUEL

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.495
IN AS SHORT AS 30 SECONDS,

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.830
AND IT WASN'T REALLY
GOOD FOR ANYTHING

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.033
BESIDES MAYBE
A DEMONSTRATION AT THE OLYMPICS

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:08.968
OR AN APPEARANCE
IN A JAMES BOND FILM.

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:12.004
Narrator:
IF YOU WANT TO FLY LIKE THIS
FOR MORE THAN 30 SECONDS,

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:14.707
YOU NEED TO FIND A WAY
TO GENERATE DOWNWARD THRUST

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:16.542
FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME.

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:20.412
STEP TWO -- DEVELOP THE
PERFECT-SIZED TURBINE ENGINE.

00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:22.148
YOU'VE GOT A LOT
OF DIFFERENT-SIZED ENGINES.

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:25.484
THERE'S HUGE JET ENGINES
TO POWER BIG 747s,

00:01:25.484 --> 00:01:27.921
AND SMALL ONES
FOR LITTLE HOBBY APPLICATIONS.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.956
WHAT WE NEED FOR A JETPACK
IS ONE JUST EXACTLY RIGHT-SIZED

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:32.491
TO CARRY THE WEIGHT OF A HUMAN.

00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:34.360
STEP THREE -- DESIGN A WAY

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.962
TO KEEP YOURSELF SAFELY ATTACHED
TO YOUR JETPACK.

00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:40.466
CONSTRUCT A HARNESS FROM
STATE-OF-THE-ART CARBON FIBER,

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:43.236
ATTACHING NYLON STRAPS,
ALUMINUM BUCKLES,

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.505
AND A LAYER OF FOAM FOR COMFORT.

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:49.208
STEP FOUR -- IT'S TIME TO ATTACH
ALL YOUR COMPONENTS TOGETHER.

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:52.345
CONSTRUCT TWO HANDLES
WITH ARMS, "A,"

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:54.080
OUT OF LIGHTWEIGHT ALUMINUM,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.249
AND CONNECT
TO BOTH ENGINES, "B,"

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:58.918
VIA TWO-INCH ALUMINUM TUBES.

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:01.087
CONNECT YOUR ENGINE AND ARMS
TO YOUR HARNESS

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:03.857
WITH A ROD END PLACED JUST
BEHIND THE NECK OF THE HARNESS.

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:07.093 line:0%
A ROD END IS A JOINT THAT CAN
ARTICULATE IN ANY DIRECTION.

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:08.494 line:0%
IT'S SORT OF LIKE YOUR SHOULDER.

00:02:08.494 --> 00:02:11.230 line:0%
YOU HAVE A BALL AND YOU HAVE
A SOCKET THAT GOES ON TOP OF IT,

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.466 line:0%
AND THE SOCKET CAN MOVE
IN ANY DIRECTION YOU NEED.

00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:15.835 line:0%
Narrator: STEP FIVE --

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:18.938 line:0%
NOW ALL YOU NEED IS THE ABILITY
TO CONTROL YOUR PACK.

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:21.307 line:0%
ADD A THROTTLE CONTROL
ON THE RIGHT-HAND GRIP

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.276 line:0%
TO FEED MORE FUEL
TO YOUR ENGINES...

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:24.810 line:0%
THE THROTTLE HANDLE IS USED

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.313 line:0%
TO CONTROL THE THRUST
COMING OUT OF THE JETS.

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:29.015
YOU GO FASTER OR HIGHER

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:32.184
WHEN YOU TURN THE HANDLE,
OR THROTTLE, FORWARD.

00:02:32.184 --> 00:02:33.486
BUT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS,

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.454
YOU TURN IT BACK,
IT'LL SLOW YOU DOWN.

00:02:35.454 --> 00:02:37.690
Narrator: STEP SIX --
ADD A FUEL TANK,

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.024
AND YOU'LL BE READY TO SOAR.

00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:40.960
Bodden: I DON'T KNOW IF
IT'S GONNA BE A GREAT FUTURE

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.261
WHEN WE ALL HAVE JETPACKS.

00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:44.764
I MEAN, HOW MUCH IS
JETPACK INSURANCE GONNA COST?
