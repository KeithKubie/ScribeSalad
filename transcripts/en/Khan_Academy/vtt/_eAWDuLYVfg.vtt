00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.670
Transformation C maps negative
2, 3 to 4, negative 1.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.875
So let me do negative
2 comma 3, and it

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:11.555
maps that to 4, negative 1.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:28.390
And point negative 5 comma 5,
it maps that to 7, negative 3.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.900
And so let's think
about this a little bit.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.830
How could we get from
this point to this point,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.940
and that point to that point?

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.830
Now it's tempting to view this
that maybe a translation is

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:46.770
possible.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.590
Because if you imagined a
line like that, you could say,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.820
hey, let's just shift this
whole thing down and then

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.620
to the right.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.980
These two things happen
to have the same slope.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.820
They both have a
slope of negative 2/3,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.680
and so this point would
map to this point,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.390
and that point would
map to that point.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.860
But that's not what we want.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.090
We don't want negative 2,
3 to map to 7, negative 3.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.330
We want negative 2, 3
to map to 4, negative 1.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.290
So you could get this
line over this line,

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.330
but we won't map the
points that we want to map.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.600
So this can't be, at least
I can't think of a way,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.170
that this could actually
be a translation.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.800
Now let's think about
whether our transformation

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.730
could be a reflection.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.610
Well, if we imagine a
line that has-- let's see,

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.390
these both have a
slope of negative 3.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.770
These both have a
slope of negative 2/3.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.300
So if you imagined a line that
had a slope of positive 3/2

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.115
that was equidistant from both--
and I don't know if this is.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.500
Let's see, is this equidistant?

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.510
Is this equidistant
from both of them?

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.980
It's either going to be that
line or this line right over--

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.690
or that line, actually
that line looks better.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.720
So that one.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.720
And once again, I'm
just eyeballing it.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.660
So a line that has
slope of positive 3/2.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.685
So this one looks right
in between the two.

00:02:17.685 --> 00:02:19.560
Or actually it could be
someplace in between.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.101
But either way, we just have to
think about it qualitatively.

00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:24.450
If you had a line that
looked something like that,

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.520
and if you were to
reflect over this line,

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.430
then this point would
map to this point,

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.740
which is what we want.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.120
And this purple point,
negative 5 comma 5,

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.440
would map to that point.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.970
It would be reflected over.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.740
So it's pretty clear that
this could be a reflection.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.574
Now rotation actually
makes even more sense,

00:02:45.574 --> 00:02:47.656
or at least in my brain
makes a little more sense.

00:02:47.656 --> 00:02:50.190
If you were to rotate around
to this point right over here,

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.260
this point would
map to that point,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.810
and that point would
map to that point.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.820
So a rotation also
seems like a possibility

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.210
for transformation C.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.710
Now let's think
about transformation

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:14.910
D. We are going from 4,
negative 1 to 7, negative 3.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.150
Actually maybe I'll put
that in magenta, as well.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.800
To 7, negative 3,
just like that.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:35.845
And we want to go from
negative 5, 5 to negative 2, 3.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.270
So I could definitely imagine
a translation right over here.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.870
This point went 3 to
the right and 2 down.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.050
This point went 3 to
the right and 2 down.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.720
So a translation
definitely makes sense.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.990
Now let's think
about a reflection.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.380
So it would be
tempting to-- let's

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.170
see, if I were to get from
this point to this point,

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.651
I could reflect around that, but
that won't help this one over

00:04:07.651 --> 00:04:08.150
here.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.858
And to get from that
point to that point,

00:04:09.858 --> 00:04:12.420
I could reflect around
that, but once again, that's

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.086
not going to help
that point over there.

00:04:14.086 --> 00:04:16.990
So a reflection really
doesn't seem to do the trick.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.082
And what about a rotation?

00:04:19.082 --> 00:04:20.790
Well to go from this
point to this point,

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.190
we could rotate
around this point.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.351
We could go there, but that
won't help this point right

00:04:27.351 --> 00:04:27.850
over here.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.770
While this is rotating
there, this point

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.540
is going to rotate
around like that

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.800
and it's going to end
up someplace out here.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.360
So that's not going to help.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.630
So it looks like this one
can only be a translation.
