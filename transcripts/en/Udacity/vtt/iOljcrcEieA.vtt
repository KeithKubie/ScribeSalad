00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.150
Alright, so first thing I need to do, I'm

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.870
guessing, is delete this relationship between band and stage.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.300
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.590
&gt;&gt; And if I right-click here. Okay. Delete field. That's was pleasantly

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.412
expected. yes. I want to delete the relationship. Gone. Band is on its own

00:00:17.412 --> 00:00:21.850
now. That's sad. But band you'll be friends again soon. So then I'm

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.550
going to create a new object so that I can, you know, make this whole

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.010
thing happen.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.270
&gt;&gt; Right. A new object to be able to

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.090
track not only the relationships but maybe other details

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.430
about, you know, what time they're playing and what

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.010
the status of it is, or something like that.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.880
&gt;&gt; Okay. So set time. Now, this is different because before we've been

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.440
naming everything like the band names

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.420
have actual names, attendees have real names.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.775
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:44.775 --> 00:00:47.570
&gt;&gt; But this set time, we're not going to want to have to name every time.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah that feels silly.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.570
&gt;&gt; And so that's when you can change the data type of the

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.820
name from text to an auto number. And

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.400
the auto number is just an automatically generated number.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.790
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.486
&gt;&gt; Following this sort of.

00:00:57.486 --> 00:00:58.486
&gt;&gt;

00:00:57.486 --> 00:00:57.590
[CROSSTALK]

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.830
Just increments up by 1.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:59.780
&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.220
&gt;&gt; So, display format. So can I just like, ST?

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.800
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.325
&gt;&gt; Will let me get, okay,

00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:04.358
[UNKNOWN].

00:01:04.358 --> 00:01:04.900
&gt;&gt; That works.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.980
&gt;&gt; And then are those curly braces?

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:07.660
&gt;&gt; Curly brace.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.070
&gt;&gt; So this means it's going to start.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.180
&gt;&gt; At zero. Er, well, give it a starting number of one.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.390
&gt;&gt; Okay. Like that?

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.070
&gt;&gt; Nope, just one.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.940
&gt;&gt; Okay. Yep. And then it'll increment, every time you create a record it'll.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.940
&gt;&gt;

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.101
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:22.266
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:26.560
&gt;&gt; And then Save. Okay. Now, I can add my relationship fields.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.200
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.480
&gt;&gt; Let me think about this. Set Time is the child of both band and stage.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.090
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.590
&gt;&gt; So I need to have Put the fields on set time.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.380
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.294
&gt;&gt; Okay. And you can't really have a stage

00:01:39.294 --> 00:01:41.890
without set time, so should that be master detail?

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.330
&gt;&gt; Both should be master detail, definitely both should be required.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.110
&gt;&gt; Okay,

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.700
so we filled that out, and Save. And now

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.160
the next one for bands. Hey, that's pretty cool.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.790
&gt;&gt; Our relationship here looks like our relationship there.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.160
&gt;&gt; Yep. You've built your first junction object.
