00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.779
In 1912 a German meteorologist named Alfred
Wegener proposed a theory about how the Earth's

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:06.830
land masses formed.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.740
He suggested that the great continents of
the Earth had once formed a single landmass

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.190
called Pangea,

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.219
which had broken up and drifted apart over
time.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.730
He called this process continental drift

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.310
and it went against all conventional thinking
of the time,

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.640
making him very unpopular amongst his peers.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.620
It's a shame because he was absolutely right.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:33.320
But it would take the work of a young cartographer
called Marie Tharp to help turn the tide of

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.360
opposition,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.500
leading to one of the greatest paradigm shifts
in the earth sciences.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.420
and it all began at the bottom of the ocean.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.220
Marie's father worked for the Department
of Agriculture and from a young age, she would

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.220
join him on his work trips

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.500
as he travelled around the country collecting
samples for soil survey maps.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.219
These early experiences were formative in
developing Marie's interest in geology

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.250
and after gaining a Master's degree in the
subject she landed a position at Columbia

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.469
University in 1947.

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.860
Here she worked as an assistant to Bruce Heezen,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.500
a geology graduate who was collecting thousands
of depth measurements across the Atlantic

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.020
ocean.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.820
During expeditions Heezen and his team used
echo sounding to collect depth data,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.590
which involved sending out high frequency
sounds or 'pings'

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.920
and recording the time delay of the returning
echo.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.130
This data could then be plotted to build a
profile of the terrain below.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.740
Unfortunately for Tharp, women were prohibited
from joining these early expeditions because

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.760
of a fear that they'd bring bad luck at
sea.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.510
Instead, she remained behind at the University
to process the data,

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:48.490
converting endless rows of depth measurements
into detailed profiles of the ocean floor.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.360
Conventional thinking had once believed that
the ocean floors were flat, featureless plains,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.680
but Tharp's maps were beginning to tell
an entirely different story.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.840
Her profiles revealed the existence of a complex
geography of crevices and valleys,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.540
but perhaps most startling was the emergence
of a long, V-shaped cleft that ran through

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.670
each of her profiles.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.760
These so-called rift-valleys offered support
for Wegener's continental drift theory:

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.770
If two land masses were moving apart, they'd
split the ocean floor in two,

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.900
tearing a scar in the landscape and forming
a valley below.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.319
Was this evidence for the controversial theory?

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:36.759
Tharp believed so, but Heezen was skeptical,
dismissing many of her suggestions as 'girl talk'.

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.970
Nevertheless, Tharp was convinced by her findings
and later produced a more detailed physiographic

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.940
map to further support her case.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.769
At the same time, another graduate student,
Howard Foster, was plotting the epicentres

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.050
of earthquakes in the same region of the Atlantic.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.360
Tharp noticed that they occurred at the same
location as her proposed valley

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.930
and as they expanded to other areas, they
found something interesting:

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.730
where there were mid-oceanic ridges, there
were also earthquakes,

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.470
so it seemed as though these two were related.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.310
At this point, even the skeptical Heezen could
no longer deny what they were looking at:

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.040
- a pattern of scars that spanned the Earth's
oceans,

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.450
permanent wounds torn into existence through
the process of continental drift.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.740
The findings were finally reported in 1957,
but opposition from the scientific community

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.680
was still fierce.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.090
Renowned explorer Jacques Cousteau was so
sure they were wrong,

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.680
he charted an expedition to film the ocean
floor to settle the score once and for all.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.190
But the footage he brought back did the opposite.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.940
It showed the deep valley, it showed how it
split the mid-atlantic ridge in half

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.739
and it showed that Tharp's maps were right
all along.

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.989
It was exactly where she had plotted it.

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.170
As the evidence mounted, a paradigm shift
in the Earth sciences was inevitable.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.750
Tharp's steadfast determination had paved
the way for Wegener's continental drift

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.750
theory to gain traction.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.550
As as the tide of opposition waned, it gave
birth to our modern understanding of plate

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.550
tectonics

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.549
and secured Tharp's position as one of the
most outstanding cartographers of the 20th

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:19.049
century.
