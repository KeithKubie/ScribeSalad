00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.789
- [Voiceover] "A circle has a
circumference of 10 pi feet.

00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:06.482
"An arc, X, in this circle has

00:00:06.482 --> 00:00:10.001
"a central angle of 260 degrees.

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:12.159
"What is the length of X?"

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:14.179
So let's just visualize
what's going on here.

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.210
So we have a circle, I can't
draw a circle that well,

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.683
but you get the point.

00:00:18.683 --> 00:00:21.806
So that's our circle, this
is the center of our circle.

00:00:21.806 --> 00:00:23.919
It has a circumference of 10 pi feet,

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.786
so if we were to go all
the way around the circle

00:00:26.786 --> 00:00:31.442
this, it has a circumference of 10 pi,

00:00:31.442 --> 00:00:32.962
10 pi feet.

00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:35.168
Now you have an arc, X.

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:37.630
You have an arc X in this
circle that has a central angle

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.243
of 260 degrees.

00:00:39.243 --> 00:00:43.028
So let's think about, so 260 degrees,

00:00:43.028 --> 00:00:45.187
so if you go straight up that's,

00:00:45.187 --> 00:00:46.626
that would, let's see if you go this far

00:00:46.626 --> 00:00:49.853
it would be 90 degrees, 180 degrees,

00:00:49.853 --> 00:00:52.732
if you were to go all the
way here you get to 270,

00:00:52.732 --> 00:00:54.229
so it's gonna be right around,

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:56.922
and we're just gonna
approximate, right around there.

00:00:56.922 --> 00:01:00.385
So that would be a central angle of 260,

00:01:00.385 --> 00:01:02.312
260 degrees.

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:04.831
And this is the arc,

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:07.212
this is arc, let me do
this in a different color.

00:01:07.212 --> 00:01:09.474
Let me do it in purple.

00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:12.935
So this is arc X, right over here,

00:01:12.935 --> 00:01:15.859
and we wanna figure out its length.

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:17.380
Well, think about it this way,

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.120
its central angle is 260 degrees,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.919
what's the central angle
of the circumference?

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:24.694
Well the circumference is
going all the way around.

00:01:24.694 --> 00:01:28.072
So if you're going all the way around

00:01:28.072 --> 00:01:31.032
that is 360 degrees.

00:01:31.032 --> 00:01:32.740
360 degrees.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.735
So the fraction that this, that arc X is,

00:01:35.735 --> 00:01:39.878
the length of X is of
the entire circumference,

00:01:39.878 --> 00:01:41.248
that's gonna be the same fraction

00:01:41.248 --> 00:01:45.811
that its central angle is of 360 degrees.

00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:47.716
So once again, the entire circumference

00:01:47.716 --> 00:01:50.815
is 10 pi feet, 10 pi feet,

00:01:50.815 --> 00:01:52.138
that's the circumference.

00:01:52.138 --> 00:01:53.554
Now the fraction of that circumference,

00:01:53.554 --> 00:01:55.319
that's going to be arc X,

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.430
that's gonna be the fraction that 200,

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.579
that's gonna be the same
fraction of the central angle

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.029
of that arc relative to the central angle

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:05.468
if you were to go all the way around,

00:02:05.468 --> 00:02:07.883
which would be 360 degrees.

00:02:07.883 --> 00:02:11.426
So it'll be 260/360

00:02:11.426 --> 00:02:13.505
of the circumference.

00:02:13.505 --> 00:02:15.106
So what's that going to be?

00:02:15.106 --> 00:02:18.067
Well let's see, we can
simplify this a little bit.

00:02:18.067 --> 00:02:19.448
We could, if we divide the numerator

00:02:19.448 --> 00:02:20.506
and the denominator by 10,

00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:22.548
10 divided by 10 is one.

00:02:22.548 --> 00:02:24.375
And let me make it,

00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:26.152
actually let me just write it this way.

00:02:26.152 --> 00:02:29.889
So we could write this as 260 times 10 pi

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:33.871
is going to be 2600 pi

00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:36.102
over 360,

00:02:36.912 --> 00:02:38.376
over 360.

00:02:38.376 --> 00:02:39.541
And now we just need to simplify.

00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:41.526
If we divide the numerator
and the denominator by 10

00:02:41.526 --> 00:02:45.137
this is going to be 260,
this is going to be 36.

00:02:45.137 --> 00:02:48.979
If we divide the numerator
and the denominator by,

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:52.938
let's see, it seems like they
are both divisible by four.

00:02:52.938 --> 00:02:55.724
260 divided by four is
going to be, let's see,

00:02:55.724 --> 00:02:59.301
200 divided by four is 50,

00:02:59.301 --> 00:03:02.202
60 divided by four is 15,

00:03:02.202 --> 00:03:04.861
15 plus (mumbling) is gonna be 65.

00:03:04.861 --> 00:03:06.579
So let me do this in a different color.

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.564
This is gonna be 65.

00:03:08.564 --> 00:03:11.617
And then 36 divided by four is nine.

00:03:11.617 --> 00:03:12.755
And just so you see I didn't,

00:03:12.755 --> 00:03:13.834
I was trying to do it in my head

00:03:13.834 --> 00:03:15.645
and it's good to get
some practice doing that,

00:03:15.645 --> 00:03:17.178
but all I did is divided
both the numerator

00:03:17.178 --> 00:03:19.081
and the denominator by four.

00:03:19.081 --> 00:03:23.435
Four goes into 260, four
goes into 26 six times,

00:03:23.435 --> 00:03:27.684
six times four is 24,
subtract, you get a two,

00:03:27.684 --> 00:03:30.261
bring down that zero, four
goes into 20 five times,

00:03:30.261 --> 00:03:32.978
five times four is 20.

00:03:32.978 --> 00:03:33.999
So that's all I did there.

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:36.356
So it's 65 pi over nine,

00:03:36.356 --> 00:03:37.343
and it looks like that's about

00:03:37.343 --> 00:03:38.921
as simplified as I'm gonna get,

00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:41.499
and that's nice, because
that's one of the choices

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:43.433
right over here.
