00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.196
Hereâ€™s another real world data set, this is the

00:00:03.196 --> 00:00:05.259
Space Shuttle Challenger and some of you

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.499
might remember on January 28, 1986, it

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:11.570
exploded and was destroyed and seven

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.820
astronauts on board passed away. So,

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.873
this example of would be one where the

00:00:15.873 --> 00:00:17.632
question is whether a good set

00:00:17.632 --> 00:00:21.260
decision, could have predicted this disaster

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.516
and saved the lives of the astronauts on board.

00:00:24.516 --> 00:00:27.244
On the day of this tragic launch, the

00:00:27.244 --> 00:00:30.999
temperature was unusually low, at 36

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.166
degrees Fahrenheit. So, the NASA

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.966
engineers asked themselves, do we

00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:37.531
have data from past flights to see if this

00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:40.618
temperature could cause problems.

00:00:40.618 --> 00:00:43.160
They graphed the temperature Xi versus

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.196
the number of O-rings that had failed

00:00:46.196 --> 00:00:47.955
in the past, because those were

00:00:47.955 --> 00:00:50.697
known to be affected by temperature.

00:00:50.697 --> 00:00:53.322
In seven flights there were failures; in

00:00:53.322 --> 00:00:55.787
fact, sometimes they failed twice and

00:00:55.787 --> 00:00:57.097
sometimes only one of them failed.

00:00:57.097 --> 00:00:59.845
And the temperatures were all over

00:00:59.845 --> 00:01:06.604
the map, 70, 57, 63, 70, 53, 75 and 58.

00:01:06.604 --> 00:01:08.287
Now, these were all the cases where

00:01:08.287 --> 00:01:09.738
a problem occurred and the question

00:01:09.738 --> 00:01:11.222
was, would the lower temperature

00:01:11.222 --> 00:01:13.405
increase the chances of a problem

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:16.559
occurring? Now, as a good statistician,

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:18.453
what do we do? Linear regression?

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:20.212
Do we compute confidence intervals?

00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:21.676
Or do we find a maximum likelihood

00:01:21.676 --> 00:01:23.557
estimator. Check exactly one

00:01:23.557 --> 00:01:27.000
box of the most appropriate term.
