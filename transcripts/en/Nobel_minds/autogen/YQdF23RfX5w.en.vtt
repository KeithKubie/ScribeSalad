about the behavior of powerful firms and

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359
about the behavior of powerful firms and
 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:33.069
about the behavior of powerful firms and
how they should best be regulated

as a good way to provide high quality at
 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.869
as a good way to provide high quality at
a low price for the consumer but there

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879
a low price for the consumer but there
 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.470
a low price for the consumer but there
are markets where for various reason

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480

monopolies where it may be difficult to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680
monopolies where it may be difficult to
 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.870

have any real competition at all that
 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.060

tracks and it may be difficult to

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130
tracks and it may be difficult to
 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.249

duplicate those tracks so it may be very

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
duplicate those tracks so it may be very
 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.219
duplicate those tracks so it may be very
quite wasteful to build multiple

parallel tracks for railroads so the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270
parallel tracks for railroads so the
 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.080
