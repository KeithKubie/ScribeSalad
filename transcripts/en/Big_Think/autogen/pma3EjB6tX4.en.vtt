bye

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980
 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.320
back in the Middle Ages they're probably

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330
back in the Middle Ages they're probably
 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.000
back in the Middle Ages they're probably
infectious diseases that we'd hit a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.010
infectious diseases that we'd hit a
 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.980
infectious diseases that we'd hit a
village would wipe everybody out and

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990
village would wipe everybody out and
 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.049
village would wipe everybody out and
then there were no humans near enough

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059
then there were no humans near enough
 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.269
then there were no humans near enough
for the virus to jump to so over just

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279
for the virus to jump to so over just
 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.060
for the virus to jump to so over just
died out now in this day and age where

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070
died out now in this day and age where
 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.070
died out now in this day and age where
the earth is much more populated than it

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080
the earth is much more populated than it
 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.410
the earth is much more populated than it
was in the Middle Ages where we have jet

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420
was in the Middle Ages where we have jet
 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.599
was in the Middle Ages where we have jet
travel where we've moved into areas like

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:27.609
travel where we've moved into areas like
 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.120
travel where we've moved into areas like
the rainforest where there's a lot of

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130
the rainforest where there's a lot of
 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.390
the rainforest where there's a lot of
species of microbes and things that

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400
species of microbes and things that
 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.799
species of microbes and things that
we've come in contact with that we

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809
we've come in contact with that we
 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.680
we've come in contact with that we
didn't in the Middle Ages there's much

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690
didn't in the Middle Ages there's much
 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.350
didn't in the Middle Ages there's much
more likelihood that new diseases will

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360
more likelihood that new diseases will
 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.440
more likelihood that new diseases will
spring up we saw this even before jet

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450
spring up we saw this even before jet
 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.180
spring up we saw this even before jet
travel really took off and that was in

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190
travel really took off and that was in
 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.869
travel really took off and that was in
1918 where we had the influenza epidemic

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879
1918 where we had the influenza epidemic
 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.840
1918 where we had the influenza epidemic
there were 50 to 100 million people is

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850
there were 50 to 100 million people is
 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.510
there were 50 to 100 million people is
the estimate that died that's a third

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520
the estimate that died that's a third
 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.119
the estimate that died that's a third
the population of Europe at the time and

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129
the population of Europe at the time and
 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.400
the population of Europe at the time and
500 million people were infected that's

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410
500 million people were infected that's
 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.720
500 million people were infected that's
a third the population in the world

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730
a third the population in the world
 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.239
a third the population in the world
population was 1.6 billion back in 1918
