00:00:00.321 --> 00:00:03.678
So in this unit and the one before, we looked into

00:00:03.678 --> 00:00:07.190
how to model forces and acceleration and how to

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.942
come up with a reasonably good numerical

00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:13.037
solution of a differential equation. This knowledge

00:00:13.037 --> 00:00:15.402
is of course something that you can apply in all

00:00:15.402 --> 00:00:19.551
situations in which velocities and forces and

00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:22.688
acceleration play a major role. We are going to

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:25.904
apply it in a later unit to design an anti-lock

00:00:25.904 --> 00:00:28.604
breaking system. But differential equations can do

00:00:28.604 --> 00:00:32.670
much more than just describe vehicles. In the next

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.308
unit, we will look at the spread of contagious

00:00:35.308 --> 00:00:38.689
diseases for instance by modeling a population as

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:41.392
consisting of susceptible, infectious

00:00:41.392 --> 00:00:43.000
and recovered persons.
