00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.920
Wisdom is one of the grandest and oddest words out there,

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.060
so lofty it doesn't sound like something one could ever consciously strive to be,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.800
unlike say being healthy or kind.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.040
Nevertheless, though it's impossible ever to reach a stable state of wisdom,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.520
as an aspiration, wisdom deserves to be rehabilitated,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.260
and take its place among a host of other more typical goals one might harbor.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.640
Wisdom seems woven from many strands.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.760
The wise are, first and foremost, realistic about how challenging many things can be.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:39.480
They aren't devoid of hope, that would be a folly of its own, but they're conscious of the complexities entailed in any project;

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.080
for example: raising a child, starting a business, spending an agreeable weekend with the family, falling in love.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.880
Knowing that something difficult is being attempted doesn't rob the wise of ambitions,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.520
but it makes them more steadfast, calmer,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.220
and less prone to panic about the problems that will invariably come their way.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.680
Probably aware that much can and does go wrong, the wise are unusually alive to moments of calm and beauty,

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.520
even extremely modest ones:

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.520
they can take pleasure in a single uneventful sunny day, or some pretty flowers growing by a brick wall.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.560
It isn't that they're sentimental and naive, precisely the opposite.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.380
Because they've seen how hard things can be to get,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.860
they know how to draw the full value from the peaceful and the sweet whenever and wherever these arise.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.220
The wise know that all human beings, themselves included, are deeply sunk in folly.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.840
We all have irrational desires and want incompatible things.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.020
We're prone to mood swings and buffeted by the curious demands of our sexuality

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.600
The wise are unsurprised by the ongoing coexistence of deep immaturity and sexual perversity

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.420
Alongside quite adult qualities like intelligence and morality.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.400
They know that we are barely evolved apes.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.020
Aware that at least half of the life is irrational

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.020
they try, wherever possible

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.940
to budget for madness and slow to panic when it reliably raised it's head

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.100
The wise take the business of laughing at themselves seriouly.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.120
They laugh about the constant collisions between the noble way they'd like things to be

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.700
and the demented way they in fact often turn out

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.440
The wise are realistic about social realtions.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.020
In particular, about how difficult it is to change people's minds and have an effect on their lives.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.900
They are therefore extremely reticent about telling people too frankly what they think

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.000
They have a sense of how seldom it's useful to get censorious with others

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.140
They want above all that things go well between people

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.840
Even if this means not being totally honest.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.420
So they will sit with someone of an opposite political persuation and not try to convert them

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.340
They will hold their tongue at someone who seems to be announcing a wrong headed plan

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.000
For reforming the countre, educating their child or directing their personal lives

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.180
They will be aware of how differently things can look through the eyes of others

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.520
and will search more for what people have in common than what seperates them

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:08.500
The wise have made their peace with the gap between how they would ideally want to be and what they are actually like

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.900
They have come to terms with their iciocies, flaws, ugliness, limitations and drawbacks

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.240
They are not ashamed of themselves and yet they understand their craziness

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.380
They can give those close to them a fairly accurate map of the reasons why they are pretty hard to live with

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.300
The wise are realistic about other people too.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.400
They recognize the extraordinary presures everyone is under to pursue their own ambitions,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.240
defend their interests and seek their own pleasures

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.540
It can make other people appear extremely mean and purposedly evil

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.300
but this would be to overpersonalize the issue

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.320
The wise know that most hurt is not intentional.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.220
It's a byproduct of the constant collision of blind competing egos in a world of scarce resources.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.280
The wise are therefore slow to anger and judge

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.480
They don't lead to the worst conclusions about what's going on in the minds of others.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.420
They will be ready to forgive from a prone sense of how difficult every life is

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.720
Harboring as it does so many frustrated ambitions, disappointments and longings

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.080
The wise appreciate the pression people are under

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.600
Of course they shouted, of course they were rude, naturally they want to over take on the inside lane

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.360
The wise are generous to the reasons for which people might not be quite so nice

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.200
They feel less persecuted by the agression and meanness of others

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.980
because they have a sense of where it comes from

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.980
a place of hurt

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.720
The wise have a solid sense of what they can survive.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.640
They know just how much can go wrong
and things will still be just about livable.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.960
the unwise person draws the boundaries of their contentment far too far out

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:52.000
So that it encompasses and depends upon fame, money, personal relationships, popularity, health

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.560
The wise person sees the advantages of all of these but also knows that they may before too long

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.480
at a time of fate's choosing, have to draw the borders right back

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.240
and find contentment within a much more bounded space

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.880
The wise persone does not envy idly

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.220
They realize that there are some good reasons why they don't have many of the things they really want

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.420
They look at the tycoon or the film star and have a decent grasp of why they did not ever make it to that level

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.900
It looks like just an accident, an unfair one but there were in fact some logical grounds

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.260
They did not work as hard, they did not have anything like the drive or mental capacity or looks

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.260
At the same time the wise see that some destinies are truly shaped by nothing more than accident.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:43.900
Some people are promoted randomly, companies that are not specially deserving can suddenly make it big

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.200
Some people have the right parents. The winners are not all noble and good

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.700
The wise appreciate the role of luck and do not curse themselves overly at those juncture

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.740
where they have evidently not had as much of it as they would have liked

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.920
In our abitious era it is common to begin with dreams of being able to pull of an emblemish life

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.820
where one one can to get the major decisions of love and work right

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.400
But the wise realize that it is impossible to fashion a spotless life

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.380
One will make some extremely large and utterly uncorrectable errors in a number of areas

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.840
Perfectionism is a wicked illusion and regret is unavoidable

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.100
But regret lessens the more we see the more we see that error is endemic across the species

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.560
One cannot look at anyone's lifestory without seeing some devastating mistakes edged across it

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.880
These errors are not incidental but sctructural. They arise because we all lack the information we need

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.160
to make choices in time-sensitive situations

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.420
We are all where it counts staring almost blind.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.280
The wise know that tremor is always just around the corner

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.540
They have come to fear and sense its approach

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.780
That is why they nurture such a strong commitment to the idea of being calm

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:07.720
A quite evening feels like an achievement, a day without anxiety is something to be celebrated.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.660
The wise are not afraid of having a somewhat boring time

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.900
It could and will again be so much worse
