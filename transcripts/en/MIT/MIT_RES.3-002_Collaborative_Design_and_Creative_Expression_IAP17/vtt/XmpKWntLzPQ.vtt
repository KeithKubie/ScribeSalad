00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.970
SPEAKER: --simple calculate.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.960
So we're basically just adding
up the numbers from 1 to 5

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.950
from both sides.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.960
So how this works is-- we
start with the red LED--

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.630
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.110
So I need to press
the red button.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.650
So let's say each of these
is represented by a number

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.310
from 1 to 5.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.268
So let's say I press 3.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.390
So when I press 3 it
stops up at value 3.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.965
Then let's say I'm at
5 then it goes to 8.

00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:42.817
So you just add the
two numbers right up.

00:00:42.817 --> 00:00:44.400
Then after that, it
just resets again.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.610
Then you just keep
repeating whatever

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.990
button you want to press.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.000
So I press 1 and then I
press 2, it goes to 3.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.320
Then after a while it resets.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.360
So it helps you from
adding up from 1 to 5.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.655
1 to 5 plus 1 to 5.

00:01:02.655 --> 00:01:03.645
This is loose.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.150
Anyone want to try?

00:01:11.982 --> 00:01:15.760
AUDIENCE: --if you can't
do 2 plus 2 in your head.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.645
SPEAKER: You have to
press the red one first.

00:01:22.276 --> 00:01:24.650
Once you press the red, then
you press the yellow button,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.586
then it just adds the
numbers up accordingly.

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:29.220
AUDIENCE: Is it just
two numbers to add

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.110
or can you keep adding numbers?

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.410
SPEAKER: It's only two numbers
because the server only

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.862
goes for 180 degrees.

00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:35.570
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.146
SPEAKER: Yeah, so you
can't have a full 360 one.

00:01:40.146 --> 00:01:41.940
So you have to
connect the server.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.300
So I was thinking about what
can we do with the server?

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.280
OK, let's try adding the
numbers, just to make

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.930
the server move up and down.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.058
So it's just playing
with what we have.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.060
AUDIENCE: 5--

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.310
SPEAKER: Hit red first.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.250
AUDIENCE: Oh, which one first?

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.720
SPEAKER: Red first.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.555
AUDIENCE: Red first.

00:02:16.555 --> 00:02:18.860
SPEAKER: Red lights up.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.760
AUDIENCE: Wait, that
was 3 plus 4 that's 9.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.760
Wait, no, 7.
