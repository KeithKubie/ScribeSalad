Ahh, I am happy! I like making videos for
you guys... you guys are the best! But I have

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.840
got to call this trend out. Less &gt; less &gt; more.
Here's my version of that fad: less &gt; less

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:20.390
&gt; and now more! But whoa whoa whoa, this isn't
going to be video chaos! Let me orient you.

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.409
First, these beauties - animated takes on
language and communication. These take like

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:32.439
20-plus hours per minute of finished footage,
so please enjoy. No pressure. But enjoy them.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.260
In Eavesdropping Traveler, each vignette takes
a charming, quirky look at a destination through

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.050
its local language. I take pictures, create
art and even write music for these.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.289
Finally, what began as plans for a behind-the-scenes
take is turning into its own series. A series

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.920
that's more direct, a bit vloggy and ties
in a random topic each time.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.670
Oh, wait! There's still the old stuff.
Last year's questions about human language

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.390
and the even older technical lessons aren't
getting updated, but they're still around.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.630
See you in the videos!
