00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.110 line:0%
This brings me to really

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.045 line:0%
I think probably the most
important story for me

00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:14.046
that I have ever worked on.

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:16.949
Which was a story about
Charles Darwin.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.218
The story was called
"Was Darwin wrong?"

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:21.387
And then in the magazine
it said "No."

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:23.756
You know, 'cause essentially
everything he said

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:25.391
is true and correct.

00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:28.628
And, so we did this
article on Darwin.

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:30.830
<i> And these are the birds that
 he collected in the Galapagos.</i>

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.998
<i>And that's one of the privileges</i>

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:33.900
<i> of being a
 Geographic photographer.</i>

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.903
<i> You call up the British
 Museum and you know</i>

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:38.437
most of the time
they'll say "Yes".

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:40.473
If you want to-- I want to
see this or this

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:43.476
and they'll let you do it,
if you pay them.

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:46.646
So these are birds that Darwin
collected in the Galapagos

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:49.415
which helped him
found his theory

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:50.717
because the beaks are
different sizes

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.418
even though they are
the same species.

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:55.388
This is essentially an example
of island bio-evolution

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:58.724
which for the story that
we did for the magazine

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:00.059
you know, everybody
would have expected

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.562
you to go to the Galapagos but

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:06.799
Todd James, photo editor decided
that we shouldn't and I agreed.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.402
<i> But this was a really
 difficult story to work on.</i>

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:12.538
<i> We were in Jamaica,
 the Dominican Republic</i>

00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:15.508
and Puerto Rico shooting
these different anoles

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:16.676
which are the same species

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:18.911
<i> but have evolved separately
 and differently.</i>

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:20.780
<i> We made comparative
 photos between</i>

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.850
<i> gorilla hands and a
 human skeletal hand.</i>

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:29.288
<i> This is a naked mole rat,
 which is an amazing story.</i>

00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:30.923
<i> A 100 years before
 one was found</i>

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:33.059
<i> Darwin predicted
 that there would be</i>

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:35.661
a mammal that had
hive-like behavior.

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:39.799
And in the horn of Africa
they found these animals.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.468
This is a
26-year old individual.

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:46.072
<i> She's a queen and has bred
 thousands of offspring.</i>

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:48.907
<i> And the interesting thing
 about this is that</i>

00:01:48.907 --> 00:01:51.043
these stories always come back
to where I learn something.

00:01:51.043 --> 00:01:53.279
or I reapply something
I've learned.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.949
But the researcher
on this told me that

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:58.251
there is all this research
going on about, you know

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:00.753
how they don't get certain
kinds of diseases.

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:03.556
And the naked mole rats
don't get cancer.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:04.857
So, this is going to be...

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:07.827
it's holding good promise for
research in different areas.

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:10.897
<i> And this was actually
 Darwin's beetle collection</i>

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:13.599
<i> which was great because that's
 how Darwin became interested</i>

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.835
<i>in the natural world was because</i>

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:18.004
<i> he was a beetle collector
 as a kid.</i>

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:20.105
<i> Then we come to
 Alfred Russel Wallace.</i>

00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:23.109
He's a naturalist, much
younger than Darwin.

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.544
He wasn't from a wealthy
family like Darwin

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:28.948
and he became a commercial
Victorian collector

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:30.482
who would go to different
parts of the world

00:02:30.482 --> 00:02:32.585
and send back
specimens for people.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:34.420
This is pre-television,

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.122
pre-film, pre-magazines.

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:37.857
So, people would have,
you know,

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:40.959
cassowaries stuffed
in their parlor

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.161
that they could
talk about.

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:45.264
So it was a form of just
decoration and entertainment.

00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:49.969
<i>He had an idea, he wrote Darwin
a letter, and mailed it to him.</i>

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:51.404
<i> Darwin gets this letter</i>

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:53.472
and then he doesn't do
anything for two weeks.

00:02:53.472 --> 00:02:55.541
It's called "Darwin's Pause".

00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:59.378
And, he's floored
because Wallace

00:02:59.378 --> 00:03:00.980
has the same idea as him.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.883
Essentially the exact same
idea that he has about

00:03:03.883 --> 00:03:07.019
the thing that makes evolution
work is natural selection.

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.456
So, he didn't do anything for
two weeks, then he announces

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:13.459
the Theory of Evolution
via natural selection.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.694
And he, it's...

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:17.396
the theory is by Charles Darwin
and Alfred Russel Wallace.

00:03:17.396 --> 00:03:19.799
Darwin had been working
on this for 25 years

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.033
since he got off the Beagle

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:24.504
and he may have not published
it until he passed away

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:26.572
because his family
was religious.

00:03:26.572 --> 00:03:29.008
At least his wife's family was.

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:31.410
But I think he was
forced to publish

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.112
because of Wallace's paper.

00:03:33.512 --> 00:03:36.983
<i> We also were able to go
 to a tuberculosis prison,</i>

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:39.285
<i> a multi-drug resistant
 tuberculosis prison,</i>

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:43.055
where it was developed
accidentally in Siberia.

00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:44.623
We used this in the story as

00:03:44.623 --> 00:03:46.859
an example of survival
of the fittest,

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.598
which is a really well-known
concept of evolution.

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:54.800
What happened was the
authorities in this prison

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.736
didn't use enough antibiotics.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:04:00.607
They used enough to contain
it but the germs evolved

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:05.377
and changed and became
immune to the antibiotics.

00:04:05.377 --> 00:04:08.581
They've actually found traces
of this kind of tuberculosis

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:11.784
<i> in Brighton Beach,
 in Long Island.</i>

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:14.319
You know, we were working
on it like crazy.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.255
We had to get TB tests
before we went

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:17.657
and after we came back.

00:04:17.657 --> 00:04:19.692
<i> This was a wonderful
 opportunity for me because</i>

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:23.196
<i> it was a big story,
 I think it was 48 pages</i>

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:26.265
<i> and it was just that the topic
 became so interesting to me</i>

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:30.302
that we travelled for 58 days to

00:04:30.302 --> 00:04:34.140
I think, 12 different countries
and 26 different locations.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.974
And we were doing
it on four-by-five film

00:04:35.974 --> 00:04:39.378
so it was a really challenging,
challenging assignment.

00:04:39.378 --> 00:04:42.181
And it was three weeks
before my wedding, so...

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:43.682
Thank you very much.

00:04:43.682 --> 00:04:48.988
( applause )
