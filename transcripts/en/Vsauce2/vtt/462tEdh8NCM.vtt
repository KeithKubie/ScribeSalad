00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:01.770
Vsauce!

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.770
Kevin here.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.490
Put on your Ho Ho Holmium T-shirt.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.440
And get warm in your sweater of santa dropping
toilet presents.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.860
Because this is a special Christmas edition
of LÜT.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.910
Prepare for the holidays and make yourself
some festive toast with this Christmas print

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:19.990
toaster.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.410
And then have some tea with a candy cane....
tea infuser.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.500
If you're more of a coffee drinker check out
this cool project recently funded on Kickstarter.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.730
The new machine is able to roast, grind, and
brew your coffee so you can buy coffee beans

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.050
direct from the growers, giving you the freshest
cup of joe possible.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.329
For something equally as hot suck on one of
these Sriracha candy canes.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.329
Then cool yourself down with some leg lamp
ice cubes from A Christmas Story.

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.290
And now that you're awake and cool, let's
do some cool decorating by growing snow.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.640
This kit lets you add the grow snow packet
to water and watch the magic happen.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.600
Make your tree come alive with these googly
eye ornaments.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.770
That can go right next to your Sigmund Freud
ornament to analyze all the gifts you get.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.630
Like this tweaking Einstein.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.359
Now let's get back twerk and pick out some
presents.

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:17.759
First download the browser extension Tab for
a Cause that will earn money for a charity

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.560
of your choice with every tab you open, so
you can give to those in need while you do

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.729
your shopping.

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.870
Then arm yourself with this beef jerky gun
that finally allows you to pull a trigger

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:29.870
to make meat.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.400
Meet up with your friends on this cool electric
scooter called Kubo that was designed to finally

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.119
give riders ample amounts of storage space
on a scooter to haul things around.

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.289
This bike exhaust system will turn an ordinary
bike into a motorbike.... or at least make

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:44.749
it sound like one.

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:49.880
And you can add these bike mittens to keep
your hands toasty while riding around on those

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.969
wintery days

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.849
Stay warm with Harry potter and Game of Thrones
inspired winter wear sent to me by Vsauce

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:57.009
fan Jackie.

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.509
She made a line of knitted accessories that
turn you into your favorite characters.

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.669
Visualize sounds in your car with these cool
sound activated car stickers.

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:12.080
For the scientist in the family you can order
an Heirloom Chemistry set reminiscent of the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.790
Gilbert Chemistry set from the 50's that comes
with real chemicals and equipment.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.070
Start everyone learning early with Primo,
a playful physical programming interface that

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.930
teaches kids the logic of programming without
requiring the ability to read.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.450
For your four-legged friend pick up this dog
treat pez dispenser.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.860
And for everyone you don't like just give
them the gift of nothing....

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.860
literally

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.490
But then you might need to get yourself this
bah humbug blank candy cane.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.570
After all that shopping you'll need to unwind
in this Dutchtub.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.040
It's a wood burning hot tub that uses the
heat from the fire and natural circulation

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.240
to allow you to relax anywhere.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.340
Or just relax with a beer in the shower....
that you can conveniently hold in your shower

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.340
koozie.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.910
But if you're not in your own bathroom you
might want to invest in this public toilet

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.460
survival kit.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.120
Store all the awesome gifts you get in this
storage bed.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.070
Or use it to do a santa stakeout with this
handy kit that has everything you need to

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.850
sneak up on Old St. Nick himself.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.370
Which of course will go great with your tactical
stocking.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.840
Don't worry about spilling gravy on yourself
with these gravy flavored candy canes

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.180
But if you do spill something just wear Silic,
a shirt that cleans itself because the hydrophobic

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.069
nanotechnology creates a microscopic layer
of air that forms between the liquid and the

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.069
fabric.

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.260
So finally drink your egg nog out cups that
let you pick your nose.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.300
And grumpy cat wants you to know your gift
is in the letterbox.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.480
And I'm gonna leave you with the gift of Game
LÜT with Jake over on Vsauce3.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.430
And as always - thanks for watching.
