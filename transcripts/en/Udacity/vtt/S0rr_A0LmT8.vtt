00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.460
Here's the Sent Memes view, it's
the first screen presented upon launch.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.770
The Sent Memes view keeps track
of all recently sent memes.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.850
Here you can see a few that I
sent to my teammates earlier.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.219
You can see the memes in a table view or
a grid.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.210
Notice how I can switch back and
forth using these tabs.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.770
When I press the grid icon,
the collection view appears.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.090
When I press the table icon
the table view appears.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.710
The grid is created using a UI
collection view controller.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.080
It's similar to the UI
table view controller but

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.510
has a more flexible layout mechanism.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.930
Both of these views access
the same meme model objects, and

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.190
they're embedded in
a tab bar controller.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.150
&gt;From the Sent Memes page, the user
can go back and create new memes.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.627
When I press the button with the plus
icon in the right corner the meme

00:00:47.627 --> 00:00:49.406
editor slides up from the bottom.

00:00:49.406 --> 00:00:51.400
Now I can make a new meme.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.450
Here I'll make one about my
favorite cow on the beach.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.901
And of course when we're done with
our new meme we'll want to share it.

00:01:01.618 --> 00:01:05.720
Here, let's send this one to Sebastian.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.946
When the meme has been sent,
the meme editor slides back down and

00:01:08.946 --> 00:01:11.470
the Sent Memes view is revealed again.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.180
And this time the collection
includes the new cow meme.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.540
And that's meme me 2.0.
