ROWAN MEREWOOD: Talk
to you about here.

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.600
Well actually, it's more like
the beginning of the day.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.730
You guys are here
for the Glass demo.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.220
I want to talk about how
you can connect to people--

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.160
connect people to the service
that you are trying to write,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.040
to the startup that
you're trying to build.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.740
So the first thing
we'll start with

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.870
is this infrastructure
diagram here.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.300
We've got our user on
the side over here,

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.450
and we've got your
service over here.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.200
We can tell it's an
infrastructure diagram

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.230
because we've got a
cloud in the middle.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.710
Now, what we're trying
to do is build some kind

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.870
of link between
those two things.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.650
The traditional way of doing it
is you can build that yourself.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.250
So something you
can build here is

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.340
you have a device the user
is connecting to your service

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.430
with, and you give
them some kind of token

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.480
on the device that connects
them to your service.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.320
This comes with a
number of issues.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.750
Firstly, for your
developers, you

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.240
have to implement this yourself.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.519
You've got to maintain the
infrastructure along with it.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.090
You've got to handle
the security issues.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.170
So we're starting to see
way more stories coming out

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.800
in national press in terms
of people who either decided

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.330
that they didn't need to
encrypt their passwords,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.070
that they could encrypt their
passwords just by MD5ing them,

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.990
that they were using
passwords on their own at all.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.690
And also, then you've
got to make sure

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.240
that that system works
on every single platform

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.740
that you want to deal with.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.370
So we've already got a headache
from a developer point of view.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.210
And as it's been a
kind of recurring theme

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.960
throughout these
presentations, there's

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.280
a lot of this where
you're probably not

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.360
interested in
reinventing the wheel.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.400
You want to go out there and
have new and exciting problems

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.790
that no one else
has run into before.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.920
Now, for the humans
who are actually

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.450
going to try and use
this application,

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.130
it just starts to get worse.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.820
They've got more
passwords that they

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.720
need to stick on Post-Its
next to their monitors.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.620
They've got more devices.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.100
So when they're trying to
connect to your service

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.640
through multiple devices,
that means I log on on here,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.310
I get my password, I put
it in, I set everything up.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.670
Then I get a new device
and I log on there,

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.700
and suddenly I have
to try and remember,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.150
was it the name of my dog?

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.560
Was it the name of my cat?

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.770
Is it my birthday?

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.540
So I put it in again.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.900
And then I've got to do all
of that setup all over again.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.590
And I've got to trust
that you've actually

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.400
built a secure system as well.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.080
It just turns into
a massive headache.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.030
So that's hopefully
where we can come in.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.260
So in fact, just a
quick show of hands.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.440
How many people know
what Google sign in

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.040
is, or have heard
of Google sign in?

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.120
Yeah?

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.140
Oh, OK.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.790
Facebook sign in?

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.290
Yeah.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.403
Twitter sign in?

00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:50.370
Yeah.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.580
So it's all the
same kind of hands.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.440
OK, so with an
identity provider,

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.630
this is the kind of
setup that you get.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.450
So what I want you to
do is ignore the devices

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.440
for the moment.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.830
What we're saying
is that you will

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.820
provide a connection between
you and the person that

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.550
is trying to use your service.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.550
So this is what sign in
with Google is doing,

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.180
is it's building
this connection here.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.880
So that token that was
previously on the device

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.210
now exists off in
the cloud somewhere,

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.796
and it just exists once.

00:03:21.796 --> 00:03:24.730
Then, whenever people
have a device-- now,

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.130
if they've got an Android
device or an Android device

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.450
with Play services
installed, they already

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.590
have a Google account.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.110
So there's no need for them
to enter their password again.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.840
That means whenever you
get a new device here,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.370
you basically just hook
it into this channel,

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.486
and you automatically
get that sign in effect.

00:03:42.486 --> 00:03:44.360
You don't have to remember
any other password

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.360
other than the password that
goes with your Google account.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.760
And you get a couple of other
interesting benefits as well.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.760
So first of all, this whole
system is based on OAuth 2.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.460
That means it's
fairly open standard.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.876
That means there are a number
of implementations out there

00:03:57.876 --> 00:04:00.130
that can help you work with
the basic details of it,

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.310
alongside our libraries.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.930
We support across a variety
of platforms, so web, iOS,

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.320
and Android.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.550
And then we've got
some special features

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.530
that we built on top
of this that I wanted

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.360
to tell you guys a
little bit about.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.430
So firstly, we provide
over-the-air installs.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.160
Now, what this
means is if you are

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.430
trying to drive
app installations

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.850
from various
locations, then we can

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.810
provide a really slick
and clean and efficient

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.630
way of doing this.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.650
And the other bit is
cross-device sign-on.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.760
So this is a kind
of magical effect

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.160
where I just have to
sign in in one place,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.630
and then I'm
automatically signed

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.790
in in all these other locations.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.410
And finally, if you're
using any of Google's APIs,

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.990
and you want user
access to those APIs--

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.942
so for example, if you want
to access the user's Drive,

00:04:51.942 --> 00:04:54.150
you want to do something
with their YouTube history--

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.140
then you're going to need to
sign them in via Google anyway.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.870
So let's take a look at a
couple people who use these.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.600
So you can try these out
for yourself as we go along,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.970
or when you are somewhat
faster internet connection.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.580
Who speaks Spanish?

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.080
Yeah?

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.580
Good.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.220
So this example is for you.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.640
So Minub, they do travel
guides for various cities.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.280
Now, if you go along
to their website,

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.940
then they've got a
little button up here

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.620
which allows you to
create an account.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.640
So I go in.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.070
And luckily, it's just a case
of hitting the big red button,

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.920
even if you don't speak Spanish.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.890
So we click that.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.227
And we get the standard
sign in window up here.

00:05:43.227 --> 00:05:44.810
So this is another
one of the benefits

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.390
of using a sign in provider,
is that your users start

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.750
to get used to the
same process each time.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.694
They don't have to learn a
new set of password rules

00:05:52.694 --> 00:05:54.110
or wonder whether
you've called it

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.850
username or nickname or email.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.850
They just get the same
process each time.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.440
And you can see in here, we're
asking for some permissions

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.170
that we want to use to
access their account.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:09.520
Now, when they click Next
here, because their devices are

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.840
registered with
Google, what we can do

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.610
is we can detect--
if Minub has an app,

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.710
and they've configured
this correctly,

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.790
then we know what
devices the user has,

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.080
what devices that app
can be installed on,

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.020
and whether they have
it installed already.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.590
If they don't, we can show
them this prompt here.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.530
So you can see that
I'm going to install it

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.340
on my now rather antique S3.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.240
But I say yes to that.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.340
So I just click through.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.840
And it just says,
it's being downloaded.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.200
So this is the point
where I either come back

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.230
to my phone at a later
point or take my phone out.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.970
And you can see
over here that I've

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.240
had a notification that it's
been successfully installed.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.520
And then when I
open up the app, I'm

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.390
already logged in on the
application over here.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.120
So this is the cross device
sign in aspect of it.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.540
Because when the app was
opened, the first thing

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.890
it does, instead of just
displaying the Sign In button,

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.960
it makes a call off to Google to
see if that connection already

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.826
exists.

00:07:10.826 --> 00:07:12.200
If the connection
already exists,

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.075
we know we don't need
to show the button then

00:07:14.075 --> 00:07:15.680
for someone just to
click it, so they

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.390
can do that one-step process.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.947
We can just take
them straight in,

00:07:18.947 --> 00:07:21.155
bring all their settings
in, show them their profile.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.270
So this can also work
in the other direction.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.200
So this is quite good if
I've hit your website first,

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.930
and I wasn't aware
that you had an app.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.050
But a lot more
we're finding people

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.020
are going either mobile
first or mobile only.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.250
So they're not necessarily
going to hit your website

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.850
to find out that you
have an application.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.975
They're just going to go
straight to the Play Store

00:07:43.975 --> 00:07:46.840
and get it from there or hear
about it from their friends.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.370
So we can do the same thing
going in the other direction.

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:56.090
So Fancy is quite a cool
little web shop affiliate

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:56.900
kind of thing.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.940
They sell a lot of
ludicrously expensive items.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.230
But if people buy those
items, then you kind of

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.990
get an affiliate credit for
the links that you supplied.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.300
So inside of their app,
and I sign in with Google.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.970
And you can see that I get
the similar kind of box here.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.820
I sign in, and I've
got my account.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:20.310
Now, later on, let's say I'm at
work, and it's my lunch break.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.420
So I'm looking on the web.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.740
So I go over to fancy.com here.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.330
And what happens
is the JavaScript,

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.820
again, is getting
a callback that's

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.789
telling them that I've already
connected to this site.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.850
So they get a little
popup that slides up

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.070
from the bottom that
says welcome back.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.289
And then the page automatically
reloads and logs me

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:42.740
straight in again.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.770
So again, this is
really helpful.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.090
If I've grabbed your app
somewhere in the past,

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.450
I don't really remember it.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.890
I come back to your website,
and all of a sudden I'm

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.620
just signed in on your website
because I created an account

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:54.785
using your app in the past.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.839
Some best practices then about
using these kind of things.

00:09:02.839 --> 00:09:04.630
How many people are
building a service that

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:08.300
requires some kind of
login for customers?

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.540
OK, so that's a fair few of you.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.460
One of the points
to make, though,

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:18.930
is that user registration action
is a valuable transaction.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.990
It's valuable for
you as a startup

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:26.170
because you're getting a
registered user that you

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.900
can then market to directly,
you can track across

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.983
all your different platforms,
you can provide them

00:09:30.983 --> 00:09:32.520
with a personalized service.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.540
But it's a valuable transaction
for the user as well.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.270
They're giving up
their details to you

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.600
so they have to trust you.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.070
They're taking the time to
register in that service

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:41.640
as well.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.540
So they have to understand the
value that they're getting out

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.990
by giving you the details
to their application.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.260
So some of the things you
should try and do there.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.760
Don't register the
user until you need to.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.360
So if you're doing a sort of
shopping cart application,

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.695
this is a fairly obvious one.

00:09:56.695 --> 00:09:58.570
You want to let the user
go through the shop,

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:01.060
buying various things,
filling out their cart.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.550
You don't need to register
them up until the point

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:06.490
that they actually click Buy.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:07.850
And this as well.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:09.530
Make sure that the
user understands

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:13.960
the value of what it is
they're signing up for.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.180
And the other thing
that we need to do here

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.550
is, you noticed on these
popups before where

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.280
I was getting various
permissions for the account.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.410
You can ask for all
kinds of permissions

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.450
when you're accessing
the various APIs.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.740
So you can read someone's
YouTube history.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.270
You can ask for permission
to manage their email.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.640
And one of the things you
should try and do there

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:42.820
is only ask for the permissions
that you need at that time.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.930
So we provide a couple
different key ones

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:49.130
for logging the user
in, and they're kind of

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:53.350
in order of the amount of data
that we're giving back here.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:56.230
If you just ask for what
we call the profile scope,

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.610
then that will log the
user in and return to you

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:03.020
as the service provider this
minimum amount of user profile

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.690
information that they need
to access the service.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:09.520
One of the other good things
about this as well is I've been

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.410
saying sign in with Google
because one of the more recent

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:17.210
changes we made is that the sign
in service doesn't require you

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.480
to have a Google+ account.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.820
So if you just sign in
using the profile scope,

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.030
that is anyone with
a Google account.

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.870
That means anyone with a
Google Android device, anyone

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.830
with a Gmail account, anyone
with a YouTube account,

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:33.150
they can all sign
in using that scope.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.430
You've got plus.login then,
which means that if they have

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:39.520
a Google+ account, you can
access more of the social

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.080
networking features that
we provide through there.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.450
And finally, right
down the end, you

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:45.730
can ask for the email scope.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:48.120
And that's where we actually
provide their email address

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.950
back to you as well.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:54.190
This means that they can
log into your service

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.570
and you don't necessarily
need to take their email.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.280
But in a lot of
cases, you generally

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.430
want to ask for the
email as well, especially

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:05.660
say if you are adding a identity
provider on top of an existing

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.250
legacy sign in system.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.330
Because at that point,
you've probably used email

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.740
as an identifier, and you
want to match up social users

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:16.880
to existing legacy users
that you've already got.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.480
Now, one of the other things
we can do though is we

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.230
can also do incremental auth.

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:24.880
So you can ask for some nice
basic safe sounding permissions

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.160
first, and then
later on, when you

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.230
want to do something more in
depth, you can message there

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.840
and you can ask for the scarier
permissions from the user

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.220
without just throwing a
massive wall of things saying,

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:40.710
hey, sign up for Map, and
let me read your email.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.330
OK, so I wanted to give you two
examples of some people who've

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.090
been doing that.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.380
Joilicloud does it quite nicely.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.870
Jolicloud is an
example where they

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.550
can ask for a lot of really
frightening permissions

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:53.520
up front.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.690
So they spend a lot
of time messaging

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:59.850
that to you in advance so
it doesn't seem too crazy.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.220
Now, what they do
is they basically

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.260
give you this aggregated
cloud storage.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.540
So they provide a nice way
of managing drive files,

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.020
YouTube files, I think they
may synchronize with Dropbox

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.170
and a couple other providers.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.550
So if you do sign in
with Google there,

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.475
they provide their
own popup here.

00:13:17.475 --> 00:13:18.850
Well, what you're
doing is you're

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.310
selecting from the
various services

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.380
that you're interested
in integrating.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.460
So that when you
get to this stage

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:29.440
here, where it says things like
Manage Your YouTube Account,

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.530
you already know why they're
asking for that permission.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.222
So if they just gave that to
you as a sort of, hey, sign

00:13:35.222 --> 00:13:37.680
in with Google, and it popped
up saying Manage Your YouTube

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.010
Account, you'd probably be
asking some questions about,

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:42.630
hm, do I really
want them to know

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.680
that I've been watching Miley
Cyrus videos for the past three

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.150
weeks?

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:49.690
Now one of the
other things you can

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.770
do there is the
incremental auth style.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.670
So Jolicloud just
asks for everything

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:56.530
they need upfront
in one big block

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.230
so that they know
that their user is

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.500
in the right permit
in the right state.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.200
8tracks then is
a kind of service

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.060
where basically they're
streaming music.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.580
And they base this on
doing recommendations

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.210
for streaming music for you.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:12.140
So again, we're
going to sign in.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.020
We've got a basic set
of permissions here.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.940
And then later on
what they can do

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.040
is they can use
your YouTube history

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.770
to personalize those
recommendations even more.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.110
So if you click over there
on the Connect Your YouTube

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:30.390
Account button, then again you
get the similar-looking popup.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.140
But at this point,
you've only got the one

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.514
additional permission
that you're

00:14:33.514 --> 00:14:35.050
asking for this
being shown there.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:40.870
So that's sign in.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:46.020
You guys look like you're
still awake, so that's good.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.640
Some of the other things I
wanted to tell you about tehn.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.170
We've heard a lot about
the cloud platform.

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:55.910
One of the aspects of the cloud
platform that I feel like kind

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.730
of sneaks in the
side is Google Drive.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.480
One of the things that we
can do inside of Google Drive

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.180
is you have this
special app data

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:10.110
folder that you can use to
store your application's config

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:12.880
data in the user's Drive.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.460
So the thing that
you can do here,

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.700
if you ask for the Drive
app data scope, that

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:22.010
means that you can basically
store little blobs of data.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.810
And you store those in
the user's Drive space,

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:26.720
meaning that you're
using their storage,

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.040
and you're using our
bandwidth, rather than

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.610
your own infrastructure.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.450
So if you're combining this with
something like the cross device

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:37.040
sign on, then you can make that
kind of completely seamless

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.660
experience across
different devices.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:44.290
So before, for example, I could
be signed in on both my tablet

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:45.480
and on my phone.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.630
But for example, if I
set some preferences

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:50.940
in your app about the theme that
I liked, maybe the news stories

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.170
that I wanted to
read, you'd need

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:56.690
some way of either just
letting those be separate

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.520
on each device or
syncing them separately.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.250
If you include the
Drive permission,

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.170
then you've automatically got
that additional free cloud

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.860
storage that you can
use to synchronize

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.835
those details across
all of the devices.

00:16:11.487 --> 00:16:13.070
The other thing I
wanted to talk about

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:16.950
is once you've got those
users in, you probably

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:21.800
want them to share data with
their contacts, their friends,

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.090
their colleagues.

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:26.630
And there are a number of
ways that you can do this.

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:28.070
People are quite
used to this now,

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:31.280
so to do this
effectively you probably

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.590
want to be a bit more
sophisticated than just

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.620
the kind of standard just
do a dumb broadcast of stuff

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.760
out to anyone who
happens to be reading.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.530
Some of the things
that you can do then,

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:47.158
who's developing an Android app?

00:16:47.158 --> 00:16:49.500
Oh, OK.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.000
Right.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.544
So some of you are
falling asleep.

00:16:52.544 --> 00:16:54.210
That was actually
mostly just a question

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:56.280
to check you're still with me.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.910
One of the things
you can do here,

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.330
or if you're thinking of
developing an Android app as

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.900
well, a lot of you
have probably seen

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.561
that when you go
to share something,

00:17:04.561 --> 00:17:06.060
you just click a
button, and you get

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.140
this kind of standard
list of applications

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.839
that can handle it.

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:12.430
And a lot of the time, this
is not always appropriate

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:13.130
for the user.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:18.630
Because they'll just have all
of their applications available,

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:22.690
and when I'm, say, sharing
something from the Guardian

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:26.180
app, I'm probably more likely
to share it via different routes

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.819
than, say, when I'm
sharing something

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:29.780
from my photo collection.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.070
So what we can do with
the share action provider

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.500
is you actually get some
customization over that,

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.620
and you can store a file so
that whatever the user used

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:41.210
to share last time will appear
at the top of that list again.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:42.790
Or you can do your
own customizations

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:45.460
based on their favorite
applications or preferences

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.810
that they've set.

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.590
One of the other things that we
can do is if you're sharing via

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:54.480
Google+ now, and you've built
that share using our libraries,

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.350
then we can actually look
through the user's contacts

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:00.280
and suggest some top contacts
based on who they talk

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.030
to the most.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:03.360
We can pull those contacts
in the user's phone

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.060
so that we can give you a
really quick, automatic way

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.750
of targeting their
most contacted users

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.890
for that particular share.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:15.070
And finally, one of the other
things we do on Google+ is we

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:16.600
have interactive posts.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.250
So these give you
a more targeted way

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.880
of sharing something
directly with the user

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.340
that gives them a call
to action on that share,

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.180
so they've got something
specific they want to do.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.900
So I just wanted to show
an example of something

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.280
that you can do with that.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.195
So here's an
interactive post for why

00:18:35.195 --> 00:18:36.570
is Rowan Merewood still talking?

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.640
I came for the Glass demo.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.070
We've got a call to
action, which is complain.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.707
So you can post
that to the world.

00:18:44.707 --> 00:18:46.540
And then when your
friends see that, they've

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:49.740
got this big action
button, which

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.530
compared to a normal
share, we found

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:54.380
this has a three times
higher clickthrough

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.840
rate than just sharing
a standard link.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.296
Part of that is possibly
the novelty, but part of it

00:19:00.296 --> 00:19:01.670
is also because
you've given them

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:04.610
a very clear thing, a very
clear verb that they're

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.590
going to do as a
result of your post.

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:08.760
OK.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.780
A final thing then
before we get some food

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.370
and we get some cool technology.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:15.910
I wanted to kind of hark
back to some of the stuff

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:19.340
that Nick was saying
right back at the opening.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.290
You should be thinking
less about your app

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:26.400
as a discrete thing that
exists as an entire experience

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.410
for the user on their phone.

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:31.210
It's less going to be about
the user coming to you

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:33.470
and interacting in just one way.

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.922
They're maybe going to open
something on their laptop.

00:19:35.922 --> 00:19:37.880
Then they're going to
come back on their phone.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.060
Maybe someone's going to
share a link with them.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.560
Maybe they're going
to be searching,

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.450
and they want to come to your
application through there.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:46.770
So it's very much
about thinking,

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.920
how are they going to
interact with my service?

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.610
I should not be the one who
is responsible for saying,

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:54.384
you will only interact with
my service in this one way.

00:19:54.384 --> 00:19:56.050
You have to go through
this entry point.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:57.540
You have to come out here.

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.490
It's a case of providing
those best entry and exit

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:04.170
points across a variety
of platforms and methods.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:05.270
You can do this.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.430
So some of the things
you can do here.

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:10.730
Take a look at schema.org.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:15.380
That's an open standard
that provides markup

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.200
for marking up various
entities on your site.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.790
So for example, if you are
a music streaming site,

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:25.900
then there are schema in there
for marking up bands, tracks.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.940
If you are an
airline, then there's

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:32.900
markup for flights,
for destinations,

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.920
for tickets, for seating types,
all of these kind of things.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.420
You can also markup
for app indexing.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.670
What app indexing means is
that if I'm on my phone,

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:45.500
and I search for something,
and I include your app name

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.120
in there, then I get a button
inside of the search results

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.710
that will take me
straight to your app.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:55.180
Additionally, add
this kind of markup

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.270
into your emails as well.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:01.780
And this is where we start to
process those emails to show

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:05.360
buttons and actions directly
inside of the Gmail interface.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.380
And cards also start to
appear in Google Now.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.910
So if you're interested
in Where, for example,

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.960
and your stuff appearing
on Where for free,

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.420
then this is a good
way to get into it.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.610
This card idea of
users navigating

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:23.960
through these little cards,
you'll see this a lot in Glass

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:24.460
as well.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.610
This is the concept
that they use.

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:30.500
And finally, really
remember inside of Android

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.620
to handle those multiple
intents to have multiple entry

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.070
points into your application.

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:38.840
So just to give you a final
few examples on those.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.740
This is what app indexing
looks like if I'm

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:44.090
searching for a recipe using
this site called All the Cooks.

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:47.610
Then inside of here, you
can see that I search,

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.285
and there I get the application
that I've got installed,

00:21:50.285 --> 00:21:52.470
I open an app button,
and I go straight

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:54.107
through to the application.

00:21:54.107 --> 00:21:55.690
One of the things
that we can do there

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.910
that is slightly
different to deep linking

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.094
is that if you don't
have the app installed,

00:22:00.094 --> 00:22:02.010
then we can take you
through to the Play Store

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:05.580
to grab it, and then take you
back to the deep link as well.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:09.530
So it's another channel to drive
app installations rather than

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:12.340
just deep links into your
applications for existing

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.080
users.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.450
And finally, a few examples
of how those actions,

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:18.810
if you markup your email's
content correctly, appear

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:20.500
inside of Google Map.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.680
So at the moment, we can
handle a variety of things.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.100
We could handle flights.

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.010
We can display boarding passes.

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:29.702
We can do reservations at
hotels and various events,

00:22:29.702 --> 00:22:31.410
and we can do reservations
at restaurants

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:34.510
as well that's a lot.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:35.400
Thanks very much.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.750
[APPLAUSE]
