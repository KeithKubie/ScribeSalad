00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719
into things a bat and ball cost $1 10
 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.259
into things a bat and ball cost $1 10
the bat cost one dollar more than the

hands up please great you got one of two

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800
hands up please great you got one of two
 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.540
hands up please great you got one of two
possible answers what you though got was

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550
possible answers what you though got was
 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.590
possible answers what you though got was
the cognitive miser answer the one that

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600
the cognitive miser answer the one that
 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.840
the cognitive miser answer the one that
uses shortcuts in the brain this

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850
uses shortcuts in the brain this
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.720
uses shortcuts in the brain this
actually isn't the real answer the real

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730
actually isn't the real answer the real
 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.680
actually isn't the real answer the real
answer is 5 cents if you look in the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690
answer is 5 cents if you look in the
 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.410
answer is 5 cents if you look in the
graphic on on that side it really does

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420
graphic on on that side it really does
 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.830
graphic on on that side it really does
it does add up to kind of 5 cents so

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840
it does add up to kind of 5 cents so
 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.529
it does add up to kind of 5 cents so
that's one example of us thinking that

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539
that's one example of us thinking that
 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.260
that's one example of us thinking that
we're rational but actually acting

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270
we're rational but actually acting
 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.750
we're rational but actually acting
irrationally the reason behind the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760
irrationally the reason behind the
 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.639
irrationally the reason behind the
cognitive miser is that your brain is

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649
cognitive miser is that your brain is
 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.160
cognitive miser is that your brain is
actually trying to save mental energy

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170
actually trying to save mental energy
 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.830
actually trying to save mental energy
the brain is a made an amazing thing and

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840
the brain is a made an amazing thing and
 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.600
the brain is a made an amazing thing and
we actually make on average thirty five

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
we actually make on average thirty five
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.570
we actually make on average thirty five
thousand decisions in a day but that

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
thousand decisions in a day but that
 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.820
thousand decisions in a day but that
mental energy is a finite resource and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830
mental energy is a finite resource and
 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.789
mental energy is a finite resource and
we suffer over the day something called

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
we suffer over the day something called
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.890
we suffer over the day something called
decision fatigue so by the end of it

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900
decision fatigue so by the end of it
 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.380
decision fatigue so by the end of it
it's almost as if we're drunk when we're

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390
it's almost as if we're drunk when we're
 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.929
it's almost as if we're drunk when we're
making decisions but that's just the tip

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939
making decisions but that's just the tip
 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:31.039
making decisions but that's just the tip
of the iceberg really why are we all

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049
of the iceberg really why are we all
 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.700
of the iceberg really why are we all
here today and why am i speaking up here

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710
here today and why am i speaking up here
 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.999
here today and why am i speaking up here
well biases are really really important

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009
well biases are really really important
 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.969
well biases are really really important
to us because we're all here to create

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979
to us because we're all here to create
 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.460
to us because we're all here to create
apps and experiences that really offer

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
apps and experiences that really offer
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.170
apps and experiences that really offer
can have long-term relationships with

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180
can have long-term relationships with
 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.359
can have long-term relationships with
the customers we're all aiming for high

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369
the customers we're all aiming for high
 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.340
the customers we're all aiming for high
engagement and a high perceived value

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350
engagement and a high perceived value
 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.149
engagement and a high perceived value
from customers for our products but we

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159
from customers for our products but we
 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.749
from customers for our products but we
can use biases in positive in a positive

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759
can use biases in positive in a positive
 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.420
can use biases in positive in a positive
way and a guiding light in the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430
way and a guiding light in the
 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.399
way and a guiding light in the
simplification process to guide them

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409
simplification process to guide them
 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.670
simplification process to guide them
through the journey of our app in a

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680
through the journey of our app in a
 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.639
through the journey of our app in a
really nice and simple way

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649
 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.750
two scenarios which would you prefer the

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760
two scenarios which would you prefer the
 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.940
two scenarios which would you prefer the
number involved above its number of

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950
number involved above its number of
 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.580
number involved above its number of
monthly active users in your app I think

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590
monthly active users in your app I think
 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.860
monthly active users in your app I think
we'd all agree that we'd rather three

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870
we'd all agree that we'd rather three
 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.119
we'd all agree that we'd rather three
million rather than 800,000 let's add

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129
million rather than 800,000 let's add
 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.460
million rather than 800,000 let's add
one data point to that engagements

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470
one data point to that engagements
 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.640
one data point to that engagements
Snorri one now has low engagement the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650
Snorri one now has low engagement the
 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.890
Snorri one now has low engagement the
scenario twos got high and by engagement

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900
scenario twos got high and by engagement
 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.599
scenario twos got high and by engagement
I'm defining that as the percentage of

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609
I'm defining that as the percentage of
 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.240
I'm defining that as the percentage of
people completing your core action a

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250
people completing your core action a
 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.009
people completing your core action a
core action for example would be

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019
core action for example would be
 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.080
core action for example would be
completely posting a tweet on Twitter

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090
completely posting a tweet on Twitter
 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.270
completely posting a tweet on Twitter
pending up putting likes on a board on

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280
pending up putting likes on a board on
 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.449
pending up putting likes on a board on
Pinterest so actually in this which

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459
Pinterest so actually in this which
 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.330
Pinterest so actually in this which
which of the two would you rather I'd

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340
which of the two would you rather I'd
 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.830
which of the two would you rather I'd
highly and strongly suggest that we

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840
highly and strongly suggest that we
 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.920
highly and strongly suggest that we
actually focus on the 800,000 and the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930
actually focus on the 800,000 and the
 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.050
actually focus on the 800,000 and the
high engagement the three million is

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060
high engagement the three million is
 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.319
high engagement the three million is
really just a vanity metric

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329
really just a vanity metric
 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.110
really just a vanity metric
let's go six months into the future and

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120
let's go six months into the future and
 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.319
let's go six months into the future and
now we've seen how focusing on high

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329
now we've seen how focusing on high
 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.750
now we've seen how focusing on high
engagement and that's leading to high

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760
engagement and that's leading to high
 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.729
engagement and that's leading to high
retention you've been able to build up

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739
retention you've been able to build up
 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.979
retention you've been able to build up
the monthly active users to five million

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989
the monthly active users to five million
 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.099
the monthly active users to five million
and so that's with using these little

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109
and so that's with using these little
 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:16.780
and so that's with using these little
nudges there's little biases these

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790
nudges there's little biases these
 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.089
nudges there's little biases these
guiding lights to help your customers

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099
guiding lights to help your customers
 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.759
guiding lights to help your customers
along the journeys within the apps that

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769
along the journeys within the apps that
 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.710
along the journeys within the apps that
you've built having been in this

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720
you've built having been in this
 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.080
you've built having been in this
business for a long time there's a few

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090
business for a long time there's a few
 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.879
business for a long time there's a few
questions we ask ourselves when we're

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889
questions we ask ourselves when we're
 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:37.899
questions we ask ourselves when we're
designing and building apps simple

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909
designing and building apps simple
 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.000
designing and building apps simple
questions really is it clear what the

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010
questions really is it clear what the
 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.180
questions really is it clear what the
app does in that first five or 10 second

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190
app does in that first five or 10 second
 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.069
app does in that first five or 10 second
experience for the customer really out

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079
experience for the customer really out
 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.140
experience for the customer really out
are you getting the value across are you

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150
are you getting the value across are you
 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.960
are you getting the value across are you
finding that hook in terms of value as

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970
finding that hook in terms of value as
 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.689
finding that hook in terms of value as
well generally to create value either

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:52.699
well generally to create value either
 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.719
well generally to create value either
save people time save people money or

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:55.729
save people time save people money or
 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:57.250
save people time save people money or
enhanced an experience or it's a

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260
enhanced an experience or it's a
 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.379
enhanced an experience or it's a
combination of the three so think about

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389
combination of the three so think about
 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:00.879
combination of the three so think about
how you actually create some value for

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889
how you actually create some value for
 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.219
how you actually create some value for
the customer and also going back to that

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:03.229
the customer and also going back to that
 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:05.349
the customer and also going back to that
core action try and design that whole

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359
core action try and design that whole
 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.569
core action try and design that whole
experience of your app around that

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579
experience of your app around that
 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.539
experience of your app around that
specific simple core action and use

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549
specific simple core action and use
 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.550
specific simple core action and use
those biases to kind of help them along

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560
those biases to kind of help them along
 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.199
those biases to kind of help them along
the way to complete that core action

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209
the way to complete that core action
 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.659
the way to complete that core action
also along that journey how can you

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669
also along that journey how can you
 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.879
also along that journey how can you
provide a sense of progress to make them

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889
provide a sense of progress to make them
 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.920
provide a sense of progress to make them
feel like they're progressing to the end

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930
feel like they're progressing to the end
 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.650
