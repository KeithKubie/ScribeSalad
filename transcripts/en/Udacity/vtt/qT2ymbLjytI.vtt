00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.460
Now let's look at a third property.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.330
Is it invariant to image scale?

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.710
That is, now the object has different
scales in the multiple images.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.730
This can be looked at by again just
taking a simple example like this.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.710
So I have two objects here or
two elements.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.800
As you can notice, both of them are the
same except this is much smaller and

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.550
this is much larger.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.270
Now, here what becomes
interesting is what

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.320
resolution am I looking at information.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.020
So, if for example, if I'm looking,

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.790
this is the size of the window I'm
looking at and this is the size of

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.790
the window I'm looking at, well nothing
directly would compare to those.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.410
And, depending again what aspects of
these regions am I kind of scaling and

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.340
observing, I would have
problems with this.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.240
This, of course, would be
a perfect match at just this size.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.340
And there is no similarity at this
window for this whole region.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.310
But as I said, this basically is
the same object just scaled up.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.060
So what I would need
is a different size.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.590
This of course in this
detector will be a corner.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.100
This will not be at this window
size detected as a corner.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.320
In fact, they will all be listed
as edges, as you would expect.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.700
So of course this suggests that
Harris Detector is not invariant

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.740
to image scale.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.010
So what can we do about it?
