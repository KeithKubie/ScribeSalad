00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.640
- Hey everyone, hope you're
having an amazing day.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.580
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in
Rio De Janeiro, Brazil

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.790
and favelas are a community
of informal housing,

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.300
which is a major, major part of Rio.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.740
As you drive through the streets,

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.410
you'll notice high-rise buildings,

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.800
but in between the buildings
and within the valleys

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.375
and literally on the sides
of cliffs and mountains

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:23.060
you will see, you will notice favelas.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.230
Now, it wouldn't be right
for me to not mention

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.581
that a lot of crime does
take place in favelas,

00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:32.330
and some of them can be
dangerous in certain areas,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.370
especially without the right connection.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.300
However, the favelas are also,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.926
there's a totally different
side of the favelas.

00:00:38.926 --> 00:00:41.503
It's home to some of the most creative,

00:00:41.503 --> 00:00:44.550
some of the most hard-working

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.552
and some of the most heartwarming,

00:00:46.552 --> 00:00:48.966
welcoming people in Brazil as well.

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:52.340
So today we're take you,
we're gonna go on a food tour

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.580
of the favelas of Rio.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.310
We're gonna visit two different favelas.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.110
We're gonna eat some home-cooked food,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.920
we're gonna eat at some
street food stalls,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.860
we're gonna meet some amazing people.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.470
I'm gonna share all the food with you

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.187
and the entire experience
with you in this video.

00:01:05.187 --> 00:01:10.187
(funky music)
(food sizzling)

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:20.872
Guilherme, good morning.
- Yes, good morning!

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:22.450
- Good morning, Rafaela,
how are you today?

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.980
- Very nice, very good, thank you.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:24.813
- Awesome.

00:01:25.657 --> 00:01:27.255
Guilherme, nice to meet you, man.

00:01:27.255 --> 00:01:28.550
Guilherme, Guilherme.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.400
Awesome.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.240
We're gonna jump on motorbikes.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.143
Helmet on.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.396
All right, we're off!

00:01:35.396 --> 00:01:38.921
(speaking Spanish)
On our way.

00:01:38.921 --> 00:01:43.921
(funky music)
(horns beeping)

00:01:51.964 --> 00:01:55.840
You gotta really hold on because
these hills are steep, man!

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.250
What's amazing about favelas is that

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.790
I mean, it is an entire community,

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.480
so it's like an entire city within a city,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.840
within Rio de Janeiro.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.974
There's businesses,
there's everything here.

00:02:04.974 --> 00:02:08.216
(funky music)
(traffic rumbling)

00:02:08.216 --> 00:02:13.133
(horn beeps)
(funky music)

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.622
That's steep, man!
(speaking Portuguese)

00:02:27.622 --> 00:02:30.840
That last bit was so steep I was sliding.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.663
How do I get this off?

00:02:32.663 --> 00:02:34.293
I was sliding off the motorbike.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.490
I have a new appreciation
for hills, they're so steep.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.820
Even just walking around.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.462
Yeah, taking a motorbike is
a roller coaster experience

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:45.201
and then walking around,
oh hello chickens,

00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:47.890
and walking around is, you get a workout.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.296
I think it's a community
jackfruit, they just split it open.

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:54.570
All the motorbike drivers
are grabbing pieces

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.348
and even people walking by
are just having a piece of it.

00:02:57.348 --> 00:03:01.080
Wow, that's very, very ripe.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.512
It's good, though, really, really sweet.

00:03:03.512 --> 00:03:06.250
- It's a pleasure to receive you guys.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.473
- Thank you so much, man.

00:03:07.473 --> 00:03:10.320
- I'm born and raised in this favela.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.340
This favela's the biggest favela in Rio.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.633
I mean, like in Brazil it's
a kind of city within city.

00:03:14.633 --> 00:03:18.309
There are 300,000 people living here, so.

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:23.140
Welcome to my place, we're
gonna hang out together here.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.792
I'm gonna take you out to
some really nice places.

00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:30.065
We have a lot of stores,
restaurants, so food is

00:03:30.065 --> 00:03:32.470
what we have most here.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.180
I mean like a lot of food so
they experience of all that

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.723
food being really nice.
- Awesome.

00:03:36.723 --> 00:03:38.901
Thank you for taking us around.

00:03:38.901 --> 00:03:41.170
- This is the most famous
cocina in the area.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.570
- Oh cool, it's one of the
Brazilian snacks on the go

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.399
that I haven't tried yet
that I'm very excited to try.

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:50.486
(speaking Portuguese)

00:03:50.486 --> 00:03:51.319
It's in like a teardrop shape.

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.900
I'm like impressed how heavy
it is, how dense it is.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.550
Like you think it's gonna
be like an airy pocket

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.550
but that is dense.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.714
Do you normally eat it from
the top or any way you like?

00:03:59.714 --> 00:04:00.871
- From the bottom.

00:04:00.871 --> 00:04:01.810
- From the bottom?
- Yeah.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.030
- Okay.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.520
- It's, it's a personal choice.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.060
- Okay, he said from the bottom.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.196
- Actually for me
traditions from the bottom.

00:04:08.196 --> 00:04:09.847
- From the bottom.

00:04:09.847 --> 00:04:11.970
Okay he says.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.726
- You'll eat all the
chicken first and then.

00:04:13.726 --> 00:04:15.754
- And then more bread on the top, okay.

00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:18.188
He's the expert, he said
eat it from the bottom.

00:04:18.188 --> 00:04:20.771
(gentle music)

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.013
Oh yeah.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.910
That's amazing, hot sauce.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.160
The batter the outside wrapper's
made from casava flour.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.880
You can taste that it's kind of gummy.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.550
Kind of sticky and very starchy.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.840
The inside is a mix of
chicken, it tastes a little bit

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.539
like tomato-y but mostly
just like shredded chicken

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:42.870
that's just delicious, that's hearty,

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.441
that is packed with chicken.

00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:46.460
And Guilherme just came out
of nowhere with a bottle

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.063
of hot sauce and drenched
my, drenched mine in it.

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:59.290
Good with that hot sauce,
oh yeah that's spicy.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.440
That's like vinegary, that
like goes up your nose,

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.473
that's amazing.

00:05:02.473 --> 00:05:04.300
Yeah this is some of the
cashew juice it comes in a set.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.332
Comes with a coxinha
and some of the juice.

00:05:07.332 --> 00:05:12.332
Oh nice, this is kaju,
kaju is the cashew fruit.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.759
That's the cashew fruit juice.

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:16.568
Oh man that's amazing.

00:05:16.568 --> 00:05:20.570
Just slightly fermented
case, very, very fruit,

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.425
very tropical.

00:05:22.425 --> 00:05:23.739
Not too sweet.

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:25.828
It's filling.

00:05:25.828 --> 00:05:28.730
It's so tasty, that's really good.

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:33.373
So good man.
- Yeah thanks, appreciate it.

00:05:33.373 --> 00:05:38.373
- This place is called
Sabor da Roca, Roca.

00:05:40.717 --> 00:05:41.550
- Sabor da Roca.
- Sabor da Roca.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.936
They're so cool.

00:05:42.936 --> 00:05:44.780
When you are here check
them out, come have a snack.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.340
That was tasty.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.437
- So in the favela we have
only one main street, that one.

00:05:49.437 --> 00:05:50.835
It's called (speaking Portuguese).

00:05:50.835 --> 00:05:55.360
For the majority of people
live in little alleys.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.160
We have a lot of alleys right here.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.910
It's the most, the most
dangerous thing that could happen

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.100
to you in the favela is to get lost.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.140
It's kind of a huge,
it's a kind of huge maze.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.770
- Most of the favelas, most
of the people live down

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.470
side alleys which are only
walking, only walking space

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.533
so we're just going down
a side alley right now.

00:06:13.533 --> 00:06:18.533
It's, what's amazing about a
favela is just the community

00:06:18.757 --> 00:06:20.256
and everybody knows each other so you,

00:06:20.256 --> 00:06:24.070
you know everyone that owns the shops,

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.930
you know you have friends
all over the place.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.410
And so there's a trust
factor of everybody that

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:31.300
knows each other.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.549
Little barbershops,
little convenient stores.

00:06:34.549 --> 00:06:37.561
Steep staircases.

00:06:37.561 --> 00:06:39.593
You can get your pet food.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.673
You can get your tvs fixed
and your appliances fixed.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:55.010
And all within a walking
only little very small alley

00:06:55.275 --> 00:06:58.830
with power cords running
right above your head.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.013
Look at the art too.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.773
These are like all the
people's everything mixed.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.370
- So guys now we're gonna,
I'm gonna have a surprise

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:13.203
for you.

00:07:13.203 --> 00:07:16.234
We're gonna visit a place
called Gate of Heaven.

00:07:16.234 --> 00:07:19.170
(speaking Portuguese)

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.368
- 88 years old (speaking Portuguese).

00:07:21.368 --> 00:07:23.868
(funky music)

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.810
You step out onto the top
of his house onto a patio

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.800
and it just overlooks
the entire valley Rocinha

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.290
all the way down into the
valley, all the way to the sea

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.500
with the mountains.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.690
It's like an amphitheater
and then you can see just

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.550
a massive rock face to the left hand side

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.360
and even more housing that goes up.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.910
If you look around at the
tops of the roofs you can see

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:52.200
most houses, all houses have
these big blue water tanks.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.090
There are services in this community.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.590
There's electricity, there's
internet, there's water

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.960
but it's sporadic right?

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.175
Sometimes it turns off,
sometimes it's not,

00:08:01.175 --> 00:08:03.925
sometimes it just doesn't work.

00:08:03.925 --> 00:08:06.526
So then people do store water.

00:08:06.526 --> 00:08:09.026
(funky music)

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.650
We're on our way now to go find some food.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:19.650
But then in the next favela
that we go we've also arranged

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:22.273
for some home cooking so
that's coming up as well.

00:08:22.273 --> 00:08:25.150
(food sizzling)

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:26.400
His name is Anderson.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.780
He's the chef here, he's an amazing cook.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.541
He's friendly, he's so cool.

00:08:30.541 --> 00:08:33.964
(speaking Portuguese)

00:08:33.964 --> 00:08:36.390
Let me just give you
a quick little tour of

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.223
this restaurant.

00:08:37.223 --> 00:08:39.200
He does all the cooking
right here and it's literally

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.750
like his home and then if
you come out the kitchen

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:46.413
you've got the little
bar counter right here

00:08:46.413 --> 00:08:49.340
with the drinks in it
and a little bit cold,

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.173
a little bit cold.

00:08:50.173 --> 00:08:53.820
And then you continue out
here, this is a little dining

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:54.653
room section.

00:08:54.653 --> 00:08:58.004
There's four tables set up
and then if you go up these

00:08:58.004 --> 00:09:02.648
steps right here this
is literally the alley.

00:09:02.648 --> 00:09:05.640
And it's an amazing little spot.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.630
He's so friendly, the aroma of those beans

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.300
and meat cooking just
like goes down the alley.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.070
I don't know how you
could not stop when you're

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:14.345
walking through here.

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:16.512
(chatter)

00:09:25.174 --> 00:09:27.380
- Would you prefer here the
balcony or on the table?

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.383
- Right, moving out.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:32.390
And they do have the indoor
section where you can sit

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.240
but he does have this is like the VIP,

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.970
this is the ultimate seating.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.650
Bar counter seating along the alley.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.460
He just sets the food
right in front of you.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.650
It's hot, it's fresh, it is
definitely cooked with love

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.070
and like the, it smells delicious.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.430
Try some of that beef first.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:47.403
That beef rib.

00:09:48.328 --> 00:09:49.711
Oh, it's beef rib right?

00:09:49.711 --> 00:09:50.718
- Yes.

00:09:50.718 --> 00:09:51.587
- It's so tender (speaks Portuguese).

00:09:52.904 --> 00:09:55.460
Look at that meat, the jiggliness of it.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.475
That's just like falling apart tender.

00:09:57.475 --> 00:09:59.975
(quiet music)

00:10:02.374 --> 00:10:03.985
Oh wow.

00:10:03.985 --> 00:10:08.652
Anderson, Anderson, (speaking Portuguese).

00:10:10.117 --> 00:10:11.650
Oh wow these ribs are amazing.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.740
Like they're so tender,
they just fall apart.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.390
That's just, it's
disintegrating in my tongue,

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.520
on my tongue right now (laughs).

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.610
Okay move into some of
those beans and rice.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:23.950
And there's a little bit
of like maybe like onions

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:25.267
in there.

00:10:25.267 --> 00:10:28.400
(funky drum beat)

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.966
I love how beans are so common
in Brazil, I love beans.

00:10:30.966 --> 00:10:34.550
They're hearty, they're
nutritious, they're just good.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.440
Also I'm gonna add in
a little bit of that,

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.407
that (speaking Spanish).
(funky drum beat)

00:10:45.896 --> 00:10:48.977
Mmm, mmm.
(funky music)

00:10:48.977 --> 00:10:53.977
The mix of starches but most
importantly that beef rib

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:58.527
is absolutely incredibly tasty.

00:10:58.527 --> 00:11:01.150
He did just bring us another
plate of meat which is like

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.352
beef maybe like sauteed in a pan.

00:11:03.352 --> 00:11:07.520
A little more like grizzly
texture to it but in a good

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.353
kind of way.

00:11:08.353 --> 00:11:11.098
Just like salty, flavorful beef.

00:11:11.098 --> 00:11:16.098
Gonna try some of that fatty, fatty piece.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.387
(chatter)

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.650
Like it's all good but that combination,

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:27.640
that beef rib, the tender
fattiness, will just melt

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.473
in your mouth.

00:11:28.473 --> 00:11:29.800
You guys gonna head down there?

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.980
How's the ribs man?

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.705
- Amazing, really good.

00:11:32.705 --> 00:11:33.538
- It's so good right?

00:11:33.538 --> 00:11:36.147
- Yeah.
(funky music)

00:11:36.147 --> 00:11:39.023
- Oh the beef man.
(funky music)

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.890
Followed by beans.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:50.834
Fantastic meal, I'm just
loving everything about this.

00:11:50.834 --> 00:11:53.472
(funky music)

00:11:53.472 --> 00:11:56.389
(speaking Spanish)

00:11:58.414 --> 00:12:03.176
(dog barking)
(chatter)

00:12:03.176 --> 00:12:06.400
From here we're walking back
down actually to the entrance

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.830
where we took a motorbike
up but first we're

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:08.763
gonna walk down.

00:12:09.867 --> 00:12:14.210
This is like underneath a
tree underneath a building

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.097
underneath the highway or the road

00:12:16.097 --> 00:12:19.360
and it's just a little
tunnel back here taking some

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.130
shortcuts I'm sure to get down.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:23.800
This goes for all of Rio De Janeiro

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.860
and all of Brazil but
the murals, the wall art,

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.970
the graffiti, it's spectacular
and it's so colorful.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.525
Definitely a faster route
than the road that has to

00:12:33.525 --> 00:12:37.010
go back and forth switchbacks
is just taking the staircase.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:42.010
(speaking Spanish)
(horns beeping)

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.370
Back out onto the main street.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.340
This is the main street of Rocinha.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.848
Sushi bar.
(engines rumbling)

00:12:48.848 --> 00:12:50.129
Yeah yeah yeah, no.

00:12:50.129 --> 00:12:55.070
Man these amphitheater views
with the rocks and stones

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:58.325
and mountains in the background wow.

00:12:58.325 --> 00:12:59.780
Oh and the sea.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.757
Just stopping in to buy some water.

00:13:01.757 --> 00:13:03.522
(speaking Portuguese)

00:13:03.522 --> 00:13:04.355
Awesome, awesome people.

00:13:04.355 --> 00:13:05.430
This is their store.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:09.150
It is just packed from
the roof to the pillars.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.865
Everything you could need.

00:13:10.865 --> 00:13:13.158
(speaking Portuguese)

00:13:13.158 --> 00:13:14.931
Have a great day.

00:13:14.931 --> 00:13:16.948
And we've just got some water.

00:13:16.948 --> 00:13:20.667
Thanks man.
(speaking Portuguese)

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.450
Here help.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:31.020
Tiny staircases leading to people's homes,

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:35.330
little walkways, little pathways,
little like tiny spaces.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.750
And then all at once you emerge
back onto the main street.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.390
And then as you get to
the base of the Rocinha,

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:42.613

mountain, the base of the,

00:13:42.613 --> 00:13:45.690

there's supermarkets, all
services you could imagine

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:50.963
are all down here.

00:13:50.963 --> 00:13:52.825
It was amazing to visit Rochina.

00:13:52.825 --> 00:13:56.627
Thanks so much to Guilherme
for showing us around.

00:13:56.627 --> 00:13:59.389
That was great.

Thank you.
(speaking Portuguese)

00:14:14.065 --> 00:14:16.930
We're on our way to another
favela which is kind of

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:17.910
across town.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:18.960

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.354

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:45.410
We made it to a downtown area
and from here we're gonna

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:48.340
jump into, it's called a
kombi, it's like an old

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.120
Volkswagen van.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.620
Which is gonna take us up
the hill to the favela.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:53.731
Oh yeah.

00:14:53.731 --> 00:14:56.564
(engine rumbling)

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.273
And we are off.
(funky music)

00:15:13.116 --> 00:15:14.080
Yeah.
(speaking Portuguese)

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.570
Okay, we've reached the end of the route.

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:17.663
Jump out here.

00:15:18.504 --> 00:15:20.602
Thanks man.
- No problem.

00:15:20.602 --> 00:15:23.102
(funky music)

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.730
- This is underneath an
abandoned or within an abandoned

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.100
railcar kind of cable car station.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.990
She is gonna be cooking for us.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:41.000
But she also maybe has
a bar called Bar Da Jura

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.570
and her name is Jura.

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:43.650
(chatter)

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:45.980
We're following Jura back to her house.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:49.000
So she owns that bar
underneath the abandoned

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.740
railway station, cable car station.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:52.656
Now we're going up to her house.

00:15:52.656 --> 00:15:57.656
(kids babbling)
(chatter)

00:15:57.696 --> 00:16:02.696
(speaking Portuguese)
(laughter)

00:16:04.465 --> 00:16:08.723
Check out the Brazil logo, awesome.

00:16:08.723 --> 00:16:11.697
I think we made it to the house.

00:16:11.697 --> 00:16:14.910
- Going upstairs to show her balcony.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:15.743
- Oh cool.

00:16:16.811 --> 00:16:19.330
- It's like a great view of the city.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.046
- Another room up here
on the second floor.

00:16:21.046 --> 00:16:23.963
(speaking Portuguese)

00:16:24.824 --> 00:16:27.003
You don't wanna fall down there.

00:16:27.003 --> 00:16:29.836
(funky drum beat)

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:39.240
The view from up here like
180 degrees fantastic.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.080
And again just the construction
of the houses just going

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.410
up the face of rocks, up
the face of the mountain.

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.963
And even, yeah this house
is four stories high just

00:16:49.963 --> 00:16:52.667
because it goes up, it's so steep.

00:16:52.667 --> 00:16:55.584
(speaking Portuguese)

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.930
Jura is gonna be making
a dish called feijoada

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:04.190
which is, it is considered
one of the national dishes

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.580
of Brazil.

00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:08.920
It's an ultimate dish, it's
an amazing hearty dish.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.500
And something I didn't know
before coming to Brazil

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.050
is that feijoada is a
dish that's typically

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:17.234
eaten on the weekend, Saturday
or Sunday because it's

00:17:17.234 --> 00:17:18.480
a heavy dish.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.867
It's a dish, it's one of those
dishes that you wanna eat

00:17:20.867 --> 00:17:23.690
and then take a nap after you eat it.

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.720
So best reserved for the
weekend as a family meal.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.131
She's gonna get started now.

00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:30.232
(speaking Portuguese)
Okay.

00:17:30.232 --> 00:17:31.065
(water splashing)

00:17:31.065 --> 00:17:33.250
This is a dish that includes very hearty,

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.838
it includes beans, but
much more beans go in.

00:17:36.838 --> 00:17:39.755
(speaking Portuguese)

00:17:47.263 --> 00:17:48.680
Oh, cumin.
- Is that cumin?

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.240
- Pork is a major, major part of feijoada

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:55.650
but not just meat, but
all pieces of the pig.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.700
She added in all the different parts.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.460
There's, you see some of the leg parts,

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.950
some of the hoof parts, some
of the probably the ears,

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:07.525
the everything.
(food sizzling)

00:18:07.525 --> 00:18:09.550
(speaking Portuguese)

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:12.959
So that bacon and then she
just added in some olive oil

00:18:12.959 --> 00:18:14.944
is gonna be for the farofa which is gonna

00:18:14.944 --> 00:18:18.210
add some casaba flour powder to it.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.205
That's one of the staples of Brazil.

00:18:20.205 --> 00:18:25.205
(speaking Portuguese)
(food sizzling)

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.685
And now she added in a whole
bag of the casaba flour powder,

00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:42.250
mixing that in, working it in.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.030
That is gonna be ultra flavorful.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:45.682
Farofa is ready.

00:18:45.682 --> 00:18:46.515
That smells delicious.

00:18:46.515 --> 00:18:49.150
She like just had to like
slowly stir it so it gets

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:51.810
a little golden color without burning.

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:55.962
Her incredible cooking
expertise, she's a master.

00:18:55.962 --> 00:18:57.383
(speaking Portuguese)
Awesome.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:02.527
(speaking Portuguese)

00:19:05.044 --> 00:19:06.638
Getting a taste test of the farofa.

00:19:06.638 --> 00:19:11.471
(chatter)
(food sizzling)

00:19:14.004 --> 00:19:16.198
Oh yeah, oh it is hot.

00:19:16.198 --> 00:19:20.640
It's crispy, it's so flavorful,

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.303
and that pork fat and the bacon.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.567
Another dish that she's
gonna be making is nhoque.

00:19:26.567 --> 00:19:28.094
It's called nhoque.
- Yeah nhoque.

00:19:28.094 --> 00:19:28.927
Gnocchi, shrimp gnocchi.

00:19:28.927 --> 00:19:32.030
- It's gnocchi with shrimp
which is one of her specialties.

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.755
Potato noodles.

00:19:33.755 --> 00:19:36.530
For the shrimp she mixed in garlic,

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:40.853
there's a little bit of cumin,
vinegar, and lime juice.

00:19:40.853 --> 00:19:43.770
(speaking Portuguese)

00:19:50.762 --> 00:19:54.800
(laughs)
(speaking Portuguese)

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.550
And then into the potato
went two eggs and some flour

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.920
and that's looking more
like a, like a dough.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.170
Okay for the feijoada pot she added in,

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.520
she took off the cover,
she added in the ribs

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.170
and the sausage.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:09.507
Put the cover back on,
now it's gonna cook more.

00:20:09.507 --> 00:20:11.920
This is some of the pork
crackling that she fried up.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.684
Marinated again in some
vinegar, a little bit of cumin

00:20:14.684 --> 00:20:16.383
and garlic.

00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:18.742
And she wants us to taste it.

00:20:18.742 --> 00:20:23.166
Oh, I bet you can hear that
crunch on the microphone.

00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:27.323
Wow.
(speaking Portuguese)

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.770
Oh it's so crispy.

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:34.110
The crispiness of that skin,
that fattiness of that meat,

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:37.633
the flavor.
(speaking Portuguese)

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.550
She just hooked us up with
a couple spoons of chili

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.890
directly onto the crispy pork.

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:56.093
What a brilliant idea.
(funky drum beat)

00:20:58.682 --> 00:21:00.690
Oh wow, a world class snack,

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.680
oh with that spicy vinegary sauce.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.250
Now she wants us to
taste it with the farofa,

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:08.051
like dinner has not even,
the meal has not even begun

00:21:08.051 --> 00:21:11.537
but we're just like snacking
on the different ingredients.

00:21:11.537 --> 00:21:15.729
She, she wants us to and there's
no way I can say no to it.

00:21:15.729 --> 00:21:18.562
(funky drum beat)

00:21:19.749 --> 00:21:22.938
Oh, that combination.

00:21:22.938 --> 00:21:27.938
Oh, Jura.
(speaking Portuguese)

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:32.440
The sun is going down
but she is still cooking.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.580
The aroma of the food is incredible.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.140
It should be ready pretty
soon but just take a moment

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.760
to appreciate, enjoy this view.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.920
An amazing city.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.620
The people we've come across
and the food we've had,

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.870
this is gonna be like one
of the greatest meals ever

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.083
in Brazil right now.

00:21:50.083 --> 00:21:52.916
(funky drum beat)

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:01.551
Finally she's squeezing
that potato batter through

00:22:01.551 --> 00:22:04.260
the press and chopping
it off to form the little

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.000
bit sized gnocchi little bits.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.930
I've eaten gnocchi many many
times, never seen it made.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.412
This is my first time.

00:22:11.412 --> 00:22:13.699
(speaking Portuguese)
- Garlic.

00:22:13.699 --> 00:22:18.592
- For the sauce for the gnocchi which is,

00:22:18.592 --> 00:22:21.330
it's gonna be a shrimp sauce
but she added in onions,

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:24.400
then in some tomatoes and green peppers,

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.605
then some tomato paste,
then some coconut milk,

00:22:26.605 --> 00:22:31.370
so it's really gonna
be Italian, Brazilian,

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:36.370
but Jura's own style.
(speaking Portuguese)

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:39.260
Then the shrimp goes into the
sauce, that's gonna be rich,

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.060
that's gonna be thick,
thickened with the coconut cream

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.358
and that's gonna be
eaten with the gnocchi.

00:22:44.358 --> 00:22:48.550
How much it comes from
her, how much she loves it.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:52.200
She even dances when she's
cooking, she is amazing,

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.313
an amazing lady.

00:22:57.562 --> 00:23:02.562
That is amazing.
(speaking Portuguese)

00:23:03.958 --> 00:23:06.208
(laughing)

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:12.773
Oh wow, she is taking
care of us like a mother.

00:23:12.773 --> 00:23:15.690
(speaking Portuguese)

00:23:19.666 --> 00:23:22.240
(laughing)

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.040
No idea what dance that is.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.330
- No she was like is everything fine?

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:33.330
(food sizzling)
(speaking Portuguese)

00:23:59.507 --> 00:24:01.299
- Oh wow.

00:24:01.299 --> 00:24:03.966
(food sizzling)

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:08.050
Then finally she also
sweats down some kale,

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:11.413
sweats down some garlic,
and some kale to go with

00:24:11.413 --> 00:24:13.202
the feijoada.

00:24:13.202 --> 00:24:15.270
In order to honor both the
dishes we're gonna begin only

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:17.570
with the gnocchi so that
we don't mix the two.

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:19.720
'Cause they're almost like
two full separate meals

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.980
she's prepared for us.

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.640
The gnocchi with the (speaking Portuguese).

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.666
That's her like signature
dish that she's known for.

00:24:26.666 --> 00:24:30.710
But then the feijoada,
she just knows how to cook

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:32.873
everything expertly.

00:24:39.842 --> 00:24:41.660
Oh that is stunning.

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.273
Like Brazilian, Italian, home cooking.

00:24:46.221 --> 00:24:47.913
You can taste the coconut milk in there.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.480
Taste the tomatoes and
peppers simmered down.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.700
The gnocchi just melts in your mouth.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.883
And then the little like mussel-y
shrimp insanely delicious.

00:25:00.161 --> 00:25:03.078
(speaking Portuguese)

00:25:04.363 --> 00:25:07.554
That is just marvelous
in every single way.

00:25:07.554 --> 00:25:10.387
(funky drum beat)

00:25:16.956 --> 00:25:19.206
That gnocchi, unbelievable.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.673
Finished my plate of
gnocchi before moving on

00:25:22.673 --> 00:25:24.006
to the feijoada.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.061
(speaking Portuguese)

00:25:28.061 --> 00:25:29.523
It's just incredible.

00:25:29.523 --> 00:25:34.523
(speaking Portuguese)
(funky music)

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:05.310
She just might be the coolest
lady in all of Brazil.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:08.320
Everything is falling off
the bone, it's that tender.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.290
All of the fat and then she
separates the meat with the

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:15.460
juices and the beans and
then she did a beautiful,

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.740
beautiful feijoada dance for us.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.850
Shaking, shaking the meat
and you could just see it

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:24.530
wiggling, oh wiggling meat.

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:27.100
That cannot get better than wiggling meat.

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.017
(speaking Portuguese)

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.780
There's nobody who could
make a better single plate

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.880
of the feijoada than Jura so we asked her

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.240
to make a plate.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.090
Added everything perfect
with a selection of all the

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:46.670
different pork, the ribs,
the ears, the, the feet,

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:51.430
the gelatin-y bits, all things
included with the beans,

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:53.200
with the rice, with the
kale, with the farofa,

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.700
with the pork crackling.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.320
Meal cooked form the heart.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.420
I gotta begin with these like,

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.110
I gotta begin with those beans.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:04.640
The gelatin in the, oh
man what is that little,

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.288
what is that little tube?

00:27:06.288 --> 00:27:08.788
(funky music)

00:27:13.664 --> 00:27:17.997
Oh wow, that is like the
most fall apart tender pig.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.990
The beans, the starchy beans,
the farofa which has that

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:27.653
like crunchy starchiness to it.

00:27:31.606 --> 00:27:35.290
The farofa is so good,
it's so like crispy.

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:38.607
It's like bread crumbs
almost, like a casaba.

00:27:38.607 --> 00:27:42.870
With that bacon, everything
tastes like bacon.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:43.820
Oh yes.

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.530
Moving on let's try
another piece of this pork.

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.740
You don't even need a knife, look at that.

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.290
These like bits of meat
just like look at this.

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:53.088
With some of the crispy pork
with some of the chilies with.

00:27:53.088 --> 00:27:55.734
Oh man, it's almost too good to be true.

00:27:55.734 --> 00:27:58.234
(funky music)

00:28:04.433 --> 00:28:06.060
It's unbelievable, and what's
amazing is also the different

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:09.359
parts of the pig because all
of them have different tastes,

00:28:09.359 --> 00:28:14.359
textures, all of them have
different like jelly-ness feels

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:16.613
to them.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:21.930
The, the fattiness content,
the porkiness, the beans.

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:23.802
The most beautiful plates.

00:28:23.802 --> 00:28:26.719
(speaking Portuguese)

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:30.164
That's a jelly fatty piece.

00:28:30.164 --> 00:28:32.664
(funky music)

00:28:36.998 --> 00:28:38.240
It's stunning.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:41.890
The only thing I might do.
(speaking Spanish)

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:44.770
I'm gonna re-juice, I'm gonna re-bean it.

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:49.490
And these beans are like
literally like liquid pork.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:52.197
Drench everything in bean
juice 'cause it's actually

00:28:52.197 --> 00:28:53.640
like a liquid pork.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.845
Oh, wow, that's unbelievable.

00:28:57.845 --> 00:29:00.762
(speaking Portuguese)

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:05.960
Dude, that is heavenly bean
juice 'cause all of those oils,

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.320
all of the collagen has
just come out of the pork

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.403
into the bean juice.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.560
Oh dude, like, I was like
biting down way harder

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.990
than I needed to.

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:19.507
I did not need to give it
that much effort (laughs).

00:29:21.658 --> 00:29:23.433
It just slides off the bone.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.487
We have say a massive
(speaking Portuguese) to the,

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:33.427
to the chefs Jura and Eliana.

00:29:36.301 --> 00:29:38.347
- How'd you like it?

00:29:38.347 --> 00:29:41.192
- It was just stunning beyond belief.

00:29:41.192 --> 00:29:44.109
(speaking Portuguese)

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:55.403
It's beyond like, this is
home cooking beyond belief.

00:29:56.430 --> 00:30:00.400
Like more comforting, more
comforting than you could

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.808
possibly imagine.

00:30:01.808 --> 00:30:06.475
(chatter)
(funky music)

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:09.880
That rib!
(funky music)

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.310
I am sweating from that feijoada.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:17.132
I am so happy, I am just
like that was a hearty,

00:30:17.132 --> 00:30:22.132
incredible meal where every
single bite was just cooked

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.830
with passion and love.

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:29.727
It was such a good meal
in such a beautiful place.

00:30:29.727 --> 00:30:34.727
I cannot even like, I just
thank you from the bottom

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:37.437
of my heart to Jura and
Eliana for cooking that

00:30:37.437 --> 00:30:41.390
incredible home cooked meal here.

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:44.180
That was just spectacular.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:47.490
And so we have come to
the end of the this favela

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.930
food tour of Rio De Janeiro.

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:52.400
And I mean it was just one
day, it was just a taste

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.400
of the, the life in the favela.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.572
And learning about the favelas of Rio.

00:30:56.572 --> 00:31:01.330
But again favelas, they
don't get a good reputation

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:05.360
and they, I mean they definitely
are the center of where

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.740
a lot of crime takes place
and where a lot of organized

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.560
crime happens in Rio, in Brazil.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.511
But that is by not even
close to the majority of

00:31:13.511 --> 00:31:16.950
the people that live in the favelas,

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:18.840
that call the favelas home.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:23.060
I'm happy that we were able
to show a positive side.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:26.740
People making a difference
and this is an experience

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:27.947
that I'll remember for the rest of my life

00:31:27.947 --> 00:31:30.350
and it was a privilege
to have a chance to visit

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.770
both of these favelas today.

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:33.700
I don't even know if I can
make it out of this favela

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.043
though after that meal.

00:31:35.043 --> 00:31:37.210
I might need to spend the night here.
