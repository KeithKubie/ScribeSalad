For most cats, catnip is like crack.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.779
But what is it that makes them go so crazy?

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.349
And is it JUST cats who are affected by it?

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:17.990
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and those
of you out there who own cats have probably,

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.900
at some point, gone to the pet store and purchased
catnip.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.140
They love it, right?

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.600
At the time, you probably didn’t give it
much thought - but realize that every time

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.679
you give your cat catnip, you’re actually
dosing them with a psychoactive drug.

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.560
It’s like weed for cats, basically.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.880
So how does it work?

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.631
And why do cats go SO crazy for it?

00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:38.219
Well, the proper name for catnip is Nepeta
cataria.

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.310
It’s part of the mint family, but it’s
special - because the entire plant is coated

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.559
in these tiny microscopic bulbs that contain
a chemical called nepetalactone, which gets

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.809
released whenever those bulbs rupture.

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.609
And that chemical is what draws cats to the
plant.

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.879
When they inhale it, it binds to the receptors
in their nose, and stimulates neurons that

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.289
lead to their brain, altering several key
areas - including the hypothalamus, which

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.350
is the part of the brain that regulates emotions.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.430
Essentially, it triggers a reaction that makes
cats feel intoxicated and euphoric.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.640
Similar to how humans feel when they take
certain drugs.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.630
The key difference though, is that all humans
respond differently to various drugs - whereas

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.470
cats have a very predictable and consistent
response to catnip.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.350
When they smell it, they all react pretty
much the same way.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.030
That said, there is a subset of the feline
population that appears to be immune to the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.100
effects of catnip.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.650
It’s estimated that around 20-30% of cats
don’t react to it at all, but the ones who

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.200
do - react the same.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.520
There’s basically no in-between.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.950
So it’s theorized that this is some kind
of genetic trait that gets passed down.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.351
Which makes sense, since a lot of wild cat
breeds - like lions and tigers - are also

00:01:44.351 --> 00:01:45.800
affected by it.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.200
But what about humans?

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.581
Can we feel the effects of catnip?

00:01:48.581 --> 00:01:53.760
Well, believe it or not - humans have been
using catnip off and on for the past 400 years.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.960
In the 1600s, Europeans brewed tea with it,
made juice out of it, and even smoked or chewed

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.740
it - claiming that it produced a mild sedative
effect.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.820
It was also believed to be a cure for colic
in babies, for a short time.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.040
As recently as the 1960s, some people even
used it as a substitute for marijuana, saying

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.570
that it caused hallucinations and euphoria
- although scientists eventually debunked

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.570
that.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.390
Their hypothesis was that it can’t affect
us as intensely as it does cats, because our

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.820
brains and olfactory systems - what we use
to smell - are structured very differently.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.930
But that doesn’t mean catnip doesn’t have
ANY benefits for humans.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.230
Also in the 1960s, researchers WERE able to
find one clear-cut use of it: as a mosquito

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.230
repellent.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.720
Apparently, the active chemical in catnip
also works as a natural repellent to mosquitos,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.360
and is actually MORE effective than DEET.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.140
The only problem is, it wears off much more
quickly.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.480
Still, you can totally find supplements online
that contain catnip essence, as well as others.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.700
So if you’re one of those people who doesn’t
like using harsh chemicals - then you may

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.010
wanna give it a try.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.140
What do you guys think?

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.650
Especially those of you with cats - are they
down with ‘nip, or do they not care at all?

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.129
