00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's one way to define it.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.754
We'll call the inputs a and b,

00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:08.000
and all we need to do is produce a string concatenating them all.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.769
We can do that with one return statement.

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.000
We're going to put a + b + b + a as the result.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.738
Now let's check that it works, passing in a and b.

00:00:20.738 --> 00:00:23.000
We run, and we get the result 'abba'.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We can try the other example, passing in 'dog' and 'cat'.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and now we get 'dogcatcatdog'.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So far all of the procedures we've defined have been pretty simple.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.500
They've only required 1 line, maybe 2 lines of code.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.000
For the final quiz of this section, we're going to ask a much more challenging question.
