00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.540
you

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:06.550
 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.150
I would take anyone into the laboratory

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.160
I would take anyone into the laboratory
 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.040
I would take anyone into the laboratory
that was accepted by the department

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.050
that was accepted by the department
 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.299
that was accepted by the department
because it's a pretty good department

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:12.309
because it's a pretty good department
 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:13.560
because it's a pretty good department
and the quality standards were pretty

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:13.570
and the quality standards were pretty
 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.790
and the quality standards were pretty
high and I don't think that the criteria

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800
high and I don't think that the criteria
 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.400
high and I don't think that the criteria
we have for you know judging students

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410
we have for you know judging students
 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.499
we have for you know judging students
prior to them getting into the

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509
prior to them getting into the
 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.060
prior to them getting into the
laboratory and doing science are very

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070
laboratory and doing science are very
 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.650
laboratory and doing science are very
good so you know it's a matter of giving

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660
good so you know it's a matter of giving
 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.850
good so you know it's a matter of giving
people a chance to see what they can do

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860
people a chance to see what they can do
 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.849
people a chance to see what they can do
and you know in my experience about half

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:38.859
and you know in my experience about half
 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:42.689
and you know in my experience about half
of them are cut out to be scientists and

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699
of them are cut out to be scientists and
 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:45.090
of them are cut out to be scientists and
you know about half of them aren't is

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100
you know about half of them aren't is
 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.259
you know about half of them aren't is
there anything in particular that

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269
there anything in particular that
 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:48.119
there anything in particular that
distinguishes early on those that are

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129
distinguishes early on those that are
 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.560
distinguishes early on those that are
cut out for it well it's I think it's a

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570
cut out for it well it's I think it's a
 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.369
cut out for it well it's I think it's a
couple of things it's it's a strong

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379
couple of things it's it's a strong
 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.599
couple of things it's it's a strong
sense of determination and commitment

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609
sense of determination and commitment
 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.790
sense of determination and commitment
and it's also an ability to think for

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800
and it's also an ability to think for
 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.910
and it's also an ability to think for
themselves and those are and and then

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920
themselves and those are and and then
 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.430
themselves and those are and and then
there's a for laboratory science a

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440
there's a for laboratory science a
 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.740
there's a for laboratory science a
factor of you know what people call good

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750
factor of you know what people call good
 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.020
factor of you know what people call good
hands where you can make things work or

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030
hands where you can make things work or
 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.760
hands where you can make things work or
you can't and nobody really quite knows

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770
you can't and nobody really quite knows
 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.600
you can't and nobody really quite knows
what that is

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610
what that is
 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.390
what that is
but those three things are are pretty

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400
but those three things are are pretty
 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.140
but those three things are are pretty
critical and the the sense of

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150
critical and the the sense of
 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.050
critical and the the sense of
self-confidence that's needed to make

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060
self-confidence that's needed to make
 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.590
self-confidence that's needed to make
your own judgments and you know even to

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600
your own judgments and you know even to
 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.080
your own judgments and you know even to
argue with your mentor about you know

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090
argue with your mentor about you know
 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.700
argue with your mentor about you know
whether something's important or

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710
whether something's important or
 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.730
whether something's important or
meaningful or you know an experiment

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740
meaningful or you know an experiment
 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.490
meaningful or you know an experiment
worth doing those are very good signs

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500
worth doing those are very good signs
 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.650
worth doing those are very good signs
when a student's willing to argue with

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660
when a student's willing to argue with
 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.780
when a student's willing to argue with
you and you know whereas primarily in in

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790
you and you know whereas primarily in in
 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.620
you and you know whereas primarily in in
in undergraduates we just judge

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
in undergraduates we just judge
 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.060
in undergraduates we just judge
intellectual abilities by whether they

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070
intellectual abilities by whether they
 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.760
intellectual abilities by whether they
pass test or not and and I didn't even

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770
pass test or not and and I didn't even
 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.470
pass test or not and and I didn't even
mention that I'm sure that's that's an

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480
mention that I'm sure that's that's an
 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.150
mention that I'm sure that's that's an
element as well but these other three

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160
element as well but these other three
 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.470
element as well but these other three
things are really important in

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480
things are really important in
 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.410
things are really important in
laboratory science
