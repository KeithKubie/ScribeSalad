00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.637
- He could not allow
himself to be the first

00:00:02.637 --> 00:00:04.977
American president to have lost a war.

00:00:04.977 --> 00:00:07.756
And so, so he could know

00:00:07.756 --> 00:00:09.690
that this isn't going well.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.760
He could know that these

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.790
generals who've given him a certain

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.495
optimistic read have given him

00:00:16.495 --> 00:00:19.321
optimistic reads before that aren't true.

00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:21.940
And he could have the political instincts

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.149
to understand how this
war is playing negatively

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:28.738
in the country but he was trapped.

00:00:28.738 --> 00:00:32.140
He was trapped in that spot

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.592
that he didn't want in history

00:00:33.592 --> 00:00:36.780
as the first president
who would lose a war.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.060
So his continued commitment to it was

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.550
always not so much a commitment to win,

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.325
but a commitment to punish,

00:00:48.325 --> 00:00:51.540
through the art of war,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.410
to punish the North Vietnamese

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.130
to the point where they
would negotiate some kind

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.295
of thing that Lyndon Johnson could say was

00:00:59.295 --> 00:01:01.750
not defeat for the United States.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.070
And then he ended up
being followed by Nixon

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.581
who was guided by the same principle,

00:01:06.581 --> 00:01:08.881
couldn't be the first
president to lose a war.
