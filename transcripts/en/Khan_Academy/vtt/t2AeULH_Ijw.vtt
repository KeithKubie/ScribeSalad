00:00:00.523 --> 00:00:02.869
Let's revisit the island
or the universe that

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:07.273
only has a farmer and a builder in it.

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:09.333
Let's think about a different scenario.

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.140
Let's think about a
scenario where they each

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.353
start off with a lot of physical currency.

00:00:13.353 --> 00:00:14.998
We're in a universe that's
starts off with much

00:00:14.998 --> 00:00:16.736
more physical currency
than the last example.

00:00:16.736 --> 00:00:19.141
Where the universe had only 4 gold coins.

00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:21.935
Let's say that the farmer
right over here starts

00:00:21.935 --> 00:00:24.190
off with ... and I'll right down
the number instead of drawing

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.066
the coins. Actually let
me draw the coins, that's

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.799
kind of fun. Let's say
he starts off with 5

00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:33.689
gold coins, and the builder
also starts off with

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:35.535
5 gold coins.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.067
Entering into this year,
the farmer is feeling

00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:41.190
pretty pessimistic. He
goes to the builder.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.796
He tells builder look I
just want the base level

00:00:44.796 --> 00:00:47.334
of construction or maintenance or whatever

00:00:47.334 --> 00:00:49.933
going on in my farm
today. I can only afford

00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:54.195
1 coin of business from
you, or what you can do

00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:57.418
for 1 coin. He gives
that coin to the builder.

00:00:57.418 --> 00:00:59.400
The builders feeling pretty pessimistic.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.424
Normally the farmer
starts off the year much

00:01:01.424 --> 00:01:03.266
better than that. He says
that this clearly going

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:07.268
to be a bad year. I'm
only going to buy my base

00:01:07.268 --> 00:01:08.932
necessities for food.

00:01:08.932 --> 00:01:11.338
He goes to the farmer
and says look even though

00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:12.679
I have ... he's not
going to tell the farmer

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:14.264
that he's hoarding all of his cash.

00:01:14.264 --> 00:01:16.601
He's going to say look
farmer, things are bad,

00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:18.800
business is bad, I'm
preparing for the worse.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.427
Just give me the base
minimum, cheapest, simplest,

00:01:21.427 --> 00:01:23.530
food you can that'll keep me alive.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.064
So, he only gives 1
coin back to the farmer.

00:01:27.064 --> 00:01:30.598
Imagine that the money
supply actually increases.

00:01:30.598 --> 00:01:32.532
For whatever reason the
farmer digs around in

00:01:32.532 --> 00:01:34.682
his backyard and finds some more gold.

00:01:34.682 --> 00:01:37.006
Then the builder, also,
while building a building

00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:40.530
actually discovers a
huge chest of gold right

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.059
over here. Their still
feeling pretty pessimistic.

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:45.096
Maybe their just pessimistic people.

00:01:45.096 --> 00:01:47.764
The farmer despite this
increase in the money

00:01:47.764 --> 00:01:49.536
supply, this gold that he discovers.

00:01:49.536 --> 00:01:52.138
He's like how frequently
am I going to discover

00:01:52.138 --> 00:01:54.599
gold like that. That
was just a one off thing

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:56.867
a bonanza that I just
happened to run into.

00:01:56.867 --> 00:02:01.021
The business itself is
pretty bad. It was even

00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:03.521
worse last year then it normally is.

00:02:03.521 --> 00:02:05.274
I'm going to spend as little as possible.

00:02:05.274 --> 00:02:07.205
I'm going to go to the
builder, and I'm going

00:02:07.205 --> 00:02:09.735
to say look things seem
to only be getting worse.

00:02:09.735 --> 00:02:14.267
I can only afford half
a coin worth of what

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:17.685
you have to offer, before
this base maintenance.

00:02:17.685 --> 00:02:19.799
The builders thinking
gee. That's even worse

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.796
than last year, but I have
all this extra capacity

00:02:22.796 --> 00:02:25.262
I could be building so
much more. I have people

00:02:25.262 --> 00:02:28.662
who aren't working. Sure, I'll take it.

00:02:28.662 --> 00:02:30.468
I'll take your half coin,
and I'll deliver that

00:02:30.468 --> 00:02:34.803
same service for that half of a coin.

00:02:34.803 --> 00:02:38.202
He does it, and essentially,
his price had gone

00:02:38.202 --> 00:02:41.135
down despite the fact
there's more currency.

00:02:41.135 --> 00:02:43.199
The builder, even though
he dug around and found

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:44.941
all this gold, he's feeling even worse.

00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:46.861
The price of what he's
offering has gone down.

00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:49.199
He's got even less revenue
in total in absolute

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:51.864
gold coins now. When
he goes to the farmer.

00:02:51.864 --> 00:02:54.796
he's like, I have to buy that base level

00:02:54.796 --> 00:02:56.065
food. Otherwise, my
family's going to starve.

00:02:56.065 --> 00:02:58.465
Business is worse than
ever. I'm so pessimistic.

00:02:58.465 --> 00:03:00.198
He doesn't even tell the farmer that he

00:03:00.198 --> 00:03:01.534
discovered all of this. That he's hoarding

00:03:01.534 --> 00:03:04.359
all of this. So, he's
say farmer, i can just

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.469
afford half a coin worth of stuff.

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:10.265
The farmer says well I guess so, since the

00:03:10.265 --> 00:03:12.272
building prices have
gone down, and I can buy

00:03:12.272 --> 00:03:14.731
more with that half of
coin. I have all this

00:03:14.731 --> 00:03:17.199
surplus labor, and surplus
capacity on my farm.

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:21.130
Sure, I will take a half
of coin for the same

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.865
thing last year I took a full coin for.

00:03:23.865 --> 00:03:26.466
You see the situation where
deflation is occurring

00:03:26.466 --> 00:03:29.202
even though the money supply has increase.

00:03:29.202 --> 00:03:30.864
Of course, I'm exaggerating things.

00:03:30.864 --> 00:03:32.611
In normally if you have
this large of bonanza,

00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:34.693
and the money supply,
people would start to get

00:03:34.693 --> 00:03:36.361
optimistic and would start to spend money.

00:03:36.361 --> 00:03:38.135
It would probably lead to deflation.

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:40.671
The main point here is
to realize that it isn't

00:03:40.671 --> 00:03:42.996
just driven by the
absolute quantity of the

00:03:42.996 --> 00:03:45.861
currency. That's important,
but just as important

00:03:45.861 --> 00:03:48.800
are confidence and what confidence drives,

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.203
and that's specifically
the velocity of money.

00:03:51.203 --> 00:03:53.205
The transactions of money. The higher the

00:03:53.205 --> 00:03:57.695
velocity ... or quantity
matters. But quantity

00:03:57.695 --> 00:04:03.287
times velocity what really
drives the level of prices.
