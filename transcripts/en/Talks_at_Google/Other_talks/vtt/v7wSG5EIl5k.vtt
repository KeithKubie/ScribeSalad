00:00:00.461 --> 00:00:03.688
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:03.688 --> 00:00:05.220
DAVID EWALT: Thank you
all for having me.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.810
My name is David Ewalt.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.700
I am a writer, I am a gamer,
and I am a level-15 cleric.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.995
That's usually a line I actually
like giving to people

00:00:13.995 --> 00:00:15.690
who aren't big gamers.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.810
But I'm assuming being here at
Google that there are more

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.250
than a few gamers in this
audience and more than a few

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.620
D&amp;D people.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.340
So technically, I'm a level-16
character, a level-15 cleric,

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.910
and level-1 psionic warrior.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.520
I see the glimpses of
recognition in the audience.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.100
You're my people.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.530
You're the ones I'm going
to be talking to today.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.250
So I wrote this book about
"Dungeons &amp; Dragons" because I

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.250
played "D&amp;D" and other
role-playing games a lot when

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.230
I was a kid.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.680
And the game was really
important to me for a number

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.230
of reasons.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.440
One was just because it was so
much fun, but also because it

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.380
was the way that I met
some of my very best

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.610
friends in the world.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.520
If you've never played the
game, it's social.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.200
You're sitting down at a table
with other people and looking

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.470
at them, and telling
a story together.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.140
So you tend to make friendships
during the game

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.100
that last a long time.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.560
So the game was really
important to me.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.050
I grew up, I kind of
stopped playing it

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.870
when I went to college.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.140
But then I realized
this game was

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.190
something really important.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.490
I started writing about
technology and about games.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.730
And when I would go meet people
in the video game

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.030
industry, I would talk to
designers and to executives of

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.830
game companies.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.770
And I would say to them, so
what made you want to make

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.190
video games for a living?

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.000
And over and over and over
again, the answer they would

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.646
give me was, "Well, you know, I
played a lot of 'Dungeons &amp;

00:01:33.646 --> 00:01:35.920
Dragons' when I was a kid."

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.310
So that made me start thinking,
there's more to this

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.370
game than just the fun weekends
I had with my

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.250
friends, in my friend Mike's
basement, that kind of thing.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.690
And so I started to delve into
it further and figure out the

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.910
history of it, where
the game came

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.130
from, why it's so important.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.540
Why it influenced our culture,
why it influenced our

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.330
industry, and just why it's so
pervasive in the 21st century.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.050
So what I want to do here is I
want to share a little bit of

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.440
that history with you.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.130
We're going to do sort of the
fast, very beginnings, just

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.960
like where "D&amp;D" came from.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.630
But I want to save a lot of
time for questions, both

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.860
because I know you might have
some, but also because one of

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.450
the fun things about this
game is sharing

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.900
stories with people.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.790
So I'd love to know, if you want
to come up and talk about

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.960
one of your favorite campaigns,
or particular

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.040
things that you got out of the
game, what you feel like the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.280
benefits of playing "D&amp;D" or
other role-playing games were,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.960
I'd love to talk about
that kind of stuff.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.940
So the kind of 60-second
ancestry, before I get to

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.730
reading a little bit of the
book, is that role-playing

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.700
games like "Dungeons &amp; Dragons."
I kind of trace

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.240
their origins all the
way back to chess.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.620
Which if you think about it,
is really a war game.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.700
It's an abstract simulation
of a famous

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.300
battle from Indian history.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.080
You've got the knights,
you've got the king,

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.410
you've got the pawns--

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.790
and that was first sort of
represented as war on a board.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.380
And these little figures were
kind of teaching concepts of

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.980
war, and even more importantly,

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.420
little bits of strategy.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.105
Like the real idea was not just
to go in and kill all the

00:03:13.105 --> 00:03:16.190
other pieces, but to dominate
the space, to dominate the

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.490
board, and sort of be in control
of the battlefield.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.940
Because it was designed to
sort of have that martial

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.360
intent, the game remained
popular, especially among

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.670
people in the military.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.680
And over the centuries,
chess sort of evolved.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.510
It got more complex.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.530
People added more
squares to it.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.770
At one point, there was
versions of chess that

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.510
literally had thousands of
squares on the board, and

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.640
sometimes hundreds of pieces.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.395
As technology advanced, the
people playing the game would

00:03:46.395 --> 00:03:47.100
add in new stuff.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.720
Suddenly there would
be infantrymen.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.580
There would be halberdiers.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.110
There would be cannons.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.250
And then the board with the
little squares kind of went

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.020
away, and you started to see,
really, war games for the sake

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.870
of war, where here we've got
terrain, where there's islands

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.210
and there's rivers and there's
hills, and even sculpted sand

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.410
tables sometimes, where you'd
have little figures.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.450
It's the kind of stuff you see
in war movies, when General

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.970
Patton's got his stick
and he's pushing a

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.470
tank across the board.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.730
Those war games were
an evolution

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.240
from things like chess.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.320
In the early 20th century, the
war games kind of became

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.640
popularized when HG Wells--

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.230
who you probably know as a
science-fiction author--

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.040
he developed a mainstream
version of these big

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.100
complicated work games
called Little Wars.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.500
And the idea was that you
could take your own toy

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.070
soldiers, if you were a kid,
and use these very simple

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.560
rules to play out a war game.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.800
It was very popular in the UK
and across Europe and started

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.870
to spill over to the US,
especially after World War II,

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.520
where a lot of veterans from
the wars came back to the

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.460
United States, brought some
of these games with them.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.270
And sort of, I think, to a
little extent, wanted to

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.510
relive some of the thrill of
being on the battlefield and

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.210
sort of reminisce with each
other, and use the game as an

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.340
excuse to, let's sit around a
table, let's talk about these

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.675
battles and sort of relive
some of these days.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.020
So around this community of
gamers, there started to be

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.160
gaming groups all over
the country.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.960
And one of the largest gaming
groups the country was the

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.330
Midwest Military Simulation
Association, based in

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.880
Minneapolis-Saint Paul.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.210
And that's where we're going to
start the history itself of

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.068
"Dungeons &amp; Dragons."

00:05:33.068 --> 00:05:35.940
The Midwest Military Simulation
Association was

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.200
founded in 1964 by a small group
of amateur historians,

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.450
miniature modelers,
and gamers.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.410
They grew quickly as war games
became more popular.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.800
Before long, the meetings were
crowded and increasingly

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.210
contentious, as the problem
of bickering over

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.320
rules reared its head.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.200
Now this is something that comes
up again in role-playing

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.840
games, but also in war games.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.800
I went to a convention out in
Pennsylvania a couple years

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.330
ago where people were playing
these big war games.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.350
And we played for like six
hours, a single battle, where

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.860
we were playing Napoleonic
miniatures, and I was one of

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.355
the members of the
Prussian army.

00:06:10.355 --> 00:06:13.580
That six hours, I think probably
four hours of it was

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.990
arguing over rules and
historical arcana, and the

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.330
rest of it was actually
rolling dice

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.160
and playing the game.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.710
The solution these gamers found
was in the form of an

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.300
80-year-old Army training
manual, "Strategos: A Series

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.790
of American Games of War,"
published in 1880 by Charles

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.930
AL Totten, a lieutenant
in the Fourth

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.080
United States Artillery.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.810
Dave Wesely, an undergraduate
physics student at Saint

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.440
Paul's Hamline University,
unearthed the book in the

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.220
University of Minnesota library
and rediscovered the

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.550
centuries-old idea of an
all-powerful referee--

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.860
someone to sort of watch over
the game and look at it and

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.750
say, you know what?

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.390
You've got it wrong.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.090
He's got it right.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.030
We're going to do
what he said.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.600
Or even to say, you both
have it wrong.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.620
This is how we're going to
resolve whether or not that

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.550
cannon just blew up your
entire infantry line.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.480
By 1967, the association had
about 60 members and had grown

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.430
so big that it fractured.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.600
Wesely and the rest of the
young war-gamer crowd

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.910
coalesced around the home of
David Arneson, a University of

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.540
Minnesota student.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.990
They'd meet several times a week
to play out traditional

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.050
Kriegspiel-style Napoleonic
battles and board games,

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.950
including Avalon Hill's
"Gettysburg," Parker Brothers'

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.800
war game "Conflict," Milton
Bradley's Cold War simulator

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.280
"Summit," and a French game
known in the US as "Risk."

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.860
In the fall, Wesely left the
Twin Cities to attend graduate

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.510
school in Kansas.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.660
Away from his gaming friends,
he had months to plan

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.290
something memorable for his
return home over winter break.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.420
What he came up with was
the first modern

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.700
role-playing game.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.410
The scenario was set during
the Napoleonic Wars in the

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.820
fictional town of Braunstein,
Germany, surrounded by

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.100
opposing armies.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.740
But Wesely didn't put the
armies on the board.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.990
Instead, he assigned each player
a unique character to

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.370
control within the scenario.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:01.840
Some players controlled
military

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.580
officers visiting town.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.430
Others took non-military roles,
like the town's mayor,

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.860
school chancellor, or banker.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.310
Wesely then gave each player
their own unique objective,

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.970
forcing them to consider
motivations for their actions

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:18.500
and to think beyond battlefield
strategy.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.090
The game quickly spun
out of control.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.870
Players wanted to do things
Wesely hadn't planned for,

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.540
like duel each other,
so he had to make up

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.070
rules on the spot.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.770
They also wandered away from the
table in small groups to

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.669
hold secret negotiations,
which if you're the

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:36.179
all-powerful referee trying to
run this game, people leaving

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:38.809
and not telling you what's going
on, that does not make

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:40.360
your game work.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.520
So Wesely returned to
school thinking that

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.600
the game had flopped.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.740
But the players felt
otherwise.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.920
Before long, they were begging
Wesely for another Braunstein.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.950
He obliged by designing new
scenarios, like the one set in

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.020
1919 amid the Russian
Civil War.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.760
Another explored a Latin
American dictatorship through

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.010
the eyes of student
revolutionaries.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.020
These innovations--

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.390
using a referee, assigning
players, individual

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.790
characters, each who has their
own unique objective, giving

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.280
each person the freedom
to do what they want--

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.120
these lit a fire in the Twin
Cities gaming community.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.640
The Braunstein role-playing
adventures appealed to players

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.210
who were tired of long,
complicated war reenactments

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.240
and got them thinking
about where games

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.790
could go from here.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:36.110
So it wasn't long before other
started to follow his example.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.220
David Arneson was born
in 1947 and grew up

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.850
in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:43.410
When he was a teenager, his
parents bought him a copy of

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.470
Avalon Hill's "Gettysburg,"
and he got hooked.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.880
Later, he moved on to the
hardcore stuff, including

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.500
Civil War simulations and
Napoleonic naval battles.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.610
Upon enrolling at the University
of Minnesota to

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.730
study history, he joined the
Midwest Military Simulation

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:01.180
Association to further indulge
the habit, and his basement

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.450
game room, which was just a
small space within a big

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:08.360
Ping-Pong table in the middle,
became the home base for this

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.120
war-gaming crowd.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.170
So seated on a cushy couch
"throne" at the head of that

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.730
Ping-Pong table, Arneson began
making his own refinements to

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.860
traditional war game rules--

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.060
mostly by breaking them.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.180
During one battle said amid the
Roman conquest of Britain,

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.801
he got bored and decided
to spice things up.

00:10:27.801 --> 00:10:32.720
"I'd given the defending
brigands a druid high priest,"

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.820
Arneson explained in
a 1983 interview.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.010
"In the middle of the battle,
the dull battle, when the

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.760
Roman war elephant charged the
Britons and looked like he was

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.000
going to trample half their army
flat, the druidic high

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.410
priest waved his hands and
pointed this funny little box

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:52.470
out of one hand and turned the
elephant into so much barbecue

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:56.430
meat." Arneson removed the war
elephant from the game,

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.630
explaining that the druid had
killed it with a "Star

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.750
Trek"-style phaser gun.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.470
"That was absolutely the only
thing in the game that was out

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.470
of the ordinary, but
the players weren't

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.400
expecting it," he said.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.670
The players were nonplussed--

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.170
saved for the delighted
commander

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.480
of the British druid.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.810
But Arneson wasn't put off
from sneaking elements of

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.960
fantasy into his games.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.310
In December 1970, after a
two-day binge of watching

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.860
monster movies and reading
Robert H. Howard's "Conan the

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.340
Barbarian" books, Arneson
invited his friends over under

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.100
the pretense of playing
a traditional

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.930
Napoleonic war game.

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:37.760
Instead, he introduced them
to the city of Blackmoor.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.640
"They came down to the basement
and there was a

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.670
medieval castle in the middle
of the table," says Wesely's

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.630
friend David Megarry.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:48.780
"And then Arneson says, 'We're
going to do this instead.'"

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.610
The players, Arneson told them,
had been sent through

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:55.420
time and space to a medieval
city and had to control

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.090
original heroic characters,
each with their own

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.910
attributes, powers, and goals.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.830
"My very first character was a
thief," says Megarry, "and my

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:07.160
nemesis was Dan Nicholson,
the merchant.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.520
His role was to try to get stuff
into town and then sell

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.360
it, and my role was to try to
steal his stuff and make my

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.750
money that way.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:18.820
It gave us a framework of how
to operate in this world."

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.500
Characters in place, Arneson
sent the players to explore

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.990
the dungeons beneath
the castle in town.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.470
Inside, he hit them with
another twist--

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.410
the subterranean passages
weren't defended by human

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:34.400
soldiers but inhabited by
fantastic monsters, like a

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.170
dragon, which Arneson
represented on the table using

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:41.635
a plastic toy brontosaurus
with a fanged clay head.

00:12:41.635 --> 00:12:45.890
The fantasy role-playing
game was born here.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.020
At first, combat in the world
of "Blackmoor" was resolved

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:53.520
using a clunky system of "Rock
Paper, and Scissors." But

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.050
Arneson quickly to turned to
the rules of a medieval

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.430
miniature war game called
"Chainmail," paying particular

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:03.140
interest to two sections of
its 62-page booklet--

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:06.150
"Man to Man," which explained
how to manage individual

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:10.030
heroes amongst your army, and
the fantasy supplement, which

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.890
included rules for casting
magical spells and for

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:15.620
fighting hideous monsters.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.780
"Chainmail" provided a
framework that helped

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.070
"Blackmoor" develop from a
novelty into a consistent

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.640
ongoing game.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.550
But ultimately, the system
proved too limited for

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.820
Arneson's growing
fantasy world.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.880
He began adding his
own innovations--

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.620
rules for fighting in different
types of armor,

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.840
lists of magical artifacts, and
provisions for improving a

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.230
character over time.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.250
Like any other passionate
hobbyist, Arneson was excited

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.240
to show off his work
with others.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.160
So he decided to show
off "Blackmoor" to

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.790
"Chainmail's" author.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:54.410
Ernest Gary Gygax grew
up playing games.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:58.630
Born in Chicago in 1938, he knew
pinochle by age five and

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.620
chess by six.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.710
His grandfather would challenge
him to matches,

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.770
checkmate him, start the game
over at the point where Gary

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.580
had made his biggest mistake,
and then repeat the process

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.940
until the boy's play
was perfect.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.220
When he was eight, the family
moved out of the city, in part

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.670
because Gary had been involved
in a 40-kid rumble, to the

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:21.250
quiet resort town of Lake
Geneva, Wisconsin.

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.560
Gary passed his time there
playing board games and cards.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.950
At ten, he discovered Avalon
Hill's "Gettysburg." "That

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:31.840
sealed my fate,"
he later wrote.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.170
"For thereafter, I was a
war-gamer." As an adolescent,

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.800
he got hooked on military
miniatures battles and built

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.070
his own sand table.

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:42.740
He also loved fantasy.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:46.180
When Gygax was a boy, his
father, a Swiss immigrant, put

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:50.140
him to bed every night with
tales of wizards and warriors.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.090
He picked up "The Brothers
Grimm" as soon as he could

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:56.200
read, mastered Poe before he
was 10, and devoured the

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.770
amazing stories in pulp
magazines like "Weird Tales,

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:03.740
"Argosy," and "Blue Book." Gygax
found a favorite in the

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.400
works of Robert E. Howard.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.140
Bright and highly literate,
Gygax had little interest in

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.730
formal education and dropped
out of high school in his

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:13.130
junior year.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.750
Later, he attended junior
college classes and toyed with

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.530
the idea of becoming an
anthropologist, but his

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.210
childhood interest had instilled
an undeniable

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.630
ambition to write and
design games.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.110
He took a job as an insurance
underwriter to support his

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.540
gaming habit and then
a growing family.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.450
In 1958, he married an
attractive redhead named Mary

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:36.470
Jo Powell, and they eventually
had five kids.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.820
In 1966 Gygax became a founding
member of the United

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.050
States Continental Army
Command, a club whose

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:45.690
impressive name belied the fact
that its members were

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.380
actually engaged in a
play-by-mail campaign of the

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:52.420
strategic war game "Diplomacy."
A year later, the

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.560
group changed its name to the
International Federation of

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.740
Wargaming and its focus to
promoting the hobby.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:01.110
So to that end, Gygax decided
to organize a war-gaming

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:02.590
convention.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:06.750
He rented out the Lake Geneva
Horticultural Hall for $50,

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:11.170
and on August 24, 1968, he
welcomed friends and IFW

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.690
members to "Gen Con," a double
pun referring to both the

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:17.560
rules of war and the
event's location.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.840
Admission cost $1, and the show
made just enough money to

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.150
cover the rental.

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:26.870
In August of 1969, Gygax
held the event again.

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:30.610
This time, IFW member Dave
Arneson drove from Saint Paul

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:33.330
to check out the action, and the
two gamers spent a lot of

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.220
time together.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.420
"Since we're only talking a
couple hundred people at that

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.560
point, we pretty much ran into
each other all the time,"

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.000
Arneson said.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.130
"We were both interested in
sailing-ship games." Arneson

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.990
had developed new rules for
naval warfare simulations, and

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:50.000
so he showed them to Gygax.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.320
And after the convention was
over, they stayed in touch via

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.350
phone and letters, and shared
ideas about how to make that

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.670
sailing game better.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:02.080
In 1970, determined to make a
career in gaming, Gygax quit

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.730
his job as an insurance
underwriter and took a

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.140
part-time job writing and
editing rule books for Guidon

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.890
Games, a tiny publisher based
in Evansville, Indiana.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:12.910
To supplement the meager income,
he learned how to

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:17.180
repair shoes and practice
cobblery out of his basement.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.490
Guidon Games lasted barely
as long as a new

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.319
pair of leather soles.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:24.790
But before it went belly-up,
it produced two games of

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:28.640
particular importance, 1971's
"Chainmail," which was written

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.810
by Gygax and his friend Jeff
Perren, and which provided a

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:34.080
starting rule set for Dave
Arneson's "Blackmoor"

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.190
campaign, and also 1972's "Don't
Give Up the Ship!,"

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:41.260
which was authored by Gygax,
Arneson, and their war-gaming

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.930
friend Mike Carr, which was the
result of their ongoing

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:46.720
discussion about
naval warfare.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.280
So based on his use of
"Chainmail" and the successful

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.860
collaboration they had on "Don't
Give Up the Ship!,"

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.650
Dave Arneson knew what to do
after he created this weird

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.710
new fantasy role-playing game.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:58.960
He shared it with Gary Gygax.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.780
In the four decades that have
passed since David Arneson and

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.380
Gary Gygax began their most
important collaboration,

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.450
various geek pundits have
attempted to describe, by way

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.670
of analogy, the nature of their
momentous and fateful

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:16.760
partnership.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.930
I've heard them described as
Paul McCartney and John

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:23.520
Lennon, James Watson and
Francis Crick, even--

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.410
and this is true--

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:25.910
John the Baptist and Jesus.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:30.190
DAVID EWALT: Here's my attempt,
which hopefully

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:33.270
resonates a little bit more
with the Google crowd.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:37.600
Two young men meet in the late
1960s, and they bond over a

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.970
shared love of a
nerdy pastime.

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:43.210
They both belong to the shared
hobbyist's club and they start

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.420
making things to share
with the members.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.490
Before long, they're
working together on

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:49.840
something new and exciting.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.770
One of them is the engineer.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.240
He invents new ways
of doing things.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.810
The other is the visionary.

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.370
He realizes the potential.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:59.800
The product they create
could not have existed

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.340
without both of them.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.360
And when it's released, it
launches a brand new industry

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.240
and changes the world.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.400
The story's the same whether
you base it in the

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.390
International Federation of
Wargaming or the Homebrew

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:16.030
Computer Club, where Steve
Wozniak and Steve Jobs

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.730
jump-started the personal
computer industry by founding

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.400
Apple Computer.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.355
Wozniak, the engineer, designed
the hardware and made

00:19:23.355 --> 00:19:24.980
the computer function.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:28.030
Jobs, the visionary, made it
user-friendly and something

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.520
people wanted.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.870
Arneson visited Lake Geneva in
the fall of 1972 to show off

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.570
his "Blackmoor" game, but what
he really delivered was

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:37.750
innovations.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:41.370
Every player at the table
controls just one character.

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.520
Those character seek adventure
in a fantasy landscape.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.250
And by doing so, they
gain experience

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:49.650
and become more powerful.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:51.830
Gary Gygax then took
those ideas and

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:53.770
turned them into a commodity.

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:56.240
Over the next two months, Gygax
labored at a portable

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.630
Royal typewriter crafting the
rules for a new kind of game,

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.920
where players roll dice to
create a hero, fight monsters,

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.460
and find treasure.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.720
By the end of 1972,
he'd finished a

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.760
50-page first draft.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.020
He called it the
"Fantasy Game".

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.810
The first people to play it were
Gygax's 11-year-old son,

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.990
Ernie, and 9-year-old
daughter, Elise.

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:21.070
Gygax had created a counterpart
to Arneson's

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:24.250
"Blackmoor", which he called
"Castle Greyhawk," and he

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:26.940
designed a single level
of its dungeons.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.590
One night after dinner, he
invited the kids to roll up

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:31.750
characters and start
exploring.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:35.870
Ernie created a wizard and named
in Tenser, an anagram

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.690
for his full name, Ernest.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:42.010
Elise least played a cleric
called Ahlissa.

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:44.570
They wrote down the details of
the characters on index cards

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:46.230
and entered the dungeon.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.820
In the very first room, they
discovered and defeated a nest

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:49.980
of scorpions.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:53.340
In the second, they fought
a gang of kobolds.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.710
And then they found their first
treasure, a chest full

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.080
of copper coins--

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.470
but it was too heavy
to carry out.

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:02.730
The two adventurers pressed on
until 9 o'clock, when the

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:06.140
Dungeon Master put
them to bed.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.120
Fatherly duties completed, Gygax
returned to his office

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.380
and designed another level
of the dungeons.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.370
The next day, the play
tests continued.

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.810
Ernie and Elise were joined by
three players plucked from

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:19.100
Gygax's regular war-gaming
group--

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.950
his childhood friend Don Kaye
and local teenagers Rob Kuntz

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.750
his brother Terry.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:27.530
He also sent the manuscript to a
few dozen war-gaming friends

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:30.240
around the country, requesting
feedback.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.240
"The reaction was instant
enthusiasm.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.170
They demanded publication
of the rules as soon as

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.510
possible."

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:40.750
The local gamers also
clamored for more.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.830
As they got farther into the
depths of Castle Greyhawk,

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:46.090
they faced greater challenges
and began to feel like they

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:47.430
were part of a legend.

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.700
Thanks to Dave Arneson's
innovation of persistent

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:53.270
characters, the dungeons
had a living history.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:56.600
If Tenser killed a pack of
kobolds on Tuesday, someone

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.730
else might find the corpses
on Thursday.

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:02.860
It was a brand-new way
to create a story.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.420
Gygax began running regular
sessions of the "Fantasy Game"

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.050
for a growing group
of players.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.870
And simultaneously, Dave Arneson
tried out the rules

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:12.510
with his "Blackmoor" players
in Saint Paul.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:15.570
Arneson and Gygax spent a year
testing the "Fantasy Game"

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.540
with their respective gaming
clubs and then discussing what

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.990
did and didn't work.

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:23.990
"I don't know if any game has
ever been play-tested as much

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.760
as this game," says Michael
Mornard, who was the only

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.580
person to play a regular
character in both Gygax's

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:33.720
"Greyhawk" campaign and
Arneson's "Blackmoor".

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.080
Gygax's early "Greyhawk"
sessions were understandably

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.150
surprising to players like
Mornard, who'd never seen this

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.840
brand-new thing called a fantasy
role-playing game.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.210
But they would also look
different to today's

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:47.120
experienced D&amp;D players.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.980
There was no common
gaming table.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:53.540
The players sat together, and
Gygax sat alone at his desk.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.250
The way his study was arranged,
he had a desk with a

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:59.080
filing cabinet right next to it,
and he would pull out the

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.520
drawers on the filing cabinet
and hide behind them, so when

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.920
you hear his voice, it was kind
of like the voice of God

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.560
coming out of nowhere to
issue you instructions.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.360
All the action took
place entirely

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.120
inside everyone's heads.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.270
If you wanted a map, you
had to draw one.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:18.290
Gary wasn't about
to give you one.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:20.380
And there wasn't much
talking, either.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.740
Each party had a caller who
spoke for the group.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.270
Players quietly discussed their
actions and then told

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.750
the caller, who called Gygax.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:30.820
If anyone talked too much,
they risked missing an

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:34.720
important announcement from
behind the filing cabinet.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.720
There were no set adventuring
parties.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.810
There was nothing like Frodo's
Fellowship of the Ring.

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:42.940
During play-testing, Gygax ran
the game for three to five

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:46.110
players each time, but they
were drawn from a pool of

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:48.010
about 20 different people.

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:51.190
They were adventurers who
occasionally banded together.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:52.580
There was much more mercenary.

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.780
There was no, "We're all in
this together, this is our

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.400
group, we're sticking
with this."

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.870
There were also no piles of
rule books, and not just

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:01.680
because they hadn't
been written.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.090
Gygax wanted his players to
learn the game through

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:05.390
experience.

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:08.500
And because the game was so new,
players never knew what

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.690
to expect from their Dungeon
Master or from their cohorts.

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:16.460
Gygax was learning the game
alongside his players and

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.300
changing the rules based
on their actions.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.530
Night after night, small groups
of players pushed the

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:24.600
boundaries of what
was possible.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.160
Their actions shaped Gygax and
Arneson's work and decades of

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.410
games that followed.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.030
After the better part of a year
spent playing in Gary

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:38.120
Gygax's "Fantasy Game" play
tests, Mike Mornard moved to

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.610
Minneapolis to start
college at the

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:41.170
University of Minnesota.

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:44.180
So naturally, he made friends
with the local gamers and soon

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.500
found himself in Dave
Arneson's basement.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.260
Perhaps because the "Blackmoor"
players were more

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:52.810
often college-age and less often
neighborhood children,

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:55.750
Arneson's games were less
playful than Gygax's.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:59.760
"Blackmoor was a much grimmer,
grittier place than Greyhawk,"

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:00.900
says Mornard.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.000
"In Greyhawk, if you were
killed, the other players

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.660
would drag your body home.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.370
But in Blackmoor, there was
no honor amongst thieves.

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:09.390
You'd be looted before
your body hit

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:11.560
the ground." [LAUGHTER]

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.200
DAVID EWALT: The game played
a little differently, too.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.450
"It was a different way of
interacting," says Mornard.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:19.310
Arneson liked to use
miniatures, while

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.290
Gygax rarely did so.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.660
Arneson used to draw maps for
his players instead of

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.630
insisting they do
so themselves.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.400
And he made people write up
their moves on little pieces

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.600
of paper instead of shouting
them out or

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.410
talking over each other.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:35.860
Based on feedback from play
tests in "Blackmoor" and

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:39.150
"Greyhawk" and from war-gamer
friends across the country,

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:42.540
Gygax completed a 150-page
revision of the "Fantasy Game"

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.610
in the spring of 1973
and sent it out to

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:48.180
more friends for testing.

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:52.140
"The reaction was so intense
that I was sure we had a

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.440
winning game," he wrote.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.870
"I thought we would sell at
least 50,000 copies to

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:00.090
war-gamers and fantasy fans.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:03.670
I underestimated the
audience a little."

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:05.280
So the demand was there.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.730
The game worked.

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:09.240
The only thing missing
was a name.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.280
"Fantasy Game" was a fine
working title, but too bland

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.750
for a final product.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:17.180
So Gygax created a list of words
that related to the game

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:20.160
and wrote them in two columns
on a sheet of paper--

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.210
words like "castles," "magic,"
"monsters," "treasure,"

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:30.150
"trolls," "mazes," "sorcery,"
"spells," and "swords."

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:33.040
He read them aloud to his
players, including Ernie and

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.460
Elise, to gauge their
reactions.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.520
The young girl's delight
at two of the words, an

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.300
alliterative pair, confirmed
the choice.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:45.740
The game would be called
"Dungeons &amp; Dragons."

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.830
So now they only had
to print it.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:51.750
In the summer of 1973, Gygax
called Avalon Hill, which was

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.940
one of the big gaming companies
at the time, and

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.110
asked if they were interested
in publishing his game.

00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:01.800
"They laughed at the idea,
turned it down," Gygax wrote.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.790
Most of the gaming establishment
wanted nothing

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:07.810
to do with Arneson and Gygax's
weird little idea.

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:11.560
"One fellow had gone so far to
say that not only was fantasy

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:15.870
gaming 'up a creek,'" wrote
Gygax, "but if I had any

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:18.760
intelligence whatsoever, I would
direct my interest to

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.570
something fascinating
and unique--

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:22.670
the Balkan Wars, for

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:25.990
example." No matter.

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:29.490
The Dungeon Master want to
choose his own adventure.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:32.120
Gygax had aspirations to
run his own company--

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:35.870
he just didn't have the
time and money to

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:37.590
start printing books.

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:40.500
His income was still coming from
repairing shoes in his

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.870
basement, and Arneson was
a security guard.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:45.620
So neither one of them really
had the start-up funds to get

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:46.160
this going.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:50.030
And remember, this is
1973 Wisconsin.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:51.490
This is not Silicon Valley.

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:53.590
There's no venture capitalists
running around, offering to

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:55.560
buy out your game.

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.700
So the solution was found in
the place where the whole

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.512
project started.

00:27:59.512 --> 00:28:02.200
In August, the annual
Gen Con convention--

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.860
now in its fifth year and
bigger than ever--

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.310
was held in several buildings
on the campus of George

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:10.120
Williams College, up the road
from Lake Geneva in a town

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.190
called Williams Bay.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.790
Members of Gygax's ever-growing
"D&amp;D" play test

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:16.490
flocked to the con and
caught the eye of one

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:18.610
of Gygax's old friends.

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:20.980
"Don Kaye saw the turnout,
noted the interest in the

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:25.140
fans," wrote Gygax, "and after
the event was over, asked, 'Do

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.870
you really think you can make a
success of a game publishing

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:29.610
company?'"

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:31.960
Kaye didn't have cash
to invest, either.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.510
But after seeing the crowds at
Gen Con, he was convinced

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:36.690
"D&amp;D" was a salable product.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:40.020
So he borrowed $1,000 against
his life insurance, and that

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:43.000
October he and Gygax became
equal partners in a new

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.080
company called Tactical
Studies Rules.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.490
It was based out of Kaye's
dining room.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:50.890
There were still problems.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:53.660
$1,000 wouldn't print enough
copies of D&amp;D to meet the

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.440
anticipated demand.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.800
So Gygax decided to publish
a different game first--

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.040
"Cavaliers and Roundheads," a
set of rules for English Civil

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.920
War miniatures battles cowritten
by Gygax and his

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.500
"Chainmail" partner,
Jeff Perren.

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.650
They published "Cavaliers and
Roundheads" hoping the sales

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:12.340
of the booklet would generate
sufficient income to afford to

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.470
publish the D&amp;D game.

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:17.030
They knew that "D&amp;D" was going
to be the horse to pull the

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:19.740
company, but "Cavaliers
and Roundheads" only

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:23.160
raised $700 in sales.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.490
But then the last piece
fell into place.

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:28.860
Another local gamer, Brian
Blume, had also been to Gen

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:32.130
Con, seen the crowds of people,
and "badgered Gary

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:36.000
into letting him in at the
ground-floor." Blume was 23,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.140
divorced, and worked as
a tool-and-die maker's

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.940
apprentice at a company
owned by his dad.

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:44.020
In December, he borrowed $2,000
from his father and

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:48.860
became a full partner in Gygax
and Kaye's company.

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.610
A week later, Gygax sent his
manuscript, now broken into

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:56.230
three small booklets called
"Men &amp; Magic," "Monsters &amp;

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:59.790
Treasure," and "Underworld &amp;
Wilderness Adventures," to

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:01.950
Graphic Printing
in Lake Geneva.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:07.530
He paid $2,300 to print
1,000 sets.

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:11.640
In January 1974, Tactical
Studies Rules made its

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.750
creation public.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:18.850
It cost $10 and came in a
hand-assembled cardboard box

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:21.470
covered in wood-grain paper.

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:25.420
A flyer pasted to the top lid
featured a drawing of a Viking

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.660
warrior on a rearing horse--

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:32.350
art which was stolen from a
Doc Strange comic book.

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:35.940
Gygax and Arneson's names were
also on the cover, and above

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.020
that was the title--

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.870
"Dungeon's &amp; Dragons: Rules
for Fantastic Medieval

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:46.470
Wargames Campaigns Playable
with Paper and Pencil and

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:50.330
Miniature Figures."

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:52.600
So this is the beginning
of the history.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.690
And it is an extremely
convoluted and important one.

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.070
The game blew up.

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:01.600
Within a year of it coming out,
it was the biggest thing

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.290
in the war-gaming community.

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:06.590
People around the country were
playing it, but it was still

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:09.520
kind of a niche hobby thing.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.300
Within a few years, the game
started to leak out of that

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.690
little war-gamer community,
and a lot of college kids

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:16.850
everywhere played it.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:20.590
And something happened where
a kid who was a fan of the

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:24.400
role-playing game suffered from
severe depression and

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.300
disappeared from college.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.910
He ran away, basically.

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:30.330
But local law enforcement
authorities, when they went to

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:31.420
figure out, well,
what happened?

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:32.140
Where'd this kid go?

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.660
They found these weird books
in his dorm room that had

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.480
pictures of demons and
monsters on them.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.910
And this was a brand-new game.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:41.070
No one had ever seen anything
like it before.

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:43.260
So they said, this must be it.

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:44.940
He's playing this
Satanic game.

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:47.160
He was driven to kill himself.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.760
That sad event is actually kind
of blew "D&amp;D" up into the

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.860
mainstream.

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:55.106
It was very negative press for
TSR and for "Dungeons &amp;

00:31:55.106 --> 00:31:57.710
Dragons," but it was
national news.

00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:01.280
And within a couple of years,
"Dungeons &amp; Dragons" was one

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.150
of the most-played games
in the country.

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:06.180
Avalon Hill tried to come back
and at that point, say hey, we

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:08.020
want to buy "Dungeons &amp; Dragons"
from you, at which

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.870
point Gary Gygax probably
not so politely

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:13.050
told them to get lost.

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:15.740
And the game went
on to influence

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:16.750
things like video games.

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:20.050
Some of the very first video
games were attempts to codify

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:23.450
"Dungeons &amp; Dragons," to take
the pages of rules and charts

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:28.540
and the manual die-rolling and
make it automatic, make it

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:30.700
simpler to have that adventure,
that experience of

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:33.810
wandering through a dungeon
and fighting things.

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:38.230
So this is where I come in, as
a kid who picked up this game

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:41.420
and had never seen anything
before like it, and said,

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.550
"This is awesome.

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:45.750
I want to play this." And this
is where I assume a lot of you

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:46.840
came in, too.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.400
Because "Dungeons &amp; Dragons"
is one of those things that

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.640
was not only sort of a seminal
game and a cultural force in

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:58.600
the '80s and '90s, but the
game appeals to a certain

00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.260
group of people.

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.680
There's a certain kind of
geeky personality that

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:06.420
definitely responds to the math,
the logic, the fantasy

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:07.850
setting, the rules.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:11.020
And so people like me really
got into it, and it

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:12.040
meant a lot to us.

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.000
And we met our friends
that way.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.410
And for many of us, it also
shaped our careers.

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:21.050
So what I want to do now is
I want to open this up to

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:24.350
questions, whether you want to
ask about the history of "D&amp;D"

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:26.040
or of other role-playing
games.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:30.000
But I'd also love to hear your
stories if you did play "D&amp;D"

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.330
What were your characters
like?

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:32.700
What did you get out of it?

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.580
You know, I had one friend who
told me it helped him get into

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.580
college, because he knew
a vocabulary word.

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:39.220
He knew the word "comeliness"
because it appeared in

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:43.330
"Dungeons &amp; Dragons," and then
it showed up on the SATs.

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:45.920
So if you've got stories like
that to share, come up to the

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.780
mics at either end.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:50.030
We are simulcasting this talk to
other offices, so make sure

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.480
you use the mic so people
elsewhere can hear you.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.730
And so let's chat.

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:01.080
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.070
Thank you.

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:04.810
I was curious, as you were
looking into the history of

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:06.700
"Dungeons &amp; Dragons," did you
look at the history of other

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.110
story games that, at least at
the present, sort of are a

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:13.080
response to "D&amp;D" but are much
more about the personal story

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.000
and much less about, say,
the math or the combat?

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.699
DAVID EWALT: Yeah, absolutely.

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:20.570
Because of sort of the nature
of publishing, this book is

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:24.270
very focused on "Dungeons &amp;
Dragons." But there's such a

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:28.210
rich world of role-playing games
that grew out of this.

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:30.570
It's important to remember that
"D&amp;D" wasn't just sort of

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:31.570
the first game of this type.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:32.880
It was the first role-playing
game.

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.400
No one had ever done that--

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.100
you play a person and
you pretend to

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.370
be a different person.

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:39.340
And there were some really
interesting responses to it.

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:43.050
There were games like "Bunnies
&amp; Burrows," which was a

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:46.219
role-playing game based on the
novel "Watership Down." You

00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:48.780
actually played a bunny
and sort of acted out

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.210
some Marxist politics.

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:51.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:55.230
DAVID EWALT: There were
role-playing games based on

00:34:55.230 --> 00:35:00.230
spy novels, things like "Top
Secret." And a lot of the

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:02.800
games had a different focus.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.860
It was less about the rules and
the numbers and more about

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.370
this idea of, OK, if you're
going to play a character,

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:12.120
what's going to be interesting
here is to flesh that out and

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:15.230
to see where you can
take the person.

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.600
More modern incarnations of
that--you know, White Wolf did

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.300
some great games in the 1990s
that I played a lot, games

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:22.490
like "Vampire: The Masquerade,"
where it was

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:24.580
really more about sort of acting
out the character.

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.410
And the politics between
players--

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:29.250
I'm a vampire, I belong to this
one clan, you belong to a

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:29.900
different one.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.800
The game's not going to
be about us fighting.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.980
It's going to be about, how does
my clan relate to yours?

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.060
How can I manipulate you to get
the political goals done

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:39.650
of my clan.

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:45.080
And modern role-playing games
today, if I can generalize,

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.960
have sort of branched out
in two directions.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:50.020
There are the ones which are
sort of very rules-light and

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.650
where the point is really
to explore character.

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:54.870
And there's also a really cool
phenomenon that people

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:57.630
describe as old-school gaming,
where it's much more about,

00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:58.410
let's roll some dice.

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:00.710
Let's get back in that dungeon
and kill a bunch of kobolds,

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:04.050
and just have that classic
sort of rolling through.

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:05.360
I find value in both of them.

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.730
It's really fun to put yourself
in another character

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:10.210
and to explore who
that person is.

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:12.620
And it's therapeutic in
a lot of ways, too.

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:15.280
You start to think about, well,
how do other people act

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.540
and respond to stimulus
that I don't usually

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:19.790
have to deal with?

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:23.170
Are there more questions?

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:24.430
Somebody else want to jump up?

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:31.290
AUDIENCE: Hello there.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:32.600
DAVID EWALT: Hi.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.620
AUDIENCE: So I just want to say,
first, a statement that

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:38.330
leads to the question, that I've
always found the greatest

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:42.720
value in the role-playing games,
any of the D20 tabletop

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:48.050
games, is in the true
malleability of the story that

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:49.620
no other medium can capture.

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:52.090
A book, a movie have one story,
no matter how many

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:53.110
times you read it.

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:56.390
A video game will have maybe
finitely many, but still, you

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:57.850
can go through them all.

00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:00.960
But this is the only game where
as you go, as, say, a

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.760
player figures out a twist in
your plot, you can, before you

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.700
reveal that twist, change
the twist so that

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.260
they're still wrong.

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:11.260
You can constantly change the
game to fit the kind of

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:13.440
players you have.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:17.780
But I can't help but find that
in games like mine, where the

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:20.990
story is even more than the
combat, that the mechanics

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:22.580
sometimes still drags
down the game.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:26.070
So the question is, with the
now pervasiveness of cheap

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:28.840
technology like Chromebooks and
tablets, the ability to

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.720
play with people who aren't
sitting at the same table as

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:34.150
you, like Hangouts, do you see
perhaps another revolution in

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:37.630
this industry as it starts
to unite with technology?

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:41.760
The ability to have a malleable
story, but not

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.690
necessarily all the
math and dice?

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:46.060
DAVID EWALT: I do, in a couple
of different ways.

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:48.010
One is purely the mechanical.

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.890
So when I'm playing with my
friends-- we have this

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:52.025
campaign that's been going on
now for a couple years, that I

00:37:52.025 --> 00:37:53.140
write about in the book.

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:57.090
And I'm a 15th-level cleric, so
sometimes I cast a spell,

00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:00.310
and the way that "Dungeons &amp;
Dragons" calculates spells

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:03.020
becoming more powerful over
time, is for some of them, if

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:06.370
you're level 15, you're
going to roll 15-,

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:08.330
6-, or 8-sided dice.

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:10.530
And so that breaks
up the narrative.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.335
It's also, now you have to
scrounge around the table, see

00:38:12.335 --> 00:38:13.510
if you can find enough dice.

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:15.010
You probably only find
five of them.

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:16.195
Then you have to roll them,
add them up, roll

00:38:16.195 --> 00:38:17.020
them add them up.

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:18.430
It takes you out of it.

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:20.500
So one of the simple
technological innovations we

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:25.140
have is everybody's got their
Android phone or their iPhone.

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.150
And there's a million apps
that go on these things.

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:29.910
So just something as simple as
automating the dice-rolling,

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:34.710
having a pre-programmed button
that rolls 15 D6, really keeps

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:35.880
the narrative going.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:39.420
Things like these virtual
tabletops and things that

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:43.070
exist online where you can loop
in friends and play long

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:44.560
distance, I think
those are great.

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.920
I've got a friend who runs
an entire campaign where

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.515
everybody's in a
different city.

00:38:48.515 --> 00:38:50.840
It allows you to keep having
that social connection with

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:54.050
those people, and to play a game
that's much more about

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:58.410
the people involved than you
might find playing "World of

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:02.080
Warcraft." You actually can see
people's faces and change

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.650
the story based on people's
reactions.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:07.550
One thing I will also tell you
about, that's sort of related

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:12.200
to this, is what we're trying to
address, a lot, with these

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.200
technological innovations
is like you say.

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.250
We don't want the rules and
the mechanics to take away

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:20.780
from the thrill of the game,
from the narrative.

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:23.030
There's a new game that came out
in the last couple years.

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:25.350
It's an indie role-playing game
that goes in the exact

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:26.520
opposite direction.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.490
Instead of going high-tech to
try and get you on the story,

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:31.510
this game goes extremely
low-tech.

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:34.600
It's called "Dread," and
it's a survival-horror

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.410
role-playing game.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:36.960
So the idea is really
like you're going

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.270
into a horror movie.

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:40.800
It's like "Friday the 13th."
It's a bunch of teenagers

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.020
going into an abandoned house,
and a monster comes, starts

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:44.690
chasing them.

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:46.650
But there's no dice and there's
no rules that the

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:47.650
players see.

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:50.720
All you have is on the middle of
the gaming table, there is

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:53.610
a stack of "Jenga" pieces.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:56.250
And as you get deeper into the
story, every time you do

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:59.160
something that would require a
die roll-0- like you try to

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.840
pick a lock or you try to break
down a door, you take

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.290
one of the "Jenga" pieces out.

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:06.930
And it actually works
brilliantly, because this is a

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:08.160
horror game.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.950
And as you get further into the
story, the "Jenga" tower

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:14.380
starts getting wobbly,
and your decisions--

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:15.465
you start getting,
physically--

00:40:15.465 --> 00:40:18.840
I mean, you've played "Jenga."
You have this physical

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.190
manifestation of, like--

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:27.460
reinforces all the tension and
fear in the narrative through

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:30.920
this incredibly simple
mechanical device.

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.250
Anybody who's a role-player,
I recommend it.

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:34.240
But because it's got no rules,
it's also great.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.910
Like we've played it with lots
of people who've never

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:37.460
role-played a game before.

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:39.040
So it's just interesting to
see the two different ways

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.830
that people try to address
narrative and to

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:42.640
keep it in the story.

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:46.466
They're going by super high-tech
or super low-tech.

00:40:46.466 --> 00:40:47.350
Another question?

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:49.600
AUDIENCE: First of all, thanks
for telling the story and

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.060
writing your book.

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:54.310
This is a purely historical
question.

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:55.120
I remember--

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.440
and subsequently could never
find, but apparently it's

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.970
somewhere in my parents'
basement, but they insist they

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:01.100
didn't throw it away--

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.622
there was a first printing,
second edition of "Deities &amp;

00:41:03.622 --> 00:41:07.370
Demigods" that included
Gray Mouser and

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:10.090
Fafhrd, Elric of Melnibone.

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:12.250
And subsequently, there was
a reprinting, and they

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:13.150
disappeared.

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:14.990
What happened?

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:16.870
DAVID EWALT: So there's a little
bit of back-story here,

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:18.960
which is that, as you can see--
you know, I told you how

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:22.660
the first box of "Dungeons &amp;
Dragons" had a stolen piece of

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:24.970
artwork on the cover?

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:28.690
TSR, over its first few years,
had a couple of different

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:30.340
legal run-ins.

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:34.200
One of the earliest was they
printed a war-gaming board

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.440
game based on the big climactic
battle in "The

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:41.360
Hobbit." They didn't have
permission from JRR Tolkien's

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:45.200
estate, but they printed a war
game based on "The Hobbit." So

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.980
they got sued and told
not to do that.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:50.610
They also printed a war game
based on the Barsoom novels

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:52.340
and got sued based on that.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:56.770
It was the same thing with the
"Deities &amp; Demigods" book.

00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:00.020
This was a big book where
they were collecting--

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:01.565
I mean, it was literally
deities and demigods.

00:42:01.565 --> 00:42:03.800
It was lists of, like, if you
have a super high-level

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.920
character, you might
run into a god.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:06.830
You might run into Thor.

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:09.520
Or just if you're a cleric,
this is who your deity is.

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:13.370
And they included some fictional
characters, things

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:16.180
like Fafhrd and the
Gray Mouser, and

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:18.550
also the Cthulhu mythos.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:19.840
And they didn't have the
rights to any of those.

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:23.010
So they put the book out,
and they got a couple of

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:26.770
cease-and-desist letters from
various rights owners, and had

00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:32.180
to very quickly withdraw what
they had and release new ones.

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:34.040
And this is actually one of the
things, you know, as "D&amp;D"

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.150
has become more popular over the
years, and now as people

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:41.430
are looking back on it in
nostalgia, if you happen to

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:46.220
have one of these old hardback
"AD&amp;D" books, especially the

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:49.600
ones with the Cthulhu mythos
and with the Gray Mouser

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.570
stories, those are worth
a lot of money now.

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:54.340
There's a really big collectible
market for these

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:55.340
"D&amp;D" errata.

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.950
And if you have them stuck in a
basement or in a box in your

00:42:58.950 --> 00:43:01.750
parents' closet, go dig them
out, because they're really

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:04.524
valuable nowadays.

00:43:04.524 --> 00:43:08.600
AUDIENCE: I'm curious about the
sort of family tree with

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.670
collectible card games and
role-playing games.

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:14.500
I'd always sort of assumed when
they came out, like when

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.860
I was made aware of them, in
"Magic: The Gathering," that

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:20.630
it was a way to commercially
sort of make more money on

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:22.900
something similar to
role-playing games.

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:28.210
But I wonder, now, with the
history of more rule-intensive

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:31.110
battle stuff sort of forking
from the-- like if it does

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:32.680
actually meet the family
tree somewhere?

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:33.630
DAVID EWALT: Sure.

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:36.630
So collectible card games are
things like "Magic: The

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:41.440
Gathering," which were in fact
directly inspired by "D&amp;D."

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:44.170
The guy who invented "Magic:
The Gathering," his name is

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:45.260
Richard Garfield.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:46.510
He's still designing games.

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:48.690
In fact, he has a brand-new
sort of computerized

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:50.870
collectible card game out.

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:53.430
He had played "D&amp;D," and this
was an attempt to sort of come

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:56.290
up with a new mechanism for, how
can we have these fantasy

00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:59.470
battles, but do it based
on pieces of paper?

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:02.490
And a big part of the idea
is the mechanism of

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:03.600
deck-building.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:06.350
It's a less about, I build a
character and I go into a

00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:07.680
dungeon to climb levels.

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:10.190
It's more about, I buy these
pieces and I put them together

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:12.540
in very smart ways to
have them battle.

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.885
When those games first came
out, when "Magic: The

00:44:14.885 --> 00:44:17.090
Gathering" was first introduced,
it was published

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:19.410
by a company called Wizards
of the Coast.

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:22.150
"D&amp;D," at the time, was still
published by TSR.

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:24.750
It was kind of a shadow
of its former self.

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:26.700
This the early '90s we're
talking about.

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:30.670
And "Magic: The Gathering"
just ate "D&amp;D"'s lunch.

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:33.222
Like, nobody was buying "D&amp;D"
anymore. "Magic: The

00:44:33.222 --> 00:44:35.870
Gathering" was hugely popular,
in part because of this really

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:38.840
smart and insidious mechanism
of, you want to be better?

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:41.670
Go to the store and
buy more cards.

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:44.740
TSR tried to replicate that.

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:47.120
They released their own
collectible card game called

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:52.310
"Spellfire: Master the Magic."
It was not successful.

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:55.440
Piles of it sat in their
warehouses and actually

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:58.290
contributed to their
eventual downfall.

00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:01.050
The company, because of all
this unsold inventory and

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:04.290
because of other financial
problems, went bankrupt, went

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:07.360
up on the block, and was
purchased by Wizards of the

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:09.360
Coast, the "Magic: The
Gathering" company.

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.760
Wizards of the Coast still
owns "D&amp;D" today.

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.080
They're owned, in turn,
now by Hasbro.

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:18.740
But "Magic: The Gathering" is
still very, very popular.

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:21.800
"D&amp;D," in some sense, is still
a little bit of a smaller

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.886
cousin, at least in terms of
revenue, to "Magic: The

00:45:23.886 --> 00:45:26.900
Gathering." If you go to game
stores on any given night,

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:28.850
you're probably more likely to
find people playing these

00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:33.130
collectible card games
then you are "D&amp;D."

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:35.900
AUDIENCE: So along the note that
we were just discussing,

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:39.550
the reputation TSR had in the
early '90s and late '80s, the

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:42.380
impression I got, just vaguely,
was that they were

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:43.990
totally incompetent
managing money.

00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:46.700
And there's apparently stories
about them printing books that

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.890
literally, the price, even if
they sold them at the exact

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:52.230
price, they would still lose
money in every single sale,

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:54.660
because they put way too much
effort, the hardback

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:55.530
books and the like.

00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:57.990
Now how much of that is true?

00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:00.950
And how much of that's just,
they were dealing with, people

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:04.140
don't rebuy the same books over
and over again for the

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:06.260
same edition of D&amp;D they have?

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:08.910
DAVID EWALT: A surprising
amount of it is true.

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:13.620
I already drew the comparison
between Arneson and Gygax and

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:14.280
Wozniak and Jobs.

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:16.480
And there are lots of
comparisons between this sort

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:20.520
of gaming culture and this
startup, versus the start-up

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.750
of the computer industry.

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:25.080
But what you see here, and a lot
of the stories I tell in

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.600
the book, are kind of like, this
is what happens on the

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.050
bad side of the equation.

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:31.830
Like, it's great when you get
people who are passionate

00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:34.380
about their product, people who
are hobbyists, who say, I

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:35.830
want to create an operating
system.

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:38.650
Or I'm going to put this gadget
together in a garage.

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:41.980
And when they turn that into a
big product, that's great.

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:44.630
Just as often, the people who
come into that, the problem

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:47.890
is, they're domain experts.

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:49.130
And these guys were gamers.

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:51.200
They were not experienced
businessmen.

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:55.270
So TSR wasted a lot of money
on really stupid things.

00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:58.570
And that's the reason why the
company eventually got bought

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:01.270
out, and why Gary Gygax, at one
point, gets kicked out of

00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.720
the company.

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.450
It's because they were
doing stuff like--

00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:05.900
and some of the stories
I refer to--

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:07.025
TSR got really rich.

00:47:07.025 --> 00:47:09.460
The game was super popular.

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.720
Tons of money are coming in.

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.780
They didn't know what
to do with it.

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.010
Instead of spending it
responsibly, they did things

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:22.460
like, they purchased a company
that did needlework kits.

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:26.390
They released tons of
"D&amp;D"-themed merchandise,

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:28.940
everything from coloring books,
but also like beach

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:31.910
towels and just like tons of
worthless crap that nobody

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:33.200
really wanted.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:37.190
My favorite story of this sort
of corporate excess was that

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:40.250
for a while, the management
of TSR

00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:42.872
considered buying a railroad.

00:47:42.872 --> 00:47:44.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:46.510
DAVID EWALT: The place where TSR
was based, which was Lake

00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:49.290
Geneva, Wisconsin, was a resort
town sort of during the

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:51.190
1920s, like the Al
Capone days.

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:52.180
It was a big resort town.

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:55.090
So all the rich people from
Chicago would take the train

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:56.940
up to Lake Geneva.

00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:01.120
After that age ended, the
train got shut down.

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.600
There was nobody running
on that train line.

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.740
So the makers of TSR was like,
well, what if we bought this

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:05.880
train line?

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:09.730
And we could set up trains, and
instead of a conductor in

00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:12.040
each car, you would have
a Dungeon Master.

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:14.410
And people would get on the
train, and by the time they

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:16.780
made it from Lake Geneva to
Chicago, they'd have done a

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:18.030
full adventure.

00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:21.036
Well, thankfully, they never
spent the money on that.

00:48:21.036 --> 00:48:23.190
But probably the reason why they
never spent that money

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:26.290
was because they got kicked
out of business for doing

00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:28.325
stupid stuff like thinking
about buying a railroad.

00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:33.370
AUDIENCE: So you were talking
about video games, which are

00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:35.210
getting more and more
high-fidelity, and collectible

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:39.250
card games, and "Dungeons &amp;
Dragons" still being a smaller

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:41.440
part of Wizards of the Coast.

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:44.490
Do you think that there's a lot
of future in this hobby?

00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:47.930
Or is it more of like a
nostalgic phenomenon for

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:51.750
people kind of in their 30s
and older who started with

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:52.280
these things?

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:56.070
Because I don't see people
playing it anymore very much.

00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:59.260
You know, you see game stores
closing around the place.

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:02.090
And I just wonder what your
opinion on that is.

00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:04.400
DAVID EWALT: I think there is
definitely a future for

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.810
"Dungeons &amp; Dragons," and I
think we're actually in the

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:09.150
early stages of a big
revival of the game.

00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:10.880
I think this is happening
for two reasons.

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:13.090
One, which is as you identified,
there's a

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:14.200
nostalgia for the game.

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:15.670
I mean, you've got people
who played it

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:16.790
when they were a kid.

00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:20.350
And now they're grown up, and
they have money, and they want

00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:21.500
to reconnect with
their friends.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.450
They want to do something
social.

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:23.360
And this is a great way--

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.680
I mean, it's like having
a weekly poker night.

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:26.910
Come sit down with your
friends, play

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:27.610
a game for a while.

00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:29.700
And people really remember
that fondly and

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.070
want to do it again.

00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:34.270
The other reason, I think,
actually has to do with the

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:35.970
expansion of video games.

00:49:35.970 --> 00:49:39.840
And "D&amp;D" almost got killed by
video games, but I think now

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.140
it's coming back.

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:44.960
Because for one thing, video
games are everywhere now.

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.810
Everyone plays video games.

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:48.540
Young, old, male, female--

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:50.310
I mean, you've got grandparents
who are playing

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:51.980
"Angry Birds" on their phone.

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:55.200
So "D&amp;D" is no longer as
weird as it once was.

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.420
Like it was hard, in the 1980s,
to go to someone who

00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:00.090
didn't game and explain to them,
here's this thing where

00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:01.830
you pretend to be a paladin,
and you're

00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:03.070
going to kill some--

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:05.600
they couldn't-- it was a
difficult mental leap to make.

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:07.950
Now when you're playing games
all the time, it's much easier

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:09.380
to understand and to
make the leap.

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.440
And it's also less scary,
because you're not going to

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:12.840
think of it as, like, gaming?

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:14.970
That's some weird, nerdy thing
that I would never do.

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:16.930
You're like, well,
I do play this.

00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:20.600
I play "World of Warcraft."
Why not?

00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:23.200
So I think the game is going
to have a revival.

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:27.480
And I think particularly, as
our lives are becoming more

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:30.130
digital, I think people
really value that--

00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:31.790
I get to sit down at a table.

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:33.430
And even if they don't want to
sit down at a table with their

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:35.910
friends, they can get online
with them and use some of

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:38.430
these online tools and have
a face-to-face connection.

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:41.395
So the game's not going away.

00:50:41.395 --> 00:50:43.120
Another question?

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.070
AUDIENCE: Hey, Dave.

00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:46.980
Just wanted to do also ask a
question based on where the

00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:49.610
future and where you see
the next revival going.

00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:50.460
I know that--

00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:52.165
I'm not an MMO guy.

00:50:52.165 --> 00:50:55.260
The biggest leap forward I've
seen is "Eve," and how you see

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:56.850
this great community
of people, doing

00:50:56.850 --> 00:50:58.230
these massive battles.

00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:01.180
And then they're covered as,
like, televised events.

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:03.780
And I was seeing if you knew
something like that.

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:06.000
What would the next
evolution be?

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.370
You know, taking something like
that and having that kind

00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:11.610
of connection to tell these
stories and to actually have

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:13.070
the kind of narrative power?

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:14.130
DAVID EWALT: Sure.

00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:15.650
Well, there's two interesting
things happening.

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:19.130
One is, so you talk about online
games, and sort of

00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:21.360
hinting towards the idea of
eSports, where people are

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:23.290
televising these events of like,
OK, we're going to have

00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:25.700
a "League of Legends" finals.

00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:27.400
Like, these things
are huge now.

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:31.310
If you play the games, people
log on to sites like Twitch

00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:34.510
and millions of people watch,
live, other people

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:35.880
video-gaming.

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:39.970
There is something sort of like
that with D&amp;D. The guys

00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:43.230
who draw the webcomic "Penny
Arcade" and do the Penny

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:46.940
Arcade Expos, they have an
ongoing game that they record

00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:47.940
as podcasts.

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:52.470
And when they do one of their
Expos, they play on stage.

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:55.600
And people watch and people
cheer and people laugh.

00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.970
And they record them as video
podcasts and put them online,

00:51:57.970 --> 00:51:59.290
and they're really popular.

00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:02.560
So I can see even "D&amp;D" becoming
sort of a spectator

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.720
sport and evolving
in that way.

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.910
In the other sense, in terms
of just MMOs more

00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:11.020
specifically, the problem we
face-- the strength that "D&amp;D"

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:14.670
has right now, as opposed to
MMOs, something like "World of

00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:18.070
Warcraft" or "Eve" or anything
else, is that the D&amp;D game can

00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:19.060
go anywhere.

00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:21.310
It's up to the imagination
of the players.

00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:24.690
You're not limited by everything
the programmers

00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:25.940
planned for, and
the designers.

00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:29.270
If the designers in a video game
didn't think the player

00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:31.230
might want to do X, the player's
not going to be able

00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:33.250
to do X.

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:36.490
MMOs are going to get smarter
and faster and more complex,

00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:38.120
and there'll be more processing
power, and they

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:42.550
will come closer and closer to
offering the true freedom of

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:43.870
choice that "D&amp;D" does.

00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:45.810
But it's going to
be a long time.

00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:50.170
I mean, you want to get really
nerdy here, you have to have

00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:52.540
true artificial intelligence
before you can have a game

00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:55.550
smart enough to react the same
way a human Dungeon Master

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:56.570
would react to his players.

00:52:56.570 --> 00:52:58.970
AUDIENCE: So no White
Wolf RPG coming out?

00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:01.500
No MMO for White Wolf?

00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:03.070
Would you say that
ship has sailed?

00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:04.490
DAVID EWALT: I mean, there's
some really cool MMOs coming

00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:05.990
out, and there's a lot
of great video games.

00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:09.490
I mean, "Skyrim," just in the
last year or two, "Skyrim" was

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:11.080
very much the D&amp;D experience.

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:12.660
And millions of people
loved that game.

00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:16.710
But none of them, for now, are
offering anything that's truly

00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:19.640
revolutionary or that can
really compete with the

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.998
freedom of choice for
"D&amp;D." I think

00:53:21.998 --> 00:53:23.320
we'll do one more question.

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:24.720
AUDIENCE: So if you multi-class
cleric/psychic

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.350
warrior, you've clearly
played either 2nd or

00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:27.730
3rd edition, or both.

00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:30.180
What are your thoughts on the
other editions of "D&amp;D" that

00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:31.190
you have played?

00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:34.010
DAVID EWALT: So this is one
of the most controversial

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:36.940
arguments in all Nerd-dom.

00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:39.850
This is right up there with,
like, could a Star Destroyer

00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:42.350
beat up the "USS Enterprise"?

00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:47.110
But it's important, because the
quick answer is, over the

00:53:47.110 --> 00:53:50.920
years, TSR had to find a
way to get people to

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:52.300
keep buying the game.

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:56.080
If I buy a box of "Monopoly,"
I've got "Monopoly." I don't

00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:57.410
have to buy a new one.

00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:59.500
Same thing was true with "D&amp;D."
So what would happen is

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:02.520
every few years, TSR would
release a new edition.

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:04.630
They would change the rules,
with new supplements.

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:05.810
It was a way to get people
to be, like,

00:54:05.810 --> 00:54:07.560
oh, this one's better.

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:10.020
It's still "D&amp;D," but it's
done a different way.

00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:12.110
So there's all these different
editions of the game.

00:54:12.110 --> 00:54:16.160
I do play, with my gaming group,
we played 3.5 edition,

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:19.220
which is really massively nerdy
and great, and I love

00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:20.580
it, because it's so detailed.

00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:22.560
But there are other versions
which are simpler.

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:25.400
4th edition, which came out
not too long ago, a lot of

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:27.300
people complained it was sort
of video-game-y, that it

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:30.140
limited your choices.

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:32.340
I've had, especially while
reporting this book, I have

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:35.800
had fun playing every version
of "Dungeons &amp; Dragons." 3.5

00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:38.030
might be my personal favorite,
because that's what I play

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:39.190
with my friends.

00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:43.960
If we had started out playing
basic "D&amp;D," the 1983 rules,

00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:45.820
that would probably
be my favorite.

00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:49.530
I will say that Wizards of the
Coast is currently working on

00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:52.660
a brand-new edition, which
they will probably

00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:53.630
release next year.

00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:55.266
Next year's the 40th anniversary
of "Dungeons &amp;

00:54:55.266 --> 00:54:58.510
Dragons." They've been
play-testing this thing for

00:54:58.510 --> 00:55:00.380
almost a year and a half now.

00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:01.660
And I've been in
the play test.

00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:03.100
I've talked to other people
that have been in them.

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:04.720
And it's a lot of fun.

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:09.380
I think what they're trying to
do is get rid of a lot of this

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:14.360
sort of edition war politics,
make it less about the rules.

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:17.840
Why should we get wrapped up
on whether spells are cast

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:20.160
using a system of spell points,
or whether they are

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:22.110
cast based on what you memorized
in the book?

00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:24.410
Like, that's not what's
important to us having fun.

00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:26.750
And so what they're trying to
do with this new version is

00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:28.712
make it really about the
fundamentals of "Dungeons &amp;

00:55:28.712 --> 00:55:31.380
Dragons." Make it
about exploring.

00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:33.180
Make it about telling a story.

00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:35.320
And make it about hanging
out with your friends.

00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:37.440
And so far, I think they've
been successful with that.

00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:39.230
So we'll see, when the final
product comes out.

00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:42.570
It might be one that everyone
can agree on.

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:45.950
So I want to thank everyone
for your time.

00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:46.990
This is the book.

00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:48.750
A lot more history about
this in here.

00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:50.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:51.880
DAVID EWALT: And if it
gets you interested,

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:52.850
go look up the game.

00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:55.390
There's game stores and groups
everywhere around the country.

00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:56.840
You can always reconnect
with people and

00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:58.090
start playing again.

00:55:58.090 --> 00:55:59.340
Thanks for coming.
