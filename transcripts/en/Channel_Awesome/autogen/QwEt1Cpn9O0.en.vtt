00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:30.259 align:start position:0%
with it yeah that would be interesting
 

00:12:30.259 --> 00:12:33.100 align:start position:0%
with it yeah that would be interesting
yeah<00:12:30.499><c> so</c><00:12:31.100><c> um</c><00:12:31.759><c> yeah</c><00:12:32.420><c> hopefully</c><00:12:32.720><c> though</c>

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:33.110 align:start position:0%
yeah so um yeah hopefully though
 

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:34.780 align:start position:0%
yeah so um yeah hopefully though
hopefully<00:12:33.799><c> we'll</c><00:12:33.949><c> see</c><00:12:34.069><c> another</c><00:12:34.249><c> one</c><00:12:34.459><c> with</c><00:12:34.639><c> it</c>

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:34.790 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll see another one with it
 

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.369 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll see another one with it
and<00:12:35.119><c> they'll</c><00:12:35.269><c> do</c><00:12:35.420><c> even</c><00:12:35.660><c> more</c><00:12:35.809><c> stuff</c><00:12:36.049><c> with</c><00:12:36.230><c> it</c>

00:12:36.369 --> 00:12:36.379 align:start position:0%
and they'll do even more stuff with it
 

00:12:36.379 --> 00:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
and they'll do even more stuff with it
but<00:12:36.619><c> if</c><00:12:37.369><c> not</c><00:12:37.519><c> yeah</c><00:12:38.360><c> it</c><00:12:39.110><c> could</c><00:12:39.230><c> have</c><00:12:39.259><c> been</c><00:12:39.439><c> a</c><00:12:39.470><c> lot</c>

00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:39.649 align:start position:0%
but if not yeah it could have been a lot
 

00:12:39.649 --> 00:12:42.879 align:start position:0%
but if not yeah it could have been a lot

00:12:42.879 --> 00:12:42.889 align:start position:0%
stronger code a lot more of it I did
 

00:12:42.889 --> 00:12:45.549 align:start position:0%
stronger code a lot more of it I did

00:13:04.929 --> 00:13:04.939 align:start position:0%
it's untrue it kind of is but it kind of
 

00:13:04.939 --> 00:13:07.749 align:start position:0%
it's untrue it kind of is but it kind of

is<00:13:26.050><c> changing</c><00:13:27.050><c> its</c><00:13:27.199><c> time</c><00:13:27.639><c> well</c><00:13:28.639><c> everything</c>

00:13:29.019 --> 00:13:29.029 align:start position:0%
is changing its time well everything
