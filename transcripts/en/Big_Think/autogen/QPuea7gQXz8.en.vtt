00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.970
 
I think it's pretty obvious I mean there

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980
I think it's pretty obvious I mean there
 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.920
I think it's pretty obvious I mean there
was no hedge fund that was levered 40

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:13.930
was no hedge fund that was levered 40
 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.740
was no hedge fund that was levered 40
times there's no hedge fund there was

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750
times there's no hedge fund there was
 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.950
times there's no hedge fund there was
levered 20 times so there was always

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960
levered 20 times so there was always
 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.590
levered 20 times so there was always
this focus because people i think focus

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:22.600
this focus because people i think focus
 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.020
this focus because people i think focus
on the individual investor and that

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.030
on the individual investor and that
 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.880
on the individual investor and that
people were worried about fraud within a

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890
people were worried about fraud within a
 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.640
people were worried about fraud within a
hedge fund it's amazing when you look at

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650
hedge fund it's amazing when you look at
 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.119
hedge fund it's amazing when you look at
it if you really look at sort of OE even

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129
it if you really look at sort of OE even
 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:34.799
it if you really look at sort of OE even
07 if you look at the amount of money

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809
07 if you look at the amount of money
 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.780
07 if you look at the amount of money
that was lost in hedge funds just from

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790
that was lost in hedge funds just from
 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.360
that was lost in hedge funds just from
fraud right or funds blowing up and

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370
fraud right or funds blowing up and
 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.430
fraud right or funds blowing up and
closing down it was pretty de minimis

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440
closing down it was pretty de minimis
 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.600
closing down it was pretty de minimis
and when you look at what happened I

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610
and when you look at what happened I
 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.259
and when you look at what happened I
think with financial institutions you

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269
think with financial institutions you
 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.030
think with financial institutions you
know the dollars that people talk about

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040
know the dollars that people talk about
 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.619
know the dollars that people talk about
is sort of trillions of dollars so I and

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629
is sort of trillions of dollars so I and
 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:56.790
is sort of trillions of dollars so I and
the reason for that is because of the

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800
the reason for that is because of the
 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.200
the reason for that is because of the
leverage it's not because of the equity

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210
leverage it's not because of the equity
 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.439
leverage it's not because of the equity
that was involved so I think on I think

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449
that was involved so I think on I think
 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:02.969
that was involved so I think on I think
there was just a real lack of

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979
there was just a real lack of
 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.880
there was just a real lack of
understanding and it was easier to sort

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890
understanding and it was easier to sort
 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.590
understanding and it was easier to sort
of pick on hedge funds because people

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600
of pick on hedge funds because people
 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.500
of pick on hedge funds because people
believe that banks were safe and I think

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510
believe that banks were safe and I think
 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.020
believe that banks were safe and I think
what was clear and what's been shown is

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030
what was clear and what's been shown is
 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.480
what was clear and what's been shown is
you know that is really the banks that

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490
you know that is really the banks that
 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.680
you know that is really the banks that
needed the oversight not the hedge funds

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690
 
 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.380
 
yeah I mean I think there is I think

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390
yeah I mean I think there is I think
 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.610
yeah I mean I think there is I think
part of the reason is there's a big

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620
part of the reason is there's a big
 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.010
part of the reason is there's a big
focus on that people want to sort of

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020
focus on that people want to sort of
 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.980
focus on that people want to sort of
monetize the value that they have in a

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990
monetize the value that they have in a
 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.830
monetize the value that they have in a
company and by doing that you go public

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840
company and by doing that you go public
 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.040
company and by doing that you go public
I think being private there's a huge

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050
I think being private there's a huge
 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.290
I think being private there's a huge
amount of benefits and being private but

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300
amount of benefits and being private but
 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.150
amount of benefits and being private but
ultimately the reason people go public

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160
ultimately the reason people go public
 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:49.640
ultimately the reason people go public
is to monetize and to capture that value

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650
 
 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.020
 
like I think it's I you can't blame the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030
like I think it's I you can't blame the
 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.020
like I think it's I you can't blame the
people for doing that I mean I think

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030
people for doing that I mean I think
 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.310
people for doing that I mean I think
what ends up happening is they're taking

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
what ends up happening is they're taking
 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.080
what ends up happening is they're taking
a private and they think when somebody

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090
a private and they think when somebody
 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.310
a private and they think when somebody
takes a couple private they believe

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320
takes a couple private they believe
 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.380
takes a couple private they believe
they're doing it at a very good price

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390
they're doing it at a very good price
 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.130
they're doing it at a very good price
the reason they're going to take it

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140
the reason they're going to take it
 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.570
the reason they're going to take it
public is they think they're going to

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580
public is they think they're going to
 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.530
public is they think they're going to
get a much higher valuation so I think

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540
get a much higher valuation so I think
 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.630
get a much higher valuation so I think
the vast majority of people in that same

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640
the vast majority of people in that same
 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.040
the vast majority of people in that same
situation would probably do the same

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050
situation would probably do the same
 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.410
situation would probably do the same
thing does that mean it's right you know

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420
thing does that mean it's right you know
 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.860
thing does that mean it's right you know
that that's a different issue but

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870
that that's a different issue but
 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.180
that that's a different issue but
there's there's a huge amount of focus

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190
there's there's a huge amount of focus
 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.000
there's there's a huge amount of focus
on sort of what people make and as you

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010
on sort of what people make and as you
 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.390
on sort of what people make and as you
look at that I think that's why people

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400
look at that I think that's why people
 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.059
look at that I think that's why people
end up taking companies public

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069
 
 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.360
 
look I think I think what

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370
look I think I think what
 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.449
look I think I think what
was very simply said we're putting our

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459
was very simply said we're putting our
 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.210
was very simply said we're putting our
money in we're going to be senior we're

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220
money in we're going to be senior we're
 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.630
money in we're going to be senior we're
going to get paid X and we can we can

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640
going to get paid X and we can we can
 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.330
going to get paid X and we can we can
end up doing anything we want until you

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340
end up doing anything we want until you
 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.240
end up doing anything we want until you
take us out I mean I I don't blame the

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250
take us out I mean I I don't blame the
 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.589
take us out I mean I I don't blame the
government for sort of imposing things I

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599
government for sort of imposing things I
 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.789
government for sort of imposing things I
just think they've gone a little bit too

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799
just think they've gone a little bit too
 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.830
just think they've gone a little bit too
far because what they're doing now is

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840
far because what they're doing now is
 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.649
far because what they're doing now is
dealing more with popular sentiment as

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659
dealing more with popular sentiment as
 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.410
dealing more with popular sentiment as
opposed to sort of business reasons and

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420
opposed to sort of business reasons and
 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.979
opposed to sort of business reasons and
that's that's the real issue it's not

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989
that's that's the real issue it's not
 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.080
that's that's the real issue it's not
it's that the government has its own

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090
it's that the government has its own
 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.410
it's that the government has its own
pressures it's hard for her if you're

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420
pressures it's hard for her if you're
 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.750
pressures it's hard for her if you're
voting for your congressman and you're

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760
voting for your congressman and you're
 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.699
voting for your congressman and you're
saying well you voted on and that

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709
saying well you voted on and that
 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.979
saying well you voted on and that
congressman votes on the bailout to say

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989
congressman votes on the bailout to say
 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.220
congressman votes on the bailout to say
that congressman but why is that person

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230
that congressman but why is that person
 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.559
that congressman but why is that person
making a million dollars a year I don't

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569
making a million dollars a year I don't
 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.449
making a million dollars a year I don't
think that's right I'm out of a job and

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459
think that's right I'm out of a job and
 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.089
think that's right I'm out of a job and
if I bailed him out I want to limit what

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099
if I bailed him out I want to limit what
 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.819
if I bailed him out I want to limit what
he can make oh I I get it but what they

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829
he can make oh I I get it but what they
 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.080
he can make oh I I get it but what they
should have done would say we're putting

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090
should have done would say we're putting
 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.400
should have done would say we're putting
in money we're going to be an investor

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410
in money we're going to be an investor
 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.830
in money we're going to be an investor
and we're going to get paid if we don't

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840
and we're going to get paid if we don't
 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.059
and we're going to get paid if we don't
get paid then ultimately we're going to

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069
get paid then ultimately we're going to
 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.090
get paid then ultimately we're going to
end up owning this company
