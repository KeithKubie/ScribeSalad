00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.840
So, we saw in the previous
video that the house prices

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.510
were distributed over the
area in an interesting way,

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.400
certainly not the
kind of linear way.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.580
And we wouldn't necessarily
expect linear regression

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.030
to do very well at
predicting house price,

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.410
just given latitude
and longitude.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.610
We can kind of develop
an intuition more

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.030
by plotting the relationship
between latitude and house

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:38.950
prices-- which doesn't look
very linear-- or the longitude

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:45.310
and the house prices, which
also looks pretty nonlinear.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.290
So, we'll try fitting it in
a linear regression anyway.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.550
So, let's call it latlonlm.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.210
And we'll use the LM
command, linear model,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.010
to predict house prices based
on latitude and longitude using

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.319
the Boston data set.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.250
If we take a look at
our linear regression,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.430
we see that r squared is
around 0.1, which is not great.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.450
The latitude is not
significant, which

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.510
means the north-south
differences aren't

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.250
going to be really used at all.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.990
Longitude is significant,
and it's negative.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.940
Which we can interpret as,
as we go towards the oceans--

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.690
we go towards the east-- house
prices decrease linearly.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.330
So this all seems
kind of unlikely,

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.450
but let's work with it.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.380
So let's see how this
linear regression

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.289
model looks on a plot.

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.259
So let's plot the
census tracts again.

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.120
OK.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.620
Now, remember before, we had--
from the previous video--

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.420
we plotted the
above-median house prices.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.350
So we're going to do
that one more time.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:14.130
Median was 21.2.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.390
We had-- the color was red.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.240
And we used solid dots.

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:24.329
Ha.

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:24.890
Oops.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.020
See what I did there?

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.390
I used the plot command,
instead of the points command,

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.390
and it plotted just
the new points.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.820
I meant to plot
the original points

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.750
and use the points
command to plot it

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.090
on top of the existing plot.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.590
OK.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.700
So that's more like it.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.860
So now we have the median values
with the above median value

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.760
census tracts.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.700
So, OK, we want to
see, now, the question

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.310
we're going to
ask, and then plot,

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.510
is what does a linear regression
model think is above median.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.170
So we could just do
this pretty easily.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:13.660
We have latlonlm$fitted.values
and this is what the linear

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.760
regression model predicts for
each of the 506 census tracts.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.970
So we'll plot these on top.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.260
Boston$LON-- take all
the census tracts,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:34.380
such that the latlonlm's fitted
values are above the median.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.630
Take the latitudes, too.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.270
And I'm going to make them blue,
but let's pause for a moment

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.770
and think.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.910
If we use the dots again,
we'll cover up the red dots

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.810
and cover up some
of the black dots.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.060
What we won't be
able to see is where

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.220
the red dots and the
blue dots match up.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.720
You know, we're
interested in seeing

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.370
how the linear regression
matches up with the truth.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.040
So it'd be ideal
if we could plot

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.840
the linear regression blue
dots on top of the red dots,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.470
in some way that we can
still see the red dots.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.300
It turns out that
you can actually

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.980
pass in characters
to this PCH option.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.990
So since we're
talking about money,

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.620
let's plot dollar signs
instead of points.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.970
And there you have it.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.270
So, the linear regression
model has plotted a dollar sign

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.730
for every time it
thinks the census

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.520
tract is above median value.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.990
And you can see
that, indeed, it's

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.390
almost as-- you can
see the sharp line

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.240
that the linear
regression defines.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.270
And how it's pretty
much vertical,

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.530
because remember before,
the latitude variable

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.510
was not very significant
in the regression.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.800
So that's interesting
and pretty wrong.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.260
One thing that
really stands out is

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.240
how it says Boston is
mostly above median.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.200
Even knowing-- we saw it
right from the start--

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.190
there's a big
non-red spot, right

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.540
in the middle of
Boston, where the house

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.750
prices were below the median.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.150
So the linear regression model
isn't really doing a good job.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.740
And it's completely
ignored everything

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.600
to the right side
of the picture.
