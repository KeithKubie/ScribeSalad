[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.214 --> 00:00:06.630
TOM FLETCHER: Thank
you very much.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.860
And thank you all
for coming out today.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.720
And I think what
we're going to do

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.010
on the format is that
I'll just give you

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.750
a quick overview of my
journey to get to this point,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.470
and say a couple of things
about this book which

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.780
I've had to resign to publish.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.761
And so I'll explain
a bit about that.

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:28.260
But what I'm most
interested in then

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.370
is getting the conversation
into more of a Q and A.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.420
But in particular, I've
been doing these events now

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.430
this last week.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.660
And at every single
event, people

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.147
have spoken to me about Google.

00:00:39.147 --> 00:00:40.730
I've been talking
to them about power,

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.280
and they've come right back
at me and talked about Google.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.250
And I really want
to just reflect

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.880
on what that means in terms
of a power transition,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.860
and what there is that we can
do together in that space, what

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.780
the challenges are.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.620
And there are huge challenges
around trust, authenticity,

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.140
and authority there that
I'd love to talk about.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.260
But really just open
it up at that point.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.300
And we can talk about
just about anything

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.740
you'd like to, whether it's
this crazy period of four

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.080
years working with those
three prime ministers--

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.420
the end of Blair, the
whole of Gordon Brown,

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.334
and the first year
of David Cameron.

00:01:22.334 --> 00:01:25.100
Or then the four
years after that,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.850
when I was in Beirut,
and trying to use

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.415
these amazing new tools--
the smartphone superpower--

00:01:31.415 --> 00:01:33.500
to do diplomacy in
a different way,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.920
and to connect with
people in a way

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.490
that we've never been
able to do before.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.311
And I can give you some examples
of how all that happened.

00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:43.810
If you want, we can
go back further.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.250
We can talk about my
life as a failed boxer.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.599
I lost a boxing match
in Nairobi to the mayor,

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:53.140
and they had t-shirts
made up saying,

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.556
Fletcher goes home
on a stretcher,

00:01:54.556 --> 00:01:56.710
which I pretty much did.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.850
We can talk about my
career as a failed lead

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.890
singer for Freshly Squeezed,
very much ahead of their time.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.460
Or indeed, anything
you'd like to cover.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.660
So the book, "Naked Diplomacy,"
clearly no real nudity

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.270
involved.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.260
The idea-- stolen really
from Jamie Oliver--

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.440
is what does diplomacy
look like, in the way

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.360
that he did with cooking.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.950
If you take away all of the
paraphernalia and all the crap

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.200
that holds us back, and we've
constructed around diplomacy--

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.360
which is a very kind
of maps and chaps

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.750
world-- a load of etiquette,
and protocol, and language,

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.090
which I'm arguing isn't helping
us to connect with people.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.040
But in a way, I'm
preaching to the choir

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.550
here, because you're disrupting
us in that space already.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.960
And one of the things
I say to diplomats

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.050
is unless we find a way to
communicate more effectively,

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.580
and to use these new
tools and to strip away

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.880
a lot of this rubbish, the kind
of platitudes about Britain

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.970
and Cambodia have warm,
bilateral relations

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.847
on a range of mutual-- I mean,
that stuff that just switches

00:03:09.847 --> 00:03:10.680
you off immediately.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.630
Unless we can shift all
of that, scrape those

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.900
barnacles off the boat,
then you-- and we often

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.110
use Google in this context--
will disrupt us even more.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.760
And I often ask
people, who do you

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.320
think will be more
powerful in 10 years time,

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.770
Google or Britain?

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.230
Who would you have on the
Security Council in 10 years

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.719
time, Google or Britain?

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:33.760
And increasingly, people--
we do a show of hands.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.976
I won't do it here,
because you're very loyal.

00:03:35.976 --> 00:03:37.395
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:37.395 --> 00:03:40.740
And word would go back
very quickly to Eric

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.360
that whoever voted for Britain.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.430
But the number of hands
that go up for Google

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.540
is increasing every
time I ask the question.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.479
So that's the idea of the
naked in "Naked Diplomacy."

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:57.520
And obviously, because
I'm trying to sell a book,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.830
we do chuck in a few
stories about nudity anyway.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.180
There's a story about when my
son turned up at the PM's house

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.120
as a four-year-old
completely naked,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.172
and the housekeeper came
to the door and said,

00:04:08.172 --> 00:04:10.130
you're the first guest
the prime minster's ever

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.540
had arrive naked.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.400
A sign of how professional the
British foreign service is.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.589
There's a story in there about
the time I was at the G8 Summit

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:22.389
with David Cameron--
his very first summit.

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.430
And I don't know if it's
like this in your world,

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.200
but there's a kind of
physicality and theatricality

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.740
to the way that
leaders interact.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.790
Think of Putin on his horse
and so on, and his tank.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.042
And so I took David Cameron
swimming in the lake at Muskoka

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:36.960
in Canada.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.180
So then we could brief the
other delegations, right?

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.550
There's a new kid on the
block here, strong and young--

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.170
a bit like the Justin
Trudeau effect now.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.160
So we did all that, briefed the
other delegations, fantastic.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.740
Word went round, and when
we arrived at the meeting,

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.750
Obama was feeling his muscles,
and Sarkozy was looking

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.130
a bit jealous, and so on.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.890
Perfect.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.950
And then Berlusconi
saw this and was a bit

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.560
put out that someone else
was stealing that space.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.320
And so he disappeared off and
came back 10 minutes later

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.820
with a stack of
photos of himself

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.786
lightly oiled and wearing a pair
of very, very tight Speedos.

00:05:12.786 --> 00:05:14.160
They were red, I
think-- though I

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.430
don't like to remember
the moment too much.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.180
I've been trying to
forget it ever since--

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.230
and handed them around.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.900
And for the only time
in my experience,

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.191
the leaders of the free world
were completely silenced.

00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:27.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.040
But the only other moment of
nudity in there, I'm afraid,

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.600
is actually more of the
core idea of the book, which

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.320
is that the very greatest
diplomat was actually

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.700
the very first diplomat,
and he was maybe

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.700
almost literally naked.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.630
He was a prehistoric
man, probably a man.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.330
And he was the first
person to convince

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.890
his fellow
Neanderthals to go out

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.550
hunting together rather than
clubbing them over the head.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.240
And that is these two basic
instincts we have for survival.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.250
One, survival of the fittest, to
compete for resource, and one,

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.340
to go out and hunt together.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.820
And at it's basic
essence, that is what

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.320
diplomacy has been ever since.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.470
We're trying to provide those
compromises, the negotiations,

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.680
that help the human
species kind of rub along.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.370
And in the midst of all the
change that you're leading,

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.656
and I don't need
to tell you about,

00:06:23.656 --> 00:06:26.190
my argument is that diplomacy
is going to matter even

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.370
more than ever, because
you'll still need people,

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.888
as we go through this period
of enormous transition,

00:06:31.888 --> 00:06:34.910
fastest changes
ever, you'll still

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.540
need people who
can help societies,

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.570
and states, and businesses,
and ideas rub along.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.770
Because when we've gone through
even remotely similar periods

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.480
of change in the past--
think of the printing press--

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.210
it has led to centuries
of upheaval, and conflict,

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.130
and war, and loss of
life on a massive scale.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.110
So somehow, we're
going to have to deal

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.780
with the consequences of
all this amazing stuff

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.200
that you're doing.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.140
The unintended consequences
of the technological change

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.680
that you are leading will
be huge political and social

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.720
change.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.303
And so we're going
to need some people

00:07:06.303 --> 00:07:09.210
in there trying to help
us navigate through that.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.610
And all that's
happening at a time

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.750
when my business of diplomacy
is itself being disrupted.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.190
I mentioned it's being
disrupted by you guys,

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.560
but it's being disrupted
by many other actors

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.970
in the media, the
businesses that

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.070
have their own foreign policy.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.070
I use the example often
of the Murdoch empire,

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.440
or even of Google, who actually
run a very, very efficient

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.280
foreign policy apparatus.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.100
We're being disrupted
from all sides

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.140
and also from elsewhere
in our own governments.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.640
And so again, we're trying
to find ways to adapt,

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.330
to disrupt ourselves, so we
can still be competitive.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.960
But at the end of the day--
and this has been really

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.750
my journey, my lesson,
coming through Number 10

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:55.250
and feeling that power
drain away, as time sped up,

00:07:55.250 --> 00:08:00.690
and we got adapted to 24/7
media and then social media.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.900
When I started, we cared about
140 words on the Sky ticker.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.450
When I left Number 10, we
cared about 140 characters

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:07.380
on Twitter.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.670
That whole sense of
speeding up, and how hard

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.630
it is now for government to
exercise the power we have.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.777
The result of all
that is that I've

00:08:15.777 --> 00:08:17.360
got to the point
where I've realized--

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.290
and you've worked it out
long before we have--

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.530
that we just simply don't have
the answers behind the wall.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.720
And so we're going
to have to now form

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.510
these different kinds of
coalitions, unusual coalitions,

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.610
in order to crack these
massive problems ahead of us--

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.789
around the next energy
source, around how do we

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:37.960
get 75 million kids
into school and out

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.080
of potentially suicide vests?

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:45.440
How do we find the balance
between security and liberty

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.850
online?

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.410
How do we judge when it's
right to go to war to protect

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:51.520
the most vulnerable?

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.890
Those are all issues that I'm
basically saying, admitting,

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.004
we can't crack.

00:08:57.004 --> 00:08:58.420
And so we're going
to have to find

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.510
ways to work with
these new actors--

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.750
often in competitive space--
but find ways and synergies

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:07.930
to try and crack those
problems together,

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.590
which is really where I'm
most interested in taking

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.130
the conversation later.

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:15.670
If diplomacy didn't
exist, my argument

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.270
is that we would
need to invent it,

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.570
to deal with the consequences
of all this change.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:27.020
But it's now much too important
to leave to the diplomats.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:32.416
So my case is that we need
others, including all of you,

00:09:32.416 --> 00:09:34.960
to think of yourselves
as citizen diplomats,

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.100
to feel that you also
have a responsibility

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.380
to promote
coexistence, to promote

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.750
that idea, like
my naked caveman,

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:48.550
that we can collaborate rather
than compete for resource.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.320
And this matters more than
ever now in the 21st century,

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.430
because the big dividing line
is not north versus south, east

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.680
versus west, rich versus poor.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.750
The big dividing line now-- and
we see it in the Brexit debate,

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.700
we see it in the American
presidential campaign--

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:09.060
is between people who believe
in that coexistence-- rooms

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.300
like this, where you're
collaborating across cultures,

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.600
across races, across
religions, across ideas--

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.820
between those people, the
coexisters and the wall

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:21.350
builders.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.490
And on the wrong
side of the argument,

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.932
you've got Islamic
States, who don't just

00:10:25.932 --> 00:10:27.390
believe in attacking
the West, they

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.810
believe in attacking
the gray zone where

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.990
Islam and Christianity work
together, or live together.

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:34.980
You've got the hard
right in Europe

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.270
becoming louder than ever.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.740
You've got the
hard left in Europe

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.120
becoming louder than ever.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:47.091
And of course, you have the wall
builder in chief, Donald Trump,

00:10:47.091 --> 00:10:50.750
arguing that basically the
answer to the 21st century

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:54.050
is just another layer of
bricks at the top of that wall.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.582
So these arguments
matter more than ever,

00:10:56.582 --> 00:10:58.790
but we need to build a much
bigger and more effective

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.440
coalition than we've
ever had before if we're

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.490
going to find the answers
and the creativity

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.990
and the ingenuity to help
us survive the 21st century.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.170
Sounds a dramatic way
to end it, but I think

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.380
it is as important as that.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.001
Thank you.

00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:18.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.225
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
fascinating introduction.

00:11:20.225 --> 00:11:22.350
One thing you talk about
in your book over and over

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.340
again is this idea
of citizen diplomacy

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.490
and how to avoid
armchair activism.

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:28.910
Can you start there?

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.285
TOM FLETCHER: Yeah.

00:11:30.285 --> 00:11:34.360
So my main worry
about social media

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.200
is the sort of
slacktivism side of it.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.510
In Lebanon, we tried
a number of things

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:43.720
to cut through to people in
completely different ways.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.586
So, for example, when the
Iranian embassy was blown up,

00:11:47.586 --> 00:11:51.440
rather than deliver a speech--
I couldn't go down and shake

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.440
hands with the ambassador
because we didn't have

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.900
diplomatic relations-- I
went down and donated blood

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.890
and then tweeted the photo
and it went viral in Tehran.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.732
And it was one way of
showing the Iranian people

00:12:02.732 --> 00:12:05.190
that what they were being told
about Britain and the West--

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.580
you know, just challenge
it a little bit.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.630
And so we found ways
to do things like that.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:10.700
They were stunts.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.090
And many of my colleagues said
these are just ridiculous,

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:14.190
attention-grabbing stunts.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.727
But they were stunts
that had a purpose.

00:12:16.727 --> 00:12:18.310
We were trying to
use these new tools,

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.018
trying to build that
plane as we flew it,

00:12:20.018 --> 00:12:22.800
to find different ways to reach
out and connect with people

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.020
in a way my
predecessors could never

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.715
have done using
traditional media.

00:12:26.715 --> 00:12:27.840
FEMALE SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.350
TOM FLETCHER: But in that
space that we're competing for,

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.870
you've got obviously
the bad guys.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:35.380
And Islamic State are
doing a fantastic job,

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.210
from their perspective,
of using gaming,

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.270
for example, to
radicalize people.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.970
And then you've got
a bunch of people

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.800
who are just being
distracted, and for whom

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.160
social media is making them a
bit more apathetic, a bit more

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:48.860
cynical.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.820
It's sort of switching them off.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.370
And it's one of the
reasons, I think,

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:56.980
why people are trusting
my world of maps and chaps

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:01.040
and hierarchies even less,
but also why increasingly they

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.880
have less trust in
your world, as well.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.250
Anything that looks
like authority

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.325
just provokes a sort
of cynical backlash.

00:13:08.325 --> 00:13:09.200
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.110
TOM FLETCHER: And
so somehow, we have

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.068
to find a way to ensure
that people aren't just

00:13:12.068 --> 00:13:15.070
using social media
just to flirt or look

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.925
at pictures of cute cats.

00:13:16.925 --> 00:13:18.300
FEMALE SPEAKER:
It's interesting.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.220
So Tom goes through
in great detail

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.680
some of the more arcane
traditions of diplomacy.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.130
And they're insane.

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.600
They're absolutely
insane, right?

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.202
So like letting every
other ambassador

00:13:27.202 --> 00:13:28.910
know that you'll be
leaving the country--

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:29.630
TOM FLETCHER: By fax.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.250
FEMALE SPEAKER: -- by fax,
before you go anywhere.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:31.390
TOM FLETCHER: Yeah.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.540
Including people I've
never met before,

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.010
and have no
intention of meeting.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:36.240
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
I can understand

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.890
why perhaps some of
these things maybe

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.800
should be changed, or
adapted, or adjusted.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.050
TOM FLETCHER: Credentials
is one of the other ones.

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:43.990
When you arrive in a country--

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.160
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Exactly, exactly.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.940
TOM FLETCHER: -- you have this
kind of three-page letter from

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.690
the queen that explains that
you are who you say you are.

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:52.570
Which you could do with
a Google search now.

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:52.990
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:54.450
TOM FLETCHER: And
you wait for a month.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:55.990
And you're not
allowed to start work

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.710
until you've presented your
credentials to the leaders,

00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:59.990
so you lose.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.920
In any other business,
the first 90 days--

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.740
you all know this--
the most important time

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.300
to really establish yourself
and get up and running.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.030
Diplomats are often
spending that time

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:09.520
at home waiting
for the phone call

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.977
from the president's
office to say

00:14:10.977 --> 00:14:13.310
you can come down and present
this bit of paper to them.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:14.685
FEMALE SPEAKER:
So it seems to me

00:14:14.685 --> 00:14:16.170
like some of these
traditions maybe

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.580
should be disrupted
regardless, or were in line

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.230
to be disrupted regardless.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.024
So I look at your
book, and I see

00:14:22.024 --> 00:14:24.440
how much you talk about what
can we do, how can we change,

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.960
how can we disrupt diplomacy?

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.190
And technology helps.

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:28.690
But I also wonder
how much of a role

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.363
your particular
temperament played.

00:14:31.363 --> 00:14:32.154
TOM FLETCHER: Ooph.

00:14:33.975 --> 00:14:35.350
FEMALE SPEAKER:
It seems like you

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.933
have a bit of a disruptive
streak, or a bit of a--

00:14:37.933 --> 00:14:42.610
TOM FLETCHER: You'd have
to ask my former bosses.

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:45.920
I was quite lucky for
a number of reasons.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.400
One was because I'd
worked in Number 10,

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.560
everyone assumed I
had somehow had sign

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.560
off on what I was doing.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.850
And so I could get
away with a bit more

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.800
than I would have
done otherwise.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.980
As you said, I was a bit younger
than most people doing the job,

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.540
so I could do it looking
a little bit less

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.520
than like an uncle dancing
to "YMCA" at a wedding.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.810
At times, I failed on that.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:13.010
And I was also lucky, I
think, because in Lebanon--

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.420
because there's no real state,
there's no real structure,

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.503
there was no one to really
complain about the fact

00:15:17.503 --> 00:15:21.300
that I was being quite critical
of the leaders of the country,

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:25.960
I could again get away with more
outrageous, provocative stuff.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.390
I could pick more arguments.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:30.640
And I needed to pick
arguments, because the people

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:35.112
I was in competition
with there were

00:15:35.112 --> 00:15:37.650
Hizbullah, the Iranian
regime, the Asad regime.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:40.220
Those were the people
who I was fighting

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.990
with on that
digital battlefield.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:44.310
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.030
And you talk a lot
about connection

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.500
rather than connectivity, right?

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.291
So it's very interesting
to see how can you

00:15:49.291 --> 00:15:53.462
forge those real connections and
how can we as citizens do that?

00:15:53.462 --> 00:15:54.920
I think with that,
I might actually

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.990
open it up to the floor,
if that's all right.

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:58.910
Because I, otherwise,
will take up

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:01.560
all of the time
asking questions.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.590
Please wait for the microphone.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.370
you see the nation
state surviving

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:06.500
to the end of the century?

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.680
And if not, who will
diplomats be representing

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.790
at the end of a century?

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:13.747
TOM FLETCHER: I do.

00:16:13.747 --> 00:16:15.330
But mainly because
I don't think we'll

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:17.175
come up with a better idea.

00:16:17.175 --> 00:16:19.300
And there won't be a moment
when people say, right,

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.980
the nation state is now dead.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.920
But I do think that many
individual states won't

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.070
survive.

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.980
And it's interesting now when
you see states existing online

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.812
before offline.

00:16:29.812 --> 00:16:31.590
Kosovo existed on
Google Maps before it

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.956
existed on the real map.

00:16:33.956 --> 00:16:36.430
And so there's a real
challenge to the nation state.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:37.805
And I think what
you will find is

00:16:37.805 --> 00:16:41.460
it's more of a slow ebbing of
power, away from the states

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.520
and away from the systems
of governance we've

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.650
constructed around states.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:48.070
The problem is then, what
do you put in its place?

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.735
So when we had this problem
in 1815, a bunch of people

00:16:51.735 --> 00:16:53.360
like me-- although,
I probably wouldn't

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.797
have been quite from the
right social background

00:16:55.797 --> 00:16:58.130
to have been one of those
people at the time-- just went

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.337
to Vienna for six months,
representing states

00:17:00.337 --> 00:17:01.420
and stitched up the world.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.390
Did the deal that lasted
until the First World War.

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.159
But who do you have
in the room now?

00:17:06.159 --> 00:17:07.950
Do you go to Davos and
try and do it there?

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:08.533
Hopefully not.

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:13.240
The biggest strength we
have as nation states

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.782
is the fact that no one
quite has a better idea yet.

00:17:16.782 --> 00:17:18.240
It's not that nation
states will be

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.162
able to deliver all the
things that people want them

00:17:21.162 --> 00:17:21.745
to themselves.

00:17:24.809 --> 00:17:26.934
AUDIENCE: So
professional diplomats,

00:17:26.934 --> 00:17:28.850
ambassadors, presumably,
were originally there

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.945
to represent kings and
queens and prime ministers

00:17:30.945 --> 00:17:32.820
to other kings and queens
and prime ministers

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.980
because communication
was too slow.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.920
So now, communication is fast.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.300
And kings and queens
and prime ministers

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.051
can talk to each other.

00:17:42.051 --> 00:17:43.926
What's the role of the
professional diplomat?

00:17:46.057 --> 00:17:47.890
TOM FLETCHER: There's
a crossover, actually,

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:49.056
between those two questions.

00:17:49.056 --> 00:17:51.780
Just very briefly, I want to
just tell you that this time

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:56.622
last year, we debated sending
an ambassador to Google.

00:17:56.622 --> 00:17:58.047
And you can see
the logic of that.

00:17:58.047 --> 00:17:59.630
You think, OK, well
Google's coming up

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:00.960
the list of power brokers.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.680
And we clearly have a whole
bunch of issues to debate,

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.500
cooperate on, argue
about with Google.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.990
Arguably, more-- I won't pick
a random country [INAUDIBLE],

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:15.832
but arguably more
than many countries.

00:18:15.832 --> 00:18:18.300
And so we really
thought hard about this,

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.920
but then decided that we
hadn't sent an ambassador

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:26.310
to previous commercial empires
and corporates in the past.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:30.570
And, ultimately, we, as
professional diplomats now,

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.870
represent states still.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.480
The technology point
is really important.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.340
When the telephone came
along, Palmerston, the then

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.610
foreign secretary, said, my god,
this is the end of diplomacy.

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.170
And then when the
fax came along,

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.910
someone joked, well, you can
replace the Foreign Office

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:47.590
with a fax.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:50.310
At every stage-- when
the stirrup came along,

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:54.050
I tell the story in here about
how the horseback riding meant

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:57.380
that one poor Chinese
diplomat in 7th century BC

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.152
was slow-sliced, death
by a thousand cuts.

00:18:59.152 --> 00:19:00.860
FEMALE SPEAKER: This
is a horrific story.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:01.322
It's worth reading.

00:19:01.322 --> 00:19:01.520
Oh my gosh.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.750
TOM FLETCHER: It's kind
of post-watershed story.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:07.937
So there will always
be a new piece of tech.

00:19:07.937 --> 00:19:09.520
And everyone will
say, OK, now leaders

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.686
can talk directly and so on.

00:19:10.686 --> 00:19:12.820
But I would argue,
coming from my world,

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.930
you still need
people on the ground.

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.340
People will say, for example,
now replace the diplomats

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.300
with robots.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.480
And I'm doing a project
at New York University,

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:25.200
can a robot do a better climate
change deal than a diplomat?

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.980
But I would argue
you still need people

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.760
who are curious, and
creative, and have

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.380
this focus on promoting
coexistence on the ground,

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.262
and can speak the
language, and so on.

00:19:35.262 --> 00:19:36.720
I think we still
have a head start.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.440
And there is still a place
for the human in that process.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.140
But only if the human is using
the technology as effectively

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.702
as you are.

00:19:47.702 --> 00:19:48.660
FEMALE SPEAKER: You do.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.650
You list three different kinds
of actors in your book, right?

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:54.020
So those who are obviously
hostile, apparently friendly,

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.200
and then local rivals for
authority and influence.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:59.350
And you put tech companies
in that second bucket,

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:00.820
apparently friendly.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:04.650
Why apparently friendly?

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.984
TOM FLETCHER: I mean, I'll
give an example of a friendly

00:20:06.984 --> 00:20:08.400
and example of an
unfriendly then.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.390
I think-- I've got one
project at the moment

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:13.285
to get 1 million Syrian
kids into school.

00:20:13.285 --> 00:20:17.380
And these are 1 million kids who
are in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.680
Imagine them as future
Google employees

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.410
or imagine them as
future-- what they will

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:25.162
be if they don't go to school.

00:20:25.162 --> 00:20:29.530
And we can't crack that
problem as governments.

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:31.470
And so what we're
trying to do now,

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:35.600
as the Global Business
Coalition, is go out to Uber

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.269
and say, can you help us
with the transport here?

00:20:38.269 --> 00:20:39.810
We're actually not
looking for money.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:42.170
We're not looking for
CSR, in the classic sense.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:45.300
We're looking for your
problem-solving abilities.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.140
We go out to Google
or Facebook and say,

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.180
can you help
provide connectivity

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:50.980
for the classrooms?

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.690
So we can get the devices
and the education--

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:57.030
and the content on the
devices into the kids' hands,

00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:00.330
getting school to kids,
not kids to school.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:04.204
And we're going out to Ikea
and [? Arab ?] and saying,

00:21:04.204 --> 00:21:05.370
can you build the buildings?

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:07.180
Again, don't give us cash.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:11.310
And in support of all that,
we found this brilliant guy

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:14.310
who has recently sold his
tech company in California,

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:17.680
who is not giving us half
his profits, but is giving us

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.559
now three days a month trying
to design the internet dating

00:21:21.559 --> 00:21:23.350
technology-- that means
we can match people

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.200
who want to help
with people who need

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.699
the help in both directions.

00:21:26.699 --> 00:21:28.240
So there's a whole
ton of stuff there

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.860
where we're clearly
on the same side.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.814
But then if you look at a lot of
the security stuff-- and Apple

00:21:33.814 --> 00:21:35.480
have obviously been
in the midst of this

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.180
recently-- that
it's competitive.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.410
And it will have to
be because the second

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.370
that the big tech
companies are seen

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.570
to be too close to
government, then

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:49.970
you're going to be pretty
quickly disrupted yourselves.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:51.575
So there's a natural
friction there

00:21:51.575 --> 00:21:53.037
and a natural competition.

00:21:53.037 --> 00:21:55.120
I also think-- another of
competition, by the way.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.786
I was at Cambridge
University yesterday.

00:21:56.786 --> 00:22:00.240
And this room, I'm sure,
is an example of this.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.596
You're going to be hoovering
up the best talent.

00:22:02.596 --> 00:22:04.380
We can't recruit the
best people anymore

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.300
because they want to
go and work at Google.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.000
FEMALE SPEAKER: Interesting.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.250
TOM FLETCHER: That's a
very direct competition.

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:12.315
We can't pay them
as much as you can.

00:22:12.315 --> 00:22:14.440
And they're also saying
this is where the power is.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.250
We want to go where
the action is.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.000
FEMALE SPEAKER: So do
you think it's power

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.409
or do you think it's interest?

00:22:19.409 --> 00:22:20.950
TOM FLETCHER: And
interest, I'm sure.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.472
And also, your canteen
is much better than ours.

00:22:23.472 --> 00:22:26.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:26.640
Yeah.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:26.900
FEMALE SPEAKER: Fabulous.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.266
More questions from the floor?

00:22:28.266 --> 00:22:29.668
We've got one at the back.

00:22:29.668 --> 00:22:31.042
So if you could
wait for the mic.

00:22:36.537 --> 00:22:37.370
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:39.470
We're seeing the erosion
of the traditional nation

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:42.910
state in this move towards
direct digital democracy.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.380
But if you look at
the recent thing

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:48.020
about the naming of a boat and
Boaty McBoatface and all that,

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.850
is our people actually ready
for that responsibility?

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:52.800
And as real world,
it's even more scary

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.040
than Mr. Trump due to the
kind of frivolous nature

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.491
of social media.

00:22:57.491 --> 00:22:59.240
TOM FLETCHER: It's a
really good question.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.948
It's a question that's
always been asked,

00:23:00.948 --> 00:23:03.530
of course, at every
stage of political change

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:04.970
and democratization.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:07.690
And in the book, I've got
some kind of great quotes

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:09.250
from old diplomats
basically saying,

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:12.410
the problem with
newspapers is that people

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:14.510
will think they have some
influence over diplomacy

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:15.009
and so on.

00:23:15.009 --> 00:23:16.700
And TV as well.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.150
My argument is that if you
think the bottom line of my job,

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:23.010
of diplomacy, is
trying to prevent

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:24.552
people of [? dying ?] conflict.

00:23:24.552 --> 00:23:26.510
It's a very simple way
of trying to capture it.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:30.924
And at every moment when there's
been a greater democratization,

00:23:30.924 --> 00:23:33.090
where more people have had
greater oversight of what

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:36.650
I do, or we do in my
world, fewer people

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:37.700
have died violently.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.170
And we're now, of
course, 200 times less

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:42.820
likely to die violently
than 100 years ago.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.590
So I see it on balance
as a positive thing.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:51.590
The empowerment of the
mob is a positive thing.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.820
But it does make my job harder.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.740
And August 2013 is
a classic example

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.970
of that, the debate over whether
we should bomb Bashar al-Assad.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:02.620
Under the old rules, governments
had decided we'd do it.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:05.420
US, UK, in we go.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:09.020
But, of course, the
reality was different.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.429
Post-Iraq, but also
in a social media

00:24:11.429 --> 00:24:13.220
age when people are
commenting in real time

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.400
about the decisions
you're taking,

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.036
the UK parliament said no.

00:24:17.036 --> 00:24:20.780
And then, that gave Obama
reason to pause, and in the end,

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:21.940
not to do it either.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:25.007
And so, on balance, who knows?

00:24:25.007 --> 00:24:25.840
May be a good thing.

00:24:28.615 --> 00:24:30.740
The problem with making
judgments in foreign policy

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.654
is, of course, you
never have hindsight.

00:24:32.654 --> 00:24:34.320
But it's an example
of how actually it's

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:39.480
harder if you're in the more
transparent West-- it's harder

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.050
to do diplomacy because you
can't bluff in the same way.

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:44.170
You can't win that-- kind
of that hand of poker

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:47.590
against the more
autocratic regimes

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:50.182
and against the Russians.

00:24:50.182 --> 00:24:52.640
FEMALE SPEAKER: I did like that
you note that not only does

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.780
Putin ride horseback, but
he has the biggest plane.

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:57.442
TOM FLETCHER: He has, by
far, the biggest plane.

00:24:57.442 --> 00:24:58.630
FEMALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]
diplomatic summit.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:59.980
TOM FLETCHER: You can read
all sorts of things into that.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.402
But [INAUDIBLE] has a
pretty big plane, as well.

00:25:02.402 --> 00:25:03.860
We arrived at one
summit on a plane

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.270
we borrowed from Led Zeppelin.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:11.700
And it had leopard skin
seats and stuff like that.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.760
I think now the UK
prime minister is now

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.120
allowed his own plane at last.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.155
And about time, too.

00:25:19.155 --> 00:25:20.554
Long overdue.

00:25:20.554 --> 00:25:22.470
FEMALE SPEAKER: More
questions from the floor.

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:24.840
Got one over here, please.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.410
AUDIENCE: So we
see, as governments,

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:31.555
tend to lean more
on digital tools,

00:25:31.555 --> 00:25:33.320
that you enable them
to reach whatever

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.450
they got-- their goals.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.770
You know, with this whole
digital age thing coming about.

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:44.030
How would you think the cyber
warfare aspect of things

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:45.970
and the cyber espionage
type of things

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:50.520
will affect diplomacy
and also the transparency

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:54.087
within governments and
certain regimes, et cetera?

00:25:54.087 --> 00:25:55.920
TOM FLETCHER: It's a
really important point.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:00.710
And I think one of my great
worries is that, at the moment,

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:07.250
as a result of Iraq, of Edward
Snowden, of Julian Assange,

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:12.756
the public doesn't actually
trust us enough with their data

00:26:12.756 --> 00:26:16.340
to give us the power
we need to take

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:20.510
on the bad guys in that space.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.620
And when we're
looking for evidence

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.260
of terrorist's planning and
so on, what we're looking for

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.220
is the needle in the haystack.

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.094
You've got to be able
to look through the hay

00:26:28.094 --> 00:26:29.064
in order to find it.

00:26:29.064 --> 00:26:31.230
And that's going to become
harder and harder because

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:34.492
of that loss of
trust in government.

00:26:34.492 --> 00:26:35.950
And so somehow--
and it's something

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:37.552
I'm trying to do
in the book a bit--

00:26:37.552 --> 00:26:39.510
somehow we have to try
and make the case afresh

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:43.470
to people for why we can
be trusted-- why we're not

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.780
some great kind of
Watergate-type conspiracy

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:49.090
and all we really want to
do is read your emails.

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:52.750
But I think we're losing
that argument at the moment.

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:56.610
And that is a threat to
our collective survival

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:59.770
because it gives an
advantage to people

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:04.180
who want to threaten and
terrorize our societies.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.540
By the way though,
one of the best

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.660
follows I'd recommend on
Twitter at the moment is GCHQ.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.660
CIA were great when they
first came on, as well.

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:15.690
But imagine if you're
trying to design a Twitter

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:17.480
account for a spy agency.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.390
[INAUDIBLE] an interview
to try and challenge you.

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:24.800
And the trick is, of
course, to just find

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.000
a way to be authentic.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.790
And GCHQ tweets math puzzles
and say, we love math.

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:33.170
Can you try this out
and see if you're

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:34.960
clever enough to work for us?

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.294
But also, they're proud of
their history, quite rightly.

00:27:37.294 --> 00:27:38.960
And so they tweet
stuff from the history

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.250
of-- that they can talk about.

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.830
And I think that's a pretty
effective Twitter account.

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:44.847
And if you like math
puzzles, they're great.

00:27:44.847 --> 00:27:46.180
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's fabulous.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.580
I have a quick question about
the Official Secrets Act.

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.280
So your book has gone through
the Official Secrets Act.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.960
What was that like?

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.192
TOM FLETCHER: It wasn't too bad.

00:27:55.192 --> 00:27:57.650
Actually, I used to do this--
when I was inside government,

00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:59.108
one of the things
I used to oversee

00:27:59.108 --> 00:28:01.565
was clearing of books
by rogue diplomats.

00:28:01.565 --> 00:28:05.150
And so I kind of knew
where the line was.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.640
And I've taken out
lots of kind of very

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.570
salacious and racy stuff
from other people's books.

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:15.150
Clearly, you can't talk
about specific examples

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.270
of intelligence work.

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:18.372
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:28:18.372 --> 00:28:20.455
TOM FLETCHER: I think you
have to be a bit careful

00:28:20.455 --> 00:28:23.420
if you're talking about
serving leaders, quite rightly,

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.980
especially if you're
talking about--

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.645
if I was spilling the beans--
I'm sorry, it's not in here--

00:28:27.645 --> 00:28:29.270
it would make a more
interesting book--

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:33.050
if I was spilling the beans
on what David Cameron thought

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:35.270
of Angela Merkel.

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:37.409
I think someone in government
should take that out,

00:28:37.409 --> 00:28:37.950
to be honest.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:41.930
Because that's not going to--
it's fun, it's salacious,

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:45.040
but it's not going
to help anyone.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:49.444
So I was trying to stay on
the right side of that line

00:28:49.444 --> 00:28:50.360
when I was writing it.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.568
In fact, in the end, the
one thing that got taken out

00:28:52.568 --> 00:28:55.950
was a reference
to representation.

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:57.930
And it's quite an
academic thing, this.

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:02.080
I was saying I didn't feel I was
just Her Majesty's Ambassador,

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.030
HMA.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:05.810
But I felt like I was the
British people's ambassador.

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:09.610
I was representing Bond,
and Beckham, and Benedict

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:12.834
Cumberbatch, and
all the rest of it.

00:29:12.834 --> 00:29:16.440
And the feeling was
that that might not

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.064
go down well with the palace.

00:29:19.064 --> 00:29:20.480
I've discussed it
with the palace.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.000
They're quite relaxed.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.460
They do you feel that
that's what ambassadors do,

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.150
you represent the
wider national brand.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.520
And that it's as important
to represent that soft power

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:32.180
as it is to represent--
to judge your power by how

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:33.385
many bullets you can sell.

00:29:33.385 --> 00:29:34.510
FEMALE SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:35.780
More questions from the floor.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.520
AUDIENCE: So how do you
evaluate a diplomat?

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.060
It was mentioned
in the introduction

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:43.464
that you were one of the
youngest ambassadors out there.

00:29:43.464 --> 00:29:45.755
I always imagine that diplomacy
is a very hierarchical,

00:29:45.755 --> 00:29:46.892
I guess, industry.

00:29:46.892 --> 00:29:47.850
There are no shortcuts.

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:50.110
You have to do your
time as a junior attache

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:54.156
in some [INAUDIBLE] country,
and again, and again, and so on.

00:29:54.156 --> 00:29:56.577
So can you comment on that?

00:29:56.577 --> 00:29:58.160
TOM FLETCHER: It is
very hierarchical.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.850
It's opening up.

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:03.690
And so you've got lots of
slightly younger people coming

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:05.024
through slightly earlier.

00:30:05.024 --> 00:30:06.940
Although, it's very
striking for me moving out

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.270
of a business
where I always felt

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:09.853
I was the youngest
person in the room.

00:30:09.853 --> 00:30:11.750
And now, I'm kind of
doing things [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.550
and I'm the oldest in the room.

00:30:16.424 --> 00:30:18.590
Much like anyone else, you
get evaluated every year.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:20.534
You get an annual appraisal.

00:30:20.534 --> 00:30:24.652
And they will look at
the key competencies.

00:30:24.652 --> 00:30:26.193
I guess you go
through similar thing.

00:30:26.193 --> 00:30:29.650
You had working with others,
leadership, problem-solving,

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:30.647
and so on.

00:30:30.647 --> 00:30:32.730
I've just done a big review
of the Foreign Office.

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:35.200
And what we're trying
to re-orientate towards

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.810
is looking at the
skills as well.

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:39.830
We've gone a bit too far in
the direction of competencies

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:40.960
and away from the skills.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.610
So we need to get
back to evaluating

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:44.870
people's courage, and
creativity, and curiosity,

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:45.800
and so on.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:50.516
Those things that have always
made diplomats very, very good.

00:30:50.516 --> 00:30:52.390
You go through-- there's
an assessment center

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:54.770
kind of halfway through your
career, which is very, very

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.170
hard to get through.

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:57.590
Before you become
a diplomat, you

00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:00.130
have a year of being
tested and assessed.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:02.270
And they go out--
maybe this is something

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:05.110
that Google in its terribly
sinister way is now doing.

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:08.470
But they used to go
out and talk to-- you'd

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:11.479
give them three names from your
life of people who knew you.

00:31:11.479 --> 00:31:13.520
They would ask those three
people for three more,

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:14.850
and then, three
more, three more.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:17.130
They'd fan out until they got
to people who you didn't really

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:17.890
know.

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:20.348
And then they would ask the
truth about what you were like.

00:31:20.348 --> 00:31:22.690
And then, they'd get you
back in and say, so that time

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:25.180
at that youth
hostel in Jerusalem,

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:28.540
on the roof when this happened--
and you'd be so shocked.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.350
The whole idea of
that was that they

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:32.764
wanted to ensure that you
weren't black mailable.

00:31:32.764 --> 00:31:34.180
They weren't going
to kick you out

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.930
because you'd smoked
something funny at some stage

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:39.820
or you'd spent the night with
someone funny at some stage.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:43.780
It was all about ensuring
they had all the information

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.800
that our opponents could
otherwise use to blackmail you.

00:31:49.174 --> 00:31:50.340
FEMALE SPEAKER: Fascinating.

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.703
Question just behind.

00:31:51.703 --> 00:31:53.197
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
one of the things

00:31:53.197 --> 00:31:55.030
that struck me when you
were talking earlier

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.350
about the culture that
you wanted to build

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:59.580
seemed very similar to Google.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.080
We want a collaborative
environment.

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.410
And we're quite fanatical
about protecting that.

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:05.300
And if we start to
see that it's shifting

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:09.200
in one direction or another,
we have entire departments

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.340
dedicated to that.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:16.055
How do diplomats think
about shaping culture?

00:32:16.055 --> 00:32:17.430
And is there stuff
we could learn

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:19.884
from you guys, or vice-versa?

00:32:19.884 --> 00:32:21.300
TOM FLETCHER: I
think actually one

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:26.860
thing that British diplomats do
very well is share information.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.910
You'd think in
most institutions,

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:31.512
like the Foreign Office, there'd
be a hoarding of information.

00:32:31.512 --> 00:32:33.928
And that's the kind of classic,
kind of hierarchical thing

00:32:33.928 --> 00:32:35.000
to do.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.245
And I can pretty much guarantee
that this morning, our

00:32:40.245 --> 00:32:42.190
[INAUDIBLE], our
ambassador in New York,

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:43.980
is going into the
Security Council

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:46.760
with more information than
anyone else in the room.

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.435
Because he will have
read this morning

00:32:49.435 --> 00:32:50.810
reports-- we call
them telegrams,

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:52.643
but they're really like
kind of long emails;

00:32:52.643 --> 00:32:57.650
they're not really telegrams--
from all the relevant countries

00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:59.787
that they're debating
that day in the hall.

00:32:59.787 --> 00:33:01.620
And he'll have got a
message from Number 10.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:03.619
He'll have got messages
from the Foreign Office.

00:33:03.619 --> 00:33:06.750
And his people have
curated all that data

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:09.420
in a way that means he's
got that head start.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.690
It's amazing how often,
as a British diplomat,

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:13.400
other diplomats come
to you to ask what's

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.560
happening in their
capital, because they're

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.160
hoarding information to
a much greater degree.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:23.100
So that, I think, is perhaps
the key thing, the key strength

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.740
that I would try to
take from the world I

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:29.130
was in into other worlds.

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:30.750
AUDIENCE: Does the
lobbying industry

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:33.950
provide an effective diplomacy
channel for non-state actors

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:36.376
like Google to nation states?

00:33:38.895 --> 00:33:40.270
TOM FLETCHER: I
think it's making

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:42.480
lots of people very rich.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.620
I think there's lots that
I try to use in the book

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.390
that we can learn from
watching lobbyists

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:49.420
and how they operate
in order to be

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:53.596
better diplomatic lobbyists,
which is one of the core things

00:33:53.596 --> 00:33:55.230
that we do.

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:58.500
I was frustrated in Number
10 that in four years

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.150
I was lobbied a lot
by arms dealers,

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:03.840
but I wasn't lobbied
anything like enough by NGOs.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.270
And yesterday, I went to talk
to a group of NGOs to say,

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:08.949
here's how you can
be more effective.

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:12.070
Here are the moments when
you can really change

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:14.902
our views inside government.

00:34:14.902 --> 00:34:17.279
I think that lobbyists,
they wouldn't

00:34:17.279 --> 00:34:19.070
exist if they weren't
moderately effective.

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:21.500
But they're much less
effective than they tell you

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.199
when they're pitching.

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:25.880
AUDIENCE: You talked there
about summarizing information,

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.810
and Google's always
tried to make information

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:29.770
accessible by
making it searchable

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:33.090
so you can access everything
with the right search phrases.

00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:35.880
Whereas, what you
described for ambassadors

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.670
was much more about really
effective summarization.

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:41.469
Do you think there's things
that either side could do better

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:42.449
in that?

00:34:42.449 --> 00:34:43.240
TOM FLETCHER: Yeah.

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:47.360
I mean, we're [? woeful ?]
at knowledge management.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.600
And so when I used to go
and meet a Lebanese warlord,

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.290
he'd been there for
30 years and would

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:54.955
have basically in
his head the kind

00:34:54.955 --> 00:34:56.580
of Rolodex of all
his previous contacts

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:59.306
with British ambassadors.

00:34:59.306 --> 00:35:03.120
And I would be going in
there without any of that.

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.680
We haven't found
a really good way

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:08.009
to conserve the data, the
knowledge that we have.

00:35:08.009 --> 00:35:09.550
And so again, one
of the things we're

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:11.008
trying to do at
New York University

00:35:11.008 --> 00:35:14.080
now is build like a diplopedia,
which is almost your knowledge

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.800
archive as an institution.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.480
And so that when
you go to a meeting,

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.470
you have a kind of
diplobot, or an app,

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:23.970
or a gadget that basically
runs through it and tells you,

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:25.490
OK, this is the guy.

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:27.180
10 years ago, he did this.

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:29.500
15 years ago, he told
the ambassador this.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.380
This is the time
that he mucked up.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.190
This is the time that
he screwed us over.

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:35.106
This is the time that
he collaborated with us.

00:35:35.106 --> 00:35:37.810
And it just gives you
a much better sense

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:42.029
of your historical relationship
with that individual.

00:35:42.029 --> 00:35:43.820
So that's something I
think we could really

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:47.070
learn from the outside world.

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:50.587
The reality is that Google
is doing that for us

00:35:50.587 --> 00:35:51.170
at the moment.

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:55.726
Google is our best tool
for that at the moment.

00:35:55.726 --> 00:35:58.000
And yet, still inside the
Foreign Office-- I mean,

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:58.530
this is the problem.

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:00.905
If you Google "Naked Diplomat"
inside the Foreign Office,

00:36:00.905 --> 00:36:05.410
you get the hand saying
inappropriate content.

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:07.750
But you find everyone
in the Foreign Office

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:09.066
using Google a huge amount.

00:36:09.066 --> 00:36:10.440
FEMALE SPEAKER:
It's interesting.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.170
I think the question
really around how do you

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:13.607
summarize, and
collate, and access

00:36:13.607 --> 00:36:15.190
the right bits of
institutional memory

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:17.920
at the right time is
absolutely incredible.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.460
I think though,
it's very difficult,

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:22.130
this warlord with
all of his memories.

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:25.462
If you were to look
at those in the whole,

00:36:25.462 --> 00:36:26.920
there'd be far too
much information

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.370
to ever ingest or use usefully.

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:31.865
It's the situational and
context clues, isn't it?

00:36:31.865 --> 00:36:32.130
TOM FLETCHER: Yeah.

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:33.830
That's why if you can
be the person that

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:35.930
can curate that
knowledge and work out

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:39.241
what to do with it, that is
a position of real power now,

00:36:39.241 --> 00:36:39.740
I think.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:40.970
FEMALE SPEAKER: Interesting.

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:43.810
AUDIENCE: You said you'd
talked about sending

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:45.480
an ambassador to Google.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.890
And I guess the answer
was certainly not yet.

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:52.290
What would be the trigger that
would actually make it happen?

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.200
TOM FLETCHER: Yeah.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.110
I mean, I think in
reality what would happen

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:57.550
is you'd send a representative.

00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:58.966
It wouldn't
necessarily be someone

00:36:58.966 --> 00:37:01.370
who would be called an
ambassador because that then

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:04.680
basically suggests the
nation state is finished

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.050
and you're looking at
different model, in which case,

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:09.591
people would say, well, why is
it the British government that

00:37:09.591 --> 00:37:13.620
chooses to send one or not?

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:15.790
I think what you will
see happening-- I mean,

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:18.900
we already have a really
good consul general in LA,

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:19.930
for example.

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:24.960
I think you'll find that
those hubs near where

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.442
tech companies are will
grow and grow and grow.

00:37:27.442 --> 00:37:29.650
And you'll increasingly send
better and better people

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:32.620
to those places because
it's a recognition

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.870
that that's where
the arguments are

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:36.170
and the potential ideas are.

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:39.240
The problem for us
inside government

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.560
is we still-- we're
still effectively saying

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.822
to tech companies,
I think, OK, here

00:37:44.822 --> 00:37:46.030
are the issues we care about.

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:48.070
Please come into
our conversation.

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:51.400
And I imagine that that's
a bit of a turnoff.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.120
We've got to find
ways to say, OK,

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.455
what are the things
we can crack together?

00:37:55.455 --> 00:37:59.670
What are the problems
we can solve together?

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:01.105
But I don't know.

00:38:01.105 --> 00:38:02.730
This debate about
should Google come on

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:05.012
to the Security Council?

00:38:05.012 --> 00:38:07.647
That would be a trigger
to send someone to Google.

00:38:07.647 --> 00:38:10.515
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:10.515 --> 00:38:11.056
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:11.056 --> 00:38:13.410
You said that the
role of diplomats

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:17.800
is to foster cooperation
and sort of lightly touched

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.651
on the topic of Brexit.

00:38:20.651 --> 00:38:24.090
What do you think
about EU and what

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:26.670
would happen to
diplomacy if the UK were

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:27.940
to leave or not to leave?

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:29.520
What do you think should happen?

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.920
TOM FLETCHER: When
I used to advise PMs

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.420
before press
conferences, I'd always

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.797
say, be careful towards the
end of the press conference

00:38:36.797 --> 00:38:38.380
because that's when
you start to relax

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.810
and that's when you kind
of let your guard down

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:41.351
and give the answer you
weren't planning to.

00:38:41.351 --> 00:38:43.225
And this is the end of
the week of book tour.

00:38:43.225 --> 00:38:45.270
This is the last
event, actually.

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:46.327
So I arrived conscious.

00:38:46.327 --> 00:38:47.910
All right, I'm not
going to go and say

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:51.080
the wrong thing on Brexit.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.460
So forgive me for
being-- all my stuff

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:55.580
is about being open
and honest and more

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.439
transparent about what we do.

00:38:57.439 --> 00:38:59.230
Except when it comes
to my views on Brexit,

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.610
where I've spent the whole
week trying not to answer

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:03.192
that question.

00:39:03.192 --> 00:39:06.927
I'm really worried about
the way the debate has gone.

00:39:06.927 --> 00:39:09.010
I don't think that Britain
is a country that needs

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:10.093
to be scared of the world.

00:39:10.093 --> 00:39:14.050
And the debate, I
fear, on both sides

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:17.960
has been much-- far too
much characterized by fear.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:21.100
We must leave Europe because
those terribly frightening

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:24.762
people in Brussels are
dominating our lives.

00:39:24.762 --> 00:39:26.970
Or, we must stay in Europe
because if we don't, we'll

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:28.420
never survive in
the 21st century.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:32.240
I don't believe
either of those views.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:36.030
The country I was representing--
trying to represent in Lebanon

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:37.960
was much more confident,
and outward-looking,

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:42.549
and aware of its role in
the world and its history.

00:39:42.549 --> 00:39:45.700
We've been at our best when
we've been outward-looking,

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:51.046
and open-minded, and sought
new ideas and markets.

00:39:51.046 --> 00:39:53.254
You see, I'm not answering
the question at all, am I?

00:39:53.254 --> 00:39:54.182
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:54.182 --> 00:40:01.180
But as I said earlier on, I'm
up for coexistence and opposed

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.330
to building walls.

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:05.352
And so that gives
you a bit of a clue.

00:40:05.352 --> 00:40:06.284
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:06.284 --> 00:40:09.850
I should explain why I'm not
answering the question, which

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:12.941
is that we're in a period
called Purdah where

00:40:12.941 --> 00:40:15.030
current civil servants
and recently resigned

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:17.460
civil servants aren't
supposed to give

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.355
a view on the referendum.

00:40:19.355 --> 00:40:21.230
So, sorry, that's why
I have to be so boring.

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:23.605
FEMALE SPEAKER: If we perhaps
took a step back and looked

00:40:23.605 --> 00:40:25.330
at things a little
bit more abstractly,

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:31.880
as opposed to talking about
Brexit directly-- let's just

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.567
say we took one step back.

00:40:33.567 --> 00:40:35.150
TOM FLETCHER: You
should be on the TV.

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:36.461
This is [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:36.461 --> 00:40:38.210
FEMALE SPEAKER: You
know, I do what I can.

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:43.165
But I have a genuine question
around unpicking the EU,

00:40:43.165 --> 00:40:45.500
or unpicking any set of
complicated agreements

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:48.850
is probably outside of
something I'm capable of doing

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:50.369
as an informed citizen.

00:40:50.369 --> 00:40:51.160
TOM FLETCHER: Yeah.

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:54.110
FEMALE SPEAKER: So if we're
looking at not Brexit,

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:57.560
but a complicated set
of external engagements

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:00.656
and agreements, what's the
role for citizen diplomacy

00:41:00.656 --> 00:41:01.780
or citizen democracy there?

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:04.480
How can we meaningfully
and relevantly engage?

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.600
And to what extent can we
meaningfully or relevantly

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.622
engage?

00:41:08.622 --> 00:41:10.300
TOM FLETCHER: It's
true, actually.

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.200
I mean, I think
that's, in a way,

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.370
a reason why either
outcome actually

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:18.900
will have lots of officials
kind of licking their lips,

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:22.150
because there will be a
real job for them to do.

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:25.420
And in a situation where
we, for example, we

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:28.166
were dealing with Brexit,
there'd be masses of work.

00:41:28.166 --> 00:41:29.540
And yet, it would
have to be done

00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:32.410
by the professional diplomats.

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:35.530
So they would be at
the center of things,

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:37.130
actually, in that context.

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:39.582
FEMALE SPEAKER: But how can
citizens make those choices

00:41:39.582 --> 00:41:40.165
and decisions?

00:41:43.932 --> 00:41:45.640
TOM FLETCHER: That's
a really good point.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:51.360
I would hope that anyone
running that negotiation

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:54.150
would be trying to find ways to
engage people and involve them

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:57.006
more in the decisions
we would need to take,

00:41:57.006 --> 00:42:01.640
so that it wouldn't all
be done behind the curtain

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.460
by the institutions.

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:07.550
But I think also,
as individuals,

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:10.020
you would need to be challenging
government at that moment.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:15.550
And saying, that vote--
whichever way the Brexit

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:18.696
vote goes, the public have
basically been saying,

00:42:18.696 --> 00:42:21.600
we're fed up of everything
we've stitched up in this way.

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:25.140
We want more of a say
over where power is going

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:26.250
and how it's exercised.

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:27.750
So hopefully that
gives people a bit

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:29.934
more leverage with
government to hold

00:42:29.934 --> 00:42:32.100
them to account and to
influence specific decisions,

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:34.464
rather than waiting every
five years for an election.

00:42:34.464 --> 00:42:35.380
FEMALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:37.921
TOM FLETCHER: But that's going
to take more direct democracy.

00:42:37.921 --> 00:42:40.320
FEMALE SPEAKER: Time for
another two questions.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.960
One in the back row.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:49.050
AUDIENCE: Can you follow
up about agreements

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:53.910
like TTIP that are being
negotiated in secret and people

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:57.290
do not really have any
influence about that?

00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:00.460
And a second one would
be similar to this

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:03.940
because-- and touching
also on the surveillance--

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:06.940
because we have seen in the
past that surveillance has

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:11.110
been abused time and again
to actually stop people

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:13.360
from having an influence.

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:15.079
So can you comment
on that please?

00:43:15.079 --> 00:43:15.870
TOM FLETCHER: Yeah.

00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:17.425
I mean, I think
on the second one,

00:43:17.425 --> 00:43:19.630
it comes back to the point
about how difficult it

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:25.040
is for us to build the trust we
need to keep people secure now.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.390
Because we don't
have a great history

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:30.911
of doing it in the right way.

00:43:30.911 --> 00:43:32.410
I mean, generally,
in my experience,

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:39.141
having been in that world,
if you go down to Cheltenham,

00:43:39.141 --> 00:43:41.640
where we have our government
communication headquarters that

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.870
does the monitoring
work, you will

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:48.260
find a bunch of people who
are incredibly motivated,

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:54.890
and real public servants,
and very professional.

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:59.460
And I just wish there was a
way of almost demonstrating

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:02.640
that more effectively, of
showing that, actually, there

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.610
are strong values at the heart
of many of these institutions.

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:07.790
But it's a very
difficult argument

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:10.620
to win while being
secretive about--

00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:14.526
and [INAUDIBLE] be
secretive about what you do.

00:44:14.526 --> 00:44:17.239
There will always be a role
for secrecy in the negotiations

00:44:17.239 --> 00:44:18.030
on the first point.

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:21.770
And there's always a role--
the Iran deal was done mainly

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:22.800
in secret.

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.240
You know, I wasn't in the
room live tweeting the Iran

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.930
deal-- just as well.

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:29.780
So there is still
a part of diplomacy

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:31.550
which has to be confidential.

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:33.926
Just as, you know, there's
a part of your world

00:44:33.926 --> 00:44:35.800
when you're negotiating
to buy a company that

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:38.740
has to be done in secret.

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:43.764
And that won't go
away any time soon.

00:44:43.764 --> 00:44:45.180
My argument in the
book is that we

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:47.676
have to find a way to
try to explain that,

00:44:47.676 --> 00:44:49.630
to communicate with
people to explain

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:51.690
why it has to be secret,
rather than just saying,

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:53.730
it's all a bit too complicated.

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:55.110
FEMALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:56.880
One more question.

00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:01.110
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
citizen diplomacy before.

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:03.220
What would you recommend,
or what is there

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:08.410
that we can actually do now to
fight against building walls

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:11.890
and our ideas for the world?

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:12.890
FEMALE SPEAKER: Amazing.

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:13.960
Amazing to finish on.

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:15.959
TOM FLETCHER: Yeah,
brilliant note to finish on.

00:45:15.959 --> 00:45:18.440
I think, pick the
right argument.

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:21.092
Take on the people who are on
the wrong side of the argument.

00:45:21.092 --> 00:45:23.300
Think about how you can use
the smartphone superpower

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:26.590
that you have to get into
those debates in the right way.

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:31.120
Don't just assume that someone
else will do that for you.

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:33.510
But you're doing
this all already.

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:35.760
I mean, being kind of
curious and open-minded

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:38.170
about the world, and
taking on those people who

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:41.899
are getting more and more
narrow and introverted.

00:45:41.899 --> 00:45:43.065
Joining the right campaigns.

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:50.417
As you are doing,
building the ideas

00:45:50.417 --> 00:45:52.750
that we don't yet know we
need but will soon find out we

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:54.980
can't live without.

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:58.070
And then really, taking
on these big challenges

00:45:58.070 --> 00:45:59.940
I mentioned, around
the next energy source,

00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:05.970
around what we do about managing
the new weapons, the debates

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:09.682
about when we go to war and when
we don't go to war, the debates

00:46:09.682 --> 00:46:11.640
around the balance between
security and liberty

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.340
that we've touched on online.

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:17.020
Those are all debates that
you should clearly all be in

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:19.420
and that shouldn't just be
happening behind the wall.

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:22.170
So I'd basically say,
seize the smartphone.

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:24.009
Get stuck in.

00:46:24.009 --> 00:46:25.050
FEMALE SPEAKER: Fabulous.

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:26.560
Tom, thank you very
much for coming.

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:27.240
[? His book ?] is
"Naked Diplomacy."

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:27.895
TOM FLETCHER: Thank you.

00:46:27.895 --> 00:46:28.728
Thank you very much.

00:46:28.728 --> 00:46:30.230
[APPLAUSE]
