I think the curiosity is high only

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:07.790
I think the curiosity is high only
 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.419
I think the curiosity is high only
undervalued phenomenon if you will

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429
undervalued phenomenon if you will
 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.899
undervalued phenomenon if you will
because you can't really always explain

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:14.909
because you can't really always explain
 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:16.460
because you can't really always explain
it sure there's some base things that

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470
it sure there's some base things that
 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.900
it sure there's some base things that
we're curious of Howard gears about

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910
we're curious of Howard gears about
 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.790
we're curious of Howard gears about
eating work here is around other people

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800
eating work here is around other people
 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.830
eating work here is around other people
but sometimes we're curious about things

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840
but sometimes we're curious about things
 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.240
but sometimes we're curious about things
that we just can't explain to ourselves

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250
that we just can't explain to ourselves
 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.300
that we just can't explain to ourselves
and that's something that we shouldn't

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310
and that's something that we shouldn't
 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.020
and that's something that we shouldn't
underestimate because that is a force

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.030
underestimate because that is a force
 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.060
underestimate because that is a force
that draws us into the world unlike any

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070
that draws us into the world unlike any
 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.360
that draws us into the world unlike any
other you can't fake curiosity if you're

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370
other you can't fake curiosity if you're
 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.560
other you can't fake curiosity if you're
curious about something you're curious

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570
curious about something you're curious
 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.120
curious about something you're curious
about it and that's it and it doesn't

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130
about it and that's it and it doesn't
 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.819
about it and that's it and it doesn't
require any more explanation but I do

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829
require any more explanation but I do
 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.830
require any more explanation but I do
think that it requires significantly

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840
think that it requires significantly
 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.710
think that it requires significantly
more investigation so if you're curious

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720
more investigation so if you're curious
 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.229
more investigation so if you're curious
about a subject matter or a project or a

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239
about a subject matter or a project or a
 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.880
about a subject matter or a project or a
problem in the world or something like

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890
problem in the world or something like
 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.680
problem in the world or something like
that I think it's our responsibility to

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690
that I think it's our responsibility to
 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.900
that I think it's our responsibility to
figure out how we can cultivate that

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
figure out how we can cultivate that
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.540
figure out how we can cultivate that
curiosity right in an all-or-nothing

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550
curiosity right in an all-or-nothing
 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.870
curiosity right in an all-or-nothing
world I feel like a lot of times we

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880
world I feel like a lot of times we
 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.170
world I feel like a lot of times we
immediately set this expectation that we

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180
immediately set this expectation that we
 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.850
immediately set this expectation that we
have to become an expert in everything

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860
have to become an expert in everything
 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.730
have to become an expert in everything
right and I think that that sets us up

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740
right and I think that that sets us up
 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.710
right and I think that that sets us up
for failure we have to have a lot of

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720
for failure we have to have a lot of
 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.660
for failure we have to have a lot of
knowledge or no knowledge at all but our

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670
knowledge or no knowledge at all but our
 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.980
knowledge or no knowledge at all but our
curiosity is simply the needle in our

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990
curiosity is simply the needle in our
 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.750
curiosity is simply the needle in our
inner compass pointing towards something

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760
inner compass pointing towards something
 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.480
inner compass pointing towards something
and compasses aren't don't point true

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490
and compasses aren't don't point true
 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.030
and compasses aren't don't point true
north right so essentially it's up to us

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040
north right so essentially it's up to us
 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.190
north right so essentially it's up to us
to figure out what that curiosity

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
to figure out what that curiosity
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.890
to figure out what that curiosity
actually is so how do we cultivate our

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900
actually is so how do we cultivate our
 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.620
actually is so how do we cultivate our
curiosity practically the best way that

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
curiosity practically the best way that
 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.230
curiosity practically the best way that
I found is through sprints and Sprint's

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240
I found is through sprints and Sprint's
 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.080
I found is through sprints and Sprint's
are essentially self-contained micro

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
are essentially self-contained micro
 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.380
are essentially self-contained micro
goals and they're structured to be less

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390
goals and they're structured to be less
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.929
goals and they're structured to be less
than 30 days long so ideally a week or

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939
than 30 days long so ideally a week or
 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.210
than 30 days long so ideally a week or
two they have no barrier to entry so you

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220
two they have no barrier to entry so you
 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.920
two they have no barrier to entry so you
don't have to wait for anybody or

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
don't have to wait for anybody or
 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.510
don't have to wait for anybody or
anything you can get started today and

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520
anything you can get started today and
 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.570
anything you can get started today and
they have to have a clearly defined set

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580
they have to have a clearly defined set
 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.179
they have to have a clearly defined set
of tasks or actions so you can get

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189
of tasks or actions so you can get
 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.520
of tasks or actions so you can get
started these Sprint's will allow you to

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530
started these Sprint's will allow you to
 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.440
started these Sprint's will allow you to
cultivate your curiosity because you'll

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450
cultivate your curiosity because you'll
 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.899
cultivate your curiosity because you'll
focus on one small aspect of something

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909
focus on one small aspect of something
 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.969
focus on one small aspect of something
that could be significantly larger and

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979
that could be significantly larger and
 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.440
that could be significantly larger and
then once you're done with that sprint

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450
then once you're done with that sprint
 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.719
then once you're done with that sprint
you can take a step back and see what

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729
you can take a step back and see what
 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.850
you can take a step back and see what
did that sprint teach you what exactly

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860
did that sprint teach you what exactly
 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.620
did that sprint teach you what exactly
were you curious about

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630
were you curious about
 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.660
were you curious about
are you still curious about this or

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670
are you still curious about this or
 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.400
are you still curious about this or
did all of a sudden your curiosity shift

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410
did all of a sudden your curiosity shift
 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.850
did all of a sudden your curiosity shift
so essentially through Sprint's you're

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860
so essentially through Sprint's you're
 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.520
so essentially through Sprint's you're
able to learn very specific goals a

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530
able to learn very specific goals a
 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.979
able to learn very specific goals a
which is great you know if you are

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989
which is great you know if you are
 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.690
which is great you know if you are
curious about cooking for example maybe

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700
curious about cooking for example maybe
 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.220
curious about cooking for example maybe
you learn knife skills and in that

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230
you learn knife skills and in that
 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.720
you learn knife skills and in that
process you start learning more about

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730
process you start learning more about
 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.190
process you start learning more about
cooking but you still have the knife

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200
cooking but you still have the knife
 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.510
cooking but you still have the knife
skills even if you walk away from that

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520
skills even if you walk away from that
 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.400
skills even if you walk away from that
project altogether Sprint's are really

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410
project altogether Sprint's are really
 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.780
project altogether Sprint's are really
great because they allow us to try

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790
great because they allow us to try
 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.970
great because they allow us to try
things on for size without wasting a lot

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980
things on for size without wasting a lot
 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.009
things on for size without wasting a lot
of time and energy and they allow us to

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019
of time and energy and they allow us to
 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.240
of time and energy and they allow us to
build over time on these curiosities you

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250
build over time on these curiosities you
 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.460
build over time on these curiosities you
can take one sprint and then follow it

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470
can take one sprint and then follow it
 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.990
can take one sprint and then follow it
with another sprint in another sprint

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000
with another sprint in another sprint
 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.059
with another sprint in another sprint
and those Sprint's will change depending

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069
and those Sprint's will change depending
 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.670
and those Sprint's will change depending
on what you learn along the way so that

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680
on what you learn along the way so that
 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.520
on what you learn along the way so that
way you can take something very big and

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530
way you can take something very big and
 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.410
way you can take something very big and
seemingly overwhelming and break it down

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420
seemingly overwhelming and break it down
 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.070
seemingly overwhelming and break it down
into very actionable steps

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080
into very actionable steps
 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.319
into very actionable steps
