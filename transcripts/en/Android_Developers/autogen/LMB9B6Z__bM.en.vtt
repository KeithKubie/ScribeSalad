00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:14.039
you set it to zero it means that they
the system will actually schedule this

00:24:14.039 --> 00:24:14.049
the system will actually schedule this
 

00:24:14.049 --> 00:24:15.899
the system will actually schedule this
job immediately which is a good thing

00:24:15.899 --> 00:24:15.909
job immediately which is a good thing
 

00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:17.740
job immediately which is a good thing
because we need the channel to be

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:17.750
because we need the channel to be
 

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.300
because we need the channel to be
visible immediately after the app is

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:19.310
visible immediately after the app is
 

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:22.840
visible immediately after the app is
installed the job runs a simple task

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:22.850
installed the job runs a simple task
 

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:24.940
installed the job runs a simple task
that actually pulls data of my channels

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:24.950
that actually pulls data of my channels
 

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.670
that actually pulls data of my channels
for my back-end and insert them into the

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:27.680
for my back-end and insert them into the
 

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:31.030
for my back-end and insert them into the
provider but how do you do that so how

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:31.040
provider but how do you do that so how
 

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.570
provider but how do you do that so how
do you insert the channels so we have in

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:34.580
do you insert the channels so we have in
 

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.520
do you insert the channels so we have in
the support library several builders to

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:36.530
the support library several builders to
 

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.440
the support library several builders to
help you build channels and programs to

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:38.450
help you build channels and programs to
 

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:41.230
help you build channels and programs to
insert them into the provider so I use

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:41.240
insert them into the provider so I use
 

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.570
insert them into the provider so I use
the support library channel builder to

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:43.580
the support library channel builder to
 

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.430
the support library channel builder to
create a channel and you can see I setup

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440
create a channel and you can see I setup
 

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.950
create a channel and you can see I setup
the type to preview I set the display

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:47.960
the type to preview I set the display
 

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.100
the type to preview I set the display
name to the channel name and I set a

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:51.110
name to the channel name and I set a
 

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:53.500
name to the channel name and I set a
link back to my app so when the user

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:53.510
link back to my app so when the user
 

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:55.360
link back to my app so when the user
click on the channel icon it actually

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:55.370
click on the channel icon it actually
 

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:58.120
click on the channel icon it actually
opens my app and I use the content

00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:58.130
opens my app and I use the content
 

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:00.370
opens my app and I use the content
resolver to call insert and just insert

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:00.380
resolver to call insert and just insert
 

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:03.700
resolver to call insert and just insert
the data into the provider and the last

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:03.710
the data into the provider and the last
 

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.620
the data into the provider and the last
thing to do is actually add a logo to my

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:05.630
thing to do is actually add a logo to my
 

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:07.870
thing to do is actually add a logo to my
channel so there's a call for that and

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:07.880
channel so there's a call for that and
 

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.700
channel so there's a call for that and
actually you can either provide a bitmap

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:09.710
actually you can either provide a bitmap
 

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:12.130
actually you can either provide a bitmap
or if it's too hard then after you can

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:12.140
or if it's too hard then after you can
 

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.290
or if it's too hard then after you can
provide a URL to the bitmap somewhere on

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:14.300
provide a URL to the bitmap somewhere on
 

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.450
provide a URL to the bitmap somewhere on
the Internet and supported we will

each channel I will use a builder to
 

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:27.970
each channel I will use a builder to
insert the programs so I set the channel

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:27.980
insert the programs so I set the channel
 

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.370

provider and the last thing I need to do
 

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:52.540
provider and the last thing I need to do
is ask the system to make the channel

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:52.550
is ask the system to make the channel
 

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:56.020
is ask the system to make the channel
visible and to do that I do one simple

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:56.030
visible and to do that I do one simple
 

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:57.940
visible and to do that I do one simple
call I request it to be visible

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:57.950
call I request it to be visible
 

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:02.350

my first channel I want to take a moment
 

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.200
my first channel I want to take a moment
to talk about the first channel what the

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:08.210
to talk about the first channel what the
 

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.150
to talk about the first channel what the
app is installed it gets what we call a

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:10.160
app is installed it gets what we call a
 

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.640
app is installed it gets what we call a
golden ticket the ticket which the app

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:12.650
golden ticket the ticket which the app
 

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:13.900
golden ticket the ticket which the app
can use to insert the channel without

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:13.910
can use to insert the channel without
 

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:15.550
can use to insert the channel without
the user approving rather user

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:15.560

they app gets one golden ticket so once

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:20.060
they app gets one golden ticket so once
 

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.030
they app gets one golden ticket so once
you insert the first channel this ticket

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:22.040
you insert the first channel this ticket
 

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.280
you insert the first channel this ticket
is gone and cannot be used anymore

since my apps shows video clip I will
 

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.070
since my apps shows video clip I will
use the program type called clip but

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080
use the program type called clip but
 

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.840
use the program type called clip but
there are many other program types to

you're showing what types to use and
 

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:51.130
you're showing what types to use and
each type has a different metadata

what exactly the metadata you need for
 

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.930
what exactly the metadata you need for
each clip type for each program type so

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:01.940
each clip type for each program type so
 

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:05.640

things so I will compare the two data
 

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.289
things so I will compare the two data
sets and then I will remove all programs

00:29:10.289 --> 00:29:10.299
sets and then I will remove all programs
 

00:29:10.299 --> 00:29:11.820

update the programs and also maybe
change the order because some of them

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:24.580
change the order because some of them
 

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.450
change the order because some of them
are more popular than others and that's

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:27.460
are more popular than others and that's
 

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.470

remember that was the channel that was

00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159
remember that was the channel that was
 

00:31:08.159 --> 00:31:10.789
remember that was the channel that was
on top of the screen and it's a system

00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799
on top of the screen and it's a system
 

00:31:10.799 --> 00:31:12.169
on top of the screen and it's a system
channel so you don't have to create it

00:31:12.169 --> 00:31:12.179
channel so you don't have to create it
 

00:31:12.179 --> 00:31:13.730
channel so you don't have to create it
but you do need to follow some

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:13.740
but you do need to follow some
 

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:17.570
but you do need to follow some
guidelines in order to use it so the

guidelines in order to use it so the
 

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:19.610
guidelines in order to use it so the
first thing I did I added support in my

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:19.620
first thing I did I added support in my
 

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.100
first thing I did I added support in my
app to actually monitor what's added to

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:22.110
app to actually monitor what's added to
 

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:23.930

my watch next channel so every time a

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:23.940
my watch next channel so every time a
 

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.700
my watch next channel so every time a
program is added to the watching sense

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:25.710
program is added to the watching sense
 

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:27.470
program is added to the watching sense
that it's my program I want to know

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480
that it's my program I want to know
 

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.480
that it's my program I want to know
about it and I want to track this so

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:29.490
about it and I want to track this so
 

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:31.549
about it and I want to track this so
it's a very simple API you can add

00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559
it's a very simple API you can add
 

00:31:31.559 --> 00:31:35.419
it's a very simple API you can add
remove and check if the program is in

00:31:35.419 --> 00:31:35.429
remove and check if the program is in
 

00:31:35.429 --> 00:31:37.850
remove and check if the program is in
the watch next channel and you can

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:37.860
the watch next channel and you can
 

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.220
the watch next channel and you can
implement it with a database or should

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:40.230
implement it with a database or should
 

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:44.840
implement it with a database or should
press pretty easy thing to do so let's

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:44.850
press pretty easy thing to do so let's
 

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:47.090
press pretty easy thing to do so let's
look at some use cases so let's talk

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:47.100
look at some use cases so let's talk
 

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.889
look at some use cases so let's talk
about the continue playing so the user

00:31:48.889 --> 00:31:48.899
about the continue playing so the user
 

00:31:48.899 --> 00:31:51.320
about the continue playing so the user

watching it so what do I do what I need
 

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:56.930
watching it so what do I do what I need
to do is actually add a program like

what we call continue here and then I

00:32:08.899 --> 00:32:08.909
what we call continue here and then I
 

00:32:08.909 --> 00:32:11.330
what we call continue here and then I
had three more data to it one is when

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:11.340
had three more data to it one is when
 

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.279
had three more data to it one is when
did it happen and the other two to help

00:32:13.279 --> 00:32:13.289
did it happen and the other two to help
 

00:32:13.289 --> 00:32:16.250
did it happen and the other two to help
us with the UI is to the length of the

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:16.260
us with the UI is to the length of the
 

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:19.399
us with the UI is to the length of the
program and the current play position

00:32:19.399 --> 00:32:19.409
program and the current play position
 

00:32:19.409 --> 00:32:22.220
program and the current play position
and again simply again just insert it

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:22.230
and again simply again just insert it
 

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:24.260
and again simply again just insert it
into the provider and you're done and if

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:24.270
into the provider and you're done and if

it was added to the watch next what
 

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:30.980
it was added to the watch next what
happened is that the pro system actually

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:30.990
happened is that the pro system actually
 

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:33.110
happened is that the pro system actually
takes the program from the from the apps

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120
takes the program from the from the apps
 

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.180
takes the program from the from the apps
channel and copy it over to the watch

channel and copy it over to the watch
 

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:37.789
channel and copy it over to the watch
next channel we do that so that the

visual effect will be immediate but what
we also do is we send an intent to my

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:42.660
we also do is we send an intent to my
 

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:43.730
we also do is we send an intent to my
app to tell it

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:43.740
app to tell it
 

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.500

a job and I save this information inside
 

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.169
a job and I save this information inside
my own database so when this program is

00:33:57.169 --> 00:33:57.179
my own database so when this program is
 

00:33:57.179 --> 00:33:59.390
my own database so when this program is
updated maybe the number of you change I

00:33:59.390 --> 00:33:59.400
updated maybe the number of you change I
 

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.669
updated maybe the number of you change I
get a refresh of the image I can
