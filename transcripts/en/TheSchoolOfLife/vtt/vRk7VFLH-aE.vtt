00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.380
An enormous amount of trouble in the world,

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.860
especially at work and in relationships,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.200
is caused by a peculiar phenomenon of our minds:

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.560
a tendency to be, as we put it,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.860
"out of touch with our feelings".

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.080
When we first meet this idea,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.640
it sounds strange and even a bit insulting.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.820
How could "we" not know what "we" are feeling?

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.760
Of course, we look from the outside like unified beings;

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.600
we carry one name, and sit in a compact, physical container.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.420
The distances between different parts of us aren't so great.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.000
How then could we be so multiple as to have secrets from ourselves?

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.520
But in reality, there are at least two distinct parts to mental life:

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.240
a Feeling Self, and an Observer Self.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.840
Sometimes the two are utterly aligned,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.440
someone asks us what we feel like eating, and the communication between the two selves is clear and immediate,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.840
we don't even notice a lag.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.040
we simply answer: "Salmon and Avocado"

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.780
At other points, it's far trickier -

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.020
we're sitting on the sofa at home after a long day at work

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.360
and are under the impression that we feel quite calm,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.080
and suddenly, an apparently minor remark from our partner arouses us to deep irritation

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.840
we stand up and start shouting about the unfairness of a host of issues we had until just then

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.420
unaware we even felt strongly about.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.860
Soon, we've got a crisis in our hands.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.800
Why is it so hard for the Observing Self to report accurately on feelings?

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.660
Firstly, because we're afflicted by so many background ideas about the unacceptability of particular feelings.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.860
Across childhood, we have instilled in us, so subtly we don't even notice,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.280
strong notions about what are, and are not, permissible things to experience.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.800
Traditionally, this might have meant that boys were not allowed to acknowledge that they felt like crying,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.860
or that girls weren't allowed to entertain certain kinds of ambitions for fear of being "unladylike".

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.760
We might not have such obviously naive prohibitions today,

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.580
but other equally powerful ones have taken their place.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.140
We may have picked up covert but forceful indications that no decent person,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.160
no one loved by their parents at least, could be enthusiastic about making money or unable to cope with work,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.360
tempted by an affair or still upset over a breakup three years ago.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.060
Furthermore, despite the apparently sexually liberated spirit of the times,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.200
the lion's share of our sexual impulses remains impossible to avow.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.760
There is still a great deal we're not meant to feel, in order to fit our most desirable of categories:

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.160
a "good boy" or "good girl".

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.300
When difficult feelings do threaten to emerge,

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.420
the Observing Self typically takes fright and looks away.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.280
Rather than produce an honest account of feelings,

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.820
he may go numb, or try to file a report that's more acceptable than true.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.780
"I'm feeling very tired", instead of "I'm feeling you've let me down."

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.240
"I'm depressed" rather than "I'm furious".

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.780
"That's absolutely disgusting!" rather than "I'm strangely turned on."

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.780
Our problems are compounded by the way that many powerful feelings,

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.740
especially of upset, envy and frustration,

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.500
can get kicked into action by apparently very trivial and seemingly nonsensical things in the outside world.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.220
For example, we might be thrown into paracosms of envy we find no room to confess to

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.700
when a friend mentions that a mutual acquantaince has been promoted,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.660
or a partner may look away for 3.5 seconds before we've entered an explanation

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.520
about how tricky a work meeting went,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.920
and we experience seething indignation and wounded pride that we haven't got our lover's full attention.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.140
But we say nothing,

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.340
because to own up to many feelings of upset, involves acknowledging

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.540
a humiliating degree of fragility.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.720
Yet, feelings that haven't been reported don't and can't go away.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.320
They linger, and spread their energy randomly to neighbouring issues.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.520
Envy comes out as spite,

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.260
anger over inattention comes out as a remark that the partner is looking "rather fat at the moment."

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.180
Though of course, by the time that hurt has manifested itself as aggression,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.020
any chances of being comforted are clearly over.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.720
Feelings we haven't got a handle on wreak havoc.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.960
They buckle and strain the system

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.700
We develop pernicious ticks, a facial twitch,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.440
impotence, and incapacity to work.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.560
Alcoholism, a compulsion to look at porn,

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.780
most so-called "addictions" are, at heart, symptoms of

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.380
insistent, difficult feelings that we haven't found any better way to address.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.780
How then might we come to be more skilled observers

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.420
in correspondence to our feelings?

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.800
Reading may have rather a large role to play,

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.980
a great writer is ideally, someone uncommonly patient about

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.140
the curious, less discussed, and apparently weirder things that float around

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.620
in the human head.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.240
Another move is to ensure that we've allocated

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.160
a lot of time to self-observation.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.020
It can look rather self-indulgent to ask for a few hours in the evening,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.760
in which there is nothing more apparently demanding to do, than sit and stare out of the window

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.700
or around the bedroom with a pad and pen on one's lap.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.080
These so-called "idle moments" are when the Observing Self can finally catch up with feelings

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.960
that might have been too shy, ashamed or harassed

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.900
to emerge in the rest of the day.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.600
They are like church bells we can make out only in the evening

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.520
when city traffic has died down.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.060
Failing to do this can, among other things,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.740
ruin our chances of getting to sleep.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.940
Insomnia, is the Feeling Self's revenge.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.700
All thoughts that haven't been properly catalogued in the day.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.700
Understanding the serious danger of the

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.880
gap opening up between "what we feel" and "what we're aware of"

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.300
brings another major benefit:

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.820
We grasp that this issue unnecessarily apply to other people too.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.840
Quite often, they will be saying things which are not, in fact, in line with their true feelings.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.780
Mean things when they're feeling vulnerable, perhaps,

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.600
or arrogant things when they're feeling small,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.680
and will identify that it's our duty to forgive them for not always

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.860
managing to be reliable correspondents of their inner lives.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.940
It's not really sinister to think this way of others

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.420
it's a kindly move that gives us the energy to lend a second,

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.540
more compassionate look at behaviour that might initially have appeared simply

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.000
horribly off-putting.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.620
Feelings are frequently far from wonderful,

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.460
and often, should not be followed.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.760
But we should accept that if we ignore,

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.800
deny, or overlook feelings entirely,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.160
the price will always be higher and worse.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.340
They will exercise a powerful, malignant, subterranean influence

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.580
across the whole of our lives.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.240
One of the two often overlooked, but key arts of living,

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.920
is to learn to devote ourselves to correctly labelling

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.340
and repatriating our own, and others', orphan feelings.
