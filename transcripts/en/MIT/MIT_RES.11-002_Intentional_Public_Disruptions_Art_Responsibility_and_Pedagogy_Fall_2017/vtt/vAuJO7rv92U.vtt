00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.765
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
Part of what I

00:00:01.765 --> 00:00:03.570
do is work with people
who are preparing

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.170
to be K-12 art teachers.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.140
I actually work with artists.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.230
I've taught studio-based
courses in ceramics, drawing.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.740
And I'm also working
with grad students who

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.950
are interested in engaging
in research about and through

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.860
and within art practices,
visual cultural practices.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.070
So there's this range of
folks with whom I'm working.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.300
So one of your--

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.592
I'm trying to negotiate
a place to enter, Larry.

00:00:32.592 --> 00:00:34.050
And one of the
things that you said

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.030
was how explicit am I with,
as we've been calling it,

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.607
this hidden agenda,
a hidden curriculum?

00:00:43.607 --> 00:00:44.940
LARRY SUSSKIND: Not as an agenda

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.480
STEPHEN CARPENTER: No, but
it's the same thing, right?

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.170
In many cases, it's
the same thing, right?

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.740
Because you have an agenda
that you're trying to cover,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.870
whether it's an
official agenda, we

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.640
can correlate that to
the official curriculum.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.190
And I'm pulling this term,
these curriculum pieces

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.860
from the work of George
Posner and others,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.670
where you might consider there
are five kinds of curriculum

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.726
that are happening at
the same time, five

00:01:08.726 --> 00:01:09.600
concurrent curricula.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.660
He says there's the
official curriculum, which

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.660
is what is written down.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.910
It's that officially mandated.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.384
This is what will be taught.

00:01:16.384 --> 00:01:18.300
Then there there's the
operational curriculum.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.570
It's what you put into practice,
trying to operationalize it.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.380
So it would be the
official agenda, then

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.200
the operationalized agenda.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.280
So agenda and curriculum to
me, agenda gets a bad rap,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.530
I think, just like propaganda.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.280
But that's a different
kettle of horses.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.780
OK.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.180
So then the third curriculum
that Posner talks about

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.070
is the hidden curriculum,
what is not official,

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.980
what is not officially
written down and intended,

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.670
and what also is not necessarily
operationalized intentionally.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.610
But it is what is hidden
and gets learned and taught

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.720
at the same time.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.420
The fourth would then
be the null curriculum,

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.670
what is not taught, what is
not intended to be taught,

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.630
what is absent and
explicitly missing.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.380
And then the fifth is
the extracurriculum.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.330
It doesn't happen inside
those intentional spaces

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.080
that we might think is
formalized schooling.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.169
So if we think of-- you're
on the volleyball team.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.970
That's extracurricular, but it's
still related to that education

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.480
space.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.070
All five of those things
are happening all the time.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.611
So the hidden agenda, the hidden
curriculum is one that I--

00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:22.860
and there's some tension
there, because in some cases,

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.150
it's operationalized with
a conscious awareness

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.907
that it's hidden.

00:02:27.907 --> 00:02:29.490
I'm not going to be
explicit about it.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.380
But then there can be
a hidden curriculum

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.450
where it's being
taught and learned

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.220
without the intention of it
being taught and learned.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.020
So when we ask kids to--

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.730
for example, there
are bathrooms--

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.300
when I was a kid,
gendered bathrooms,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.470
men's bathroom when
we're boys and girls,

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.470
and so it's teaching us
certain things about how

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.450
society is structured.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.670
But when we move
and have a shift

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.190
in our cultural and social
space where bathrooms

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.580
don't have to have certain
labels, then other knowledge,

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.680
other ideas are taught and
learned through those gestures.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.765
But they're not
necessarily official.

00:03:04.765 --> 00:03:05.640
Does that make sense?

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.410
LARRY SUSSKIND: Yeah.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.326
STEPHEN CARPENTER: OK.

00:03:07.326 --> 00:03:11.360
So the program where I teach
at Penn State for an art

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.634
education, also at VCFA,
we're very explicit about what

00:03:15.634 --> 00:03:16.800
that hidden agenda might be.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.330
It's to the point where
it's not hidden at all.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.490
It's very upfront.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.460
It's very official.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.960
And it gets
operationalized in terms

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.940
of a focus on social justice,
a focus on the role of artists

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.060
and art in the world
and what matters matter

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:38.160
and how we can engage
with concepts and theories

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.740
like we heard in the
introduction-- feminist theory

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.950
or critical race theory
or critical pedagogy.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.580
Or we can think about
anti-racist theory.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.230
So we can think about--
or disability studies--

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.910
all of these different ways
in which society operates

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.450
are part of the
curriculum that I've

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.820
been part of in these
two institutions

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.860
to look at the
preparation of teachers.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.060
So someone who says, hey, I want
to go study in this program,

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.800
it's not a surprise
to them when we

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.450
start talking about feminist
pedagogy and feminist issues.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.000
What might be a
surprise is perhaps

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.529
the ways in which we approach
that and then operationalize

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:20.029
it.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.740
But it shouldn't be a surprise.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.930
Now in some cases, some
people might not always

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.360
read the [LAUGHS]
the fine print.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.700
And then there might
be a surprise there.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.470
But I don't hide those issues.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.580
As a matter of fact, I'm very
upfront with my undergraduates

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.710
about, in this course, we're
going to learn about learning.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.921
And I'm more interested in
learning than I am in teaching.

00:04:49.921 --> 00:04:51.420
And that doesn't
make sense to a lot

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.610
of people who are preparing
to be teachers or think

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.140
about teaching, because to
frame it around learning

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.540
suggests there's a shift from
the agency of the teacher

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.960
as the primary vehicle
to the student.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.540
LARRY SUSSKIND: Do I
need a first course

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.090
where there's no
interference with learning

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.480
to draw in a basic way?

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.800
And then after that, I can come
to a second level drawing class

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.530
where you can lay on
all this other stuff.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.550
Or from the very
beginning, in even the most

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.700
rudimentary learning
of the medium,

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.430
are you already insinuating into
the design of this curriculum

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.150
this other set of concerns?

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.480
I don't even have
to know anything

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.080
about the basics independent
of this second concern

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.780
to start learning this
other set of things?

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.860
STEPHEN CARPENTER: No.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.007
One can enter with the concerns.

00:05:46.007 --> 00:05:48.340
LARRY SUSSKIND: And that is
your plan, most of the time?

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.020
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
All of the time.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.560
LARRY SUSSKIND: All the time.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.980
STEPHEN CARPENTER: All the time.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.063
LARRY SUSSKIND: All right.

00:05:51.063 --> 00:05:53.970
STEPHEN CARPENTER: So [CHUCKLES]
we start with, let's say,

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.130
social issues.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.410
Or let's say we're grounding the
course within a social space.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.180
We all live in a social space.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.680
We all come with
a set of concerns.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.920
We all come with a
set of experiences.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.690
We come to the studio, and
then return to wherever

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.100
we were before that.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.290
What we experience
outside of the studio

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.090
is content for art-making.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.580
It's content for
engagement through art.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.750
So this is a shift
where we think of--

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:37.420
so if we take a step back
to notions of curriculum,

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.350
a very basic question in
curriculum design, creating

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.470
theory, curriculum
development, I should say,

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.130
is what is worth knowing?

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.360
What content do we
want students to learn?

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.970
What is worth knowing?

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.720
We might then look
through the progression

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.594
of curriculum theory.

00:06:54.594 --> 00:06:59.480
And then folks 30,
40 years ago start

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.770
making a shift in [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.000
What is worthwhile?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.440
What matters?

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.990
And what happens is
there's a movement away

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.990
from a more modernist
notion of art

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.530
as material-based to art as
a reflection and engagement

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:13.520
within the world.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.070
Not that it hadn't
been that way before.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.290
But that the world becomes
an art-making medium,

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:25.490
and in a context that can be
not only reflected and depicted,

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.250
but can also be used
as one of the materials

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.470
within art-making practice.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.180
And that art practice
can have some sort

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:37.280
of engaged and intentional
effect within that.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.630
So the kind of drawing
class that you're mentioning

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.540
or describing is not uncommon.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.180
These kinds of courses
happen quite often.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:52.400
But their titles don't
always reflect that.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.452
And many art schools
are making some shifts.

00:07:54.452 --> 00:07:56.660
I had mentioned to a colleague
a number of years ago,

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.090
I said, we really need to
change the names of some

00:07:59.090 --> 00:07:59.840
of these courses.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:05.450
Like, we should have Art with
Larry, Art 505, Art with Larry,

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.820
and then Art 507,
Art with Steve.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.180
And they would have a sense
of what that course was about.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.600
It it's not a materials-specific
course, although it could be.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.580
But when we move the focus
to issues, ideas, concerns,

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:26.790
engagements, problems, ideas,
that is an easier entry

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.940
point for the kinds of pedagogy
that we're talking about,

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:34.370
that lend themselves
to the sensibilities

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:38.190
of disruptive practices,
of social consciousness,

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.140
of transformative learning.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.020
LARRY SUSSKIND: And what
I've taken from your comments

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:49.050
on occasion is that I ought
to have that objective if I'm

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:55.140
going to teach people about
operating in their community.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.850
Don't just teach the
method or the content.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:05.280
But get to this other level and
build that into the curriculum.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.690
Take responsibility for that.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:07.770
Be explicit about it.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:11.684
Be accountable not just
during but even before,

00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:14.100
although who knows whether
they would have let me anywhere

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.490
near the place if I had
said at the beginning,

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.865
our goal here is to bring
about change in this community.

00:09:20.865 --> 00:09:23.323
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Well, it
depends on your strategy there,

00:09:23.323 --> 00:09:24.006
right?

00:09:24.006 --> 00:09:25.380
So if we think
about it this way.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.530
Now you didn't mention
this in your story.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.600
But I would be interested
in this component,

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.390
because it also then
gets back to one

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:36.210
of those parts of the
longer question you asked me

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.970
earlier about my own
students and my own teaching.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.887
This is part of the
social studies curriculum?

00:09:43.887 --> 00:09:44.720
LARRY SUSSKIND: Yes.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.370
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
Officially, right?

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:47.990
There should be some objectives.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.450
There should be some state
standards or district standards

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.630
or district objectives
that many teachers

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.045
consider to be the curriculum.

00:09:55.045 --> 00:09:56.420
And they teach to
those standards

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.040
or to those objectives.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.040
I teach my students,
put those aside.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.310
Let's build on what you
know, what is most important,

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:06.664
build on your own
politics, build on the--

00:10:06.664 --> 00:10:09.080
let's start with the themes
and the ideas and the concerns

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:09.920
that you have.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.080
Build your curriculum
around that,

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.410
drawing on your art practice,
your knowledge of art.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.570
And then let's compare.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.570
Let's use those standards
or those objectives

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:22.770
as an assessment.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.560
Now how many of
those do we address?

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.899
Usually we can
cover all of those.

00:10:26.899 --> 00:10:28.440
But if we start the
other way around,

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.004
we start with learning Objective
6 and learning Objective 8,

00:10:31.004 --> 00:10:32.420
and this is the
lesson, it's going

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.676
to be really narrow and tight.

00:10:33.676 --> 00:10:36.050
And it doesn't-- and you're
always going to be interested

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.920
in we got to kick it
back into the center.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.290
We got to make sure they're--

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.100
But in the way that you
did it, I would imagine

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.500
you could have said
at any given moment,

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.390
when you felt some
resistance, well,

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.700
if we look at the
standards, we're

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.940
covering XYZ, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6 7, because--

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.540
and this is a way that one--

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.190
I'm not trying to say this is
how you do a cover-up story.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.680
But this is how you can
justify the social practice,

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.030
social engagement, social
consciousness pedagogy

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.600
is you say, look, we're
meeting all of the standards.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.747
As a matter of fact, if
we were to do, let's say,

00:11:11.747 --> 00:11:13.830
three units like this over
the course of the year,

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.017
we could hit all of those
objectives each time.

00:11:17.017 --> 00:11:18.850
If we do it in a more
conventional approach,

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:21.420
we might only address one
of those objectives once

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.180
or a few of them
very superficially.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:30.060
So this becomes an even more
potent way to make a case,

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.975
because you're using the--

00:11:31.975 --> 00:11:33.225
you were talking about values.

00:11:33.225 --> 00:11:34.740
LARRY SUSSKIND: Use the
objectives against them.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.390
[LAUGHING]

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.929
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Yes,
I call it playing judo.

00:11:37.929 --> 00:11:40.470
You use your opponent's strength
and speed to your advantage.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.980
LARRY SUSSKIND: Right.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:41.200
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Yeah.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:43.933
LARRY SUSSKIND: When I
teach graduate students who

00:11:43.933 --> 00:11:47.010
are in a professional
degree program, all of this

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.740
is easily talked about.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.980
It's layered into the social
objectives, the social change

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.620
impact.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:12:00.300
It's all easily included
in the conversation.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:05.250
And there's explicit reflection
on the social impact,

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:09.190
social implications,
social change, or who wins,

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.790
who loses if you
do this, and so on.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.060
It's just fascinating
to me that you're

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.200
teaching teachers or teaching
kids in elementary school.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.840
And you're, in a sense,
teaching the same thing.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.300
And you're not really
modulating that much.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.870
You're still saying,
there's biases here.

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:28.915
Everyone has a bias.

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:31.047
And you learn what
you're including,

00:12:31.047 --> 00:12:32.130
what you're not including.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:35.670
And it sounds like you would
say that to every level

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.070
and to the teachers
teaching at every level.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:42.330
And that was surprising
to me, that all of this

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.810
was as explicit
in your curriculum

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:51.500
in your teaching for K-12, as
it is in teaching professionals.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.500
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Yeah.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.874
Let me give you
a couple examples

00:12:53.874 --> 00:12:58.850
to say, yes, to support
what you're saying.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:04.140
So there are a number
of courses that one

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.410
might find in an undergraduate
or pre-service art education

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:08.400
curriculum.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:14.141
You can imagine, there has to
be a 101 or Art Education 101,

00:13:14.141 --> 00:13:14.640
Intro.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.290
And then there has
to be the student

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:17.496
teaching at the other end.

00:13:17.496 --> 00:13:19.620
And somewhere in there,
there's a practicum course.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.520
Many places have
methods courses.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.960
There's usually a history
course or a cultural practices

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.629
or a cultural
foundations course.

00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:29.170
And there's also a
curriculum course.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:34.270
And it depends on what
institution where I'm teaching.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.450
But usually if it's
the curriculum course

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.070
or the cultural and
social foundations

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:43.870
course, the first day of class,
this is how I start the class.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:47.360
Now we've known each other
for almost two years now.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.342
And we've sat through
these conversations.

00:13:49.342 --> 00:13:50.550
So you know what I look like.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:51.600
You know what I sound like.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.433
But imagine students
who are just showing up

00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:55.660
to class for the first time.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.500
And this is how I
start the class.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.070
(BRITISH ACCENT) Good afternoon.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.430
My name is Dr. Carpenter,
and I'll be your instructor

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:03.730
this semester.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.330
So for the next
16 weeks, we'll be

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:11.610
engaging in curriculum and
cultural and social issues

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:13.420
related to art education.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.190
Now some of you
come to the course

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:16.797
as artists and others
come as-- and I

00:14:16.797 --> 00:14:17.880
continue in just this way.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.196
And we start to
read the syllabus.

00:14:20.196 --> 00:14:22.070
And at a certain point,
I just can't do this.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.810
I cannot find different regions
of the UK to move around

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:27.850
my accent.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:30.400
And certain students
start saying, look.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.990
And then I say, (NO
ACCENT) well, now

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:33.010
the next thing that
we're going to do,

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:34.343
and I change my voice like this.

00:14:34.343 --> 00:14:36.860
And they're looking at
me like, oh, my goodness.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:37.980
What's going on?

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.820
And I stop them right there.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.392
This is the first
day of class, Larry.

00:14:44.392 --> 00:14:46.320
You haven't blinked in a minute.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.930
And your mouth is wide
open, and you're giggling.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.640
And what's going on here?

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.600
And I make them talk.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.410
I say, what's up?

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.120
Well, you sound different.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.610
I sound different than what?

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:57.550
Well, you sound different
than you did before.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:58.570
Well, what did I
sound like before?

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:00.000
Well, you sounded--
you had an accent.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:00.500
Oh, I did?

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.450
What kind of accent?

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:05.530
I say, well, if I'm someplace
else, I have an accent there.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.500
But when I'm home, I
don't have an accent.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.260
People who sounded like that
at home don't have an accent.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.920
It's only when they leave.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.340
And so what else is different?

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.570
And they also end up
talking about, well--

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.090
I move them to the
space to say, faces

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:21.210
that look like mine, in
most people's conception,

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.870
at least in the
institutions where I teach,

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:27.720
don't sound like that.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.990
Or the conception of someone
with an accent like that

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:32.400
looks different than I do.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.190
But I put it on the table,
and I draw attention

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:37.680
to what this
pigmentation looks like

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.050
and what it sounds like (BRITISH
ACCENT) to talk like this.

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.110
Or if I talk like
this or have a--

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:47.712
so the idea of how accents
inform and influence--

00:15:47.712 --> 00:15:48.670
LARRY SUSSKIND: Biases.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:49.470
STEPHEN CARPENTER: --biases.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:49.990
That's it.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:51.400
Day one.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:55.270
I say, so how do you sound
when you talk to your students?

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.060
How does your language--
how does the way you dress

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.740
speak to your students?

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.010
And also, how do you
respond to your students

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.330
based on what they sound
like and what they--

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.324
day one.

00:16:07.324 --> 00:16:08.740
LARRY SUSSKIND:
And you wouldn't--

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:14.470
I mean, that's not keyed to the
age or level of the students.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:15.590
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Yeah.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:19.400
So this becomes part of what
it means to be a teacher.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.240
So if you're interested
in teaching learners,

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.845
you have multiple
identities in that space.

00:16:25.845 --> 00:16:27.970
But if you're going to
assume that all learners are

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:29.800
learners are learners,
it's much easier.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.600
You just deliver
stuff and expect it

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.950
to come back in the same way.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.200
It's not messy at all.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:43.260
For the younger ones, I'm
also spending this year

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.480
as an artist and
learner in residence

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.040
at an elementary
school in my town.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.590
So I visit a class
of first graders

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:53.640
just about every Friday.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.254
And then I'm working with
the entire third grade team.

00:16:56.254 --> 00:16:57.420
LARRY SUSSKIND: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.230
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
No, that's OK.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.730
Yeah.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.620
Well, it's funny you
say that, because one

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.890
of the things I've been
doing with the third graders

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.869
is looking at the water crisis.

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:10.890
And I know some of you are
interested in the global water

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:12.700
crisis.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.319
So in third grade, Africa is one
of their social studies units.

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:19.710
It worked out really
quite well in connection

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:22.950
with the African
diaspora water curriculum

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.349
that I've been working on that
was funded by the Africana

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:27.970
Research Center at Penn State.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:36.700
And so to talk to them about
the water crisis in Africa,

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.790
there's a moment in
which, for some learners

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:43.360
and for some teachers, there
could be a moment where

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.360
you equate Africa, no water.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.120
All Africans have no water.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.950
Right?

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:54.750
I have to call that out.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.870
There's also a moment where--

00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:00.770
and this happens
beyond third grade--

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:02.300
it happens in the news.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.580
It happens in TV shows.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.440
It happens in textbooks.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.500
It happens in
daily conversation,

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.560
where people will say, I'm going
on a trip, multiple places.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.180
I'm going to fly to France.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.581
And I'm going to go to Germany,
and I'm going to go to Africa.

00:18:17.581 --> 00:18:18.080
Really?

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.690
You're going to go to a
country, country, continent,

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:23.850
where we frame Africa
as an entire country.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.920
And for those third
graders to learn that,

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.930
to learn what I mean by that, to
learn that Africa is a country?

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:36.470
No, Africa is one continent
made up of multiple countries.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.880
Somehow, that doesn't
always happen.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.340
And so the message
then in society

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.800
is one that needs
to be attended to.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.450
I mean, it certainly
then lends itself

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:52.250
to biases or misunderstandings
about the continent.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:54.990
So I make it clear
to the third graders.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.480
But this how I do it.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.370
And I put a map
of Africa and say,

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.170
so here's the country of Africa.

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:01.730
And we're going to talk-- no!

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:03.710
What do you mean it's not--

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.470
with a little bit of joking,
with a little teasing,

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:07.210
to make sure.

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:11.030
And I enable them and
allow them to make explicit

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:12.760
what they're hearing.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.950
And to continue to do
that is quite important.

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:21.250
There's a book by
Walter Bateman.

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.379
He wrote, I think,
after he retired

00:19:24.379 --> 00:19:25.670
from the College of Education--

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:27.461
I think it was at
University of Minnesota--

00:19:27.461 --> 00:19:29.770
it's called Teaching
Through Inquiry.

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:32.260
And one of the
strategies that he

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.160
uses that I borrow, or he
writes about in this book,

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.546
is based on the Socratic method.

00:19:38.546 --> 00:19:40.420
But it's also based in
this notion of inquiry

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.900
through the process of asking
questions one can reveal.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.510
But to make sure students
are paying attention,

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:50.260
you can provide information as
factual, factual, not factual,

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.840
factual, and see when and
how they pick up on it.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.030
And I love doing that
with the younger kids.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.960
Or when it's time to share--

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.420
so then another
component is I've

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:04.180
been sharing with the students
design challenges that

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.650
are drawn directly from
lack of adequate access

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:11.740
to water in different
countries in Africa,

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:15.590
as exemplified from
different places.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.970
So whether it's the water filter
or pumping water or piping

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:23.680
water or transporting water or
collecting water out of the air

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.840
through the moisture.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.050
So I say, look,
here's an example.

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:32.230
Imagine you live
in a rural town.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:36.340
And you have an amazing
access to water,

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:40.960
but it's filled with disease and
mosquito larvae and all this.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.420
I'd like you to design a
way to filter that water.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.130
But you can't use
any electricity.

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:49.810
And you can't use
any oil or any gas,

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:58.880
no motive of motion or power,
other than the human body.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.520
Divide into a group of two,
three, four and draw this.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.780
And I give them 10 minutes.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.414
These are eight-
and nine-year-olds.

00:21:04.414 --> 00:21:05.830
And they go away
and they draw it.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.663
And then when they share
these things-- this

00:21:07.663 --> 00:21:10.360
the same challenge that you
give that designers are dealing

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.471
with in the world right now.

00:21:12.471 --> 00:21:13.720
Their drawings are incredible.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.345
Their design-- the conversations
they're having are incredible.

00:21:16.345 --> 00:21:20.182
But the way frame it is,
imagine you lived in a town,

00:21:20.182 --> 00:21:20.890
blah, blah, blah.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:23.545
I don't say, imagine you
lived in this African village.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.550
And to take it away from that--

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.740
although they are
studying Africa,

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:35.187
I take it away from that and
make it a more generic space

00:21:35.187 --> 00:21:36.270
for them to think through.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.577
Then I say, well, in
certain countries in Africa,

00:21:38.577 --> 00:21:41.160
this is the case, just like in
certain states in this country,

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.420
just like in other
countries in the world.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.050
So I don't just leave it there.

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:47.580
Making it explicit
with the students

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.720
is very, very important.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.807
And they get it.

00:21:50.807 --> 00:21:52.390
LARRY SUSSKIND: I'm
still on this idea

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:56.620
that there's this special
quality about being a socially

00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:00.190
disruptive artist or being
a teacher who's trying

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:02.290
to take this into account.

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:04.990
And all the other
things that we try

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.600
to help people get
better at teaching

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.690
or better at doing
something doesn't

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:14.080
get at this core quality.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.610
I think it is different and
special and scary and other

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:19.730
things.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:22.146
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Yeah, I
think it's all of those things.

00:22:22.146 --> 00:22:25.236
I also-- maybe you
recall, I said,

00:22:25.236 --> 00:22:26.860
when I'm doing the
water fountain work,

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.590
I still get anxious
to approach people.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.840
LARRY SUSSKIND: You don't
know who's going to haul off

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.630
and belt you.

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:33.213
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
They might do this.

00:22:33.213 --> 00:22:35.580
Watching all these YouTube
videos tells me other people,

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.190
this happens to
folks all the time.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:42.800
But it's the social
engagement that

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.340
is an important part of the
materiality of that work,

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.250
just like clay is an important
material part of ceramics,

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:51.050
obviously.

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:57.979
And not everybody is
as able with all media

00:22:57.979 --> 00:23:00.020
as they would like to be
or teaching and learning

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:00.780
certain content.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.115
So that's just an understanding.

00:23:03.115 --> 00:23:04.490
LARRY SUSSKIND:
Yeah, but this is

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:07.550
different in kind than
learning another medium.

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:09.740
I'm terrible, terrible,
terrible at watercolor.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.560
But watch me go when
I do something else.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.219
OK, I can get better at it.

00:23:14.219 --> 00:23:15.760
You can teach me to
get better at it.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.900
It isn't I'm not great at it.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.070
I've never been good at it.

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:23.280
But OK, if I put enough effort
in and you give me coaching,

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.330
and I try it, and I watch
it, I'll get better.

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:29.870
I just have a sense that
being ready to commit

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:35.540
to engage in public spaces in
something aimed at changing

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.120
the way people think about
things that are challenging

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:42.020
their identity is not
something that you can build

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.610
the capacity in the same way.

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:46.820
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
So this is how

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.724
I want to answer this
question in another way,

00:23:49.724 --> 00:23:51.140
because I think
we're going around

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.348
on this on the same question.

00:23:52.348 --> 00:23:56.450
And I appreciate
the provocations.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:59.810
So if I think about the
most recent semester where

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:02.990
I taught the participatory
inquiry course, a range

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:05.450
of students in this course--

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:09.332
one student from I
believe she's in sociology

00:24:09.332 --> 00:24:10.790
or comparative
literature, perhaps.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:17.990
Comparative literature--
was not about to perform,

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.460
to do the reading in public.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:24.050
But was very interested
in graphic novels,

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:27.230
comics, visual representation.

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:29.570
And the issue she
was interested in

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:35.190
was this conversation on campus
about unionizing graduate

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.690
students.

00:24:38.299 --> 00:24:40.090
And so I was kind of
concerned about, well,

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:45.130
how do I perform unionizing
and the political issues there.

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:47.380
And so we talked
about her interest

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:48.790
in graphic novels and comics.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:51.940
And what she ended up
doing was, essentially, it

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:55.810
was a survey of
sorts asking people

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:58.480
to provide her with
feedback, their perspective

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.140
on this issue, on
unionization of grad students,

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:05.670
and with little drop
boxes where they could--

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:08.950
it's almost like those
suggestion boxes.

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:10.720
And she put them in
strategic places,

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:15.640
collected them, and then
made the graphic visual

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.710
representation depictions,
almost like cartoon

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.020
on these squares, panels.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:25.780
And then with the
speech bubbles as was

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.540
the content from the
anonymous suggestions

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.210
that people gave her.

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:33.910
And then she would post
these on bulletin boards.

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:37.600
So you could see this
public display of comments.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.260
She physically put
this in the world.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.526
But she didn't physically
put herself in the world.

00:25:41.526 --> 00:25:42.400
Does that make sense?

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:42.550
LARRY SUSSKIND: Yeah.

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.480
STEPHEN CARPENTER: So we're
playing to strengths that way.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.074
And that's why the
particulars of what

00:25:46.074 --> 00:25:47.740
she was about when
she was interested in

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.410
and what she was capable,
that's what that went.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:54.850
Another student who
was in architecture

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:57.964
was interested in--

00:25:57.964 --> 00:25:59.380
so on our campus,
I don't know how

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:02.830
it happens around
Cambridge and around MIT,

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:06.640
but we have different
representatives

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:11.710
from different religions
or different beliefs

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:14.739
who will set up in
different parts of campus.

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:16.030
And they're allowed to do that.

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:17.710
And they'll pass out literature.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.050
And they'll engage
people in conversation.

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:22.390
And so what this
one student did was,

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:24.410
he wanted to emulate their--

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:28.970
he wanted to borrow their
mode of their presentation,

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:30.160
but not their message.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.860
He wanted to actually
substitute out

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.920
their message of
religion and spirituality

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.070
with concepts from architecture.

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:40.654
And so he [CHUCKLES]--

00:26:40.654 --> 00:26:42.320
LARRY SUSSKIND: Sounds
a little strange.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.569
STEPHEN CARPENTER: It is very.

00:26:43.569 --> 00:26:45.817
It was, yeah, exactly.

00:26:45.817 --> 00:26:47.650
So imagine, you're
walking down the sidewalk

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:51.100
and someone says, oh, may I talk
to you about being saved or may

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.670
I talk to you about spiritual
enlightenment or whatever?

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:57.600
And then instead of
doing that, you say,

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.460
well, do you have a
moment, because I'd

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.140
like to talk to you about the
differences between concrete

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.239
and cement and their uses
in architectural structures.

00:27:05.239 --> 00:27:06.030
I'm thinking, what?

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:07.020
But he's dressed as if--

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:08.620
LARRY SUSSKIND: It sounds
like a really MIT thing.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:08.850
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Right?

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:09.349
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:09.349 --> 00:27:12.370
But he's dressed
as someone that you

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:15.400
might see on campus in
the guise of a spiritual

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.390
or a religious practice.

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:21.130
So in that way, he felt
very comfortable doing that.

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:24.670
But it was about, well, how
do you take on that persona

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:25.307
without--

00:27:25.307 --> 00:27:26.640
he wasn't trying to [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:32.580
He was trying to use
that visual as momentum.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.580
LARRY SUSSKIND: Until you
play to his strength--

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.310
STEPHEN CARPENTER: You
play to their strengths.

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:37.620
LARRY SUSSKIND: There a
lot of ways of doing this.

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:38.950
You're playing to
people's strengths.

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:39.740
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
That's what it's about.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:40.240
Yeah.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.890
LARRY SUSSKIND: I like that.
