00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.000
Well the weather outside is frightful, and
the fire is so delightful, but at the risk

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.400
of sounding spiteful, salting roads ain’t
rightful.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.810
That’s why this story I did write, full
of alternatives that might pull us just that

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.370
much further in our environmental fight, fool!

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.020
You’re not a fool.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.560
That’s just, you know...I like rhyming.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.570
Welcome back to DNews.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.570
I’m Matt Lieberman.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.930
Every winter, communities the world over prepare
for months of icy roads and snowstorms.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.599
But in the United States, we fight back against
the cold and damp with a massive amount of

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.599
road salt.

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:32.599
How much?

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.570
Try 22 million tons.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.940
That’s roughly 137 pounds of salt per American
citizen.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.079
That’s crazy, right?

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.480
We’ve been praying at the altar of road
salt since the 1940s and 50s, as highways

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.140
changed the face of the nation.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.480
Suddenly, truckers and commuters alike didn’t
have days to wait for snow and ice to melt.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.269
Salt was our solution to increase traction
on roads and simultaneously melt the ice and

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:55.269
snow on them.

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.109
The benefits are obvious: According to a 1992
study, salting roads reduces car accidents

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.250
during and after winter storms by a whopping
87%.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.350
That translates to potentially thousands of
lives saved.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.350
So why are we making a stink about something
that works?

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.390
Well our dependency has massive downsides.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.920
Sodium chloride is corrosive.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.710
It eats through cars and trucks, bridges,
even concrete.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.240
A study in Utah estimates that Americans spend
between $16 and $19 billion a year to repair

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.240
the damage.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.230
There’s got to be a cheaper solution, and
one without the additional environmental effects

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.230
of road salt.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.560
When the salt melts, it steadily runs off
into our water supplies, increasing the salinity

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.200
and chloride levels of lakes and rivers and
killing wildlife.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.200
A December 2014 study from the US Geological
Survey found that 29% of urban streams exceeded

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.130
safe levels of chlorine for at least part
of the year, and that the levels of chlorine

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.860
have risen in 89% of urban streams overall.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.320
Additionally, salt on the road attracts animals
like deer, moose, and elk, which poses constant

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.320
risks of collision.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.621
Additionally, we’ve now used so much salt
on our roads that we’re now facing a salt

00:01:59.621 --> 00:02:00.621
shortage.

00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:01.621
What are we to do?

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:05.719
Well, there are alternatives out there, but
unfortunately most of them still involve salt

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:06.719
in some capacity.

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.690
For example, Wisconsin cities have taken to
pre-soaking their roads with cheese brine

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.690
before storms.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.370
Now, there is still salt or a salt/sand mixture
in the cheese brine, but there is far less

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.540
of it, and pre-salting the roads makes it
difficult for ice and snow to stick to them.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.040
Other communities have taken to using beet
juice in conjunction with road salt to reduce

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.230
the amount of salt used, and others still
use calcium chloride instead of sodium chloride.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.099
Calcium chloride is less harmful to vegetation,
but is more corrosive to concrete and metal.

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.750
However, the following options are the most
environmentally friendly: Sand and ashes both

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.840
offer better traction and have low albedo,
which means that they absorb sunlight very

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.379
easily, heating roads quickly to melt ice.

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.730
Kitty litter is also an option, providing
excellent traction, though for a high price.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.610
There’s also a product called Ecotraction,
which is a volcanic material that provides

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.580
traction and is safe to the environment and
to animals.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.080
So now we want to hear from you.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:29.340
What is your solution to America’s road
salt addiction?
