SEAN MCQUILLAN: With
picture-in-picture, you

00:00:01.833 --> 00:00:03.550
can overlay other apps
where your user is

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.420
doing critical tasks, such as
watching a video or navigating.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.020
It's available whenever your
app is running on Oreo or above.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.520
Let's dive in on how
to add it to your app.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.400
A picture-in-picture
overlay is a mode

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.890
that you enter from
a visible activity.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.930
The user will see the
contents of the activity

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.970
during the entire
transition animation,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.460
so you'll want to
optimize this experience.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.340
Of course, it does count
as a configuration change.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.250
To avoid visual hiccups, make
sure you handle configuration

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.350
changes in your activity.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.670
How do you design for PIP?

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.670
Well, designing for
Picture-In-Picture, or PIP,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.550
is simple.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.310
It's a small window,
so you simply

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.430
hide all of the views that
aren't relevant to the overlay.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.290
For example, if you're
playing a video,

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.990
you should only show
the video content

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.720
and hide all of the other views
to create a simple overlay.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.420
Another important thing to
note when designing for PIP--

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.320
overlays have a fixed aspect
ratio you configure in code.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.930
This lets you specify
the perfect aspect ratio

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.710
for your content.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.490
Now, to support user interaction
with your PIP overlay,

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.330
you may supply a small number of
controls called remote actions.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.670
You can use remote actions
for simple interaction,

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.610
such as playing or
pausing a video.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.670
When in PIP mode, your activity
won't get any touch events.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.720
Instead, you configure remote
actions with PendingIntents.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.490
When a user presses
a remote action,

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.350
the PendingIntent will
be fired, and you'll

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.690
be notified via a
BroadcastReceiver

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.340
or other means.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.290
When your user expands
the overlay back

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.890
to a regular activity, you'll
get notified via a callback.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.960
You'll need to reshow
all of your hidden views

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.820
when your activity
exits PIP mode.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.830
And there's one
more detail to note.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.480
When an activity
enters PIP mode,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.090
it starts a new task
without a back stack.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.980
When it exits PIP
mode, it does not

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.390
bring back the original task.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.270
So by default, Back
will leave your app.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.000
Your user's navigation
history is lost.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.460
To recover your back stack,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.680
on recovering navigation state.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.240
Picture-in-picture
is a great way

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.810
to continue your users' critical
tasks as they use their phone.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.550
I've just covered
the essentials here.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.350

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.130
Thanks for watching.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.170
See you next time.
