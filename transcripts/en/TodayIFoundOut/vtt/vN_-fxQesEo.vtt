00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:01.790
The speaking clock is an idea that goes all
the way back to 1933, when citizens of Paris

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.850
were the recipients of the first such service.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.020
Since then, dozens of countries have implemented
a similar system that the public can call

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.020
to find out the exact time.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.620
In the UK, the service has a long and storied
history and even today in the age of near

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.977
ubiquitous smartphones and the internet it’s
still called an astounding thirty million

00:00:13.977 --> 00:00:14.977
times per year.

00:00:14.977 --> 00:00:17.560
Prior to the introduction of the UK speaking
clock service in 1936, it’s noted that people

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.590
wanting to know the time who didn’t have
a clock or watch handy would simply call the

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.790
exchange operator and ask, resulting in operators
spending much of their time doing this, instead

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.989
of routing calls.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.380
Prior to this, the somewhat official role
of a person telling people the time often

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.160
fell to employees of the Post Office, who
would pass it on to their mail coaches who

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.920
in turn would pass it on to the public when
asked as they made their rounds.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.480
(For more ways people used to get the time,
see: Telling Time Before Ubiquitous Clocks.)

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.570
With exchange operators being inundated with
calls from people just wanting to know the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.370
time, it was evident from almost the moment
telephones were first introduced and made

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.510
available to the British public in the last
years of the 19th century that an automated

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.940
speaking clock system was needed.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.010
Unfortunately, the technology to record human
voices wasn’t widely commercially available

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.200
until around the mid-1920s.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.570
Even then, it would take until the mid-1930s
for the Post Office, who controlled the telephone

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.000
system in the UK at the time, to begin designing
a machine that would accurately tell you the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.140
time audibly.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.600
The speaking clock machine eventually constructed
by the Post Office was relatively large and

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.030
contained “state of the art” technology
including using several electric motors, glass

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.970
discs, various valves, and photocells.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.870
This system was evidently good enough that
the service wasn’t upgraded until 1963,

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.360
nearly three decades after it was originally
introduced.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.360
With the system designed, a voice was needed.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.190
As such the Post Office held a competition
to “the girl with the golden voice”.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.190
No men were considered for the role as the
telephone orientated jobs were still seen

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.190
as a strictly female gendered profession back
then.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.790
The winner of the contest would not only become
the voice of the speaking clock, but also

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.620
be given a prize of 10 guineas or about £700
today, a somewhat paltry sum given the billions

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.060
(after adjusting for inflation) the service
has earned in the ensuing decades since its

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.060
genesis.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.890
The woman chosen for the gig was one Ethel
Jane Cain, a telephonist.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.409
After being selected, Cain was given a script
of things to say.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.280
She described the recording process in a 1957
Manchester Radio interview:

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.890
The way I recorded it was in jerks as it were.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.239
I said: “At the Third Stroke” (that does
for all the times), and then I counted from

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.799
One, Two, Three, Four, for the hours, we even
went as far as twenty-four, in case the twenty-four-hour

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.890
clock should need to be used, and then I said
“…and ten seconds, and twenty seconds,

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.169
and thirty, forty, fifty seconds”, and “o’clock”
and “precisely”.

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:31.200
The famous “precisely”.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.249
So what you hear is “At the Third Stroke
it will be one, twenty-one and forty seconds”

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:40.730
She went on to note that “the real work
was done by the engineers of the Post Office”

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.340
who had to painstakingly fit all her lines
together so they maintained a natural sounding

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.340
cadence.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.879
For those who’ve never called before, since
1936, the line spoken by the talking clock

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.329
prior to announcing the time has remained
more or less exactly as Ethel described it-

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.379
the disembodied voice on the other end of
the line simply states, with little variation:

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.540
“At the third stroke, the time will be [insert
time here]” At which point three beeps will

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.999
play, the third of which will coincide with
the exact time mentioned followed by a brief

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:10.280
pause before the message plays again.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.790
To call the service, users simply had to call
846, which spelled out the first three letters

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.540
of the word “time”, leading to the service
colloquially being known as “Tim” in the

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.370
areas of the country using this number (other
areas used other numbers until 1990 when the

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.549
number you needed to dial was changed more
simply to 123).

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:38.129
To 
maintain the service, people calling were

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.180
initially charged a single penny, a figure
that has steadily risen over the years to

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.529
30p today, making the service incredibly profitable.

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:50.919
Officially introduced on July 24, 1936, the
British speaking clock service received approximately

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:55.419
13 million calls during its first year of
operation, a figure that becomes doubly impressive

00:03:55.419 --> 00:04:00.669
when you realise the service was only available
in London for the first six years it existed.

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:04.319
With the massive number of calls coming in
at all hours, to make sure people didn’t

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.500
clog up the lines at any given time, the Post
Office issued a briefing after the system

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.150
was debuted, noting:

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.639
In view of the possibility of certain members
of the public becoming so enamoured of the

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:18.130
golden voice that they are impelled to listen
to it for an indefinite period, an automatic

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.130
device disconnects the circuit at the end
of ninety seconds.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.540
While the idea of people becoming “enamoured”
with a recording of someone reading the time

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.650
might seem silly, Brian Cobby, the third “golden
voice” of the speaking clock claimed that

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.460
he often received fan-mail, particularly from
“older women”, who liked to call the speaking

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.430
clock at night when they couldn’t sleep,
just to listen to his soothing voice.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.040
Speaking of Cobby, since its initial inception,
there have been four “permanent” (non-guest)

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.626
voices for the speaking clock, the aforementioned
Ethel Jane (you can hear her time reading

00:04:46.626 --> 00:04:51.130
here), who provided the voice between 1936
and 1963; Pat Simmons (listen here), who provided

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.690
it from 1963 to 1984; actor Brian Cobby (listen
here), who lent his voice to the service from

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.590
1984 to 2007; and Sara Mendes da Costa (listen
here, or if you live in the UK just call the

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.400
number) who is the current voice of the service.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.630
All four of these individuals became the voice
after entering a “golden voice” competition

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.720
similar to the one previously discussed and
were variously rewarded with cash prizes in

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.280
addition to becoming the new voice of the
service.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.660
As for the accuracy of the speaking clock,
though many maintain that the modern speaking

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.250
clock is “accurate to within one five thousandth
of a second”, this claim is disputed by

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.500
the National Physics Laboratory who say that,
owing to variable delays in the transmission

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.330
actually getting to your phone: “you can
probably expect the starts of the seconds

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.800
pips to be accurate seconds markers within
about one-tenth of a second.”

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.690
This said, the service does take an extraordinary
amount of care in ensuring that the time they

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.270
give is as accurate as possible, even attempting
to account for the delay for the signal to

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.280
reach your phone.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.590
The service is so accurate that a minor scandal
was caused in 2013 when it emerged that employees

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.400
at the Ministry of Defence had spent £40,000
of public money (about 130,000 calls) calling

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.330
the service to synchronize their clocks over
the previous three years, despite the fact

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.790
that doing exactly that was explicitly banned
by the Ministry of Defence in 2010.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.620
Other than MOD employee calling to synchronise
watches, it has been noted that the service

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.290
fields the most calls on four very specific
days: The day the clocks go forward and back

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.270
for daylight saving time, New Year’s Eve
(with people trying to ensure they celebrate

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.650
the new year at the exact right moment) and
November the 11th (so that they can observe

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:24.740
the traditional 2 minutes silence for Remembrance
Day at the exact right time, 11AM).

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.340
Despite the huge technological leaps made
in the last few decades that would seem to

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.330
make such a service obsolete, the speaking
clock service still fields an estimated 30

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.450
million calls every year or about 82,000 calls
per day.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.880
That said, this is markedly less than a little
under a decade ago before the ubiquity of

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.330
smart phones, when the service was pulling
in an average of about 200,000 calls per day.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:09:25.259
With either numbers, at 30p a call, the speaking
clock is still raking

00:09:25.259 --> 00:09:56.980
in

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:10.959
the money.
