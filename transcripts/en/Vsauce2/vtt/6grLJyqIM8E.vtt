00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.270
Vsauce!

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.270
Kevin here.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.110
Fighting an inflatable dragon with a plastic
sword.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.300
Which is all you can do with a dragon.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.950
They’re fairy tale foes in the west.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.960
But for some reason, the dragon image has
existed all over the world since the dawn

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.710
of civilization.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.470
So is the dragon just a fantasy cliché, or
does it help explain our evolution, embody

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.160
our oldest fears, and unite all of humanity?

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.710
And when old maps marked unexplored territories
with, “Here be dragons.”

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.969
Well...where be dragons?

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.460
Everywhere.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:05.460
South America, Central America, North America,
Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia - the dragon

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.780
is a universal ancient concept.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.880
Long before legends of English knights besting
maiden-devouring, fire-breathing dragons,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.570
the Aztec worshipped Quetzalcoatl, a feathered
serpent sky dragon god of wisdom and life.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.840
And the ancient Greek serpent dragon Ladon
was trusted with guarding immortality-granting

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.270
golden apples until he was defeated by the
demigod Heracles.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.939
Ladon, like many dragons, was very snake-y.

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.240
Wait, why are dragons and snakes so closely
related?

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.830
To get to our imagination’s ultimate predator,
we have to start with the first persistent

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.490
predator of our evolution.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:53.420
Molecular Phylogeneticists who study DNA to
date organisms, date like time not date like...y'know...

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.860
believe that our earliest placental mammal
ancestors began flourishing within 400,000

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.640
years of dinosaur extinction about 65.5 million
years ago.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.990
But snakes basically as we know them today
were around 100 million years ago.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.200
They had about 20 million years of alone time
eating placental mammals before predatory

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.640
birds joined the party, and had another 2
million before the first carnivorous mammals

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.830
evolved.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.640
Snakes had been eating every iteration of
our evolving ancestors for millions of years

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.000
- so by the time homo sapiens evolved and
developed language, we were talking about

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.330
our oldest arch-enemy -- snakes.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.760
In what’s considered the oldest known great
piece of literature, Mesopotamia’s Epic

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.470
Of Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh’s immortality is
stolen by a snake.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.390
A snake makes him mortal.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.660
The Abrahamic origin story says that a serpent
convinced Eve to eat forbidden fruit from

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.040
the tree of knowledge of good and evil by
promising that, “her eyes would be opened.”

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.300
She and Adam were subsequently banished from
an immortal paradise, but the mortal threat

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.660
of snakes might have literally helped our
eyes.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.640
The Snake Detection Hypothesis suggests that
visual systems of primates evolved to detect

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.019
dangerous animals - primarily venomous snakes.

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.390
In The Fruit, The Tree, And The Serpent, anthropologist
Lynne Isbell explains the hypothesis like

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.739
this: Snakes evolved to be difficult to see
and mortally dangerous.

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.980
They coil their camouflaged bodies and remain
motionless until they attack.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.690
Surviving the peril of snakes for millions
of years required selective pressure favoring

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.209
primates’ specialized visual systems.

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.450
And compared to other mammals, the pulvinar
region of the brain, which helps visually

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.480
detect relevant objects, is disproportionately
large in primates and humans.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.920
Studies from different international labs
have detailed the ability of humans’ enhanced

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.299
visual relay system to recognize snakes.

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.709
And this sight is preconscious.

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.420
Blindsight, which lets even those with cortical
blindness respond to visual stimuli without

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.519
knowingly perceiving it, allows us to detect
snakes and react without being consciously

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:13.590
aware of them.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.880
Basically, we can notice and react to a snake
without having to think, “There is a snake,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.720
I’d better watch out!”

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.740
Or like explorer Percy Fawcett wrote after
dodging the attack of a bushmaster, “I had

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.530
not seen it until it flashed between my legs,
but the ‘inner man’ - if I can call it

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.990
that - not only saw it in time, but judged
its striking height and distance exactly,

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.200
and issued commands to the body accordingly!”

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.570
Fawcett’s “inner man” was confirmed
by a 1993 study on “Conditioned electrodermal

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.750
responses to masked fear-relevant stimuli.”

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.830
Not very catchy.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.410
Consistent with the hypothesis, the lemurs
of Madagascar, an early branch of primates

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:02.370
living on an isolated island off the coast
of Africa with no venomous snakes, do not

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.170
fear snakes and have poor vision.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.130
Armed with the vision to detect them, we quickly
learn to fear snakes.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.560
Ophidiophobia, or a fear of snakes, is one
of the most common and intense phobias in

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.590
the world.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.919
In The Dragons Of Eden, Carl Sagan notes dream
studies in which almost half of the people

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.400
surveyed reported dreams about snakes.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.110
And while modern psychologists’ studies
show neither human infants nor monkeys raised

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:36.540
in captivity inherently fear snakes, studies
of fear association showed both are prepared

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.540
to learn.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.900
Lab monkeys showing no initial fear response
were conditioned to fear live as well as toy

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.860
snakes after viewing videos of wild monkeys
demonstrating a fear response to snakes.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.630
Researchers were unable to condition the monkeys
to fear non-threatening stimuli like flowers

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.009
or toy rabbits.

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:03.669
We notice and fear snakes as part of a co-evolution
arms race for survival that eventually led

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:09.680
to us telling legendary stories of our origins
amongst serpents.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.680
 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.570
Skeptics of the Snake Detection Hypothesis
would like to see more data, like studies

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:20.850
done with primates reacting not just to snakes,
but to other primate predators like leopards

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:21.850
and eagles.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:28.169
And in any case, dragons don’t just look
like snakes, dragons have legs, they can fly

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.650
and they have a mouth full of ferocious sharp
teeth.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:39.009
Dragons are more like a snake mixed with
a leopard and an…eagle.

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:43.300
The three predators monkeys are screaming
about.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.419
When Anthropologist David Jones studied howler
monkeys, he noticed they use three distinct

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:53.110
alarm signals that lead to specific instinctive
safety actions.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.350
One call alerts the group to a snake and they
stand up on their hind legs to look at the

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.560
ground and then climb to safety in the tops
of trees.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.190
Another call identifies a hunting bird or
raptor and monkeys abandon the trees, hit

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.620
the ground and take cover in bushes.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:14.009
Finally, a call for a leopard or large carnivoran
causes them to run into the trees and out

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:18.750
onto the thinnest branches that can’t support
heavier meat-eating mammals.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.971
In An Instinct For Dragons, Jones writes that
the dragon is a composite creature of the

00:07:23.971 --> 00:07:29.910
three major predators of primates -- serpent,
carnivore and raptor.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:34.979
He believes combining them into one monster
is a natural indexing mechanism performed

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:38.000
by the brain to consolidate a message.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.470
That message is to recognize, beware, and
honor what Georgess McHargue called in her

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:51.520
1968 book The Beasts Of Never, “the oldest,
the first, and the most basic monster.”

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.570
McHargue was right.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:59.139
The Epic Of Gilgamesh not only mentions dragons
but featured the demigod Humbaba, whose dragon-like

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:04.389
characteristics included the head of a lion,
the claws of a vulture, a body covered in

00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:08.490
thorny scales, and a tail that ended in a
snake’s head.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:13.300
Also, a phallus that ended in a snake’s
head.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.160
Phallus means weiner.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.280
Conquering or harnessing the power of this
symbol of nature’s chaos granted the hero

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.669
the power to create order.

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:28.800
Chinese emperors are said to be descended
from dragons, and adorned their kingdoms with

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.680
dragon imagery.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.990
In the East, civilizations were created with
the blessing of dragons.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:41.010
In the West, civilizations drew power from
tales of defeating them.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:45.350
But something weird happened to dragons in
Western culture over the last hundred years

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:52.480
- these manifestations of evil that needed
to be vanquished to secure our future became

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.440
friends with our future.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.570
Dragons became playmates for children.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:05.410
The Reluctant Dragon, written by Kenneth Grahame
in 1898, was the first popular western story

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:08.600
in which a dragon is a sympathetic character.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:13.959
It tells the tale of a bookworm child who
befriends and defends a peaceful, poetry-loving

00:09:13.959 --> 00:09:20.000
dragon from the stubborn, ideological local
villagers who believe all dragons must be

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.800
destroyed as tradition demands.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.880
The valiant dragon slayer of legend, St. George,
is summoned to kill the dragon but the child

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.730
successfully convinces the knight to spare
his harmless friend.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:36.709
To appease the blood-thirsty villagers, they
stage a fake battle in which George innocently

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:40.380
pierces a fold of skin on the dragon’s neck.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:45.430
George then parades the dragon through town
and declares he is no longer a threat.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:52.290
The knight, the child and the dragon walk
away peacefully, hand-in-hand into the night.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:58.750
Peter Green wrote in a 1959 biography of Grahame
that he grew up in the countryside of Berkshire

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:06.560
during a time so simple kids entertained themselves
by playing games like “push the heavy log.”

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:11.240
As an adult, Grahame was reluctantly forced
into banking in the booming city of London

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:16.260
after being unable to afford his dream of
going to Oxford University.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.690
At the height of uncontrolled development
of manufacturing during the industrial revolution,

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:27.500
the whimsy and serenity of Grahame’s rural
youth contrasted starkly with the rigid responsibilities

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.850
of banking in polluted, urban 19th century
London.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:37.170
The Reluctant Dragon represents the inner
turmoil Grahame felt between his creative,

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:42.930
artistic self -- the dragon -- and his dutiful,
banker self embodied by the fabled dragon

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.740
slayer St. George.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:50.540
In the end, the knight, the child and the
dragon make peace with one another at a time

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:55.940
when Grahame reconciled with his own struggle
between being an artist and being a prominent

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.000
member of The Establishment.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.410
The first friendly dragon story is a negotiation
between the rigid control of modern humanity

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:12.020
and the anarchist entropy of nature brokered
by the precocious innocence of adolescence.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:17.649
The dawn of modern science and human advancement
required a compromise between our past and

00:11:17.649 --> 00:11:18.649
our future.

00:11:18.649 --> 00:11:23.640
We became friends with an enemy we had fought
for time immemorial.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:28.589
An enemy who represents time immemorial.

00:11:28.589 --> 00:11:34.470
The ouroboros, a serpent or dragon eating
its own tail, symbolizes the infinite cycle

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.940
of nature -- creation from destruction.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:43.529
A fundamental truth recorded by the earliest
civilizations.

00:11:43.529 --> 00:11:48.760
Life and death eternal.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:55.480
Today, we don’t need dragons.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.220
Not like we used to.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:02.080
The millions-year war is over and we’re
still here.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.280
Living and breathing the fire of curiosity
and courage.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.980
Instinctively exploring the deepest, darkest,
depths of the unknown.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:16.920
And overcoming the impossibly powerful enemy
guarding the most valuable treasures imaginable.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:22.830
Using our minds to detect problems and invent
ways to conquer challenges.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:26.399
It’s how we evolve.

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:30.050
But into what?

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:36.950
Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche warned, “He
who fights too long against dragons becomes

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:42.110
a dragon himself...”

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:47.440
Devoid of the monsters that strengthened us
for this moment, we’re left with the power

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.950
to decide.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.730
“Am I the knight?

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.760
Am I the child?

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.870
Or am I the dragon?”

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:03.190
And as always - thanks for watching.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.960
Don't you know?

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:28.360
You were brave with a free-talking mind and
a voice that is still a cry for life.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:35.860
And no matter what we want, we want to be
loved.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.960
Yes we were here.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.840
We were afraid.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:48.780
We paid them for the right to commit our own
ego suicide.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:58.560
But I believe it's just a ride.
