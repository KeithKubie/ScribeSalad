00:00:01.046 --> 00:00:01.986
&gt;&gt;Student: It's like, way more rougher.

00:00:07.586 --> 00:00:08.856
&gt;&gt;Roshelle: How many of you
noticed that the club soda started

00:00:08.856 --> 00:00:10.266
to get bubbles around it and fizz?

00:00:10.646 --> 00:00:12.096
Why do you think that's happening?

00:00:12.476 --> 00:00:16.336
&gt;&gt;Student: In most sodas, around
the glass, like bubbles appear

00:00:16.336 --> 00:00:19.066
and I think the same effect
happened with the candy.

00:00:19.346 --> 00:00:21.836
&gt;&gt;Roshelle: The benefits of having
explorations class is keeping the kids

00:00:21.836 --> 00:00:23.786
engaged, getting them
to ask those questions.

00:00:24.076 --> 00:00:27.976
It just really gets the kids
excited and motivated to learn more.

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:38.346
&gt;&gt;Katie: Explorations, the idea behind
it is creating classes of choice

00:00:38.346 --> 00:00:41.616
for children, so that they can sign
up for an interest that they may have.

00:00:41.876 --> 00:00:44.566
And then it also provides the
teachers with an incentive to be able

00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.766
to teach something that
they're very passionate about.

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:50.286
&gt;&gt;Vicky: Each teacher picks a topic
that they're interested in that fits

00:00:50.286 --> 00:00:53.616
in our STEAM theme, the science,
technology, engineering, the arts,

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:56.906
or mathematics, and they come up with
eight lessons that go along with it.

00:00:56.906 --> 00:00:59.956
And then the kids get to choose which
topic, and you have mixed grade levels.

00:01:01.086 --> 00:01:02.006
&gt;&gt;So is the wheel going to go on here?

00:01:02.336 --> 00:01:02.516
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:01:02.516 --> 00:01:03.756
&gt;&gt;Vicky: So we're going
to put the wheels

00:01:03.756 --> 00:01:06.306
on which direction, this
way or this way?

00:01:08.146 --> 00:01:09.956
&gt;&gt;Student: I think this
way is going to be better.

00:01:10.056 --> 00:01:11.806
&gt;&gt;Vicky: Right now, I have toyology,
which is fourth and fifth graders,

00:01:11.806 --> 00:01:15.766
and we are going to analyze how toys are
built, what the components are in them,

00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.466
and then they will apply
that information

00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.846
and knowledge to make their own toys?

00:01:19.226 --> 00:01:22.816
&gt;&gt;Georgette: A blueprint is
like a sketch of your model.

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:26.766
It's what, you want to make
a model, you blueprint it,

00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:30.916
and you would have what it looks
like, what it's made out of.

00:01:31.226 --> 00:01:33.596
Anyone who really builds
anything would use it

00:01:33.596 --> 00:01:36.246
because it scales what
they were going to build.

00:01:36.686 --> 00:01:39.086
&gt;&gt;Katie: We make sure that our
kids have a lot of opportunities

00:01:39.086 --> 00:01:43.306
to be very curious, to observe,
to wonder, to have a hypothesis,

00:01:43.306 --> 00:01:47.026
to find something out, to re-engineer
something and think about the world

00:01:47.026 --> 00:01:47.976
around them, how can they contribute?

00:01:49.186 --> 00:01:50.976
&gt;&gt;Georgette: We're having
fun, but also learning.

00:01:52.046 --> 00:01:56.976
&gt;&gt;Student: It didn't really do
nothing, it just really stayed.

00:01:58.076 --> 00:02:01.126
&gt;&gt;Roshelle: The exploration class I'm
teaching is called candy chemistry.

00:02:01.576 --> 00:02:03.476
The kids come in and we get to--

00:02:03.476 --> 00:02:06.136
like yesterday we did the
Mentos and Diet Coke challenge.

00:02:06.276 --> 00:02:08.736
So they get to really do a
lot of science observing.

00:02:08.826 --> 00:02:14.066
&gt;&gt;Student: If it has bubbles, it might
like affect the thing you're putting in.

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:19.236
&gt;&gt;Alexa: You learn about how
candy works with different drinks

00:02:19.236 --> 00:02:23.786
and how it dissolves,
and why it dissolves.

00:02:23.786 --> 00:02:25.706
Science is everywhere.

00:02:25.876 --> 00:02:29.956
It's in trees, grass,
dirt, the whole earth

00:02:30.036 --> 00:02:33.096
and the sky, so science is everywhere.

00:02:35.786 --> 00:02:38.376
&gt;&gt;Klaus: I started a drone explo,
the idea of opening their eyes

00:02:38.376 --> 00:02:42.706
to the possibility of, like drones can
really help you do a lot of things.

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:46.496
&gt;&gt;Set it down, okay.

00:02:47.076 --> 00:02:47.786
&gt;&gt;You have a brain break.

00:02:47.786 --> 00:02:50.936
The idea of them moving to a different
teacher, it's really, really beneficial.

00:02:50.986 --> 00:02:52.576
&gt;&gt;So, Elizabeth, what
drone did you develop?

00:02:52.576 --> 00:02:56.516
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth: I put on cameras
on each side, so that like,

00:02:56.596 --> 00:02:58.556
they could get it from all angles.

00:02:58.556 --> 00:03:01.196
And I also put like a
camera in the middle.

00:03:01.196 --> 00:03:03.046
&gt;&gt;Klaus: If I say, "Okay, we're going
to spend twenty minutes doing math

00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:05.076
and then we're going to just
do twenty minutes of drones,"

00:03:05.306 --> 00:03:06.916
but I'm still going to teach math.

00:03:07.476 --> 00:03:11.046
So what that does is it opens
up the diversity of curriculum,

00:03:11.286 --> 00:03:14.866
so we get to develop something
that starts off from the ground.

00:03:15.246 --> 00:03:16.496
&gt;&gt;You guys ready to fly a drone?

00:03:16.686 --> 00:03:17.876
&gt;&gt;Students: Yes.

00:03:18.056 --> 00:03:19.816
&gt;&gt;Student: Whoo-hoo!

00:03:20.046 --> 00:03:21.886
&gt;&gt;Katie: When the kids
come in and they're able

00:03:21.886 --> 00:03:24.686
to choose what they're going to learn
about, they're much more engaged.

00:03:24.686 --> 00:03:27.786
They're much more likely to go and read
some more nonfiction articles based

00:03:27.786 --> 00:03:29.256
on the topic that they were studying.

00:03:29.256 --> 00:03:31.906
It's all about engaging students and
getting them excited about learning.
