realize overall social well-being okay
so the question then is what is it about

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150
so the question then is what is it about
 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.960
so the question then is what is it about
that description of the Friedman view of

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970
that description of the Friedman view of
 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.740
that description of the Friedman view of
managerial responsibility that doesn't

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750
managerial responsibility that doesn't
 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.240
managerial responsibility that doesn't
meet up with the account or ideal of

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250
meet up with the account or ideal of
 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.950
meet up with the account or ideal of
humanistic

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960
humanistic
 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.350
humanistic
management and so I want to suggest

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360
management and so I want to suggest
 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.110
management and so I want to suggest
basically three three ways in which they

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120
basically three three ways in which they
 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.670
basically three three ways in which they
might might diverge and I think those

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680
might might diverge and I think those
 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.809
might might diverge and I think those
are three dimensions on which to press

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819
are three dimensions on which to press
 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.850
are three dimensions on which to press
the account for humanistic management to

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860
the account for humanistic management to
 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.460
the account for humanistic management to
perhaps define itself sharply as an

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470
perhaps define itself sharply as an
 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.279
perhaps define itself sharply as an
alternative to to what you might call

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289
alternative to to what you might call
 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.469
alternative to to what you might call
standard accounts of managerial

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479
standard accounts of managerial
 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.129
standard accounts of managerial
responsibilities so the the first

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139
responsibilities so the the first
 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.980
responsibilities so the the first
dimension is the idea of of what you

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990
dimension is the idea of of what you
 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.290
dimension is the idea of of what you
might call preference okay

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300
might call preference okay
 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.610
might call preference okay
and the second one is what I'll call

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620
and the second one is what I'll call
 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.060
and the second one is what I'll call
power and the third one is what I'll

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070
power and the third one is what I'll
 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.700
power and the third one is what I'll
call purpose so we have preference power

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710
call purpose so we have preference power
 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.490
call purpose so we have preference power
and purpose let me say a little bit more

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500
and purpose let me say a little bit more
 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.020
and purpose let me say a little bit more
about what I mean by each of those

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030
about what I mean by each of those
 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.800
about what I mean by each of those
dimensions and and where we might try to

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810
dimensions and and where we might try to
 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.450
dimensions and and where we might try to
broaden or enrich the discussion I'm

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460
broaden or enrich the discussion I'm
 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.029
broaden or enrich the discussion I'm
amused to hear from all of you as to how

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039
amused to hear from all of you as to how
 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:25.710
amused to hear from all of you as to how
you would fill in those three areas with

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720
you would fill in those three areas with
 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.999
you would fill in those three areas with
regard to thinking about what is

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009
regard to thinking about what is
 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:31.980
regard to thinking about what is
humanistic management first with regard

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990
humanistic management first with regard
 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.149
humanistic management first with regard
to preference I think on most not just

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:36.159
to preference I think on most not just
 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:38.249
to preference I think on most not just
the the Friedman view right but most

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259
the the Friedman view right but most
 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:40.950
the the Friedman view right but most
liberal views right preference plays a

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960
liberal views right preference plays a
 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.680
liberal views right preference plays a
very powerful role because it's both by

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690
very powerful role because it's both by
 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.749
very powerful role because it's both by
satisfying individual preference that we

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759
satisfying individual preference that we
 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:51.360
satisfying individual preference that we
achieve societal well-being right and

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370
achieve societal well-being right and
 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.610
achieve societal well-being right and
similarly it's by respecting individual

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620
similarly it's by respecting individual
 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.469
similarly it's by respecting individual
preference that we also respect

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479
preference that we also respect
 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.529
preference that we also respect
individual choice so insofar as human

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539
individual choice so insofar as human
 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:01.490
individual choice so insofar as human
dignity is about trying to achieve

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500
dignity is about trying to achieve
 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.800
dignity is about trying to achieve
overall social well-being right and also

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810
overall social well-being right and also
 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.240
overall social well-being right and also
about respecting individual choice then

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250
about respecting individual choice then
 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.379
about respecting individual choice then
the account of dignity has to do more

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389
the account of dignity has to do more
 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:13.529
the account of dignity has to do more
than say something simply about it being

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:13.539
than say something simply about it being
 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:14.999
than say something simply about it being
an account that respects individual

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:15.009
an account that respects individual
 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:18.120
an account that respects individual
preference right and that I think is a

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130
preference right and that I think is a
 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.360
preference right and that I think is a
very important area especially because

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370
very important area especially because
 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.860
very important area especially because
the appeal of the liberal account is

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870
the appeal of the liberal account is
 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.430
the appeal of the liberal account is
that it allows for a wide-ranging set of

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440
that it allows for a wide-ranging set of
 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.890
that it allows for a wide-ranging set of
views of the good life it allows for

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900
views of the good life it allows for
 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.749
views of the good life it allows for
wide-ranging set of views about what it

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759
wide-ranging set of views about what it
 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.219
wide-ranging set of views about what it
is that makes people's lives meaningful

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:35.229
is that makes people's lives meaningful
 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:38.399
is that makes people's lives meaningful
and especially in a global economy right

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:38.409
and especially in a global economy right
 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:40.290
and especially in a global economy right
being able to allow for that I think is

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300
being able to allow for that I think is
 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.240
being able to allow for that I think is
very important so the question is is

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250
very important so the question is is
 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.700
very important so the question is is
there a way to account for individual

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710
there a way to account for individual
 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.810
there a way to account for individual
well-being an individual choice

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:48.820
well-being an individual choice
 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.890
well-being an individual choice
in a way that simply isn't about

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:49.900
in a way that simply isn't about
 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.250
in a way that simply isn't about
respecting preference that comes to the

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:53.260
respecting preference that comes to the
 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.380
respecting preference that comes to the
idea of humanism but at the same time

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:55.390
idea of humanism but at the same time
 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.590
idea of humanism but at the same time
allows one to do that in the context of

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:58.600
allows one to do that in the context of
 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.820
allows one to do that in the context of
a global economy where there is a

00:06:59.820 --> 00:06:59.830
a global economy where there is a
 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.160
a global economy where there is a
plurality of values and a plurality of

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.170
plurality of values and a plurality of
 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.740
plurality of values and a plurality of
conceptions of what it is to lead the

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:04.750
conceptions of what it is to lead the
 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.710
conceptions of what it is to lead the
good life so that's sort of the first

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720
good life so that's sort of the first
 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.320
good life so that's sort of the first
first dimension I think that we be

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:10.330
first dimension I think that we be
 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.670
first dimension I think that we be
interesting to talk a little bit more

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680
interesting to talk a little bit more
 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.260
interesting to talk a little bit more
about the second one is power

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.270
about the second one is power
 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.350
about the second one is power
okay the Beast I focus on powers that I

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360
okay the Beast I focus on powers that I
 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.760
okay the Beast I focus on powers that I
think that actually that's one area

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:20.770
think that actually that's one area
 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.600
think that actually that's one area
where the classical liberal view in

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.610
where the classical liberal view in
 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:28.440
where the classical liberal view in
economics doesn't do a very good job of

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:28.450
economics doesn't do a very good job of
 

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.990
economics doesn't do a very good job of
accounting for because in the classical

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:31.000
accounting for because in the classical
 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.820
accounting for because in the classical
liberal view basically everything is a

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:32.830
liberal view basically everything is a
 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.290
liberal view basically everything is a
matter of exchange right and a short of

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:37.300
matter of exchange right and a short of
 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.800
matter of exchange right and a short of
any sort of severe form of coercion or

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:40.810
any sort of severe form of coercion or
 

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.440
any sort of severe form of coercion or
physical restriction right basically

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:43.450
physical restriction right basically
 

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.390
physical restriction right basically
it's a matter of economic exchange and

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:45.400
it's a matter of economic exchange and
 

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.710
it's a matter of economic exchange and
when I think about the concern of

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720
when I think about the concern of
 

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.960
when I think about the concern of
dignity I my sense is that the concern

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:48.970
dignity I my sense is that the concern
 

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.480
dignity I my sense is that the concern
with dignity really is about a concern

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:51.490
with dignity really is about a concern
 

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.820
with dignity really is about a concern
with the appropriate exercise of

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:53.830
with the appropriate exercise of
 

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.070
with the appropriate exercise of
managerial power all right in other

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080
managerial power all right in other
 

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.420
managerial power all right in other
words that a lot of the concern with

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:57.430
words that a lot of the concern with
 

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.640
words that a lot of the concern with
dignity is about how is it that managers

00:07:59.640 --> 00:07:59.650
dignity is about how is it that managers
 

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.170
dignity is about how is it that managers
are exercising their power visa via

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:01.180
are exercising their power visa via
 

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.390
are exercising their power visa via
employees for example in the firm and so

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.400
employees for example in the firm and so
 

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.400
employees for example in the firm and so
they asked is one area where where the

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:05.410
they asked is one area where where the
 

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.320
they asked is one area where where the
human humanistic approach to management

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:07.330
human humanistic approach to management
 

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.750
human humanistic approach to management
actually has a lot more to say that can

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:09.760
actually has a lot more to say that can
 

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.880
actually has a lot more to say that can
be quite valuable to add to the standard

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:11.890
be quite valuable to add to the standard
 

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.890
be quite valuable to add to the standard
kind of classical account of thinking

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:13.900
kind of classical account of thinking
 

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.470
kind of classical account of thinking
about management and economics where

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:16.480
about management and economics where
 

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.420
about management and economics where
everything isn't simply about exchange

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:18.430
everything isn't simply about exchange
 

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:19.770
everything isn't simply about exchange
but there is a dimension of power that

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:19.780
but there is a dimension of power that
 

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.780
but there is a dimension of power that
goes unrecognized that needs to be be

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:21.790
goes unrecognized that needs to be be
 

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.270
goes unrecognized that needs to be be
addressed and then the question becomes

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:24.280
addressed and then the question becomes
 

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.950
addressed and then the question becomes
is is dignity really simply just about

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960
is is dignity really simply just about
 

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.850
is is dignity really simply just about
right the appropriate exercise of power

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:31.860
right the appropriate exercise of power
 

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.230
right the appropriate exercise of power
so say for example power is non

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240
so say for example power is non
 

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.750
so say for example power is non
domination right or power as a respect

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:36.760
domination right or power as a respect
 

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.750
domination right or power as a respect
for fairness or is humanistic management

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760
for fairness or is humanistic management
 

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.670
for fairness or is humanistic management
and dignity require more than simply

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:44.680
and dignity require more than simply
 

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.500
and dignity require more than simply
just what might be called either the

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:46.510
just what might be called either the
 

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.470
just what might be called either the
unfair or dominating use of power which

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:49.480
unfair or dominating use of power which
 

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.970
unfair or dominating use of power which
could be accommodated in a liberal

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:50.980
could be accommodated in a liberal
 

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:56.790
could be accommodated in a liberal
approach at last miss purpose

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:56.800
 
 

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.240
 
and by this I mean the purpose of both

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:00.250
and by this I mean the purpose of both
 

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.380
and by this I mean the purpose of both
economic activity in general but also

the purpose of the firm now the standard
liberal view I think is very

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:10.040
liberal view I think is very
 

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.190
liberal view I think is very
conveniently melts together the view

conveniently melts together the view
 

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.660
conveniently melts together the view
that if individuals pursue their own

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:13.670
that if individuals pursue their own
 

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.250
that if individuals pursue their own

you can imagine that leads to the
 

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.600
you can imagine that leads to the
overall satisfaction of social welfare

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:19.610

humanistic management I read about the

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.760
humanistic management I read about the
 

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.760
humanistic management I read about the
idea of serving the common good as sort

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:27.770
idea of serving the common good as sort
 

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.440
idea of serving the common good as sort
of underlying what it is the purpose of

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:29.450
of underlying what it is the purpose of
 

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.340
of underlying what it is the purpose of
the firm and business activity should be

actually would want to raise sort of one

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:37.340
actually would want to raise sort of one
 

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.870
actually would want to raise sort of one
question which is is pursuit of the

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:40.880
question which is is pursuit of the
 

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.420
question which is is pursuit of the
common good actually intention with

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:43.430
common good actually intention with
 

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:47.410
common good actually intention with
respect for human dignity okay because

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:47.420
respect for human dignity okay because
 

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.210
respect for human dignity okay because
you can imagine all sorts of pursuits in

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:49.220
you can imagine all sorts of pursuits in
 

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.670
you can imagine all sorts of pursuits in
the common good which require great

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680
the common good which require great
 

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.950
the common good which require great
sacrifice on the part of individuals and

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:53.960
sacrifice on the part of individuals and
 

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.500
sacrifice on the part of individuals and
so the insofar as human dignity is about

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:56.510
so the insofar as human dignity is about
 

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.730
so the insofar as human dignity is about
actually respecting individuals I wonder

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:00.740
actually respecting individuals I wonder
 

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.200
actually respecting individuals I wonder
if appeal to the common good is the

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:02.210
if appeal to the common good is the
 

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.240
if appeal to the common good is the
right appeal to sort of look to with

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:04.250
right appeal to sort of look to with
 

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.800
right appeal to sort of look to with
regard to thinking about purpose in the

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:05.810
regard to thinking about purpose in the
 

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:10.090
regard to thinking about purpose in the
context of economic activity okay at the

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:10.100
context of economic activity okay at the
 

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.200
context of economic activity okay at the
same time I can understand the

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:11.210
same time I can understand the
 

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:12.940
same time I can understand the
resistance on the part of humanistic

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:12.950
resistance on the part of humanistic
 

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.310
resistance on the part of humanistic
management to sort of focusing on simply

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:15.320
management to sort of focusing on simply
 

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.110
management to sort of focusing on simply
the purpose of economic activity is

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120
the purpose of economic activity is
 

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.780
the purpose of economic activity is
whatever individuals themselves choose

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:19.790
whatever individuals themselves choose
 

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.450
whatever individuals themselves choose
as the proper ends of the Association or

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:22.460
as the proper ends of the Association or
 

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.340
as the proper ends of the Association or
the proper ends for themselves and so

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:24.350
the proper ends for themselves and so
 

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:25.600
the proper ends for themselves and so
the question is is there something in

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:25.610
the question is is there something in
 

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:29.040
the question is is there something in
between the idea of the common good and

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.050
between the idea of the common good and
 

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:32.490
between the idea of the common good and
sort of the simple pursuit of individual

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:32.500
sort of the simple pursuit of individual
 

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.550
sort of the simple pursuit of individual
purpose my own thought is that there's

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:35.560
purpose my own thought is that there's
 

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.930
purpose my own thought is that there's
something there and thinking about the

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:37.940
something there and thinking about the
 

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.660
something there and thinking about the
idea of thinking about economic activity

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:40.670
idea of thinking about economic activity
 

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.150
idea of thinking about economic activity
as the creation of meaningful

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:43.160
as the creation of meaningful
 

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.579
as the creation of meaningful
opportunity for individuals to pursue

00:10:45.579 --> 00:10:45.589
opportunity for individuals to pursue
 

00:10:45.589 --> 00:10:48.970
opportunity for individuals to pursue
their own ends and that's sort of my own

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:48.980
their own ends and that's sort of my own
 

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.710
their own ends and that's sort of my own
view about how to think about it and and

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720
view about how to think about it and and
 

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.420
view about how to think about it and and
and I'm happy to talk about that later

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:52.430
and I'm happy to talk about that later
 

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.280
and I'm happy to talk about that later
but I think trying to understand purpose

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:54.290
but I think trying to understand purpose
 

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.920
but I think trying to understand purpose
is this sort of one last thought and I

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:56.930
is this sort of one last thought and I
 

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:01.210
is this sort of one last thought and I
getting one way to wrap it up is to put

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:01.220
getting one way to wrap it up is to put
 

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.010
getting one way to wrap it up is to put
the question to humanistic management as

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:03.020
the question to humanistic management as
 

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.250
the question to humanistic management as
follows

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:05.260
follows
 

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:10.040
follows
is whether the market is in fact a

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:10.050
is whether the market is in fact a
 

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.140
is whether the market is in fact a
sphere in which human dignity can be

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:13.150
sphere in which human dignity can be
 

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.520
sphere in which human dignity can be
realized and the right set of

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:14.530
realized and the right set of
 

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:16.050
realized and the right set of
institutions to realize it in other

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:16.060
institutions to realize it in other
 

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.790
institutions to realize it in other
words is there something about markets

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:17.800
words is there something about markets
 

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.920
words is there something about markets

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:19.930
that helps to realize from and I human
 

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.530
that helps to realize from and I human
dignity right or is a humanistic

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:22.540
dignity right or is a humanistic
 

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.030
dignity right or is a humanistic
management approach basically taking the

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.040
management approach basically taking the
 

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.580
management approach basically taking the
market as given and saying look we have

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:26.590
market as given and saying look we have
 

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.800
market as given and saying look we have
the market okay they may be desirable

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:28.810
the market okay they may be desirable
 

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.740
the market okay they may be desirable
for other reasons and the question is to

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:31.750
for other reasons and the question is to
 

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.960
for other reasons and the question is to
tame the market in a way to make it

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:33.970
tame the market in a way to make it
 

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.870
tame the market in a way to make it
appropriate for human dignity and and so

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880
appropriate for human dignity and and so
 

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.150
appropriate for human dignity and and so
I think answering that question may be a

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:39.160
I think answering that question may be a
 

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.710
I think answering that question may be a
way to get at some of the issues with

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720
way to get at some of the issues with
 

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.890
way to get at some of the issues with
