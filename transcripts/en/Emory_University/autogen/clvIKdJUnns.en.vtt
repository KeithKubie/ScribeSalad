patients a remarkable benefit they

vitality and health in the 1980s the

vitality and health in the 1980s the
results of transplants were poor and

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400
results of transplants were poor and
 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.679
results of transplants were poor and
kidneys were lost from rejection and

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689
kidneys were lost from rejection and
 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.870
kidneys were lost from rejection and
then we got the cyclosporine class of

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880
then we got the cyclosporine class of
 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.790
then we got the cyclosporine class of
drugs and they really revolutionized

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800
drugs and they really revolutionized
 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.760
drugs and they really revolutionized
transplantation short-term outcomes got

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770
transplantation short-term outcomes got
 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.800
transplantation short-term outcomes got
much better we expected most of our

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:39.810
much better we expected most of our
 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.110
much better we expected most of our
patients to survive with a functioning

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120
patients to survive with a functioning
 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.450

while it's great for short-term outcomes

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830
while it's great for short-term outcomes
 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.160
while it's great for short-term outcomes
causes lots of side effects that really

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170
causes lots of side effects that really
 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.050
causes lots of side effects that really
limit the long-term outcomes that our

only survived for about eight to ten

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509
only survived for about eight to ten
 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.990
only survived for about eight to ten
years which is clearly far short of what

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000
years which is clearly far short of what
 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.600

you'd like for our patients in addition

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610
you'd like for our patients in addition
 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.730
you'd like for our patients in addition
cyclosporine causes lots of other side

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740
cyclosporine causes lots of other side
 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.130
cyclosporine causes lots of other side
effects like diabetes perhaps a third of

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140
effects like diabetes perhaps a third of
 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.450
effects like diabetes perhaps a third of
our patients will develop post

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460
our patients will develop post
 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.760
our patients will develop post
transplant diabetes almost all of them

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770
transplant diabetes almost all of them
 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.709
transplant diabetes almost all of them
take blood pressure lowering medications

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719
take blood pressure lowering medications
 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:25.039
take blood pressure lowering medications
and most of them take medications to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049
and most of them take medications to
 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.389
and most of them take medications to
lower their cholesterol because

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399
lower their cholesterol because
 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.429
lower their cholesterol because
cyclosporine causes all those side

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439
cyclosporine causes all those side
 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.649
cyclosporine causes all those side
effects so the patients will be on any

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659
effects so the patients will be on any
 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.389
effects so the patients will be on any
rejection drugs and then we'll take a

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399
rejection drugs and then we'll take a
 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.760
rejection drugs and then we'll take a
handful of drugs to compact combat the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
handful of drugs to compact combat the
 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.649
handful of drugs to compact combat the
side effects and all of that leads to

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659
side effects and all of that leads to
 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.090
side effects and all of that leads to
premature death from cardiovascular

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100
premature death from cardiovascular
 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.429
premature death from cardiovascular
disease so there's a tremendous need for

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
disease so there's a tremendous need for
 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.950
disease so there's a tremendous need for
better drugs to prevent rejection but

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960
better drugs to prevent rejection but
 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.420
better drugs to prevent rejection but
without causing all those side effects

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430
 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.850
the problem of rejection is that the

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860
the problem of rejection is that the
 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.830
the problem of rejection is that the
immune system recognizes the transplant

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840
immune system recognizes the transplant
 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.970
immune system recognizes the transplant
is foreign and lymphocytes T cells

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980
is foreign and lymphocytes T cells
 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.650
is foreign and lymphocytes T cells
attack and cause immune damage of the

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660
attack and cause immune damage of the
 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.330
attack and cause immune damage of the
transplant so we need drugs to dampen

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340
transplant so we need drugs to dampen
 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.670
transplant so we need drugs to dampen
the immune system cyclosporine does that

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680
the immune system cyclosporine does that
 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.360
the immune system cyclosporine does that
and Bella tacit does that as well the

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370
and Bella tacit does that as well the
 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.310
and Bella tacit does that as well the
problem with cyclosporine is it doesn't

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320
problem with cyclosporine is it doesn't
 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.510
problem with cyclosporine is it doesn't
just affect the immune response it also

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520
just affect the immune response it also
 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.920
just affect the immune response it also
hits a target that's throughout the body

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930
hits a target that's throughout the body
 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.890
hits a target that's throughout the body
so all of those other targets throughout

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900
so all of those other targets throughout
 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.990
so all of those other targets throughout
the body in the cardiovascular system

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000
the body in the cardiovascular system
 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.670
the body in the cardiovascular system
caused those side effects of

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680
caused those side effects of
 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.570
caused those side effects of
cyclosporine elit astept is different it

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580
cyclosporine elit astept is different it
 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.120
cyclosporine elit astept is different it
blocks the immune system but it does so

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130
blocks the immune system but it does so
 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.210
blocks the immune system but it does so
in a selective way because the the

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220
in a selective way because the the
 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.130
in a selective way because the the
target of Bella tacit is really only

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140
target of Bella tacit is really only
 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.229
target of Bella tacit is really only
expressed in the immune system so you

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239
expressed in the immune system so you
 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.180
expressed in the immune system so you
can suppress the undesired immune

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190
can suppress the undesired immune
 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.970
can suppress the undesired immune
response of rejection but you won't see

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980
response of rejection but you won't see
 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.340
response of rejection but you won't see
those off target or non the

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350
those off target or non the
 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.690
those off target or non the
cardiovascular side effects

bellota Supt has been studied
 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.199
