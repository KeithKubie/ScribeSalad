00:00:00.232 --> 00:00:02.522
On app launch, I know that
you're probably tired of seeing

00:00:02.522 --> 00:00:05.230
the dummy data and needing to hit 
the refresh button

00:00:05.337 --> 00:00:07.151
for real data every single time.

00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:10.341
I'm going to show you how to display 
the data using the current settings

00:00:10.341 --> 00:00:12.921
each time the activity is loaded.

00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:15.385
In forecast fragment, 
we just refactored the code

00:00:15.385 --> 00:00:17.207
so that when the refresh button
is selected,

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.836
we call this helper method, 
updateWeather.

00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:22.071
Now that it's in a helper method, 
we can also call it

00:00:22.071 --> 00:00:23.713
from the onStart method.

00:00:23.744 --> 00:00:26.265
We over write onStart so that 
the refresh happens

00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:27.994
whenever the fragment starts.

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:30.102
This will cause 
the weather data to appear.

00:00:30.102 --> 00:00:31.628
We'll learn all about onStart,

00:00:31.628 --> 00:00:34.754
and the rest of the Android 
life cycle in the next lesson.

00:00:34.849 --> 00:00:37.577
At this point, we can also remove 
all the fake data that we had

00:00:37.577 --> 00:00:39.142
in the onCreateView method.

00:00:39.142 --> 00:00:42.629
Then we pass in an empty array list
to the ArrayAdapter.

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.259
Now we can test this.

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:46.381
We need to make sure that 
this is the first app launch

00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:49.775
and that it wasn't already running,
so if it's already running, kill it.

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:51.584
Then tap to open the app,

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:54.104
and then you should see 
the actual weather data immediately.

00:00:54.104 --> 00:00:58.182
Under settings we can change the location
to be the pairs postal code.

00:00:58.182 --> 00:01:00.765
We hit OK, and then return 
to the main list,

00:01:00.765 --> 00:01:03.170
and then we see that 
the weather data has updated.
