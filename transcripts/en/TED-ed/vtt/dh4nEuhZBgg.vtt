00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.001
Your interstellar police squad
has tracked a group of dangerous rebels

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:19.681
to a cluster of of seven small planets.

00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:24.462
Now you must apprehend them quickly 
before their reinforcements arrive.

00:00:24.462 --> 00:00:27.191
Of course, the rebels won’t just stay put.

00:00:27.191 --> 00:00:31.433
They’ll try to dodge you
by moving from planet to planet.

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:34.201
But you have one major advantage.

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:40.460
Every hour, your state-of-the-art cruiser 
can warp between any two planets,

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.409
while their beat-up smuggling ship

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.491
can only jump to an adjacent planet 
in that same time.

00:00:46.491 --> 00:00:48.843
These rebels don’t like to stay put.

00:00:48.843 --> 00:00:52.291
Every time they can relocate, they will.

00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:57.513
Your scouts tell you that the approaching
rebel fleet is 10 hours away.

00:00:57.513 --> 00:01:00.592
You can’t risk letting the rebels escape.

00:01:00.592 --> 00:01:03.514
Can you devise a sequence 
for searching the planets

00:01:03.514 --> 00:01:07.772
that’s guaranteed to catch them 
in 10 warps or less,

00:01:07.772 --> 00:01:12.582
no matter what moves they make?

00:01:12.582 --> 00:01:14.866
Rounding up the rebels won’t be easy.

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:19.926
For one, you have no way of knowing which 
planet they’re on to begin with.

00:01:19.926 --> 00:01:25.222
And without that information, it’s hard 
to determine where they’ll move next.

00:01:25.222 --> 00:01:27.103
So where do you begin?

00:01:27.103 --> 00:01:31.241
When tackling problems of this kind 
it often helps to simplify things,

00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:34.681
so you can better understand 
their dynamics.

00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:37.440
Let’s imagine that this cluster 
has the same arrangement

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.540
but no outermost planets,
leaving only the four in the center.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.391
We still don’t know which planet 
the rebels start on.

00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:47.529
But there’s one key feature:

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:51.252
the third planet 
is adjacent to all others,

00:01:51.252 --> 00:01:55.206
which means the rebels either start there 
and move somewhere else,

00:01:55.206 --> 00:01:57.485
or start on one of the other planets

00:01:57.485 --> 00:02:02.140
and have no choice 
but to move to planet three.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:09.031
Simply checking planet three
twice in a row would do the trick.

00:02:09.031 --> 00:02:13.421
Adding the three outer planet 
adds a bit more complexity,

00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:15.852
but the same strategy remains.

00:02:15.852 --> 00:02:21.051
We want to check the planets in an order 
that will eventually corner the rebels.

00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:23.343
And there’s another insight 
that can help us:

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:26.792
each hour, the rebels move from 
an even-numbered planet

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:28.762
to an odd-numbered planet,

00:02:28.762 --> 00:02:30.530
or vice versa.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.770
This gives us a way 
to simplify the problem

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.742
by dividing the planets into two subsets,

00:02:35.742 --> 00:02:38.170
and tackling each one separately.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.392
For starters, let’s assume the rebels 
begin on an even-numbered planet:

00:02:42.392 --> 00:02:43.110
either two,

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.868
four,

00:02:43.868 --> 00:02:45.191
or six.

00:02:45.191 --> 00:02:47.582
So we’ll search planet two first.

00:02:47.582 --> 00:02:50.533
If they’re not there, they must have 
started on either four

00:02:50.533 --> 00:02:51.843
or six.

00:02:51.843 --> 00:02:53.690
which means they can move to three,

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.491
five,

00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:56.119
or seven.

00:02:56.119 --> 00:03:00.182
Planet three at the center gives them 
the most options for their next move,

00:03:00.182 --> 00:03:02.623
so we’ll want to check there next.

00:03:02.623 --> 00:03:05.841
If we don’t find them, they must have been
at planet five

00:03:05.841 --> 00:03:06.701
or seven,

00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.062
meaning they’ll next move to four

00:03:09.062 --> 00:03:10.810
or six.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.951
Let’s now search planet four.

00:03:12.951 --> 00:03:15.990
If they’re not there, they must have gone 
to the sixth planet

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.021
and can only flee to three

00:03:18.021 --> 00:03:20.011
or seven.

00:03:20.011 --> 00:03:23.362
If we next scour planet three 
and don’t find them,

00:03:23.362 --> 00:03:26.960
we know they went to planet seven 
and are now cornered.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.710
They can only move to planet six, where
we’ll apprehend them on our fifth search.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.561
Of course, this plan only works

00:03:34.561 --> 00:03:39.062
assuming that the rebels were on 
an even-numbered planet in the first hour.

00:03:39.062 --> 00:03:41.221
But what if that assumption was wrong?

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:44.612
In that case, they must’ve started 
on an odd-numbered planet.

00:03:44.612 --> 00:03:47.904
And because they move to an adjacent 
planet every hour,

00:03:47.904 --> 00:03:52.931
their location must alternate between
odd and even-numbered planets.

00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:55.992
This means that if they were on 
an odd-numbered planet to start,

00:03:55.992 --> 00:04:00.083
after five moves, they'd be 
on an even-numbered planet.

00:04:00.083 --> 00:04:02.242
So if our first five searches missed them

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:06.061
because our assumption that they started 
on an even-numbered planet was wrong,

00:04:06.061 --> 00:04:09.883
all we have to do now 
is repeat the sequence!

00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:11.336
Searching the planets in order

00:04:11.336 --> 00:04:12.061
two,

00:04:12.061 --> 00:04:13.501
three,

00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:14.733
four,

00:04:14.733 --> 00:04:16.142
three,

00:04:16.142 --> 00:04:17.350
six,

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.621
two,

00:04:18.621 --> 00:04:19.771
three,

00:04:19.771 --> 00:04:21.132
four,

00:04:21.132 --> 00:04:22.240
three,

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.590
six,

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.560
leaves the rebels nowhere to run.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.872
Thanks to your deductive reasoning, 
order is restored to the galaxy.
