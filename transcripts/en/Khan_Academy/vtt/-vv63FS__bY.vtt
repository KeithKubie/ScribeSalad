00:00:00.184 --> 00:00:02.802
- [Voiceover] So I have a
vector valued function h here,

00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:03.861
and when I say vector value,

00:00:03.861 --> 00:00:06.162
it means you give me a
t, it's a function of t,

00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:07.258
and so you give me a t,

00:00:07.258 --> 00:00:09.215
I'm not just going to give you a number,

00:00:09.215 --> 00:00:10.668
I'm going to give you a vector.

00:00:10.668 --> 00:00:11.501
And as we'll see,

00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:13.270
you're going to get a
two dimensional vector.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.882
You could view this as the
x component of the vector

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:18.513
and the y component of the vector.

00:00:18.513 --> 00:00:20.902
And you are probably familiar by now,

00:00:20.902 --> 00:00:22.303
that there is multiple notations for

00:00:22.303 --> 00:00:24.179
even a two dimensional vector.

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.938
For example, you could
use what's often viewed

00:00:26.938 --> 00:00:29.106
as engineering notation here,

00:00:29.106 --> 00:00:32.032
where the x component is being multiplied

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.532
by the horizontal unit vector.

00:00:36.355 --> 00:00:37.868
So you might see something like that,

00:00:37.868 --> 00:00:42.831
where that's the unit
vector, plus the y component.

00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:46.483
Four t to the fourth,
plus two t, plus one,

00:00:46.483 --> 00:00:50.303
is multiplied by the vertical unit vector.

00:00:50.303 --> 00:00:52.889
So these are both
representing the same thing,

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:55.582
it just has a different notation.

00:00:55.582 --> 00:00:57.453
And sometimes you'll see
vector valued functions

00:00:57.453 --> 00:00:59.226
with an arrow on top to make it explicit

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:00.912
that this is a vector valued function.

00:01:00.912 --> 00:01:02.884
Sometimes you'll just hear people say,

00:01:02.884 --> 00:01:05.227
well, let h be a vector valued function,

00:01:05.227 --> 00:01:07.565
and they might not
write that arrow on top.

00:01:07.565 --> 00:01:08.588
So now that we have that out of the way,

00:01:08.588 --> 00:01:09.812
what we're interested in is,

00:01:09.812 --> 00:01:12.774
well let's find the first
and second derivatives

00:01:12.774 --> 00:01:14.691
of h with respect to t.

00:01:15.837 --> 00:01:18.968
So, let's first take, let's
take the first derivative,

00:01:18.968 --> 00:01:22.313
h prime of t, was as you'll see,

00:01:22.313 --> 00:01:24.130
it's actually quite straight forward.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.377
You're just going to take
the respective components,

00:01:26.377 --> 00:01:28.205
with respect, take the
derivative of the respective

00:01:28.205 --> 00:01:30.481
components with respect to t.

00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:32.727
So the x component, with respect to t,

00:01:32.727 --> 00:01:35.695
if you were to take the derivative,

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:39.014
with respect to t, what
are you going to get?

00:01:39.014 --> 00:01:41.513
Well we're going to use the
power rule right over here,

00:01:41.513 --> 00:01:44.005
five times the negative
one or times the negative.

00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:46.966
You're going to get negative
five times t to the five,

00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:49.700
minus one power, so t to the fourth power.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.633
The derivative with respect
to t of negative six,

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:53.073
well that's just zero,

00:01:53.073 --> 00:01:56.844
so that's the rate of
change of the x component,

00:01:56.844 --> 00:01:58.850
with respect to t.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.126
And now we go to the y component.

00:02:01.126 --> 00:02:02.743
So we're going to do the same thing,

00:02:02.743 --> 00:02:05.266
the derivative with respect to t,

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:06.717
is going to be, and once again,

00:02:06.717 --> 00:02:08.263
we just use the power rule,

00:02:08.263 --> 00:02:11.763
four times four is 16t to the third power.

00:02:13.151 --> 00:02:15.811
Derivative of two t is just two,

00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:16.985
and then derivative of a constant,

00:02:16.985 --> 00:02:19.275
well that's zero, we've already seen that.

00:02:19.275 --> 00:02:21.519
So there you have it.

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.380
So this is the rate of
change of the x component

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.571
with respect to t,

00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:26.139
this is the rate of
change of the y component,

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.012
with respect to t.

00:02:28.012 --> 00:02:29.555
And one way to do it,

00:02:29.555 --> 00:02:32.047
vectors can represent many,
many, many different things,

00:02:32.047 --> 00:02:35.137
but the type of, a two
dimensional vector like this,

00:02:35.137 --> 00:02:37.094
you can imagine this being,

00:02:37.094 --> 00:02:40.881
h of t being a position
vector in two dimensions.

00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:42.298
And then if you're looking
at the rate of change

00:02:42.298 --> 00:02:44.217
of position with respect to time,

00:02:44.217 --> 00:02:46.890
well then this would
be the velocity vector.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.303
And then if we were to take the derivative

00:02:48.303 --> 00:02:49.816
of this with respect to time,

00:02:49.816 --> 00:02:52.237
well we're going to get
the acceleration vector.

00:02:52.237 --> 00:02:54.987
So if we say h prime, prime of t,

00:02:55.983 --> 00:03:00.883
what is that going to be
equal to, h prime, prime of t?

00:03:00.883 --> 00:03:03.338
Well, we just apply the power rule again.

00:03:03.338 --> 00:03:07.505
So four times negative five
is equal to negative 20t

00:03:09.672 --> 00:03:12.865
to the four minus one,
so t to third power.

00:03:12.865 --> 00:03:16.782
And then we have three
times 16 is 48t squared,

00:03:19.926 --> 00:03:22.789
and then the derivative
of two is just zero.

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:24.051
And so there you have it,

00:03:24.051 --> 00:03:26.109
for any, if you view t as time,

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.558
for any time, if you view
this one as position,

00:03:28.558 --> 00:03:30.513
this one as velocity and
this is acceleration,

00:03:30.513 --> 00:03:31.992
you could, this would now give you the

00:03:31.992 --> 00:03:34.191
position, velocity and acceleration.

00:03:34.191 --> 00:03:35.956
It's important to realize
that these vectors

00:03:35.956 --> 00:03:40.123
could represent anything of
a two dimensional nature.
