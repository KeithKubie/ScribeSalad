00:00:01.535 --> 00:00:02.536
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: First up-- Tom

00:00:02.536 --> 00:00:03.537
Brady's got it all!

00:00:03.537 --> 00:00:04.605
Four NFL championships, a

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:06.173
supermodel wife, even a cameo in

00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:07.674
the film "Ted 2," which is a big

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:08.909
achievement.

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:10.377
The Patriots QB is headed to his

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:11.645
seventh Super Bowl, but SB

00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:13.180
Nation reports that when asked

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.381
for comment on the refugee

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:15.282
crisis created by the Muslim

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:17.150
ban, Brady replied, quote,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.685
"What's going on in the world?

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:19.887
I haven't paid much attention.

00:00:19.887 --> 00:00:21.154
I'm just a positive person."

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:23.724
(laughter and groaning)

00:00:23.724 --> 00:00:24.725
(Hardwick laughs nervously)

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:26.860
"Hey, no, please.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.861
Also, when's that big election

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:28.862
everyone's talking about gonna

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:29.863
happen?

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.298
What? White privilege?

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:32.299
I've never heard of it.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.300
Anyway..."

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.301
(laughter)

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:35.669
Comedians, Tom Brady's obviously

00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:36.837
been distracted prepping for

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:38.705
this big footballing game.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:39.873
Catch him up on the news in one

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.074
sentence.

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.976
Whitney.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:44.778
&gt;&gt; So, in football terms, it's

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:47.080
like if Donald Trump was the

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.649
quarterback, but instead of

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.651
throwing to the receiver, he's

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:51.752
Hitler.

00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:52.753
(laughter)

00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:53.754
(applause and cheering)

00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:55.322
Yeah.

00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:56.323
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: All right, points.

00:00:56.323 --> 00:00:57.858
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:00:57.858 --> 00:00:59.092
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Will Sasso.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:00.761
&gt;&gt; All anyone needs to know is,

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:02.296
we won, you snowflake, libtard

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:03.297
cucks!

00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:04.298
We're making America great

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:05.032
again! No?

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:06.300
&gt;&gt; No?

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.301
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: All right.

00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:08.135
&gt;&gt; Oh, no, no, not such much.

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:08.936
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Okay, yeah, yeah.

00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:09.770
&gt;&gt; Not so much here. I'm sorry.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.771
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Well done.

00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:11.605
&gt;&gt; I'm so sorry. I forgot...

00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:12.506
&gt;&gt; Wrong cable network!

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:13.507
&gt;&gt; I'm so sorry.

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:14.508
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Yeah, it's wrong.

00:01:14.508 --> 00:01:15.509
Paul Scheer.

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.877
&gt;&gt; Dude, imagine if Roger

00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:19.413
Goodell was the president.

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:20.514
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: All right, points.

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:21.281
(laughter, applause)
