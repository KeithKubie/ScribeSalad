00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.120
- [Instructor] We've already
talked about the notion

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.180
of a monopsony employer in other videos,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.940
but now we're going to
review it a little bit.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.250
And we're going to introduce a twist,

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.990
and the twist is what happens

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.530
when they have to deal
with a minimum wage?

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.230
And as we'll see, it's
kind of counterintuitive.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.640
So first of all, just as a review,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.770
a monopsony is a situation
where you have one buyer

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.233
and you have many sellers of something.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.170
And when we're talking
about a monopsony employer,

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.580
the buyer is the buyer of labor.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.780
We're talking about the buyer
in the labor factor markets,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.150
and the seller are the workers,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.830
the people who would sell
their labor for a wage.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.640
And we have already studied monopsony

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.540
employers situations
before, but I will redo it.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.560
It never hurts to get the practice.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.270
In the vertical axis, you have the wage,

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.100
which is really the price of this factor

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.610
of labor that we're studying right now.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.160
And in the horizontal axis,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.730
you have the quantity of the
factor that we care about,

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.700
and this is quantity of labor.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.100
Now, we have seen this
show many times before.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.790
You're going to have or you typically have

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.170
a downward-sloping marginal
revenue product curve.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.300
And that describes a situation

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.140
where every incremental
unit of labor you bring on,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.910
the marginal revenue, the
incremental revenue you get,

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.840
goes lower and lower and lower because of,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.220
arguably, diminishing returns in some way.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.870
So this is marginal
revenue product of labor.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.590
You could also have marginal
revenue product of capital

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.650
or of land, other factors.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.430
And then we could think
about the supply of labor.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.180
Or actually, really what
we're trying to get at is

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.110
what is the marginal factor cost curve?

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.180
And if this employer

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.430
were not a monopsony employer,
if they were just operating

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.560
in a perfectly competitive labor market,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.190
the marginal factor cost curve

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.910
would just be the market wage.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.090
So it might look something like that.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.570
But we are dealing with
a monopsony employer,

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.820
and so they don't just take
the market wage, they have,

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.420
you could view it as a
supply curve for labor

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.680
that's specific to them.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.310
Because remember, they're
the only show in town.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.180
They are the big employer
maybe in this small town.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.203
And so you have this supply curve.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.990
This, this is supply

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.540
of labor.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.610
But this is not the
marginal factor cost curve,

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.630
and we've explained this before.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.720
But that's because as you bring on

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.660
higher and higher quantities of labor,

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.560
you need to pay more to
that incremental person.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.320
But what typically happens
is if you need to pay

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.110
one person more, you need to
pay everyone the same wage.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.830
So as you bring on that incremental labor,

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.100
not only you have to pay more
for that incremental unit,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.760
but you have to raise
the wage for everyone.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.950
So the marginal factor
cost goes up twice as fast

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.160
as the supply of labor curve.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.453
So the marginal factor
cost curve, it would look,

00:02:49.242 --> 00:02:51.600
might look something like this.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.150
And then what's rational
is a firm would keep

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.400
bringing on that factors,
in this case, labor.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.970
It would keep hiring folks

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.360
as long as the incremental
revenue that it gets

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.450
from hiring that next unit is higher

00:03:06.314 --> 00:03:08.410
than the marginal or the incremental cost.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.050
And so they'll keep bringing people on

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.230
as long as the MRP is higher than the MFC,

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.130
and so we would get to
that point right there.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.890
And so it'd be rational for this firm

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.980
to hire this quantity of labor.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.250
Let's call that Q sub one.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.310
And then what wage are they paying?

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.710
Pause this video, and think about that

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.460
'cause this is always a little bit tricky.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.560
Well, you might be tempted
to draw a line here.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.760
But remember, this doesn't
describe the actual wage.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.420
The wage at that quantity is described

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.990
by the supply of labor.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.300
So this would be the wage
that the firm would pay.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.080
So now let's introduce our twist.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.570
Let's think about what happens

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.610
if a minimum wage is
employed in this region,

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.500
that, for whatever reason,
the city council says,

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.590
hey, that employer needs
to be paying more money.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.740
And let's say they
institute a minimum wage at,

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.780
I will do this in a bold color.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.900
Let's say they institute a
minimum wage right over here.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.920
Let's call this wage sub m.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.320
Pause the video, and think
about what would then happen.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.020
What would the marginal
factor cost curve look like?

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.220
And then what would be
the rational quantity

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.663
for the firm to hire?

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.530
All right, so now that
the town has instituted

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.070
a minimum wage and it's
higher than the rational wage

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.900
that the firm would've
otherwise paid for labor,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.770
what it does is it,

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.600
at least at a certain
range of quantities, it,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.930
of quantities of labor being employed,

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.190
it essentially makes this
monopsony employer have to think

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.000
a little bit like an employer
in a competitive labor market

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.920
where you just have to accept a wage.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.710
Now, this wage isn't
being set by some market.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.200
It's being set by a government.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.220
So as long as this wage

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.340
is higher than the supply of labor,

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.530
well, then this is going to be,

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.940
or higher than our old supply curve,

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.040
well, this is going to be,
from the firm's point of view,

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.160
the new supply curve.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.520
So it's going to look something like this.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.350
But then when the supply curve,

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.740
when the wages that the
supply curve describes

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.130
go higher than that minimum wage,

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.860
well, then it will track that.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.750
So this is our new supply
curve right over here.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.510
So new,

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.100
new supply curve, and we're
talking about supply of labor,

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.440
and it's this whole red thing.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.403
And what would be our new
marginal factor cost curve?

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.250
Well, we said that it has twice the slope,

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.300
but when the slope is just flat here,

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.930
I'm gonna do this in a new color.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.100
So the marginal factor cost curve,

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.190
it's going to track this
horizontal line right over here.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.680
And then all of a sudden,

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.720
when the supply curve starts to go up,

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.520
well, then it's going to jump back

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.690
to the old marginal factor cost curve.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.100
So it's going to look something like this.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.630
So MFC, I'll call it two, that's in blue.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.520
So it tracks the supply curve
here when it's horizontal.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.510
And it is really just analogous

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.800
to when we just have to accept
a wage, and then it jumps.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.580
We have a bit of a discontinuity,
and then you get up there.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.540
But what's rational, as always,
is a firm to keep hiring

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.190
as long as the marginal
revenue product is higher

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.060
than the marginal factor cost.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.110
So it's going to keep hiring.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.890
As long as this yellow line
is above the blue line,

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.220
it would keep hiring, keep hiring,

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.510
all the way until this
point right over here.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.650
So notice what just happened.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.800
It is now rational

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.240
for the firm to hire more people,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.810
and that is counterintuitive.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.870
In everyday thought,

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.730
if I thought I was running
some type of a business,

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.000
if I was running a burger joint,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.740
and all of a sudden if there
was a higher minimum wage,

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.660
then it feels like, hey, I
might not have enough money

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.970
to hire people, I might lower
the number of people I hired.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.710
But we just showed, at least with some,

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.060
with a very simplified economics
model, that theoretically

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.400
when you're dealing with
a monopsony employer,

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.990
it actually might get
them to hire more people.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.220
So an interesting question is

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.120
why did this counterintuitive
thing happen?

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.210
And one hand-wavy argument,

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.010
but I encourage you to ponder it,

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.890
is to realize that, in the old world,

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.140
every time they brought
on an incremental person,

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.820
they had to raise the salary of everyone,

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.990
and that's what made
the marginal factor cost

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.470
go up so quickly.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.570
But now since you have
this whole flat part

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.910
of your supply curve,

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.010
because regardless of
how many people you hire

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.510
in this range right over here,

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:32.870
you're paying the same amount,

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.330
that incremental person

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.180
does not increase the
wage for everyone else.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.810
So that is what made it
rational for the firm

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.630
to go and keep hiring.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.530
Now, the community, the government,

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.150
the city council would
have to be very careful

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.940
about what this minimum wage
is because it's very possible

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.970
that they could overshoot
and actually end up

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.960
in a situation where the firm hires less.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.720
So, for example, if they
made this the minimum wage

00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:00.020
right over here, let's
call that W two or W three,

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.610
well, now all of a sudden,

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.720
you would have a marginal
factor cost curve

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.600
that is going like this

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.310
for at least a good bit.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.780
We can think about it a little bit later,

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.380
as what happens is you go
further and further to the right.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.720
But then it would only be rational

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.570
for the firm to hire that much,

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.660
and so then you would have
a decrease in employment.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.690
But if we go back to
the original situation,

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.130
another thing that you
might be thinking about,

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.710
hey, this seems too good to be true.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.780
It's now rational for the
firm to hire more folks,

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.570
and those folks are getting more income.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.850
Surely someone must be losing.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.160
And it is the case that the firm

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.330
is now going to lose more of,

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.090
I guess you could say the surplus

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.680
that it was having in the old world,

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.363
and more of that is now
being given to the workers.
