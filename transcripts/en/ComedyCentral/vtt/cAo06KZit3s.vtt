Good morning.

00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:06.172 align:start size:53% position:47%
Isn't it?

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.044 align:start size:81% position:19%
Gene?

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:12.345 align:start size:53% position:47%
Helen Hunt?

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:15.181
Oh, my gosh! Billie, it's you!

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:17.316 align:start size:97% position:3%
I thought for a second,
and I almost said something...

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.419 align:start size:78% position:22% line:85%
that you were Helen Hunt.

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.419 align:start position:0%
You did say something.

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:22.221 align:start position:0%
Oh, I should have gotten this
whole chance encounter on video.

00:00:22.254 --> 00:00:23.556 align:start size:88% position:13%
Can you go back and say
hashtag viral--

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.425 size:75% position:38%
What are you doing here?

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:28.227 align:start size:84% position:16%
I go here. What's up?
They know me.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.862 align:start position:0%
Like one time you go here,
or you--

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:33.533 align:start size:94% position:6%
No, I'm like a student.
Like, um-- oh here, like this.

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.268
"Books, books, books..."

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:37.503 align:start position:0%
Are you telling me that your dad
got you into the college...

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:38.871
that I'm teaching at?

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:41.107 align:start size:94% position:6%
Oh, like I need Kent Russell
to get me in.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.008
Higher on the left!

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.011
Future Home of the--

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:45.978
Can't--

00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:47.947
That could be a different dad.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.483 align:start position:0%
If your dad thinks that I'm just
going to take care of you...

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:52.351 align:start position:0%
he is sorely mistaken.

00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:54.921 align:start size:97% position:3%
Gosh, you are obsessed with
talking about my dad right now.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:56.456 align:start size:50% position:50% line:85%
It's weird.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:56.456 align:start size:91% position:9%
Okay, look--

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.424 align:start position:0%
Sh-sh-shhh-- there's a cake-beef
walking up.

00:00:58.457 --> 00:00:59.992 align:start position:0%
Uh, hey, excuse me.

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:01.294 align:start position:0%
Do you guys know where the
philosophy building is?

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.129
Oh, I think the gym's that way.

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:05.898 align:start position:0%
No, I was asking about the
philosophy building.

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:07.433 align:start position:0%
I'm a mid-semester transfer.
Today's my first day.

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:10.903 align:start size:63% position:38%
Me, too! Absolutely!

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:13.239 align:start size:63% position:38%
Um, yeah... I'd love
to work out later.

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:15.174 align:start size:91% position:9%
Maybe.

00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:18.010 align:start size:56% position:44%
Yeah. Oh, my gosh,
he's into me.

00:01:18.043 --> 00:01:20.980 align:start size:81% position:19%
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What is the sorority rush?

00:01:21.013 --> 00:01:22.215
College joke.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.449 align:start size:91% position:9%
Okay, Gene, the last time
I saw you...

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:25.218
you tried to get me
the death penalty.

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:29.589 align:start position:0%
Billie, that was a courtroom gag
between old pals.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:33.025
Wait, wait! Okay, okay, look.

00:01:33.058 --> 00:01:34.894
The judge made me decide
between getting a job...

00:01:34.927 --> 00:01:36.095
or going back to school.

00:01:36.128 --> 00:01:39.499 align:start position:0%
So, now I'm trying the school...
way.

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:40.433 align:start size:94% position:6%
I thought I'd go to the one
you went to--

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:41.601
What are you saying?

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:42.568 align:start size:88% position:13%
'Cause I wanna hang out
with you more.

00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:43.970 size:81% position:41%
You're mumbling.

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:48.307 align:start position:0%
So... where should I enroll your
bag? College joke.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.309 align:start size:59% position:41% line:85%
What are you doing?

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.309 align:start size:75% position:25%
What?

00:01:50.342 --> 00:01:53.546 align:start position:0% line:85%
Give it to me.

00:01:50.342 --> 00:01:53.546 align:start size:78% position:22%
That's my winter clothes!

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.381 line:85%
That's my winter clothes!

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.381 align:start size:78% position:22%
That's my winter clothes.

00:01:55.414 --> 00:01:57.216 align:start size:78% position:22%
Don't you make fun of me.
That's my--

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.283 line:85%
Catch me, if you're my friend!

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:58.249 align:start size:41% position:59%
No!
