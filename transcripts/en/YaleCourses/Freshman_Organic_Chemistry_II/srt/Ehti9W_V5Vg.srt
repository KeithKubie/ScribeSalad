1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:06,900
Okay. So we're talking about alkenes and
in particular today we're going to be

2
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:07,620
talking,

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,180
continuing to talk about polymerization
in the context of things that nature

4
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:14,670
makes, what are called, which
are called ice of paranoids.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,080
And then we'll talk about the properties
of polymers and then go onto a settled

6
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:20,670
liens.
Uh,

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,330
we're talking about electronic files being
the things that attack a double bonds

8
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,300
in particular ones where
the electro file is carbon,

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,250
like the sigma star of something
with a leaving group on it or the,

10
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:38,400
with an electronegative negative
group on it, or a cad I ion.

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,240
And we're talking about the
synthesis of Turpines and steroids.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,330
So there's a key,
a molecule called ISO Penn Tino Pyro,

13
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:53,280
phosphate, pyro. Phosphate is this thing
with two fos versus linked by an oxygen,

14
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,750
right? And it turns out you can do
an alcoholic rearrangement. I mean,

15
00:00:57,751 --> 00:01:01,890
when I say you, I mean you, I mean
the enzymes in you do it. Okay?

16
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,320
So you can get from Iso Penn,
Tino pyro phosphate, uh, to, uh,

17
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,990
to die methyl allium pyro phosphates,

18
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:14,790
which he knows involves a shift
of a hydrogen, uh, Al illegally.

19
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,100
Okay? Now, the reason you do
that is to make it better for sn.

20
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:21,210
Two reactions.

21
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,350
If you look at the relative rate for
displacement of chloride by Ayah done an

22
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,980
acetone,
if you call it one for purple chloride,

23
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,980
if you make allium chloride, so you
put a double bond to make that bond,

24
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,190
the carbon chlorine bond Alec,

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,690
it goes up by almost a
hundred fold a factor of 90.

26
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,020
And if it's a benzene ring instead
of just a regular old double bond,

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,860
it goes up another factor
of two and a half. Okay,

28
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,120
so apparently this an
adjacent unsaturation,

29
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,040
that new double bond is
especially good at at uh,

30
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,490
in state,
in stabilizing after the transition state.

31
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,630
So at the time when chloride is
leaving and iodide is coming in,

32
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,380
the double bond is able to
interact with that orbital.

33
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:10,560
That's bonding simultaneously,
that pentavalent carbon,

34
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,510
a transition state.

35
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,610
So both sn two as well as sn one where
you draw a resonance structure for that

36
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:21,830
kind of interaction for the cat
eye. And it's good to have it, Alec.

37
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,140
So notice that this shift is Lle shift
from ISO Penn Tino pyro phosphate to die

38
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:28,200
methyl alcohol.

39
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,220
Pyrophosphate resulted in getting the
leaving group to be alcoholic so that

40
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:37,740
it'll be easier to displace.
Now why do you do that? Okay,

41
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:42,330
so you can take as a nucleophile then if
you have this really good leaving group,

42
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:45,690
you can take as a nucleophile the
ice of Pantene. Oh pyrophosphate.

43
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,860
So it's a carbon that's serving
as the nuclear file, right?

44
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:53,310
So you make a new bond,
get a cad ion, right?

45
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,800
But the cat eye and can be lost by
losing a proton next door to make a new

46
00:02:58,801 --> 00:02:59,634
double bond.

47
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,830
What you'll notice is a new aloe lake
functionality with the leaving group,

48
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,830
right? So you've put two of these things
together and you have the same kind of

49
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:11,900
functionality you had at the beginning.
Okay?

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,390
And that thing is called Gera Neal
pyro phosphate because it's related to

51
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:19,570
Geraniums
as we'll see.

52
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,160
Notice that the starting material has
five carbons. Now having put two together,

53
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:26,710
you have 10.
Okay?

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,240
So if you take Jared annealed
pyro phosphate and uh,

55
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,250
I samurais the double bond,

56
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,170
then it's in a position for the other
double bond in the same molecule to be the

57
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:39,850
nucleophile,
right?

58
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:43,750
So you can do that and get
that cat eye on right now.

59
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:45,910
What could that cat eye and do?
Well,

60
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:50,020
of course it could do the same thing
it did before and lose a proton. Right?

61
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:55,360
And that gives Lyman nene and I made it
a sort of yellow green, you know why?

62
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,620
Cause it made a little bit like lemons
or limes that lemon grass oil is Lyman.

63
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:07,270
Ian in Asian cooking has
that. Okay. If you bend it up,

64
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:10,840
then you can see another possibility.
What other possibility do you see?

65
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,830
If I draw the confirmation more
like that? I don't, I got an idea,

66
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,231
right?

67
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:22,000
The double that double bond could add
to the vacant orbital along the carbon

68
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,250
like that, uh, Markovnikov
addition. It's not what, what,

69
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:28,550
why is it not so good on her eye

70
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,290
forms a four membered rings. There's
going to be some rings strain there,

71
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,860
but it does happen, right?
And if you lose the Proton,

72
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,410
now you'd get a compound
called Beta pinene.

73
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:44,830
Guess what kind of trees that comes from?
Okay?

74
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,360
Okay. Now you could also do
an anti Markovnikov addition,

75
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:54,070
which doesn't form quite as strained
to ring, right? If you do that.

76
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,870
And then they had water and lose a
proton to the carbon cat eye and you get,

77
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,980
uh, uh, after oxidation
camphor, which of course,

78
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,420
now all of these things have in common
that they have very characteristic odors.

79
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:12,550
Lemon, the Pinene
Turpentine Camphor, right?

80
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,590
So these things are called
turpines essential oils.

81
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,730
Terpene is from Turpentine, right?
That's where pioneer pioneer's,

82
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:27,340
the major constituent of
Turpentine. Essential oils.
Does it mean you need them?

83
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,850
What it means is they have an essence.
They have an odor.

84
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,390
So these see tens are volatile
and your nose responds to them.

85
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,290
So these are essential oils, uh, okay.

86
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,680
And notice their see tens
terpenes or see tens.

87
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:44,310
But now you can do more of the same.
If you start with your journey,

88
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:48,850
you'll pyrophosphate that you had before,
you could add another ISO Pentane oh,

89
00:05:48,851 --> 00:05:53,560
pyrophosphate and yet a thing that's
called farnesyl. Pyrophosphate. Right?

90
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,690
And things that come from that,

91
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,230
like the compounds that came in from
the sea 10 we're called turpines.

92
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,290
These are called sesquiterpenes.
Do you know what [inaudible] means?

93
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,970
You know what assessed with centennial is

94
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,960
Sasquatch? Anybody? It
means one and a half, right?

95
00:06:13,961 --> 00:06:18,270
So it's one and a half turpines 15
it's actually three of the ice of Penn.

96
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:22,900
Dino pirate phosphates. But the
name terpene came first. Okay?

97
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:23,860
So for example,

98
00:06:23,861 --> 00:06:28,861
carry awfully in which is in clove and
hemp and rosemary is a Sasquatch terpene.

99
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,633
Okay?

100
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,540
Now two of those things can come together
and now this reaction is different

101
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,570
because it's not the
double bond attacking.

102
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:41,410
It's two of these Alec positions
coupling with one another.

103
00:06:41,411 --> 00:06:43,840
It's a different kind of reaction.
We're not going to talk about it,

104
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,220
but at couples to give this,
which is squalene or shark liver oil.

105
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,230
Okay? And you'll see the new bond in the
middle. It's symmetric about the middle.

106
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,290
Now you can do interesting
things with squalene.

107
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,560
What kind of terpene in would you
call it? Incidentally? Squash lead.

108
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,280
If you take two fifteens you get 30 right?
So what are you going to call it?

109
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,270
Is it a mano terpy Sas
Suite, terpene. Diterpene,

110
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,550
right. It's a trite terpene to
one and a half since three, right?

111
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:22,530
So this is a trite derpy, but there are
a lot more important try turpines well,

112
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,550
more important. They come from this.
So this one is a starting point. Okay,

113
00:07:26,551 --> 00:07:29,850
so they're squealing and I'm going
to twist it around into a special con

114
00:07:29,851 --> 00:07:34,530
formation like that. Now, what
allows me to do that enzymes, right,

115
00:07:34,531 --> 00:07:39,531
that hold these things in particular
shapes and now I'm going to react with

116
00:07:39,571 --> 00:07:43,320
oxygen and do an EFP oxidation. Of
course, it's not just, Oh, it's a,

117
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:47,040
it's something like the reagents we talked
about, except it's done biologically,

118
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,690
but we're not interested in the
particulars of the biological reagents,

119
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,370
but it makes an EFP oxide notice
that it's able to do it selectively.

120
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,330
It gets only that double
bond among all those. Right?

121
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,340
And now you've protonate that.
And what will it do?

122
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,330
Can you see a way this can become more
stable? What's, what's makes it unstable?

123
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,050
Yeah, the ring strains. So how do you
get rid of the rings strain? Yeah.

124
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,280
Which way are you going to

125
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,113
break it?

126
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:31,940
Yeah. You're either going to break this
bond or this bond or this bond. One,

127
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:35,120
two, three, two. Why Two?

128
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,480
Stability. Pardon me?
Why better stability?

129
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,400
No,
so what's happened?

130
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:47,880
These electrons that are shared between
Oh and carbon are going to come onto the

131
00:08:47,881 --> 00:08:52,870
oxygen bottle, right? It's
a tertiary carbocat ion.

132
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,310
If you break it your way. Okay,
so we'll do it that way. Okay.

133
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:58,410
Now what's that going to do?
Anybody got an idea?

134
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,813
Okay.

135
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,850
Now what have we been looking at?
Attacking double bonds.

136
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,430
We're looking at carbon cat ions
attacking double bonds. Any possibilities?

137
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:16,130
You see?
Okay.

138
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,500
Now you're going to form a bond between
this cat eye and then either the bottom

139
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:22,160
one or the top one.
Which one do you want to go

140
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,880
to? Bottom or top. If you have
a cat I and they had into an lt

141
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,013
white long.

142
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,080
Who?
Who would say that's a good idea?

143
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,650
Mark on the cough would say it's
a good idea. You're right. Okay,

144
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:46,950
so we do look at my coffee in the
competition. Okay, what happens next?

145
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:53,830
No? Well you got an idea.
Do the same thing again.

146
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,130
Do another mark in the competition.
Okay.

147
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,633
What's next?

148
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,573
Wrong

149
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,170
this time it's an anti
Markovnikov addition because
of the way the molecule is

150
00:10:12,171 --> 00:10:16,880
held there. Okay. Okay. But now
you're set up to do another one,

151
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,110
a Markovnikov coffin.

152
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:21,973
Okay.

153
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,630
And now you might think you'd use that
last double bond and make another ring

154
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:29,110
since you're on a roll
here. Right. But you don't.

155
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,680
And the reason is the way the molecule
is held so that that one's not in

156
00:10:32,681 --> 00:10:35,140
position to do the trick,
but something else happens

157
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,540
that's noticed. That's nice and
stable. It's a tertiary cad ion,

158
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,100
but there's another tertiary cat eye and
available. Do you see how to get to it?

159
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,060
Sebastian? You got an idea? Yeah.

160
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,700
How can I get from this cat iron to a
different tertiary cat eye and one that

161
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:55,350
we'd be just the same.

162
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,060
Sable Hydra chip.

163
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,150
Okay.
So that's tertiary,

164
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,990
but we can do a hydride shift
and get another tertiary one.

165
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:07,840
Okay.

166
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,380
And the ideas for the next one?

167
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,710
Yeah. Lauren, you got an idea?

168
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,970
We have a nice stable tertiary cat on it.
We could go back there probably any,

169
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,160
any other possibilities?

170
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,250
We're getting a tertiary one.

171
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,470
Oh, the one on the left. You could
do another hydride shift. Okay,

172
00:11:26,471 --> 00:11:31,240
so that's tertiary to what's
next. Arvin, do you got an idea?

173
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,620
You might as well just do like the math.
You can be a mess out here.

174
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,640
They're not side shift.
Yeah. Okay, good. Next.

175
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:44,120
Antonio
other notified shift.

176
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,930
Oh boy. We're really
going into town now. What?

177
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,700
Hydride shift.
Obviously right,

178
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,990
wrong.
This time the proton just gets lost.

179
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,500
So it goes that way. The Arrow, right?

180
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,840
It makes a double bond
and the proton goes away.

181
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,130
Now that stuff is La Nostra Raul,

182
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,570
and that's the sort of the source of
cholesterol and all the steroid hormones.

183
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:17,150
You remember these few things we
showed last time that Barton was,

184
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:20,810
look looking at all these steroids.
They have a six membered, six members,

185
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:24,380
six membered ring than a five membered
ring and something substituted at the top.

186
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,640
They all come from here.

187
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:36,060
So these are triterpenes.
Now that's a cute story,

188
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,800
but one wonders whether it's true.
Okay?

189
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,241
And we'll show how,

190
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:47,241
you know it's true that once we get
to Nmr spectroscopy a week after next

191
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:50,970
probably. Okay. But you'll have
to hold your breath until that.

192
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,980
So there's these ice preens then you
can think about rearranging those double

193
00:12:55,981 --> 00:12:56,814
bonds.

194
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:02,180
Notice that ISO Penn Tino pyrophosphate
has this c five unit in. But if you're,

195
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,460
if you do that,
you could make two new bonds.

196
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,390
I'm not talking about cad and anti
and mechanisms, just schematic here.

197
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,680
So if you have two ice Sabrina's,
you could link it together like that.

198
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,420
And that's Geranium oil
rose oil, right? Or,

199
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,210
or you can have two ice supreme
and put them together like that.

200
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,370
And that's menthol.

201
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,900
Or You could have four of them
and put them together like that.

202
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,950
And that's retinal.
The aldehyde over on the right.

203
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,780
So that's the thing that's involved in
vision or that absorbs light in your eyes.

204
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,480
So it's a a tetramer.
Okay.

205
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,660
Or you can take 30,000 die supreme
means and link them together like that.

206
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:49,830
And that's latex.
The Latin word latex just met a liquid,

207
00:13:49,831 --> 00:13:52,470
but now it's always applied
to this particular liquid,

208
00:13:52,471 --> 00:13:55,770
the SAP that runs out of
these trees that have a,

209
00:13:55,771 --> 00:14:00,190
a Brazilian sis and there's a real
romantic story about this and how, uh,

210
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,180
you know,
explorers stole seeds from Brazil,

211
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:07,200
which was trying to keep them and took
them to England and grew them in queue

212
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:11,610
and then sent them to southeast Asia to
make rubber plantations like this and

213
00:14:11,611 --> 00:14:15,180
that the rubber plantations
in Brazil failed because they,

214
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:19,350
that once you put the trees all close
together so that you could harvest them

215
00:14:19,351 --> 00:14:23,250
efficiently rather than sending slaves
out into the Amazon to find a tree here

216
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:24,090
in a tree there.

217
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,530
Then it turned out they got a disease
that killed all the ones down in South

218
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:32,430
America. Henry Ford had a real
disaster with that. But anyhow,

219
00:14:32,431 --> 00:14:36,720
you get that SAP and we showed you the
PSAP last time and we made a rubber ball

220
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,530
with it like this.
Okay.

221
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:45,100
Now that stuff was called by the Indians
could choke and in fact that's the name

222
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:47,610
and for,
for a rubber in French.

223
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,640
So people tried to find a use
for it in the west, know the,

224
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,650
the natives made balls, they
made a galoshes, you know,

225
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:58,160
you put your foot down in latex and let
it dry and then you've got a rubber boot.

226
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:03,020
Uh, so they, there were lots of things,
but it was difficult to work with.

227
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:07,730
Thomas Hancock and England developed a
thing called a masticator to try to chew

228
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:11,240
it up to make it so you could
make different things with it.

229
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:16,260
And Charles McIntosh and
Scotland in 1823 sandwich the,

230
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,090
the rubber between cloth layers
to make waterproof, you know,

231
00:15:20,091 --> 00:15:23,900
that's what you call a waterproof
jacket and Britain as a Macintosh.

232
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,091
The we,

233
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:30,650
the reason you had to Sacha sandwich it
was because the stuff is really sticky.

234
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,730
I had a piece I was going to bring
that I made last time and I forgot to,

235
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:39,230
but it's really sticky stuff.
So that's not so good. Right.

236
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:44,000
It gets really gooey in the heat
and it's brittle in the cold.

237
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:48,020
So there's a fairly narrow temperature
range where it's useful. Okay.

238
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:52,760
Until Charles Goodyear in
1839 figured out the product,

239
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:57,260
the process of vulcanization,
which made this stuff,

240
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,820
uh,
useful.

241
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,840
So this is his own description from his
autobiography in 1855 of the discovery

242
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:07,310
of Balkanization,
he actually,

243
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,670
he was really nuts about rubber.
Incidentally,

244
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:15,320
the word rubber was coined by,
uh, by priestly, the guy invented,

245
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,590
discovered oxygen,
right. And you know why?

246
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,180
Because you use it for an eraser
to rub out pencil marks. So rubber.

247
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,780
Okay. Uh, but anyhow, uh,

248
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,620
good year really loved
rubber in this book.

249
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:34,700
He printed several copies on paper,
but other copies he printed on rubber,

250
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,420
which have now all stuck together
and you can't open any of the pages.

251
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,370
But anyhow, in describing his
discovery, he said he, that is himself.

252
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,380
Speaking of the third person here,

253
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:50,650
he was surprised to find that the specimen
being carelessly brought into contact

254
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:53,600
with a hot stove charged like leather.

255
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,840
So he was trying to figure some
way to make it not be sticky.

256
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,990
So he thought you could put a powder
on it to keep it from being sticky.

257
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:02,180
And the powder he'd try
was trying was sulfur,

258
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,650
but he was in Woburn mass when he was
doing this and he dropped it on a hot

259
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:11,630
stove and it charred, whereas
usually it melted, right? So he,

260
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,440
this surprised him.
So he got his friends and relations.

261
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:18,890
It says he endeavored to
call the attention of his
brother as well as some other

262
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:22,790
individuals who were present and who
were acquainted with the manufacturer of

263
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,820
gum elastic to this effect as remarkable.

264
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:30,590
And unlike any before known since gum
elastic always melted when exposed to a

265
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,670
high degree of heat,

266
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,850
the occurrence did not at the time
seemed to them to be worthy of notice.

267
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:42,200
It was considered as one of the frequent
appeals that he was in the habit of

268
00:17:42,201 --> 00:17:45,650
making in behalf of some new experiment.
So they,

269
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,290
they're tired of all his
inventions. Right. But, uh,

270
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,060
he showed it to Benjamin Solomon
at Yale and Solomon wrote,

271
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,930
having seen experiments made and also
performed them myself with the India

272
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:02,310
rubber prepared by Mr. Charles Goodyear.
I can state that it does not melt,

273
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:05,730
but rather chars by heat.
And that does not stiffen by cold.

274
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:10,380
But retains its flexibility with cold
even when laid between cakes of ice.

275
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,640
So this is what a good year, who didn't
have much money needed in terms of a,

276
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:18,900
a serious endorsement to go out
and try to get some capital to,

277
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,490
to commercialize this.

278
00:18:20,491 --> 00:18:24,480
So he got a patent and this is the
beginnings of the patent and he says he

279
00:18:24,481 --> 00:18:28,290
claims combining said gum with
sulfur and with white LED's.

280
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,830
So it was the form of triple compound.

281
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:34,560
The lead's not used anymore in combined
in combination with the foregoing the

282
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:38,910
process of exposing the India rubber
fabric to the action of a high degree of

283
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:41,070
heat.
He had made a whole bunch of raincoats,

284
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,400
sort of Macintosh style and
it put them in the, in the uh,

285
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,820
closet during the summer to bring
out when they got rainy again.

286
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,270
And when he went to get them,
they were just all one big gooey mass.

287
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:55,410
So this was really a appealing to him to
patent this though he could make fabric

288
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:56,244
from it.

289
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:01,370
This is 1844 seven years later was the
crystal palace exhibition in London,

290
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:08,481
that try of industry in the
West in the Victorian period.

291
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,360
So there was this,

292
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,200
these industrial displays of the best
products from all over the world.

293
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,720
And here only seven
years after the patent,

294
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:21,110
we find Goodyear's vulcanized court
where he's pushing the beauties of rubber

295
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:27,020
and you see there's a desk and that desk
is made of rubber and it still exists.

296
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:31,650
It's in a museum up in Waterbury.
He made everything out of rubber.

297
00:19:31,651 --> 00:19:36,030
You can't believe all the things he
made out or he proposed making bills for

298
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:40,620
currency out of rubber so that you
could wash them without destroying them.

299
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,380
A lot of these things didn't catch on
Sony. I latex was a po. Is this polymer?

300
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,170
What do you do when you
heat it with sulfur? Well,

301
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:52,770
you have several chains next to one
another and no one knows exactly how it

302
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:53,370
works,

303
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:58,290
but somehow it joins adjacent chains
with sulfur to make cross links between

304
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,460
these polymer chain.

305
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,970
So probably there are radical
addition reactions to double bonds,

306
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:07,300
radical Lilach substitutions.
So you get maybe this Al [inaudible],

307
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,640
which attacks the sulfur and then
that adds to the other double bond,

308
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:14,640
some something like this. But anyhow,
it makes cross links in the chains.

309
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,170
So how does that affect the
physical properties of the polymers?

310
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,780
Remember the problem is that it gets
gooey when it's hot and brittle when it's

311
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:23,640
cold,
which is not what you want in a coat.

312
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:29,630
So we're going to study this a little
bit and we're going to follow a really,

313
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,720
uh,

314
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,720
important scientists who published this
in 18 three description of a property of

315
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,920
Qucik or Indian rubber with
some reflections on the
cause of Alaska. [inaudible]

316
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,030
of this substance.

317
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:47,060
So this was done by John Gfe who lived
1757 to 1825 of was a very interesting

318
00:20:48,491 --> 00:20:52,150
person. He, he was, uh, he
tutored John Dalton for example.

319
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:56,440
He lived up in the Lake
district in England and
Wordsworth wrote of him in this

320
00:20:56,441 --> 00:20:58,270
a poem excursion.

321
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,050
No flower blooms throughout the
lofty range of these rough hills,

322
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:06,460
nor in the woods that
could from him conceal its
birthplace non who's figure did

323
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:11,020
not live upon his touch touch.
Because when guff was three years old,

324
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:15,090
he had rheumatic fever and
went blind. Right? So he was,

325
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:19,450
he was a great scientist though, blind.
So everything he had to do by, uh,

326
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,010
by touch or description of someone else.
So all of these studies of rubber,

327
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:28,030
he did blind. Okay. So
here's the beginning of this.

328
00:21:28,031 --> 00:21:31,360
He lived in Middle Shaw
House near Kendall in 18,

329
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:35,140
two he said to substance called Qucik
or Indian rubber possesses a singular

330
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:39,010
property, which I believe has never
been taken notice of in printed,

331
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:43,960
at least by any English writer.
Okay. So here it goes on and he says,

332
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,810
uh, I made a piece of Coochie, a little
heavier than an equal bulk of water,

333
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,300
the temperature of which was 45 degrees.

334
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:55,810
The vessel containing the resident
water was then placed on the fire.

335
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:59,170
And when the contents of it
were heated to 130 degrees,

336
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,600
the COO chook floated on the surface.

337
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:07,470
What does that say about the density of
cooked Chook and the influence of heat

338
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:12,400
on it
and pardon?

339
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,320
It got well, it got less dense, right?

340
00:22:17,321 --> 00:22:20,080
Cause you know water gets less
dense when you heat it up.

341
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,490
So when it was cold at sank,
when it was hot, it floated.

342
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:29,620
So it must expand when you heat
it more than water does. Okay,

343
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,460
so he didn't. Rubber makes it
expand more than water. Okay,

344
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:36,490
that's the first that,
that's not a great surprise.

345
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:40,420
That's not the important thing. Experiment
one is the important thing here.

346
00:22:40,421 --> 00:22:44,650
He says, hold one end of
the slip of, of the rubber,

347
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,890
thus prepared between the thumb
and forefinger of each hand.

348
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:52,060
Bring the middle of the piece into
slight contact with the edges of the lips

349
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,920
because he has to do it by touch,
right?

350
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,470
Taking care to keep it
straight all the time,

351
00:22:56,471 --> 00:22:58,990
but not to stretch it much
beyond its natural length.

352
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,510
After taking these preparatory steps,

353
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,260
extend the slip suddenly and you
will immediately perceived something.

354
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:08,470
So we're going to repeat his thing,
but I need a balloon there.

355
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,810
Okay? So everybody takes their balloon
and we'll do what gfes says to do here.

356
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,183
Okay?

357
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,330
So hold it between your thumb and finger
and put it against your upper lip and

358
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:24,190
stretch it a little bit. Okay? And
now having stretched a little bit,

359
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,100
stretch it as hard as you can
while it's against your lip.

360
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,693
You notice that anything

361
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,260
who's a sensitive as John Gfe here,
what happened?

362
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,080
And what's really interesting
is you stretch it pretty
far and not much happens,

363
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,070
but the last inch makes a difference.
You notice that

364
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,360
what happened,
Lauren?

365
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,090
He got really warm,
not the first part of the stretching,

366
00:23:52,091 --> 00:23:55,450
but at the very end of the
stretching is everybody onto that.

367
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,023
Okay,

368
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,980
good. So that's what he noticed,
right? And you can read all of it.

369
00:24:04,981 --> 00:24:09,610
He said here if you want to. Okay.
Then he tries another experiment here.

370
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,081
He says,

371
00:24:11,081 --> 00:24:16,081
if one end of a slip of cu
chook be fastened to a rod
of metal or wood and await

372
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:20,200
be fixed to the other extremity in
order to keep it in a vertical position,

373
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,200
then what will the Thong do?
So let's try that one.

374
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,440
So here's a piece of coot Chook and
we'll get it so you could see it here.

375
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,450
Uh,
let's see.

376
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,870
Yeah, you can see it a little
bit, but what needed some light?

377
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,643
Just a few.

378
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,510
And we'll put this on here.
So we're going to stretch it.

379
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,490
That's what he says to do.

380
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:00,250
No, I had more. What? I tried
this. I had more light before.

381
00:25:00,251 --> 00:25:02,710
Let's see if I can do better

382
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,730
now I'll turn on this, uh,
this light. There we go.

383
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:14,550
Except that the thing is blocking it.

384
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,260
You get it into focus.
Okay. So I have, you know,

385
00:25:23,261 --> 00:25:26,230
lines on paper there and you
can see how much it stretched.

386
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,970
Okay.
Forget it just a little bit.

387
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,240
Now what he's going to do is heat it.

388
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,140
Yeah.

389
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,510
So what does what you do when you heat it?

390
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,340
So what's going to happen to
the way we see the weight?

391
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,880
It just bolt just halfway
down below one of those lines.

392
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,590
Okay. What's going to happen when I
hit it? I'll hit it with this thing.

393
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:58,730
Which way will it move?
It'll expand, right?

394
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,740
So let's give it a try.

395
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,580
Is it going down?
Did it do anything?

396
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,030
It may be that it's,

397
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,980
I think my slide it out a little bit
here so that it's not rubbing against the

398
00:26:26,981 --> 00:26:27,820
rod there.

399
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,043
Okay.

400
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:45,260
So how do you think Derek
triples? Okay, let's,

401
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,490
what's going to happen if I cool it off,

402
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,230
it shouldn't go back.
Let's watch.

403
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,140
So it's expanding when it cools

404
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,090
and it's contracting slowly when it heat.

405
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,463
Yeah.

406
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,800
This is weird,
right?

407
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:22,130
It expands when it cools
and contracts when it heats.

408
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,880
So we're going to have to deal with that.

409
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,930
So heating a tightly stretched
piece of rubber makes it contract.

410
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:46,320
Okay, so if stretching rubber generates
heat. That's what we did here.

411
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,210
Let's think a second.

412
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,960
What's going to happen when it
contracts if we let it go back?

413
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,653
Yeah.

414
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:58,490
Okay. Well we have several
possibilities. Okay.

415
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:03,350
It could be that the heat comes from
friction of the molecules rubbing by one

416
00:28:03,351 --> 00:28:04,880
another.
If that's,

417
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:09,770
so what would happen when we
let it can track Carl and he,

418
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,300
well, he is way right? On the other hand,

419
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,000
if he comes from some other cause,

420
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,700
contraction may do the
opposite and absorb heat.

421
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,220
So what we're going to do is
stretch our rubber band is,

422
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,370
or our rubber as far as we can and
go like this to get it back to room

423
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:28,900
temperature while holding it tightly,
tightly stretched.

424
00:28:28,901 --> 00:28:31,340
Cause remember this phenomenon
happens only at the very end.

425
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,410
Then we're going to
put it against our lip.

426
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,390
All right,
and do that.

427
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,390
What do you find?
Which of these isn't one or two?

428
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,280
Did it get hot when it
contracted or you get cold?

429
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:56,620
Both. Oh, cold. Okay. Yeah,

430
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,410
that's pretty dramatic isn't it?
You know,

431
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,460
GFE claims to have been discovered this,

432
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,260
but in fact I discovered it.

433
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,790
My nephew was having a birthday and I
was blowing up balloons that I happen to

434
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:12,700
do that. I thought, wow, that's
really something. Then I found,

435
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:17,900
then I found out I had been
scooped by two centuries. Okay,

436
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,050
so how does this work? What the heck
is going on with these polymers now?

437
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,940
If you've been to the Yale health center,
so what do you see?

438
00:29:27,941 --> 00:29:32,110
If you go upstair up in the Yale health
center and look out toward the campus,

439
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,500
this is what you see.

440
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:41,020
A rather questionable view
from the Yale Health Center.

441
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,800
But right here is something
that's very interesting

442
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,950
and if you get up and look at it,

443
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:51,520
that's the two of them have Charles
Goodyear because he was a native of new

444
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:52,354
haven,

445
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:57,610
even though he discovered vulcanization
and in a Wolburn mass and died in New

446
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:02,290
York, a pauper, incidentally popper,
because he got involved with lawyers,

447
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:07,240
people tried to, uh, everybody, his
brother tried to break his patent.

448
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,970
So he hired Daniel Webster who
was secretary of State and,

449
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,460
and put on the most expensive,
uh, defense that ever happened,

450
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:20,440
have a patent and still he
lost his shirt. Okay. But,

451
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,810
but so he didn't know how it worked,

452
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:28,090
but maybe he can find out
now because there he is.

453
00:30:28,091 --> 00:30:29,200
And if you go to that,

454
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:32,710
that obelisk there and then
down just a little bit farther,

455
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:36,460
you get to this guy and that
guy could tell him probably,

456
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:42,240
and conceivably did talk to him because
this is j Willard Gibbs who died,

457
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,700
who got his bachelor's
degree at Yale in 1858.

458
00:30:45,701 --> 00:30:49,090
So two years before Goodyear died.
So they could have met,

459
00:30:49,091 --> 00:30:50,920
but I don't think they did.
Right.

460
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,100
Gibbs could have given him some idea
about what was going on with rubber,

461
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,300
but the person who really could have
done it, the person are over here,

462
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,340
right here are two gravestones that
have different designs. The one,

463
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,770
they're both people from
this chemistry department.

464
00:31:05,771 --> 00:31:10,090
One is John Gamble Kirkwood who was a
physical chemist and a theorist about

465
00:31:10,091 --> 00:31:12,820
polymers. Right. And his, uh,

466
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:17,830
his gravestone tells everything
he did. Uh, not everything,
but quite a few things.

467
00:31:17,831 --> 00:31:20,310
The awards he got and so on.
Uh,

468
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:23,530
but next to his is the
tomb of Lazarus on soccer.

469
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,380
His friend and colleague and the,

470
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:30,730
his tomb says Nobel laureate,
right?

471
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:36,900
His wife died 15 years later and the stone
was re to put her name on it as well.

472
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,310
And also to put on a footnote.

473
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,980
Okay. So they could, they could,

474
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:48,340
perhaps they're commuting down there
with Goodyear now and telling him what's

475
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:52,000
going on with this.
It has to do with statistical mechanics.

476
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:56,260
You remember that's what Gibbs did
because statistics is what makes rubber

477
00:31:56,261 --> 00:31:58,060
contract after you've stretched it.

478
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,510
If you have a chain all
stretched out like this,

479
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:05,680
there's only one way to arrange
it between the two ends, right?

480
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:11,080
But if you,
if you contract it like that,

481
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:16,120
you can have it that way or that way or
that way or that way or that way. Right?

482
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,990
There are a zillion ways to have it
if it's contracted. So statistics,

483
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:23,770
entropy says it wants to have a
shorter distance between the ends.

484
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:28,780
So even though it might be
most stable in terms of heat,

485
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:31,660
that is the best con formation
when it's stretched out,

486
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,910
entropy will contract that again.

487
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,020
So if you have a whole bunch of these
polymer chains and you start to stretch

488
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:38,854
them out,

489
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:44,290
they're all tangled around and as you
stretch they get more and more parallel to

490
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:45,464
one another.

491
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:50,840
And finally they'll get so near,

492
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:55,850
some of them will get near one another
enough to crystallize just locally.

493
00:32:55,851 --> 00:32:57,530
I mean these aren't like diamonds,
right?

494
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,400
But little local units of the thing are
together and when they come together

495
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:05,120
like that, they got their lower
and energy so they give off heat.

496
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:09,140
So when you stretch it at first,
that doesn't make any difference.

497
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,910
But the very last bit of the stretching
causes this crystallization and he comes

498
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:18,440
out, right? So there's
local con crystallization,

499
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:22,160
which contributes rigidity,
right? And releases heat,

500
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,800
right? On the other hand, when
you let it, if you put heat in,

501
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:32,840
it will melt these crystals and
entropy will cause it to contract,

502
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:36,110
right? And that, uh, so,

503
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:41,890
so then it'll allow statistics to make
the material contract like this and

504
00:33:42,081 --> 00:33:43,100
you'll go backwards.

505
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,930
So it's actually entropy that brings
rubber back to its original shape.

506
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,201
Okay.

507
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:56,201
So fixed irregular cross links between
adjacent chains prevents crystallization.

508
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:02,000
So it doesn't become brittle when it's
cold because it doesn't crystallize.

509
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,330
And
uh,

510
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:09,110
it also prevents it from being goofy when
it's hot. How does that happen? Well,

511
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:13,340
the gooeyness has to do with the, with
the flowing of the molecules. So how,

512
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:17,570
but if you have something that's all
tangled up like this, how can it possibly,

513
00:34:17,571 --> 00:34:21,830
how can you move a molecule, right? If
it's got to be really complicated shape,

514
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,240
the way it happens is very interesting.
It's a process called reputation.

515
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,100
Like a reptile.

516
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:33,500
This was an idea of a French physicist
who got the Nobel prize for this kind of

517
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:35,300
thing.
Okay.

518
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:40,130
So suppose you try to move
the chain length wise, right?

519
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:44,090
What will happen is like a carpet,
when you try to move a carpet,

520
00:34:44,091 --> 00:34:46,790
you make a little wiggle in
it, right? A little hump,

521
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,890
and then you can move the Hump
along without moving anything else.

522
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:56,360
And it would go on and on all along the
chain and finally get to the other end

523
00:34:56,361 --> 00:35:00,710
where it would be like that. And
finally the other end could move, right?

524
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:06,340
So it sort of crawls or goes like a
snake through all this tangle of other

525
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:08,720
polymers.
Right?

526
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,820
Now what does vulcanization
have to do with that? Right?

527
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:19,040
If you have crosslinks between the chains,
then they can't slide by one another.

528
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,200
So you can't do reputation.

529
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,590
So this stuff doesn't flow
and become gooey when it's hot

530
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,160
and that's what vulcanization does.

531
00:35:28,161 --> 00:35:31,940
So there's no flow when hot and
it inhibits crystallization,

532
00:35:31,941 --> 00:35:33,590
so it's not brittle when it's cold.

533
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,970
There's also vulcanization that
happens in the, uh, as I look around,

534
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:43,590
I'm not sure that any of you have
practice this, but you've heard of it.

535
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,380
I'm sure.
Here's a Robin Kelly.

536
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:50,670
I got permission to use this by
talking to Robin Kelly's mother.

537
00:35:50,671 --> 00:35:53,820
And she tells me that Robin Kelly is
now a student at Harvard law school.

538
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:55,200
This was from some years ago,

539
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:59,940
but Robin Kelley did Irish dancing and
she wanted her hair to look like this for

540
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:04,110
Irish dancing.
So she vulcanized that,

541
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:05,521
right?

542
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:10,521
So here hair has sulfide groups coming
out and they linked to other chains.

543
00:36:10,681 --> 00:36:14,310
So it's crosslinked, it's
vulcanized to begin with. Okay.

544
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:17,520
That holds the chains next to
one another in shape, right?

545
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:23,060
So what she did first was reduced the
dye sulfide cross links by excess basic

546
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,940
self, uh, hydro, uh, thiol.

547
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:30,810
So these are the two files that
are commonly used for that.

548
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:35,340
And notice that the sh is much
more acidic than, than hydroxide.

549
00:36:35,341 --> 00:36:40,320
So if you have basic RSH,
you have s rs minus, right?

550
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,960
Okay.
So that can be do an sn,

551
00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:46,500
two reaction on sulfur
and break that bond.

552
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:51,270
And that one can attack another
Thile take its hydrogen,

553
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,360
right?
And then that,

554
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:57,960
that Theo laid an ion can
do another displacement.

555
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,400
So what's happened,

556
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:01,950
okay,

557
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,960
is that we've reduced,

558
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:05,910
yeah,

559
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:10,890
the, the dye sulfide links to
make it to r a s h groups, right?

560
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:15,210
And now you can do the same thing
again and again and again, right?

561
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,200
And now the chains are pliable
and can be moved past one another.

562
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:24,510
So now she puts the soft spikes in and
curls her hair up tight and changes its

563
00:37:24,511 --> 00:37:25,920
shape,
right?

564
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:31,050
And now she's got to make new cross
links again to vulcanize it, right?

565
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,030
So she's got it like this.

566
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:38,190
Now she oxidizes the thiols back
the dice all with hydrogen peroxide.

567
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,370
Now look at the Bond
Association energies that, oh,

568
00:37:42,371 --> 00:37:45,990
Aho Aho members are very, the,
the oil was a very weak bond,

569
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,320
but the SS bond is not so weak and
that sh bond is weak compared to,

570
00:37:52,441 --> 00:37:56,700
Ooh. So it's much favorable to start
on the left and go to the right.

571
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:59,160
It's favored by 30 kilocalories per mole.

572
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,280
So if she puts in peroxide,

573
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,980
right with thiol,

574
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:09,480
she'll get out the new cross
links and alcohol, right?

575
00:38:09,481 --> 00:38:13,440
So you get the new cross links holding
the chains together in the shape you want

576
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:14,274
them to be.

577
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:18,510
So now our hair is vulcanized
in that everything's fine.

578
00:38:18,511 --> 00:38:21,510
She can go Irish dancing.
Okay.

579
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,860
Now another way to hold the chains
together with cross links is to have ionic

580
00:38:25,861 --> 00:38:26,694
groups on them.

581
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:30,990
And these ions tend to get together
with counter ions in clusters.

582
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:34,800
So that serves as a cross link,
but it's not a permanent cross link.

583
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:37,540
The covalent bonds are,
right?

584
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:41,560
So it's possible if you warm it to break
those at have and make things flow.

585
00:38:41,561 --> 00:38:43,150
So this is thermo plastic.

586
00:38:43,151 --> 00:38:47,140
You heat the polymer and you can reshape
it and then you cool it and it's got

587
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:49,150
the new shape,
right?

588
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:52,720
So there's after warming and
they got malleable cross length.

589
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,390
This is a father,
uh,

590
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:00,040
Newland at Notre Dame university
who figured out how to polymerize,

591
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,630
not the thing that had methyl up here,
which was the biological ISO preed unit,

592
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:09,730
but the one that has chloro. So that
gave a new compound called neoprene,

593
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:13,710
which had different properties and
they're all of these different, uh, uh,

594
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:18,780
polymers that have been made and this
list of according to how much they cost,

595
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:23,830
they get very expensive for flouro
silicon. Uh, how heat resistant they are.

596
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,480
Uh,
that low temperature,

597
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,850
the maximum temperature you can use them,
but also how they,

598
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,360
how they last oxidation,
whether they're substitutes, uh,

599
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:37,630
subject to weathering by ozone,
how strong they are.

600
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:42,820
So natural rubber is nice and strong at a,
it resists abrasion and tear.

601
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:47,950
It's very resilient. This is after, uh,
after crosslinking it after vulcanization,

602
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:50,950
but it's only fair on oxidation or Ozon.

603
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,550
You've probably seen rubber that's been
around a while are old telephone lines,

604
00:39:54,551 --> 00:39:58,360
the rubbers falling off because
ozone has gotten to it, right?

605
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:02,050
So there are others that have,
that have a variety of properties.

606
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:06,640
I also wasn't important. One that's not
listed here is how they interact with uh,

607
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:10,750
oil or something like that.
Natural rubber is very bad with oil,

608
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,770
but some of these others, uh, like
neoprene is much better. So the,

609
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,040
you know,
designing a,

610
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:22,130
a tire for your car is a very complex
thing to mix different polymers to get

611
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:26,050
exactly the properties in different
parts of the tire that are necessary.

612
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,240
Now there are other ways
of doing polymerization as
well. For example, styrene,

613
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,660
you could imagine these double bonds
going together with a radical doing

614
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,020
addition to the double bond and
notice that as I drew at there,

615
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:41,710
it's random whether which ended,
the styrene got attacked,

616
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:45,760
but it would also be possible to imagine
that it always goes head to tail.

617
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:50,590
Always the same way. Why would that
be advantageous always to go this way?

618
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,920
Yeah,

619
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,970
because in fact, that's what it
does. It goes just head to tail.

620
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,493
Why?

621
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,970
Why don't you do additions like this
where you add to the center and leave that

622
00:41:05,971 --> 00:41:06,804
radical?

623
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,073
Okay.

624
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,050
Why do you want to leave
this radical instead?

625
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,333
Amy?

626
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,360
It's secondary,
but much more important.

627
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:19,963
Yes,

628
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:24,100
it's been Zelig. It's like al the
lake. It has the double bonds to,

629
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,870
to interact with the SOMO.
Right? So both for both reasons,

630
00:41:27,871 --> 00:41:29,670
it does that even if
it were a methyl group,

631
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:33,150
it would tend to do this because it
would be secondary the way Amy said.

632
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,510
But with fennel,
that's ever so much more so.

633
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:40,370
So that's 13 kilocalories more
stable than adding the other way.

634
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:45,830
Okay? Now there's also the question of
tactility, which we talked on before.

635
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:50,630
So, uh, you can have ISO tag, even
though these are all head to tail.

636
00:41:50,631 --> 00:41:55,280
Notice that the, the methyl group is on
every other carbon. But you can have ice,

637
00:41:55,281 --> 00:41:59,930
a tactic, Cindy, a tactic where I stacked
the, they're all the same. A tactic.

638
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:03,740
They alternate and a tactic is random.
And that's what you get.

639
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,260
You get right.

640
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:09,530
The regio chemistry is always head
to tail with the free radical.

641
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,560
But the stereo chemistry is random.
So it's a tactic.

642
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:16,130
But you can get ISO tactic
polypropylene from Ziegler,

643
00:42:16,131 --> 00:42:18,150
not a catalyst that we talked about.
Uh,

644
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:22,720
two last lecture or the lecture before.
And Cindy tactic.

645
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,230
Remember I've used this fancy Kaminsky
catalysts that comes from one side than

646
00:42:27,231 --> 00:42:29,930
the other than one side than the other.
And it has a mirror plane.

647
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,740
So you change the configuration each time.
Okay.

648
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:38,570
But there's another question
of selectivity when you
have two different monomers

649
00:42:38,571 --> 00:42:42,440
in there. So for example,
methyl methacrylate and styrene.

650
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:47,000
So you could have block coat polymers
where you have a bunch of one coming

651
00:42:47,001 --> 00:42:50,570
together and then a bunch of the
other one in a single chain. Right?

652
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:56,420
But another possibility is to have them
strictly alternate a, B, a, B, a, B.

653
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,370
Right?
And you can do that.

654
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:03,230
And the reason you can do it is because
of the rates of adding different

655
00:43:03,231 --> 00:43:05,180
radicals to the alkenes.

656
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:10,490
So if you have that particular radical
at the end of the chain, right, the rea,

657
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:15,520
it adds to styrene faster than they
heads to methyl methacrylate that this,

658
00:43:15,981 --> 00:43:19,670
this unit here was methylmethacrylate
that added to a radical there.

659
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:23,720
So now it's at the end of the chain and
it would prefer by a factor of two to

660
00:43:23,721 --> 00:43:27,650
one to react with its own kind there.
Pardon me?

661
00:43:27,651 --> 00:43:32,000
To react with styrene rather than
with its own kind. Right? Now,

662
00:43:32,001 --> 00:43:36,560
what would you expect if you have
styrene as the, as the last radical,

663
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,440
right?
Notice what's interesting here.

664
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:42,530
I was wondering what this one was here.
It's this.

665
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:47,960
Okay.
Okay.

666
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:51,680
That's now notice it's a factor
of two in the other direction.

667
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,690
One radical. Each radical prefers
to react with the other monomer.

668
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:01,130
Isn't that interesting? That's why it
goes a B, a, B, a, B. Why should that be?

669
00:44:01,131 --> 00:44:03,860
This isn't surprising
because the this rack,

670
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:08,300
this radical is resonance stabilized
as Amy was telling us. Okay,

671
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,890
so that's, that's the fastest of all
these reactions and it's a good radical.

672
00:44:12,891 --> 00:44:17,720
So that's reasonable. But why does this
one prefer not to form the good radical,

673
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:22,370
but the form what appears to be the
less good radical. Okay, so here,

674
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:27,430
here's our radical starting and it can
add to this to give that and that that

675
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:31,830
turns out it would be something like that.

676
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,150
And this 20th kilocalories per mole
exothermic, that's great. Right?

677
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,710
But if we start with it,
but if we react with the other alkene,

678
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:46,200
right, then it gives this,
which is less stable, right?

679
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:51,210
This one doesn't have as much Al Lilly
or Benzoic stabilization that you have

680
00:44:51,211 --> 00:44:54,570
down here. Okay. But it's faster.

681
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:01,110
So it's faster to go to
the higher energy product.

682
00:45:01,111 --> 00:45:05,490
That's not the Hammond
postulate. Right? Why? What?

683
00:45:05,491 --> 00:45:09,090
Why is it twice as fast to go
to the less stable product?

684
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:12,090
So the transition state
for one looks like that,

685
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,230
the transition state for the
other, it looks like that, right?

686
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,060
What's good about the bottom one?

687
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:19,350
Yeah,

688
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:24,140
there's the top one. There's the
bottom one. And notice in this one the,

689
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:28,410
the carbon eel is good at
stabilizing high homos.

690
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:33,090
So you can have a resonance structure
with a minus charge here and a plus charge

691
00:45:33,091 --> 00:45:36,120
here.
You can't do that up here as well.

692
00:45:36,121 --> 00:45:40,180
This isn't specifically good at
stabilizing and ions. All right.

693
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:44,400
So you can have these resonance
structures here that you can't have there.

694
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,953
Right?

695
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:52,140
So the ionic resonance
structure, you could say,
stabilizes the transition state,

696
00:45:52,141 --> 00:45:54,510
or if you wanted to talk
about it in terms of orbitals,

697
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,140
you'd say that the c double bond
o gives an unusually low Lumo,

698
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:00,870
so that's good when
the SOMO is not so low.

699
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:02,580
Yeah,

700
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:06,120
and this special stability applies
only at the transition state.

701
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,320
Once you formed this bond, then you can't
have a resonance structure like that.

702
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,430
So the product is not stabilized
by that kind of thing.

703
00:46:14,431 --> 00:46:17,940
But the transition state is, which is what
makes these things turn around and go,

704
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:22,260
a, B, a, B, a, B. Okay.

705
00:46:22,261 --> 00:46:25,170
Now I was going to go onto acetylene,
but we'll do that next time.
