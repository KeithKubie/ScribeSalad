00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.410
Since we already computed the center x and center y pixel.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.260
in our nested object to set the center x and

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.160
center y of our circles we simply need to access that value.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.059
In this case nested in d.values with key x.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.990
And nested in d under .values at

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.976
key y to determine where on our map to place the circles.

00:00:23.976 --> 00:00:28.630
And for simplicity's sake, to verify that the location of the circle is correct,

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.120
we will plot the circles with a constant radius of five to start
