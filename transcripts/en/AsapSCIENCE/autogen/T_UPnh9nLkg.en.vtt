00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.485
 You just clicked on this video, meaning you're alive 

00:00:02.485 --> 00:00:05.405
 It is interesting that in order to know where you came from 

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:07.405
 We must first understand what it means 

00:00:07.405 --> 00:00:10.295
 To be alive. Life is organized 

00:00:10.295 --> 00:00:12.575
 A genetic unit that can be metabolized 

00:00:12.575 --> 00:00:15.325
 Reproduction and evolution. It is important 

00:00:15.325 --> 00:00:18.465
 Remember this, when we go back in time to find out exactly how I came here 

00:00:18.465 --> 00:00:21.735
 Astronomers believe that our solar system has begun 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.820
 Formed 4.6 million years ago, when a star exploded 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.980
 And falling to form the sun 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.000
 And about 500 similar planets interconnected 

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:33.465
 To form the soles of the planets 

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:35.725
 And for about 600 million years 

00:00:35.725 --> 00:00:38.705
 The land was very hot to live, and most of the water was 

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.855
 Evaporates through space, even if some chemicals are simple and reacted 

00:00:41.855 --> 00:00:44.505
 And began to take up a living space 

00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:47.040
 Comets and meteorites collided with Earth at the time 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.620
 They have brought in enough heat to develop the ocean floor 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.300
 Destroying all possibilities of life. And until comets and meteorites subsided 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.240
 The earth cooled and it became possible for the water to stay on the surface. 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.920
 Thus, life began about 3.7 million years ago. 

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:02.045
 I found many theories about how 

00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:05.075
 Which began quite well, some believe in simple life 

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:08.075
 Which came from a meteorite, while others believe that chemical evolution 

00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:11.065
 He began with interactive vehicles reacting with the heat 

00:01:11.065 --> 00:01:13.780
 Or perhaps struck by lightning 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.000
 It is difficult to identify, a new study claims to be obtained 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.035
 On the oldest fossil, over 3.77 million years old 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.180
 An old microbe has evolved 

00:01:23.185 --> 00:01:26.125
 Near an outlet for thermal venting in the ocean floor 

00:01:26.125 --> 00:01:29.125
 At that time, simple cells began to develop 

00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:32.125
 On the ground, they were able to confine energy, and multiply 

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:35.005
 And evolution, to become the only unit 

00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:37.800
 Which created this life, which includes you. 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.600
 And for two millennia, all living creatures on Earth are single-celled 

00:01:40.605 --> 00:01:43.585
 They probably lived in the oceans 

00:01:43.585 --> 00:01:46.155
 Preserved from ultraviolet rays 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.700
 But then something remarkable happened 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.340
 Photosynthesis. 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.120
 Before 2.5 billion years ago, there was a random surge 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.695
 They were useful for cells, and they started using solar energy to boost their food representation. 

00:01:57.695 --> 00:02:00.685
 And since then, oxygen, or O 

00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:03.555
 It was the product of photosynthesis, changing our atmosphere 

00:02:03.555 --> 00:02:06.805
 Thereby renewing the ozone layer that represented the protection of the Earth 

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:09.815
 From the deadly rays of the sun, and of course at this point 

00:02:09.815 --> 00:02:12.395
 Oxygen is toxic to most living organisms 

00:02:12.395 --> 00:02:15.605
 But over time, cells evolved to its potential, and because of metabolism 

00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:18.735
 And its interaction with oxygen, it became effective, and cells can grow more. 

00:02:18.735 --> 00:02:20.775
 And about a billion years later 

00:02:20.775 --> 00:02:24.125
 Cells began to merge smaller cells 

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:27.135
 Their ability to live in a variety of environments has increased. 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.405
 This selective feature led to the intertwining of cells together in a coordinated manner 

00:02:30.405 --> 00:02:32.915
 Even after the split, these cells in the end 

00:02:32.915 --> 00:02:36.175
 I began to exchange genetic specimens 

00:02:36.175 --> 00:02:39.245
 They have had sex. Individual organizations will be divided by equal division 

00:02:39.245 --> 00:02:41.785
 Or through simplified atomic division, however 

00:02:41.785 --> 00:02:44.875
 When hemispheric evolution developed, genetic reorganization began to emerge 

00:02:44.875 --> 00:02:47.385
 The rate of development is increasing as production 

00:02:47.385 --> 00:02:50.405
 Whenever they are genetically modified, and some of them 

00:02:50.405 --> 00:02:53.465
 The probability of living and procreation was greater 

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:56.425
 So, the tree of life began to explode, 

00:02:56.425 --> 00:02:59.295
 At first there were plants, and then fungi, corals and then amphibians such as crabs 

00:02:59.295 --> 00:03:02.345
 Skin prickles like sea urchins, and then fish 

00:03:02.345 --> 00:03:05.405
 Such as sharks and cod fish, and then the quartets evolved from fish 

00:03:05.405 --> 00:03:07.885
 To begin partly by adapting to living outside the water 

00:03:07.985 --> 00:03:11.315
 Initially inhalation of air and absorption of oxygen in the gastrointestinal tract. 

00:03:11.315 --> 00:03:14.085
 Over time, primates will develop separate lungs 

00:03:14.085 --> 00:03:16.905
 Of the gastrointestinal tract to absorb oxygen, and a new way of walking on land as well 

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:19.875
 And then amphibians and reptiles 

00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:23.225
 Dinosaurs and, finally, mammals. 

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:26.895
 In fact, the trunk of our entire origins comes from the tail of a furry rat, like mammals 

00:03:26.895 --> 00:03:29.915
 Which survived and flourished, 66 million years ago 

00:03:29.915 --> 00:03:32.995
 Just after the cocoon that removed the dinosaurs. 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.805
 And after decades of development 

00:03:35.805 --> 00:03:39.940
 To glorify another species, another branch of the family tree 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.800
 Evolved into a monkey and a full line of monkeys. And for nearly 4 million years, one of the first 

00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:47.695
 Human-like creatures arrived, 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.520
 The most famous antiquities are attributed to (Lucy) who stood straight 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.715
 For previous generations 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.435
 Before 100,000 or 2-3 million years ago, set primate 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.405
 She started and had a bigger brain 

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:02.200
 And began to use their hands for several complex activities such as construction 

00:04:02.205 --> 00:04:05.215
 And the use of tools. This was the first step to transformation 

00:04:05.215 --> 00:04:08.135
 Our environment to improve our lives. 

00:04:08.135 --> 00:04:10.275
 It was also a catalyst for the transition from plant diet 

00:04:10.315 --> 00:04:13.195
 For others containing meat 

00:04:13.195 --> 00:04:16.465
 This is an intensive method of nutrition, less affected by seasonal shortages. 

00:04:16.655 --> 00:04:19.455
 These simple stone tools enable us to cut meat 

00:04:19.455 --> 00:04:22.445
 It may become the instrument chosen for two million years. 

00:04:22.445 --> 00:04:25.545
 And for about 1.8 million years, human phenomenon 

00:04:25.555 --> 00:04:28.515
 Popped up, the immediate predecessor of our faction. 

00:04:28.515 --> 00:04:31.515
 And finally, a few hundred thousand years ago, modern humans 

00:04:31.515 --> 00:04:34.545
 Or human wise, step towards light. 

00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:36.565
 Larger, smarter, and more capable than his predecessors 

00:04:36.565 --> 00:04:38.820
 Interestingly, we almost 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.895
 We did not make it a changing environment until 140,000 years ago 

00:04:41.895 --> 00:04:44.885
 The human population was reduced to only hundreds of people 

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:48.315
 Objects threatened, but we survived. 

00:04:48.315 --> 00:04:50.765
 As recently as 60,000 years ago 

00:04:50.765 --> 00:04:53.455
 Three different factions of the "human" family coexisted. 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.260
 Homo neanderthalensis homo denisova 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.515
 We, the wise man, have all lived together on this planet 

00:04:59.515 --> 00:05:02.505
 In fact, sane and neanderthalensis often mated 

00:05:02.505 --> 00:05:05.255
 That's why most modern humans, including you 

00:05:05.255 --> 00:05:08.205
 They have nuclear neanderthalensis acid. neanderthalensis died years ago 

00:05:08.205 --> 00:05:11.140
 When 30,000 of the mortals arrived 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.195
 To what is now "Europe" and from this point 

00:05:14.195 --> 00:05:16.945
 Humans were the only beings living on Earth. 

00:05:16.945 --> 00:05:19.925
 Unlike our principal relatives, who favored their own development 

00:05:19.925 --> 00:05:22.335
 While our evolution chose the power of reason and in fact 

00:05:22.335 --> 00:05:24.985
 Your mind weighs 2% of your body weight 

00:05:24.985 --> 00:05:28.115
 But it uses 20% of your calories. And this power of mind 

00:05:28.115 --> 00:05:31.265
 Has enabled us to survive in a variety of environments 

00:05:31.265 --> 00:05:34.435
 Where we began to travel around the world. 

00:05:34.435 --> 00:05:37.455
 Wherever we started we were small groups of less than 100 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.760
 We have settled into groups of thousands, millions and billions. 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.920
 You were born 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:55.320
 So, how did you get here. Autrjim @
