00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.980
Guns, berets and leather jackets may be the images you associate most with the Black Panther Party.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.380
But what you may not know is how the political group shifted healthcare in the U.S.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.420
To be more community-based.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.820
Our government was not gonna provide healthcare.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.560
So, we were going to provide healthcare for the people.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.620
The Black Panthers opened free medical facilities,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.420
created the very first nationwide screening program for sickle cell anemia,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.880
a blood disorder.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.500
And they even helped establish a form of acupuncture.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.600
That's still in use today.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.460
We spend a lot more time serving the people

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.700
than we did protesting

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.600
or

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.920
defending ourselves from the police.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.420
So why isn't the Black Panthers health care activism more widely known?

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.660
Well it may be by design.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.440
History is written by the victors.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.480
The Black Panthers are not writing the history of the Black Panther Party

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.000
Hey fam. I'm Imaeyen and this Sunday on AJ+,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.380
we're exploring the Black Panther party's history

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.060
healthcare legacy and how a covert government program tried to bury it all.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.160
To understand what prompted the Black Panthers go right into health care,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.960
you first have to understand why it came into existence

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.140
Here's how co-founder Huey T. Newton explained the group.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.860
We are bound to transform society and

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.320
Erect a system where our people will receive justice.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.520
The Panthers formed on the heels of the civil rights movement -

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.500
a time when the push for racial equality and equity divided the U.S.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.700
1965 was a pivotal year that helped spark the Panthers creation,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.300
according to former Black Panther at Billy Jennings.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.420
We had the murder of Malcolm X in February.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.600
Also you had

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.980
the signing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.620
And also you had the Watts Riot happening August of 1965,

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.780
along with the Selma March in 1965.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.720
Then in the fall of 1966 a white police officer ran down and killed

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.840
an unarmed teenager in a historically black neighborhood in San Francisco.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.000
It was a breaking point. The community rioted.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.040
The governor declared a state of emergency, and the next day,

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.900
National Guard soldiers marched with bayonets through the streets.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.660
This was the fertile ground in America's landscape that prompted Newton and Bobby Seale

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.620
to found the Black Panthers Party for Self-Defense in October 1966.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.060
The Black Panthers initial mission was to police the police.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.620
Panthers followed patrol vehicles ready to defend their communities with force if they felt the need arose.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.100
This is a part of their legacy that the world remembers.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.060
But the physical self-defense was a fraction of the Panthers objectives.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.960
As their movement grew, so did their vision.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.260
Dr.Tober small was a physician to the Black Panthers,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.260
though he wasn't a party member.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.620
They were not just people in black jackets carrying guns.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.880
They were interested in actually doing something for the community.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.560
The Black Panthers focused more on what they call survival programs -

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.160
things like food assistance, free education, free legal aid.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.500
And one of their top priorities was free community healthcare.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.400
Most of our civilized countries will provide these services for the people.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.640
The Panthers realized that we didn't have a civilized country. We were not providing these services for the people.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.340
As a young doctor small treated political activists like Angela Davis and George Jackson in prison.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.700
And when Bobby Seale issued a directive for all chapters to establish free health clinics in 1970,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.960
the Black Panther Party turned to Dr. Small to help build the program.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.460
I had all the pharmaceutical companies donating medicines to the George Jackson Free Clinic.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.080
I had doctors volunteering, nurses volunteering, med techs volunteering.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.380
Sheba Haven, who was a member of the Black Panther Party,

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.400
says the Black Panthers approach to health care was radical.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.420
I think that they had a great impact on medicine in general because they were

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.940
progressive not just in the idea that healthcare is a right

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.140
but in the way that healthcare is delivered.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.640
The Black Panther Party interceded in places where the US government was seemingly absent,

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.160
like its nationwide screening program for sickle cell disease.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.260
It was a first.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.240
The government was not prioritizing sickle cell anemia

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.340
for the same reason that Jackie Robinson had to be the first black baseball player in 1948.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.420
For the same reason that the black troops were segregated during World War II.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.220
There was racism in this country.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.160
Sickle cell anemia was a disease that affected mostly black folks.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.540
Sickle cell is the single most common genetic disease in the United States.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.540
And the vast majority of patients are African American.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.140
It's painful and deadly.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.380
And in 1970 the country only allocated less than $100,000 in funding.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.760
It spent $7.8 million on muscular dystrophy.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.720
$1.6 million on cystic fibrosis.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.040
$8 million dollars to get a man on the moon.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.140
and obviously sickle cell anemia was not a priority

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.640
Then an intriguing thing happened in 1972.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.100
John Lennon invited Black Panther members and collaborators to appear on one of the most

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.180
popular talk shows of the day: the Mike Douglas Show.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.560
And they seized the platform to address the problem of sickle cell disease.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.660
We've tested 30,000 people for sickle cell anemia and I think we've tested for more than anybody in the country.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.300
And just like that sickle cell became part of the national conversation.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.560
The Panthers used their medical infrastructure to run tests for sickle cell in cities all over the country.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.680
So it is objectively true that one of the defining public health initiatives of the early 1970s

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.020
wasn't launched by the U.S. government -

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.980
But by an organized group of socialist advocates.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.980
The initiative gained so much momentum that President Richard Nixon signed legislation

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.500
to aid research on finding a cure for the disease.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:44.440
By this point, the Black Panthers had become a major cultural force, operating on the international stage.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.280
Their philosophy shared common ground with Maoists in China.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.880
And as China began to normalize relations with the U.S.,

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.420
they country invited Huey P. Newton to visit months before receiving President Nixon.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.840
And that visit was a major reason acupuncture entered the American mainstream.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.060
Acupuncture existed in the Chinese community already,

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.400
But the Chinese community in Americas was more insular

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.000
and more like enclave, right?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.440
We introduced it to the rest of the world.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.840
The year after Newton visited China, he sent a delegation of 19 people to the country including Dr. Small.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.260
When they came back from 1972, we started talking my acupuncture more

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.940
and we had people practicing as a puncture on both coasts.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.580
The Black Panthers also helped run the first health clinic to implement five-point ear acupuncture.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.280
That protocol is still used today to treat conditions like drug addiction and post-traumatic stress.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.560
So the group had a major influence on healthcare initiatives in the U.S.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.740
Why then does it seem like that narrative has been hidden?

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.880
Why are the Panthers so often associated with this rather than this?

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.360
It's partly because of controversial FBI director J. Edgar Hoover

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.180
and a little program you may have heard of before: COINTELPRO.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:05.100
Well, one of the things J. Edgar Hoover always talked about was young black people being unified,

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.690
a messiah coming to unify and black people,

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.500
which he was terrified of, because her was a racist.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.600
COINTELPRO or counterintelligence program was a propaganda

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.420
and surveillance operation that the FBI used to target activists, political groups and minorities.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:26.060
COINTELPRO was basically designed to destroy

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.460
members of the movement that they felt were a threat to the American government American way of life.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.580
COINTELPRO's goal was to discredit leaders and divide movements.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:40.100
Or, as the FBI put it at the time, "to pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them."

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:47.520
The power structure did not want to show the survival programs of the Panthers.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:54.380
They wanted to paint them as people who were committing crimes and violence.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:01.040
Of the 290 operations carried out by COINTELPRO the Panthers were targets of 245.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.780
For those of you that enjoy math that's more than 84%

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.080
Hoover personally instructed 14 different FBI field offices

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:13.760
“submit imaginative and hard-hitting counterintelligence measures aimed at crippling” the Panthers.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.740
They sent death threats, offensive cartoons and forged letters to different members

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.560
in an attempt to disrupt and divide the group.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.600
Perhaps the most insidious part about COINTELPRO was how effective it

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.020
in controlling the narrative around the party.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:34.280
What the FBI and the government wanted to push that the Black Panther Party wasa black and angry group

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.820
and they were anti-white.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.620
So if you want to paint someone as a devil you're not gonna paint them as providing healthcare,

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.680
providing free food, taking care of elderly people to the hospital,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.040
providing a free ambulance service like we did in North Carolina.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.280
And in a way, it worked.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.740
Years of police raids, misinformation, incarceration and killings

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.540
not only reduced membership, it left the organization financially crippled and

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.560
ultimately unable to carry out its social programs.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.420
The Black Panther Party was officially disbanded in

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:08.340
Today, many of the same structural inequities that the Black Panthers fought against continue,

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.980
including access to healthcare.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.880
That's resulted in some devastating statistics for African Americans.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.865
In 2017, the American Heart Association said that African Americans have the worst

00:09:18.865 --> 00:09:23.660
cardiovascular health and more deaths from heart disease than any other group.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:28.720
They also have higher rates of HIV, diabetes and chronic kidney disease

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.920
A 2007 study shows that African-Americans are much less likely

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.240
to trust physicians and the overall healthcare system.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:41.860
You'll see the statistics for black folks is vastly inferior to the statistics for white folks,

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.780
and the Panthers recognized that there's racism in healthcare,

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:50.480
which is why they got involved in trying to provide healthcare for the community.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.280
But the Black Panther party's legacy lives on.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.320
Many Panthers and volunteers with the party have gone on to work long careers in public health and medicine.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:03.020
Even the New York health commissioner, Mary Bassett, spent her early career

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.500
volunteering in the Black Panthers free clinic.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.040
The legacy of the Black Panther Party will not be forgotten

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.860
because people those things are embedded within people's families.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.940
Shortly before he was killed by police in 1969, Black Panther Fred Hampton said he this:

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.980
“You can jail a revolutionary, but you can never jail the revolution.”

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:29.340
And that revolution always included a demand for healthcare as a basic human right.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.700
Hey, fam, thanks so much for watching.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.100
Don't forget to like, share, subscribe and follow and let us know in the comments

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.240
if you knew anything about the Black Panthers healthcare legacy,

00:10:38.249 --> 00:10:42.500
if you feel like there are any solutions they brought back then which could work today,

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.980
and tell us also what you want to see us do next.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:45.800
We'll see you next Sunday.
