00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:13.709
You may have seen videos on the internet where
people whisper and tap on things, or crinkle

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:14.709
things…

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:20.500
These strange delicate, noises… can cause
some people to get “brain tingles” So,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.679
did ya feel anything?

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.349
For some, hearing and seeing videos like this
can cause a “tingling sensation.”

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.259
It can start across their skull and down their
spine and it’s usually paired with an intense

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:32.450
feeling of relaxation.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.450
It’s been called “brain tingles,”or
“brain orgasms,” but as of now, it goes

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.190
by A-S-M-R.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.490
Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response
Awareness of ASMR has been growing since the

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.660
early 2010’s, with video views in the millions,
AND its reputation has piqued the interest

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.860
of science researchers who want to know what’s
going on behind this phenomenon.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.200
And, tbh, we don’t know a lot.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.040
The term, ASMR isn’t even defined in scientific
literature -- Autonomous Sensory Meridian

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.220
Response -- was coined on an online forum
not by a scientist.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.650
What “tingle heads” are trying to describe
is the body’s involuntary response based

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.549
on what it’s seeing and hearing.

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.780
A 2015 study took the responses of 475 participants
who experience ASMR and found consistent visual

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.869
and auditory stimuli across the board.

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.859
Participants experienced tingles to slow movements,
soft whispering, or “crisp sounds” -- like

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:27.859
tapping.

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:31.369
Of course, different people react differently
to the tingles -- for some it’s a stress

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.600
reliever, and for others it makes them so
relaxed it helps them sleep.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.570
The thing is, this is all self-reported by
“ASMR enthusiasts,”, so another study

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.880
tried to get some concrete evidence right
at the source -- the ol’ noodle.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.789
Researchers used fMRI scans to study the brains
of a small group of people -- half of whom

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:50.270
had ASMR.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.211
They focused on the resting-state network
or default mode network (DMN).

00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:57.159
The DMN is a system of interacting regions
of the brain that light up when the individual

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.119
is NOT focused on external factors.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.450
Like, say, when you’re daydreaming.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.670
All they looked for was a difference in brain
structures.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.380
Not what the tingles did to the brain.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.730
And though it wasn’t a large sample size,
what they found was interesting.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.140
Normally, certain regions of the brain fire
up together or “talk” to one another -- this

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.811
is called being “functionally connected”
But, in people who experience ASMR, researchers

00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:24.532
noted some, of these regions were talking
LESS to one another, and some regions were

00:02:24.532 --> 00:02:25.650
talking MORE.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.220
So, we STILL don’t have concrete answers
yet, but these fMRIs show, “tingle heads”

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.890
definitely have something going on.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.980
But so far, that’s about all we could find
in the hard science literature on ASMR.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.880
But these days you can’t talk ASMR without
mentioning, Dr Craig Richard, a professor

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.130
of pharmaceutical sciences, and ASMR experiencer
who’s created a whole platform to interview

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.260
other ASMR scientists and keep it in the news.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.550
Richard is in the middle of conducting an
online survey of over 20,000 self-reported

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.540
ASMR persons from over 100 countries.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.460
Nothing is published yet, and it’s not exactly
scientific, but at some point we may have

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.570
more data.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.680
In the meantime, he has a hypothesis.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.050
A lot of these videos have one thing in common
and that’s their ability to elicit intimacy

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.160
through the idea of sensory function.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.150
Things are being touched, voices are soothing
and comforting…

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.180
He believes all of these factors trigger a
similar response to the experience of being

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.410
loved.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.110
I mean YES gentle voices and touching are
important factors to all interpersonal bonding

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.110
amongst humans.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.940
It helps us strengthen our relationships and
neurotransmitters get released to make us

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.390
feel relaxed and comforted.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.820
BUT we have no scientific evidence to back
this up.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.650
Even Dr. Richard says that more studies need
to be published to find an solid answer

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.420
In the end, even though it might seem like
some silly internet thing knowing more about

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.300
this could help us treat serious conditions
like insomnia, anxiety, and chronic pain.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.150
And we know more research is definitely needed,
but, it’s a good reminder that even when

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.430
you may feel alone, you can always count on
the people of the internet to have your back

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.710
and also your...tingly head.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.120
Hey there hope this episode has your fingers
tingling towards the subscribe button.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.950
And speaking of internet, why don’t you
check out this video on if we could one day

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.620
connect our brain to the web.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.460
SHARE ALL THE ASMR.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.850
Fun fact: ASMR could be linked to Synesthesia,
which is the ability to hear color or taste

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.400
words (aaand we have a video on that too BAM
TWO VIDEOS) anyway thanks for watching and

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.189
hope you see you back here on Seeker.
