00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:14.766
&gt;&gt;My name is Virginia.

00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:16.026
I'm fourteen years old.

00:00:16.086 --> 00:00:21.386
I live in Camilla, Georgia,
and I get fun, entertainment,

00:00:21.996 --> 00:00:23.596
and ease outta technology.

00:00:23.596 --> 00:00:24.976
It just makes everything
a lot easier for me.

00:00:25.516 --> 00:00:30.546
[Virginia playing piano].

00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:33.496
&gt;&gt;Virginia: Camilla, Georgia,
is like a small southern town.

00:00:33.496 --> 00:00:36.316
You know, we don't get
the newest stuff here,

00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:40.266
and I definitely think people
overlook Camilla and the students

00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.806
at Westwood, and people are surprised

00:00:42.806 --> 00:00:49.976
to hear the achievements
we've had in computer class.

00:00:50.046 --> 00:00:53.626
&gt;&gt;I first started using
computers about the seventh grade,

00:00:53.856 --> 00:00:56.796
but I really started to get
the in depth view on technology

00:00:56.796 --> 00:00:59.816
when I entered into eighth
grade with Miss Vicki's class.

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:03.596
&gt;&gt;-- how deep you can go into making
your character different, like--

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:06.296
&gt;&gt;Vicki: Okay, so how
you can customize it.

00:01:06.296 --> 00:01:07.586
&gt;&gt;Virginia: Yeah, customizing
your character.

00:01:07.586 --> 00:01:10.246
&gt;&gt;Vicki: I focus on teaching
them how to learn new software,

00:01:10.596 --> 00:01:15.136
learning how to learn, using the
Wiki, how to blog effectively,

00:01:15.406 --> 00:01:19.016
collaborating effectively,
being very comfortable

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:20.556
with just about any technology.

00:01:20.816 --> 00:01:22.466
&gt;&gt;Virginia: She first
showed us how to blog.

00:01:22.616 --> 00:01:26.396
&gt;&gt;Vicki: You have to click on
object and change your X, Y and Z.

00:01:26.606 --> 00:01:29.756
&gt;&gt;Virginia: And then she went into
media and how you can edit videos,

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:32.096
and I just got so involved with it.

00:01:32.096 --> 00:01:32.686
It was amazing.

00:01:32.686 --> 00:01:35.976
&gt;&gt;Okay, here's my iGoogle page.

00:01:36.216 --> 00:01:38.926
I have my Digi Teen Dream
Team stuff right here.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:43.986
Digi Teen is a website my computer
teacher created and it was basically

00:01:43.986 --> 00:01:48.566
for schools all around the world
to talk about digital citizenship

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.226
and do different blog posts with it.

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:54.846
I do about one blog a month,
with people on Digi Teen.

00:01:54.846 --> 00:01:56.576
&gt;&gt;I'm a health freak, so, you know,

00:01:56.576 --> 00:01:59.536
I have the world's healthiest
foods, food of the week.

00:01:59.806 --> 00:02:02.886
Every other day, I like to go on
YouTube and see the top rated videos,

00:02:02.886 --> 00:02:07.156
and then sometimes I'll
go to Spark Notes and read

00:02:07.156 --> 00:02:09.506
up a coupla the books I'm studying.

00:02:09.606 --> 00:02:11.016
I love to text message.

00:02:11.316 --> 00:02:15.296
I use iTunes and that's how I get my
music and I share it with my friends.

00:02:15.296 --> 00:02:19.656
I love to go on MySpace and Facebook
and play games like Guitar Hero.

00:02:20.156 --> 00:02:22.566
[cross talk]

00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:30.556
&gt;&gt;Virginia: It's my favorite game.

00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:36.626
&gt;&gt;I love to play basketball.

00:02:36.746 --> 00:02:38.806
&gt;&gt;Azalee: Virginia is an awesome kid.

00:02:39.536 --> 00:02:44.356
There's a sweet, wonderful,kind
girl on the one side, and then,

00:02:44.546 --> 00:02:50.976
the other side is this fierce
competitor, with a drive to succeed.

00:02:51.106 --> 00:02:52.686
&gt;&gt;Virginia: I did really
good on defense today.

00:02:52.686 --> 00:02:56.926
Someone baseline drived me a
coupla times, but-- I know, I know.

00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:59.716
&gt;&gt;Mom, this ice is like frozen over.

00:02:59.716 --> 00:03:04.936
&gt;&gt;Azalee: Why don't you [inaudible]
real quick and unfreeze it?

00:03:08.236 --> 00:03:08.536
Shazam.

00:03:09.636 --> 00:03:12.206
&gt;&gt;Virginia: When I get home
from basketball, I usually spend

00:03:12.206 --> 00:03:15.066
about forty five minutes
checking my MySpace and Facebook,

00:03:15.516 --> 00:03:18.906
and I usually just reply back to
friends' comments and I go look

00:03:18.906 --> 00:03:22.196
at new pictures they've posted.

00:03:22.416 --> 00:03:24.416
I love to take pictures.

00:03:24.886 --> 00:03:27.866
I've tons of them.

00:03:28.066 --> 00:03:29.586
&gt;&gt;Vicki: The thing that
makes Virginia very unique

00:03:29.636 --> 00:03:33.446
that really impressed me when we
did our digital citizenship project,

00:03:33.906 --> 00:03:38.666
was that she realized that she was
on Facebook for too much every day,

00:03:38.706 --> 00:03:39.956
more than four hours a day.

00:03:40.186 --> 00:03:42.806
&gt;&gt;Virginia: I realized I was
being very unhealthy online.

00:03:43.146 --> 00:03:46.976
I started losing my color
in my face and I started,

00:03:46.976 --> 00:03:48.106
you know, eating differently.

00:03:48.106 --> 00:03:48.976
It was really weird.

00:03:48.976 --> 00:03:50.486
So I was like, this is not good.

00:03:51.246 --> 00:03:55.316
&gt;&gt;Azalee: They had a fast at our
church, that everyone was asked

00:03:55.316 --> 00:03:57.856
to give something up for three
weeks, and Virginia saw this

00:03:57.856 --> 00:04:00.876
as an opportunity to
reflect on the fact

00:04:00.876 --> 00:04:05.976
that she was wired three hours
a day, and so she gave it up.

00:04:06.116 --> 00:04:09.056
&gt;&gt;Vicki: I think that that shows
a lot of maturity in ninth grade

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:12.576
to keep that balance,
because technology is great,

00:04:12.576 --> 00:04:14.006
but we also have a real life to live

00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:18.446
and technology should improve our
lives, not take away from our lives.

00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:22.176
&gt;&gt;Virginia: Okay, when everybody gets
in their wigwams, raise your hand.

00:04:22.426 --> 00:04:26.636
&gt;&gt;I'm teaching young elementary
kids how to stay safe online.

00:04:26.636 --> 00:04:29.416
&gt;&gt;Do you think there can be bad
people that would try and hurt you

00:04:29.416 --> 00:04:31.026
on a website called Wiggi World?

00:04:31.296 --> 00:04:33.986
&gt;&gt;I really wanted to make a
difference with that situation,

00:04:33.986 --> 00:04:37.316
so I found this website called Wiggi
World, and I was like, "Miss Vicki,

00:04:37.316 --> 00:04:38.716
this would be a great thing to do."

00:04:38.896 --> 00:04:42.476
We just got a class going and
we're just teaching them, you know,

00:04:42.476 --> 00:04:45.716
the little aspects of digital
citizenship that can go a long way.

00:04:45.996 --> 00:04:48.986
&gt;&gt;Things you think you should
keep private to yourself online,

00:04:49.216 --> 00:04:50.846
like not tell a stranger,
even if they ask?

00:04:51.626 --> 00:04:51.736
Mm-hmm.

00:04:51.736 --> 00:04:53.146
&gt;&gt;Your email address.

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:54.926
&gt;&gt;Virginia: You would not
tell your email address.

00:04:54.976 --> 00:04:55.336
What else?

00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:56.166
&gt;&gt;Where you live.

00:04:56.436 --> 00:04:57.176
&gt;&gt;Virginia: Good job.

00:04:57.416 --> 00:04:59.086
&gt;&gt;The kids have loved Wiggi World.

00:04:59.196 --> 00:05:00.646
They don't really look
at it as learning.

00:05:00.646 --> 00:05:02.196
They just look at it
as playing, you know.

00:05:02.196 --> 00:05:04.486
&gt;&gt;Do you think we should give
them our cell phone number?

00:05:05.396 --> 00:05:05.636
&gt;&gt;Everybody: No.

00:05:05.636 --> 00:05:06.606
&gt;&gt;Virginia: No.

00:05:06.826 --> 00:05:10.866
&gt;&gt;I've learned from the experience
of teaching how naive young kids

00:05:10.926 --> 00:05:14.056
in the fourth grade are to
technology, the dangers of it.

00:05:14.056 --> 00:05:14.846
&gt;&gt;Do you have any pets?

00:05:14.846 --> 00:05:16.226
Do you think that would
be an okay question?

00:05:16.476 --> 00:05:18.446
&gt;&gt;Vicki: Digital citizenship is

00:05:18.626 --> 00:05:23.016
&gt;&gt;one of the most misunderstood,
under appreciated topics

00:05:23.276 --> 00:05:25.226
in terms of education in schools.

00:05:25.646 --> 00:05:28.506
Here in the south, we say a little
bit of dirt is good for your health.

00:05:28.766 --> 00:05:32.456
If you want to raise an unhealthy
child, you put them in a bubble

00:05:32.456 --> 00:05:34.486
and you never let them
get exposed to germs.

00:05:34.686 --> 00:05:36.956
But no filter is going
to ever be perfect.

00:05:37.186 --> 00:05:38.236
&gt;&gt;Virginia: What is your real name?

00:05:38.326 --> 00:05:39.796
No, that's not a good question.

00:05:39.966 --> 00:05:42.336
&gt;&gt;Vicki: I engage my
students in becoming teachers,

00:05:42.586 --> 00:05:45.666
because it's presentation
skills and it's leadership.

00:05:45.666 --> 00:05:49.376
But if you want to truly know
something, if you have to teach it,

00:05:49.736 --> 00:05:51.686
then you become an expert.

00:05:51.686 --> 00:05:55.486
&gt;&gt;Virginia: I just love to get up
there and, you know, teach the kids.

00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:57.026
&gt;&gt;These things are very important.

00:05:57.026 --> 00:05:59.716
You need to remember them as
long as you use a computer.

00:05:59.716 --> 00:06:03.966
&gt;&gt;Miss Vicki has, you know, made
me see technology in such a new,

00:06:03.966 --> 00:06:08.366
different light, and she's just
introduced me to the vast majority

00:06:08.366 --> 00:06:11.786
of technology, not just cell phones
and computers, but, you know,

00:06:11.786 --> 00:06:15.626
blogging and actually reaching out
to help people through technology.

00:06:15.626 --> 00:06:18.866
I get to meet so many
new people and, you know,

00:06:18.866 --> 00:06:21.086
share with them my
views on everything.

00:06:21.646 --> 00:06:26.016
I do think digital
technology's improving my life.

00:06:28.076 --> 00:06:30.676
&gt;&gt;My mom was very against
cell phones.

00:06:30.676 --> 00:06:31.926
She hated them.

00:06:31.926 --> 00:06:34.366
We finally talked her into getting a
cell phone, 'cause we could never get

00:06:34.366 --> 00:06:37.326
in touch with her, and it's
been so much easier for her.

00:06:37.486 --> 00:06:40.106
And I always have to show
her new things to do with it.

00:06:40.256 --> 00:06:44.086
She always like, "I don't know what
to do on this darn thing," you know.

00:06:48.566 --> 00:06:50.466
