00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.500
&gt;&gt; We want to know if the deletion is dominant or recessive, but we see

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.640
here if you're homozygous for the deletion that the only way to be resistant

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.245
to HIV infection is to be homozygous for the deletion and

00:00:15.245 --> 00:00:20.840
therefore it's recessive. Here we're looking at, at your results

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.220
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.552
&gt;&gt; But if you want to learn more about the CCR5 gene and this particular

00:00:25.552 --> 00:00:28.364
SNV you can scroll down and read about it

00:00:28.364 --> 00:00:32.519
here. And actually there're very many citations listed that

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:37.678
give background, detailed background information on the connection between

00:00:37.678 --> 00:00:40.600
this gene and this SNV and resistant to HIV.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.580
&gt;&gt; Perfect.
