00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:07.070
FEMALE SPEAKER: This
is the director.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:12.560
He also co-wrote, co-edited,
and co-produced the movie,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.880
and it's Carlos Marques-Marcet.

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:17.530
CARLOS MARQUES
MARCET: Thank you.

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:21.960
FEMALE SPEAKER: He wanted to
share with you a funny story

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.740
about shooting Google
and the bizarre fact

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.890
that he's actually here.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:27.350
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET:
Well, it's

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.474
actually a very long story.

00:00:28.474 --> 00:00:32.070
It's very weird to be in this
building, because, as you saw,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.960
that's a photograph of
this building in the movie,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.010
of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.464
The funny thing is
when we were doing

00:00:39.464 --> 00:00:41.630
the script of the movie,
my photographer friend, who

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.590
inspired the movie,
actually, he's a man,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.040
but I changed the gender--
he came to visit me.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.930
Then we decided, he read
the script and said,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.880
oh, this photographer
doesn't work like that.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.046
I'll come through Los
Angeles, we'll make a project,

00:00:55.046 --> 00:00:59.770
we've got a grant from an
art institution and UCLA

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.420
to help us and everything.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.450
We'll give you support so
you can make this art project

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.450
before making the movie.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.040
So you have on one side the art
project, and on the other side

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.410
you have the movie, and
we'll use the art project

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.070
to use it in the movie.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.662
The funny thing
is like, OK, so we

00:01:16.662 --> 00:01:17.870
started working on one thing.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.640
We shot on the
antennas, and then

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.670
the antennas gave us
the idea, and then

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.822
we shot the Google
building, but we

00:01:23.822 --> 00:01:26.280
didn't know it was Google at
the time, because like I said,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.071
when we took the picture,
it wasn't bought.

00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:30.140
And then the news came
on-- Google has bought,

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.710
and it's like oh, somehow
it gave us the key to all.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.720
Maybe that's what the
photographic project needs

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.530
to be, just randomly,
because it got bought.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.340
Then he's like, OK, we said
the thing about all the tools,

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.240
you see the physicality
of internet.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.040
We all wonder, OK, internet,
but where is internet?

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.830
Filmmakers, we shoot
things, we shoot things

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.490
that you can touch, that you
can see, you don't shoot ideas.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.200
So it was like, how do
you shoot the internet?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.210
Where is it?

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.610
Where is it?

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.650
I want to see it.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.065
That wasn't where-- we were
trying to find this service

00:02:07.065 --> 00:02:07.690
and everything.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.300
But also Google
Maps, we're obsessed

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.450
with Google Maps and this
thing that you can use

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.490
to travel all around the world.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.500
It reminds me a lot of the
Lumiere brothers with the two

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.140
screens.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.315
The Lumiere brothers were the
first one doing films-- well,

00:02:22.315 --> 00:02:24.606
in America it was Edison,
but for the rest of the world

00:02:24.606 --> 00:02:25.439
it was the Lumieres.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.900
I love it.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.725
Basically, they do
panoramics of the world

00:02:32.725 --> 00:02:36.220
all around just to show
people how was Istanbul,

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.750
how was this country they've
never seen before in France.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.590
It's like, woah.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.610
I feel nowadays Google
Maps makes the same thing.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.560
You just Google a
street view and you

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.507
could have the same panoramic
view of anywhere in the world.

00:02:49.507 --> 00:02:51.340
Anyway, we were obsessed,
and it's like, OK,

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.135
we have to photograph
the tools, and also,

00:02:54.135 --> 00:02:56.330
let's photograph the Google car.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.642
Then it was like, impossible.

00:02:57.642 --> 00:02:59.225
We got the [INAUDIBLE]
and everything,

00:02:59.225 --> 00:03:03.510
but how do you reach Google?

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.750
It's seems very funny, but we
try any way, all the emails,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.960
all the contacts possible
through the university,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.740
through something else.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.449
There was no way.

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:15.489
We even came to-- not
these offices, because they

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.580
were still in the other
offices in Santa Monica--

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.670
we went there to the door.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.035
I'm trying to ask somebody,
knock on the [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:24.140
Can we get in?

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.165
We're not bad people,
we're not crazy people,

00:03:26.165 --> 00:03:27.540
we just want to
talk with Google.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.760
It was impossible
to talk with Google.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.290
And then we decided, OK, you
cannot to talk with Google,

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.500
Google talks with you.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.560
That was actually what happened,
and now I'm in the building.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.050
But in a funny way, we decided,
OK, let's go to Silicon Valley,

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.830
let's go to Google city.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.620
There's a place where Google is.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.875
We just went there, and we
looked for the Google car,

00:03:55.875 --> 00:03:58.340
and we found it in some corner.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.691
Then we just took the tripod,
took the picture, and went.

00:04:03.691 --> 00:04:05.440
Then it was funny,
because it was so hard,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.023
but then when we
asked for permission,

00:04:07.023 --> 00:04:11.810
Google said, yeah,
fine, use the picture.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:12.870
Everything's fine.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.370
It's the weird structure
of the internet.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.560
There's no centers, you
really can't reach any center

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.510
at any point.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.480
It was very like
being in the castle,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.855
you know, a little
bit Kafka-ian.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.680
It's funny, because that's
how all the artistic projects

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.890
started, because then we
were in Silicon Valley.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.900
For them it's like
the most strange place

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.847
in the world, like very weird,
like all these buildings there.

00:04:38.847 --> 00:04:40.430
Then we start taking
all the pictures,

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.910
and that's where all the
email at the end, she says,

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.080
all the ideas came from.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.950
The funny thing,
we went to Yahoo

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.330
and we did the same thing,
we just took the tripod,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.720
went to this basket court
field-- court field, you say?

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.880
Yeah, I think-- with the
camera, took the picture,

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.270
and left, with no
permission or anything.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.170
Then we say, OK
that's in the movie,

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.930
so let's ask for permission.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.800
Then they said, oh, it's fine,
but this is the old logo.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.290
Maybe you're can Photoshop
it and put the new logo.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.560
So that's basically what we did.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.160
It was an experience to deal
with all of the new technology

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.840
companies.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.270
They have a different mentality
that still I don't understand,

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.145
but it was kind of Kafka-ian.

00:05:26.145 --> 00:05:28.270
FEMALE SPEAKER: Carlos, I
did some research on you,

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.470
and I had a quote from you about
a movie that you really loved,

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.380
an Italian movie from 1963.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.872
I'm sorry, you'll have
to actually pronounce it.

00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:40.330
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET:
I fidanzati.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.050
FEMALE SPEAKER: Right,
and the director?

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.000
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET:
Ermanno Olmi.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.604
FEMALE SPEAKER: It was a
remarkable first scene.

00:05:47.604 --> 00:05:49.020
I think in the
first three minutes

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.730
there's one word
spoken, and yet, you're

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.750
already captured and
intrigued with what happens.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.250
Why?

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.340
Why did she do that?

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.580
I wanted to ask you, you start
this movie with a couple making

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.440
love, right?

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.609
It's really right there.

00:06:01.609 --> 00:06:02.275
It's not vulgar.

00:06:02.275 --> 00:06:04.940
It's very tasteful, natural,
but it starts the movie

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.060
and it ends the movie.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.084
Why did you choose to do that?

00:06:08.084 --> 00:06:09.500
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET:
Well, to me

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.570
there's something
about sexuality

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.260
that is the most intimate
language that couples have.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.310
Somehow it was a way to show
this evolution, this change.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.810
Sometimes I get a
little bit annoyed

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.650
when you see movies that
just try to show you

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.260
sex to get you horny.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.810
Sometimes it's fine.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.032
Sometimes you are in the mood
and that's great, actually.

00:06:33.032 --> 00:06:34.990
FEMALE SPEAKER: But that
wasn't why you did it.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.948
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET:
That wasn't why I did it

00:06:36.948 --> 00:06:40.720
and sometimes it's just-- I
like when it has a meaning, when

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.620
it's doing something.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.920
To me, it would be doing a
dialogue between two people,

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.295
just not with words,
but with bodies.

00:06:49.295 --> 00:06:51.670
FEMALE SPEAKER: I know that
your background initially-- I

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:56.830
know you studied filmmaking--
but you started as an editor.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.400
I was just wondering,
when I started in TV news,

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.720
I started as an editor.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.280
I remember being on the field
and really feeling my stories.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.120
I would hear the sound bite,
oh, my story's going to start.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.190
That's the sound.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.450
Do you feel that your way
of even writing the movie

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.050
has been affected by the
fact that you were initially

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.080
an editor?

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.496
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET:
Yeah, and I

00:07:18.496 --> 00:07:20.500
think the whole
concept of the movie

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.360
was already very editing-based.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.900
The length of the
shot, just calculating

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.770
how long the scenes
were going to be,

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.480
short scenes with long scenes.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.170
The pacing was already very
present on the writing, I feel.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:38.800
Even when this
[INAUDIBLE] long take,

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.160
but it's already written
as an editing long take.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.040
I wasn't really
planning already-- it's

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.580
hard to say, to explain, but
you basically think on shots

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.630
and how to transition
to one to another

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.290
in a way that you
will do an editing,

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.452
but just without cutting.

00:07:57.452 --> 00:07:58.910
That has to be in
the writing, too,

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.850
in the way to go from
some place to another,

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:08.050
and how this time happens in
one side, or in which pace,

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.480
and which action.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.480
I think basically
editing is like music,

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.337
it's like playing music.

00:08:15.337 --> 00:08:17.420
There was something of it
that was already present

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.200
in the script.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.010
I'm terrible, I have no ears,
so I'm horrible with music,

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.154
so it's kind of my way of trying
to get something with that.

00:08:25.154 --> 00:08:26.570
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Was this the movie

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.542
you thought you
were going to make?

00:08:28.542 --> 00:08:29.750
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET: Sorry?

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:31.833
FEMALE SPEAKER: When you
had the finished product,

00:08:31.833 --> 00:08:36.000
was that the movie you thought
you were going to make?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.610
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET: To me,
for many directors, that's

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:40.299
their goal.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:41.840
They have a movie
in their mind, they

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.070
want to see it on the
screen, and yes, I'm

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.840
happy because it looks
like what I imagined.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.550
For me it happens a little bit
the opposite when I'm shooting.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.920
If I shoot a scene that
is exactly as I expected,

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.930
as I imagined,
something is wrong.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.390
I know I like to go to
shoot and get something

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:58.730
that I didn't expect.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.520
I shoot a lot of takes
sometimes, just waiting

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.679
that something new happens
that is not on the screen

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:06.470
but is better, some
sort the reality bridge

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:09.510
or something that surprises you.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.870
I will say yes, it's very
similar in some ways,

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.680
but the parts that
I like the most

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.710
are the parts that
are not as similar.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.196
For example, one of my
favorite moments of the movie

00:09:21.196 --> 00:09:22.820
is the moment where,
in the last scene,

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.400
when they are you
drinking whisky,

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.590
there's this long silence,
and the dog starts barking.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.470
That's probably one of my
favorite moments of the movie.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.450
Of course, this dog
started barking by itself.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:38.910
I told the actors, just
wait until the dog stops,

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.260
and then you can start talking.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.100
Then it never
stopped, so then it

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.210
became this action
moment that was

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.990
exactly what the scene needed.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:50.450
It's like, oh, thanks,
there's something.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.230
I couldn't give that direction.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.050
That wouldn't have
existed in my mind,

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:57.900
and that's what I'm
always searching for.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.622
It's almost like a rush of
something unexpected happening.

00:10:02.622 --> 00:10:05.080
FEMALE SPEAKER: Did the actors
bring something to the movie

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.770
that you hadn't expected?

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.210
Perhaps something you liked?

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.390
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET:
Yeah, a lot.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.460
Of course, the sense
of humor of it.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.880
It always was thought of as a
drama, but then shooting it,

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.780
we had so much fun working.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:21.840
We were laughing so much.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.860
Then suddenly, the movie
got much more light

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.600
than it was originally intended.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.432
I feel like the
audiences laugh a lot.

00:10:28.432 --> 00:10:30.890
I was surprised, even, because
it wasn't planned like this,

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.350
but it's just what it came with.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.040
Natalia's energy, the
character was more

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.780
like a quiet character,
and she still

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.976
is, but Natalia the actress,
she's like a tornado.

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:44.340
Not like the character at all.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.400
I think she brings this,
somehow, in little doses

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.330
to her character.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.200
I think they change
the character.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.920
Originally, she was not British.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.220
It's when we cast
her that we decided,

00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.250
oh, actually, if she's
British, it will work better.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:03.510
I always work with whatever
I have on my hands.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.160
It's not like--
you've got a script,

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.820
say it's an
exterior, day, sunny.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.550
Then you go, oh, it's
raining, we don't shoot.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.730
For me, is more like,
oh it's raining.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:16.390
What happens if it's raining?

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.220
Let's try to figure it out.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.840
FEMALE SPEAKER: You shot it
on a Red EPIC camera, right?

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.615
So was that hard to shoot
with low lighting resolution?

00:11:24.615 --> 00:11:27.095
Did you have to light
it in a particular way?

00:11:27.095 --> 00:11:29.720
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET: Yeah, it
was kind of an issue sometimes.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:36.037
Like Alex is now, or they
got better low-light.

00:11:36.037 --> 00:11:37.870
But at the same time,
I like to use the EPIC

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.950
because it has the 4K.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.260
We planned a little
bit of re-framing.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.360
Not doing it imposed,
but already shooting it,

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.800
we were planning them.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.920
That's why we decided
to shoot with the EPIC.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.211
The problem is that, for
example, for this first scene,

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.230
we shot with the
lights-- you don't have

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.820
anywhere to hide the lights.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:01.020
You just basically
have to use windows.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:04.035
Dagmar, the DP, is she's
an amazing director

00:12:04.035 --> 00:12:06.630
of photography, and we
basically always think

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.420
of lighting spaces.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.080
That's how we function.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.900
We light the space and
I make the blocking

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.400
with the actors,
thinking already,

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.570
what's the possibilities
of the space?

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.470
Basically, I use
the props, because I

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:20.930
don't like to use marks.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.360
I don't like the act of
saying, you have to step.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.280
They can do it,
but to me, I just

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.920
want to be totally free
to be able to create.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.380
So I put, here is
the coffee pot,

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.940
so I know he needs to his mark.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.720
The props are their marks.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.670
Then we work with knowing
where the props are

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:42.060
and where we're going
to put the lights.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.310
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do you like
Red cameras in particular?

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:46.620
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET:
Yeah, I enjoy them a lot.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.320
Like a lot of the [INAUDIBLE]
before like [INAUDIBLE],

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.090
I like them a lot,
too, but there's

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:54.610
something about the Red, it
has its own specific colors

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:56.230
and everything.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:58.270
I've really enjoyed
having the 4K.

00:13:01.332 --> 00:13:02.790
Some days it can
be very dangerous,

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:06.340
if you just use-- because
in cinema you have 4K now,

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.350
so normally you end
up screening 2K.

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:10.860
Basically, you can
do re-framings,

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.360
and move the camera.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:17.590
You can become a lazy filmmaker.

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:24.850
But if you plan it well, and
if you think of it in a way

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:26.620
that this is part
of your language,

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:32.310
not as something you do as a
way of trying to solve problems,

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:35.335
as a way of a
creative tool, I think

00:13:35.335 --> 00:13:36.784
it has a lot of possibilities.

00:13:36.784 --> 00:13:38.700
FEMALE SPEAKER: I hear
the Red's fairly heavy.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.670
Did you use it like-- is it a
gyro stabilizer for the walking

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:43.920
shot or the movement shots?

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.170
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET: It's
all in tripod, some tripod

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.465
and with all machine.

00:13:47.465 --> 00:13:50.290
It's all very big.

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:55.030
Some people use Steadicams as
a way to substitute a dolly,

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.820
but it's not the same.

00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.870
There's actually
very few filmmakers

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:03.220
who know how to use Steadicam.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.740
A lot of times it's
an easy tool to use,

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:10.240
but to me the problem was,
because it makes your life much

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.720
easier, for us it would
have been much easier

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.304
to go with a Steadicam
here and there.

00:14:14.304 --> 00:14:15.761
But the problem
with the Steadicams

00:14:15.761 --> 00:14:17.270
is that they are
called Steadicams,

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.430
but they never stay steady.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.720
They always have
these things that

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.050
are floating and everything.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.720
For us it was important to
stay at the moment with them,

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.920
so we used these old
machines like in the 1940s

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.950
with the smaller cameras.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:34.710
It's beautiful.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:38.520
There's something-- you
see like Douglas they may

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.950
be starting even huge cameras.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.830
Now they are small.

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:47.410
You can feel the weight of the
[GROAN], Gone with the Wind,

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:48.780
and then it's like, woah.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.050
There's something about
that is very beautiful,

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:55.000
I feel, of being on the ground.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.410
FEMALE SPEAKER: I also read
that you said that you don't

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.130
choose a movie, it chooses you.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.480
So I feel like sometimes,
when you're in a relationship,

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.250
there's a moment
where you're like,

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.940
that was when I fell
in love with him.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.919
Was there a moment when
this movie chose you?

00:15:09.919 --> 00:15:11.835
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET:
That's a good question.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:18.640
There's a first moment
where it makes it click .

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.650
That normally
happened when I have

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:23.900
ideas for movies and with
shows before, and everything.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.510
I have this idea floating,
this other idea floating,

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.490
and then suddenly it
just makes that click.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:33.890
In that case, it was
oh, there's internet.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:35.495
I wanted to explore
all the language

00:15:35.495 --> 00:15:39.290
of long-distance relationships,
the language of webcams

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.080
and screens.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.344
Then my friend [INAUDIBLE] the
photographer, came to visit me,

00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:47.010
and then he told me
click, click, click.

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:49.000
Oh, yes, a photographer
coming to Los Angeles,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.030
and then it's like,
boom, they are born.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.690
There's a spark
that goes in there,

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.690
and then it's like,
OK, that's an idea.

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:58.490
It that grabs you and
it doesn't leave you.

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:02.160
I think it's almost
like first sight love.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.337
It's mostly that afterwards
you cannot hate it.

00:16:05.337 --> 00:16:07.420
In a relationship, you
fall in love at the moment,

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.190
and then you're
seven years together,

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:12.150
and then there's
no sex or anything.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:16.890
Then you have to fall in
love again, and go to dinner,

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:18.350
and then you can fall in love.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.960
It's mostly like pre-falling
in love again and again.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.460
FEMALE SPEAKER: You said that
the last scene was emotionally

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.010
challenging for you.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:27.200
I wanted to know why.

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:32.870
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET:
I guess, of course,

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.950
there's a personal
part on the story,

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.590
but I haven't lived exactly.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.190
I've never gone
to a door, nobody

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:39.890
has ever come to my door.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:41.740
But there was something
about this material

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.160
of just showing the breakup.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.360
Somehow, when they ask me if
this movie is autobiographical,

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.930
it is, and it is not,
in many ways, but maybe

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:53.830
it sums up all my
failed relationships.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:17:00.700
Somehow, it was trying to
confront what happens when you

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:04.460
still love somebody but you
know that you cannot live a life

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:08.240
together, and trying to really
go deep into this moment

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.349
and not planning.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:13.440
I was very concerned
about going into the scene

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.609
with very pre-formed ideas.

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:19.069
I wanted to be vulnerable,
me as the director,

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:23.740
too, not really knowing
what needs to be.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:27.680
I know what they want to
capture, but I don't know how.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.480
It was very funny, actually, in
the rehearsals with the actors,

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.550
they always explain the
story, because I normally

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:40.140
record the rehearsals, but this
time I just left them alone.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.950
They were having
sex and they'd turn,

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:43.325
it's like, where
is the director?

00:17:48.184 --> 00:17:49.600
But then when
you're sad, you have

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.220
to be-- I think it
was Herzog who said,

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:55.130
a director can never cry
on set, and it's true.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:59.080
You have to be very cold-minded
and be able to analyze,

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.580
just guide the
actors and tell them,

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.620
this is not working
here or there.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.000
This is happening, you have
to be almost scientific there

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.610
while also
corresponding and being

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:12.870
sympathetic to their feelings,
but being able to analyze them.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:16.280
I was very afraid to have to do
both things at the same time,

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.080
being able to have
both your right

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.980
and left sides of
the brain connected

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.840
and the same then confront
them in a way that

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.190
is the ending of your movie.

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:27.160
Actually we didn't shoot
it until-- the night

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.469
before, I was watching movies,
like sex scenes and everything,

00:18:30.469 --> 00:18:33.010
maybe they have a solution, but
of course, it was all stupid.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:38.630
But then, I didn't shoot it
until the last shot, almost.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:42.770
I guess I was looking for this
magic to happen where, oh yeah,

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:43.530
it's cut.

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:46.500
It's right in the moment
when the sun is coming out,

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.760
the [INAUDIBLE] is
going to get married,

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.770
the taxi's on the floor,
she's missing her plane.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.610
These dramatic moments
of them happened.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:55.744
It gives you a rush.

00:18:55.744 --> 00:18:57.410
At the end, I feel
like if we make them,

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:00.200
we make movies for the
pleasure of making them

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.000
into these little flash moments.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.160
I guess it was a way
of pushing myself

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.300
into this limited situation.

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.710
Of course, I'm not doing
like "Fitzcarraldo."

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:13.360
I'm not sending a
boat over a mountain,

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.610
but still, you're
looking for this moment

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:19.540
where something magical,
some kind of truth happens,

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:23.500
or you feel that
happens for yourself.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.000
FEMALE SPEAKER: If that was
the most challenging part

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.880
of the movie, emotionally,
what was probably

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:32.440
the most fun or most awesome
moment for you in the movie?

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.690
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET: There
was a lot of fun moments.

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:37.810
From the moment where they
are trying to throw things

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:41.230
at one another, and
then when it happened,

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:42.750
we tried so many times.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.520
Every time was fun.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.790
I do a lot the takes so
we tried to make it funny.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:51.010
Then when it happened, we all
look at each other, like, woah,

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:52.530
it looked like it went through.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.700
The first scene
was a lot of fun,

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.510
because it's like
a choreography.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:04.590
It gives you also
a rush because it's

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:08.000
like, OK, you're getting closer
to the time, but you know,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.990
it still is like 20 minutes.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:15.740
Everything needs to be perfect,
and when it happens, go crazy,

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.740
and we shout.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.020
It seems like it was
the end of the world,

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.409
hugging everybody, oh, sad.

00:20:22.409 --> 00:20:23.450
It was something special.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.459
It was fun to shoot.

00:20:25.459 --> 00:20:26.875
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
want to read you

00:20:26.875 --> 00:20:30.460
a quote I read that you wrote.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:31.480
I hope you don't mind.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.610
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET: No,
you're very well-prepared.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.494
You're probably the
best-prepared interview

00:20:34.494 --> 00:20:35.530
I've had.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:38.740
FEMALE SPEAKER: You wrote, "It's
a problem with our generation:

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.620
it's difficult to
plan for the future,

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.610
not just because of
the financial crisis,

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:44.790
but also because
of hedonism, which

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:47.000
is the antithesis of sacrifice.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.710
And this whole debate on what
self-sacrifice means is also

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:51.610
very interesting."

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.750
I think I quote you
from March, 2014.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:57.730
I wanted to ask you,
in that statement,

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.580
are you talking
about our generation

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:04.660
being more self-orientated and
losing a sense of community?

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:12.290
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET:
Yeah, I wouldn't

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:15.990
want to fall into cliches
of yeah, just [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:17.110
and everything.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.600
I feel somehow it's a
liberation, also, in many ways,

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.610
of some rules that we narrate.

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:27.440
The weight of tradition has
been the rule of society,

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.870
like most of societies until
now that sentence so fast.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:35.550
I feel you have a family,
have to have kids,

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:40.390
the woman is at home,
the husband goes to work.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:41.930
If you're high-class,
nobody works,

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:45.267
you just live off of
the money of the others.

00:21:45.267 --> 00:21:45.850
So it's great.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:53.120
But it was very clear,
and then suddenly, there's

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.775
this discourse of
authenticity that in some ways

00:21:55.775 --> 00:21:57.730
is very nice,
because you just try

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.400
to find whatever
makes you happy,

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.470
and there's no way, no rule.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:07.190
But that makes it also
very hard to-- there's

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:12.020
a discourse of finding
yourself that also sometimes

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:16.130
can be very distracting from
the things that you really need.

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:18.440
It's a contradiction
sometimes, because trying

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.590
to find yourself,
you're not yourself

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:23.410
if it's not compared
to other people,

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:25.340
in a framing of other people.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.730
We sometimes forget that
this philosopher who

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:32.130
wrote a whole book about it,
basically talking-- we all

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.230
need to be special nowadays, no?

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:39.720
And you can be the guy who has
like 14,322 hairs on your head.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.570
But what does that mean?

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:46.830
Does it mean anything
for somebody else?

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.340
I feel there's something in
this idea of-- in building

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:51.570
relationships, a lot
of things sometimes

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:53.620
happen and the thing
is just like, oh yeah,

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:56.000
professional life
against-- I wanted

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.600
to be made aware of that, of
professional schools, family,

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.460
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.540
It's more like, there's
no one route now,

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:08.380
so now it's really hard to
find somebody who you can

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.970
partner for a long, long time.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:12.625
That's a choice,
not an obligation.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:17.400
I think the sacrifice
thing-- it's funny,

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.330
I had to cut a bunch of
the dialogue of the movie

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:21.950
because I think it
was too explicit,

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:23.699
but there was a moment
in the ending scene

00:23:23.699 --> 00:23:28.770
where he was telling her, we
don't know how to sacrifice.

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:31.260
We're a generation
where we don't know.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.350
Then she said, oh, my
parents did sacrifice,

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.540
and it didn't work out
very well for them.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.020
So that true.

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:40.200
There's both sides of sacrifice.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.980
It shouldn't feel--
sacrifice if not-- it's

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:49.300
a dangerous line in
that relationship.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.980
You have to put effort,
and what this effort

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.290
means, because then we
start to basically go

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:59.190
to think in the relationship,
oh, is it worth it?

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:02.820
Should I invest so much
effort in this relationship?

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:06.750
The outcome is not-- so we start
to enter with the mentality

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:11.550
that it's not about an outcome,
it's love, you give it,

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:14.640
and maybe you return, maybe not.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.430
I think it's dangerous to
get into those channels,

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:22.729
and sacrifice is something
you do expecting nothing.

00:24:22.729 --> 00:24:25.270
But at the same time, there's
a connotation that [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.220
Catholic kind of
connotation is horrible.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.550
As a Catholic, I say it.

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:37.450
I'm not practicing, but,
[INAUDIBLE] Catholic, I guess.

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:39.430
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do you
have a dream project

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:41.540
that you would love
to make one day?

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.550
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET:
A dream project?

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:45.130
Wow.

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:47.750
It's very hard to say,
because to me, things

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:50.740
go very one to another.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.290
If they had asked
me 10 years ago,

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.410
I would never have
said I had done

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:56.690
the movie like the one I did.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:03.670
Just supposing that I'm
going to be something

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.730
that I am now in
10 years, and that

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:09.400
would be most
horrible thing if I'm

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.960
the same person in 10 years.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.180
It's really hard to think.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.830
I guess doing
something meaningful,

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:21.520
but there's always
ideas and projects,

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.740
but something that I
like at some moment,

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:28.160
then you don't have it anymore.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.340
This is very hard because
ideas change for me.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:36.270
I would love my project
will be making movies

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:41.722
until I'm 105 years old,
like Manoel de Oliveira.

00:25:41.722 --> 00:25:44.180
I like his movies, I'm not a
super fan, but if they ask me,

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.721
which filmmaker
would you like to be?

00:25:45.721 --> 00:25:47.040
It's him.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.380
105 and making movies,
what else do you want?

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:52.370
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do you
have a purpose in life,

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:55.020
and do you think you're
going to fulfill that purpose

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.036
unless you're making a movie?

00:25:57.036 --> 00:25:58.994
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET:
I know I'm going to die.

00:25:58.994 --> 00:26:00.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:02.425 --> 00:26:04.924
FEMALE SPEAKER: Is there a
story you really want to tell?

00:26:06.737 --> 00:26:08.320
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET:
I guess I don't

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.986
want to think too
much, because then you

00:26:09.986 --> 00:26:11.860
start to get, oh,
yeah, I'm an author,

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:15.220
or, that's my discourse
about the world,

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.490
and I should be talking
about these things.

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:20.290
I prefer just to think about
the things that really worry me,

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:22.570
and what are the things
that really move me now,

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:26.080
and be with my
instinct at the moment.

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.560
Because if not, I can
get very egocentric.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.460
Your ego-- your ego is
just a part of yourself.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.820
You have many more other
parts, much more interesting.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:41.870
Right now I'm interested in
investigating the relationships

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:44.440
of how we're changing nowadays.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:49.430
There's this French
saying, [INAUDIBLE],

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:53.630
the real is painted as you
see it, being of your time.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:57.770
That, to me, was right
now, it's important

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:01.290
trying to investigate
what's happening around me.

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:04.710
Making films, to me,
is a way to really

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:07.730
be able to-- the
luxury to investigate

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:10.455
and also re-create how you feel.

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:16.530
It's a luxurious job.

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:18.500
I'm still weird when
I say, oh are you

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.230
going to pay me to do this job?

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:21.759
Really?

00:27:21.759 --> 00:27:24.050
It's great, but sometimes it
feels like a blessing more

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:27.800
than a job.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.310
FEMALE SPEAKER: Does anybody
have a question for Carlos?

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:32.143
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:27:33.125 --> 00:27:39.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
in the movie

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:43.090
they have a long-distance
relationship, but in general,

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:46.750
do you think that
technology actually

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:52.421
helps people get closer, or
are they doing the opposite?

00:27:52.421 --> 00:27:54.420
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET:
No, it's a good question.

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.800
I don't have answer for it.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.975
Somehow the movie offers
more questions than answers.

00:28:00.975 --> 00:28:02.250
That's true.

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:04.530
I think technology is like
anything, how you use it.

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:07.090
It's like, atomic
energy, is it good?

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:09.780
Depends.

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.880
I think the same thing,
it can bring you closer,

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.390
but at the same time, it
can bring you farther away,

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:16.590
because of the feeling
that you are close,

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.880
but you live without being
aware of the things that you're

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.040
missing.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:24.070
You think that just having a
computer, you know somebody,

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:26.280
that you can talk
everyday, and pretend

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.280
that you could have just
a normal, everyday life

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.390
with somebody that is so far.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:33.310
That can harm a lot
of relationships,

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:36.580
because at the end,
physicality and presence

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:39.100
is such an important
part of a relationship.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.255
At the same time,
it can keep you

00:28:41.255 --> 00:28:43.750
in contact with many people.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:47.040
I always say the same,
but I talk more sometimes

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.600
with my parents when I'm
abroad then when I'm home.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.230
When I'm home, you go
to dinner on Sundays,

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:57.030
it a bunch of family people,
and you don't say anything.

00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:59.220
Then when you're in
front of a computer,

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.290
then you have to talk.

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:04.070
Then, woah, you talk about
many things I never expected.

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:06.570
I will have talks with them.

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.800
It all depends on the situation.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.400
What is important is to see
what we lose and what we win,

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.440
and try to use them
the best way possible.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:21.320
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.650
First, I wanted to thank you
for coming here and making

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:24.540
this film.

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:26.790
I've gone through a long
distance relationship myself,

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:30.240
so some of the stuff is
very resonate with me.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.780
I just want to say
that I really like

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:34.920
the song you chose,
the Magnetic Fields

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.570
song "Nothing Matters When
We're Dancing" for the movie.

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:41.950
I thought it was used very
well knitting the two scenes.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:44.120
How did you choose that song?

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.620
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET:
It's probably

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:47.700
one of the very few
things that's still there

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.990
from the very first
draft of the movie.

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:53.380
It actually was
there all the time.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.080
At the time, coming
through Los Angeles,

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.610
that's when I
started writing this,

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:58.800
almost like seven years ago.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:04.940
I was very much rediscovering
The Magnetic Fields,

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.260
and listening again,
the song was like, wow,

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:13.700
there's something
about-- Stephin Merritt

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:17.160
has this ability to write
these lyrics in a way that

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.130
is almost cheesy, but it's not.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.430
It feels the feelings,
but with a certain irony

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:28.530
that is not sarcastic.

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:30.540
That was the tone for me.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:35.560
I wanted to use some irony, but
I didn't want a distant irony.

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.130
I wanted to be close
to the characters

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:39.870
be able to explore feelings.

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:44.280
Of course, there was also
a part of the lyrics that

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.750
has to do with
dancing, and dancing

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.660
is something you
can only do when

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.850
you are in front of each other.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:53.450
Then, through the song,
the idea of the scene

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:56.830
came on, of them dancing
with the computers.

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:59.820
So it's OK, nothing
happens when we're dancing,

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.184
but what happens when
we are not dancing?

00:31:02.184 --> 00:31:03.600
That was a little
bit of the idea,

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.642
almost, that I started
the movie with.

00:31:11.059 --> 00:31:11.850
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:12.330
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET: Hi.

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:14.060
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
bringing us the movie.

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:14.310
CARLOS MARQUES
MARCET: Thank you.

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:15.660
AUDIENCE: It's a beautiful film.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.410
I wanted to talk to
you about the editing.

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:20.410
You have a lot of long
takes at the beginning,

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:23.500
and I love editing.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:28.600
At one point Robert Wise
said that, as an editor, when

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.850
he became a director, he
found that he was shooting

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:32.557
more coverage, not less.

00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:34.723
At the beginning of the
film and throughout the film

00:31:34.723 --> 00:31:37.290
you have some really
long takes, which

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:40.930
also seem to parallel
the video conference,

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:43.180
because you really don't
have another take when you're

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:44.900
video conferencing with people.

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.780
How much of that
thought came in for you

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.180
about what were shooting?

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:52.210
Did you feel as an editor
that you wanted more coverage?

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:55.300
Did you intentionally
go for the longer takes?

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.000
Did the Red camera
help that because you

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.240
didn't have an end
of a reel coming

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.350
and I'm running out of film?

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:04.570
How did that affect you, and
what was your plan with these?

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:06.070
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET:
I didn't know

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:10.080
that he-- that's a quote from
Robert Wise, that he shot more?

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.200
He shot more coverage?

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.760
AUDIENCE: He said that to
me, I ask him a while ago.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.930
That is what he said,
is that he always felt--

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:16.700
CARLOS MARQUES
MARCET: You met him?

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.220
AUDIENCE: I worked for him.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:18.720
He said--

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.053
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET: Now I
want to ask you a question.

00:32:21.053 --> 00:32:23.400
AUDIENCE: I was trying
not to go there.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.620
It's just, I love him too.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:27.040
I mean, brilliant editor.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:30.629
But I always felt that,
that's why I asked him.

00:32:30.629 --> 00:32:32.420
I would think as a
director your mind would

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:36.329
be so focused on what you were
going to create that I'd think

00:32:36.329 --> 00:32:37.620
he knew exactly what he wanted.

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:39.328
He said no, he just
made them shoot more.

00:32:39.328 --> 00:32:42.690
And you're an editor-- started
out as an editing and filming.

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:45.240
Especially now that you have
the digital tools that he never

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.014
had, I would love to know what
your thoughts are on that.

00:32:48.014 --> 00:32:49.430
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET:
It's funny,

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:53.260
I have a lot of of friends
who go into directing.

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.310
Most of them shoot
very little coverage.

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:58.750
I think they are more
precise on the way

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:00.720
that they are going to use it.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.140
It's hardly that
they shoot-- I think

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:06.620
as an editor you tend to shoot
things that you-- you do more

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:09.890
takes until you
get the right take,

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:13.050
and then you don't shoot
things you're not going to use.

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:15.030
Sometimes, in coverage,
there's this idea of,

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:18.610
let's do things just in case.

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:20.980
Let's do all these
long master and then

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.290
they discovered this angle,
and cover this angle,

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:27.500
and cover this angle, and
then I'll decide on the post.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.650
I feel as an editor, you already
have anything in your mind,

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:31.380
pretty much.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.670
When something new happens,
you're already thinking, OK,

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:38.560
that new thing happened but now
I need shoot this thing here.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.910
So you're already taking
pieces as they happen, as you

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:46.510
get surprised, too, sometimes.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:50.450
I think it also makes you want
to-- for example, something

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:52.380
that influenced
me, I feel like I

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:55.220
wouldn't have done this very
long take at the beginning

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:57.400
if it wasn't in the beginning.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.850
As an editor you
know that a very long

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:01.900
take in the middle of
the movie, it's probably

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:06.290
going to go to the
bin, because you

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:11.909
have to be a master of having
the rhythm of the whole movie

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:16.469
on your mind in a way that
it's almost impossible.

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:19.050
In the middle, you've
created, and then finally you

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:21.364
end up breaking it up.

00:34:21.364 --> 00:34:22.989
But at the beginning,
you're setting up

00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:25.630
the tone of your movie.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:32.199
You can see as it's developing
what's going to be the theme.

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:35.087
You don't need to compare it to
what's come before and after.

00:34:35.087 --> 00:34:36.920
I think that's another
difference, probably,

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.630
or something that
makes you think a lot,

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:42.055
is that you are very aware of
what's come before and after.

00:34:42.055 --> 00:34:44.429
I guess all directors, but
especially which as an editor,

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:47.380
know how you make a
transition from this scene

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:50.790
to the other scene, or on
the way of shooting it.

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:52.974
To me, at least, an
experience with my friends

00:34:52.974 --> 00:34:58.440
is that they shoot less,
but they shoot more takes.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.397
AUDIENCE: As I said, did
you plan longer takes also

00:35:01.397 --> 00:35:03.230
because of parallels
video conferencing that

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:04.920
was going to happen later?

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.210
Because it feels the same.

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:09.210
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET:
There was a little game--

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:11.390
I'm thinking of a
game of piloting

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:13.940
the camera and the other
camera, and I always

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.460
fantasize the idea of what
cameras are going to be, like,

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.970
4K quality in a few years.

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:22.406
And there's got to be
a nice rhyme in there.

00:35:22.406 --> 00:35:24.280
To me, it was important
just to be with them.

00:35:26.987 --> 00:35:28.570
We discussed a lot
with the co-writer,

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:31.580
this is somehow a movie
between the difference

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:34.630
of being thrown off somebody,
in the image of somebody,

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:38.400
also the difference of a two
shot and a shot reverse shot.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.720
I shot reverse
shot, then it feels

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.420
like they are in front of them,
but it's like an abstraction.

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:47.080
And somehow, being in front of
a computer is an abstraction.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:50.100
We wanted to follow them so
you have any [INAUDIBLE],

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:53.160
you don't have
any buildup thing,

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.660
and you're just with
them, sitting with them

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:58.740
and you share with
them this reality.

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:01.660
It was not very metaphoric.

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:04.834
I don't like too many metaphors,
but more giving a feeling.

00:36:04.834 --> 00:36:06.500
Probably the reason
for this long thing,

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.310
it was not as much
the thing itself,

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:09.490
but the moment of the cut.

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:16.430
The moment you cut, I knew that
was going to have an effect.

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:19.770
You're going to miss for
the rest of the movie

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:22.150
this moment where they've
been together in space.

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:25.380
So that was a little bit
between-- but it was also

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.880
like the beginning,
the second take,

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.430
when you see him
showing the apartment,

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:34.200
obviously that was the idea of
reminding of the first scene,

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.950
but somehow then there
is a cut, and then

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:37.730
you see him in the other room.

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:39.762
There's an abstraction in there.

00:36:39.762 --> 00:36:41.553
AUDIENCE: I really
appreciated your editing

00:36:41.553 --> 00:36:42.852
and the way it was shot.

00:36:42.852 --> 00:36:43.352
Thanks.

00:36:43.352 --> 00:36:45.977
CARLOS MARQUES MARCET: I'll ask
you questions about Robert Wise

00:36:45.977 --> 00:36:46.642
after.

00:36:46.642 --> 00:36:47.433
I'm very impressed.

00:36:47.433 --> 00:36:50.935
So

00:36:50.935 --> 00:36:52.560
AUDIENCE: One of the
things, of course,

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.660
that was in this, a lot
was moving to the computer

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:59.520
technology with the lower
resolution and other things

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.240
with lag and
pixelation and freezes.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.802
Now, did you use
those all natural,

00:37:05.802 --> 00:37:07.260
or where there
certain places where

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:11.870
you felt you kind of
needed special effects to a

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:15.264
get the feeling you
wanted from that?

00:37:15.264 --> 00:37:16.680
CARLOS MARQUES-MARCET:
It's funny,

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.000
because I was very concerned.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.770
I really wanted to get
this texture of the pixel,

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:26.690
and I feel there's some beauty
to it, especially [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:29.370
converting with the
[INAUDIBLE] that came around

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:32.550
and then you had those
conversions of movies.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:36.160
You have all these masses of
pixels moving from one side

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:36.920
to another.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.560
It was almost like
a experimental film

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:43.490
and I have safe movies
converted of this beauty.

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:48.720
To me, all video chats have
kind of the same feeling,

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.330
which, at the show
two years before,

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:54.230
the technology in two years
got so much better, like a year

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:55.310
before.

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:59.370
So we didn't have as
many pixels as we wanted.

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:00.970
Actually some scenes--
obviously there

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:03.840
were scenes where we were
cutting, and breaking up.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.960
Then it was painful because
we had to shoot again.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:11.870
The actress was like,
ahhh, getting crazy.

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:13.657
Of course, the
moment, the day we

00:38:13.657 --> 00:38:15.740
had to shoot the scene
where the connection breaks

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.530
the [INAUDIBLE] and
everything, that day,

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:20.370
the connection was
completely perfect.

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:22.760
There was no way
could make it worse.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.520
OK, let's try it
with a cellphone.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:25.412
3G.

00:38:25.412 --> 00:38:25.995
Still perfect.

00:38:25.995 --> 00:38:28.450
We had to move everything out.

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:30.790
So I had to do something.

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:34.670
I had to do some of the stuff,
like, basically freezing, just

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:37.180
with the freezing, but
very simple things.

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:38.650
I even do it with
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:43.420
I didn't have to do any kind
of after-effects or anything.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:48.020
The good thing with shooting
this with video chats,

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:51.220
we recorded the screen, so
you're actually always shooting

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.940
three cameras somehow.

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:58.030
The thing is that you can make
several takes into one, even

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:01.960
if you've done 20 takes,
you can make a freeze frame,

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.520
and then cut, and then
put another frame.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:08.950
So there's a lot of editing
hidden in these jump cuts,

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:11.630
but they're not jump cuts.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:13.294
That's my little trick there.

00:39:13.294 --> 00:39:15.980
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you so
much, it was a wonderful time.

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:17.355
CARLOS MARQUES
MARCET: Thank you.

00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:19.630
