00:00:07.267 --> 00:00:08.350
DAN STEPHEN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.390
I'm Dan Stephen.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.780
I work in the ads business.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.350
So my team works with
developers and advertisers

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.930
to help grow their user base and
also their brands with Google.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.680
Today I want to give you three
sort of takeaways on ways

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.760
that Google can help you grow
a long-term, sustainable gaming

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.050
business.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.000
At its core, Google
is here to help

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.890
you take care of the
basics so that you

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.190
can focus on more of
the strategic objectives

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.690
around building a business.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.390
So we want to help you
build a core user base.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.750
We want to then help you
use your data to enhance

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.670
your strengths, the
strengths of your game,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.450
but also optimize the weaknesses
that potentially are creating

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.940
lower engagement,
and then, ultimately,

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.380
grow the most valuable
user base in your game.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.680
Let's start off.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.330
We know that you did not
create this game to just let

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.250
it sit on the shelf.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.990
So how do you build
a user base quickly?

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.520
Developers and
advertisers right now

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.620
are dealing with the
complexity caused

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.380
by having just so
much data created

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.800
by multiple channels for
acquisition, multiple screens,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.200
and multiple devices for users.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.470
So we understand this and
have been investing heavily

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.750
in our machine
learning capabilities

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.060
to remove this
complexity for you

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.790
and allow you to still
reach the right user

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.630
at the right time in the
most efficient way possible.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.060
Google can help you get
the world playing your game

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.740
by reaching users in the
moments that matter really

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.030
effortlessly.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.180
And last year, we launched
the Universal App campaign,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.420
which is designed to help you
reach users across Google Play,

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.980
Search, YouTube, AdMob, and
our mobile Display Network.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.630
It's really easy to set up.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.640
You just need four
lines of text.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.460
Upload your favorite
videos and images.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.040
And then set a cost per install.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.020
Google then takes care
of the rest for you,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.210
delivering you the
best of both worlds--

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.330
time savings and a
growing user base.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.430
So how does it work?

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.010
Using the simple inputs,
what Google's machine does

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.190
is start to identify types
of patterns and behaviors,

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.480
using ad creatives to
see what converts best

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.170
on what particular channel.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.710
So if Google learns
that consumers

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.630
are more likely to install your
app after clicking on a YouTube

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.790
ad as opposed to an ad
in AdMob, then the system

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.174
and the campaign will start to
optimize for that performance.

00:02:39.174 --> 00:02:40.590
So you'll start
getting more users

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.100
from YouTube or the
various different channels.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.250
But getting installs
is just a start.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.490
So for point two,
successful gaming companies

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.440
understand that unique
features of their titles

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.200
are very different for driving
revenue and engagement.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.686
We know the stat--

00:03:02.686 --> 00:03:04.560
I think everyone's heard
it-- that, you know,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.450
that 3% of your users drive
the majority of your revenue.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.180
So the most valuable
asset that you actually

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.960
have as a gaming business is
your player data, the insights

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.710
about what the most engaged
users love about your game,

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.330
like where did they come from?

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.070
What parts of the
game do they like?

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.320
What parts of the game
do they actually hate?

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.450
How often do they come back?

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.710
And how valuable
are they to you?

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.320
But how do you
know these answers?

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.260
And how do you surface it
up in a way that's easy?

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.540
You just heard about
Firebase Analytics.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.620
And this is Google's
free analytics solution

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.470
that helps you easily
understand the engagement levels

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.280
in your game.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.050
Why are users coming back?

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.360
And what actions are they
taking that eventually

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.610
lead to the most
desirable outcomes

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.830
for your particular
game, whether that's

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.310
an in-app purchase, or a
share on your social network,

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.430
levels beaten, records
broken, trophies won,

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.430
friends invited, et cetera?

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.950
Which brings me to
the third step--

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.760
using these insights, so
using your player insights

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.610
to put the game in the hands
of the users who are truly

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.560
going to love your game,
your most valuable users

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.240
who will drive revenue
growth for your business.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.640
You want to get the world to
love your game, which is hard,

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.830
not only because users
are discovering apps

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.100
from a myriad of new channels,
but also your user base

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.010
is actually more diverse
than ever before.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.260
Historically, app
marketing has all

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.160
been about demographic targeting
and look-alike audiences.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.010
Because these were the
folks that we thought

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.100
were likely to love our game and
drive value for our business.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.640
The goal now is still
the same, to find

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.490
users who are likely to take
a desired valuable action.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.920
But you can now look directly
at their actions rather than

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.110
their attributes.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.549
There's an easier way to find
the users that matter most now,

00:05:01.549 --> 00:05:03.840
those that will open your
game and just keep playing it

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.600
forever, and drive real value.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.970
You can now activate
your user insights

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.440
with the universal app campaigns
to drive engagement and value.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.080
Universal app campaigns
can automatically

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.870
find valuable users
based on the actions that

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.580
matter most to you.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.340
All you need to do
is tell the campaign

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.960
what valuable event you want
your users doing more of.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.460
You don't need to
worry about who

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.730
to target, where to find
them, how to reach them,

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.180
what ad format is going to work
best for them, what to bid.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.000
The machine can do
this second by second,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.630
impression by impression,
optimizing on the fly itself

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.730
in real time.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.830
You can define any
in-app action that

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.860
matters, from completing
an on-boarding tutorial,

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.740
to beating a level, to
sharing with their friends,

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.990
or to making a purchase.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.270
It's really easy to
integrate in an in-app action

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.190
and your conversion
data into AdWords

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.520
through either Firebase, or
[? codelessly ?] through Google

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.290
Play, or any of the third-party
measurement providers.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.330
So just wrapping up--

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.490
in summary, Google
really just wants

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.610
to help you remove the
complexities of marketing

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.980
and business development
so that you can seriously

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.460
focus on the things
that matter to you,

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.260
which is effective growth.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.550
So we do this by helping you
grow your core user base.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.790
We help you surface insight
so that you can continuously

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.350
iterate and improve.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.330
And then we use
strong signals to let

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.310
Google's machine
learning find you

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.930
the best users for your game.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.030
So thanks, everyone.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:43.930
