foreign aid was it would be a steady
 

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:50.760
foreign aid was it would be a steady
source of money for aid and there's a

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:50.770
source of money for aid and there's a
 

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:53.970
source of money for aid and there's a

avoid this variability and the third is
 

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:03.069
avoid this variability and the third is
one that moved it to a little bit

00:39:03.069 --> 00:39:03.079

get a lot of rank seeking behavior that

00:39:11.289 --> 00:39:11.299
get a lot of rank seeking behavior that
 

00:39:11.299 --> 00:39:13.059
get a lot of rank seeking behavior that
there's a lot of ranks they can behavior

00:39:13.059 --> 00:39:13.069
there's a lot of ranks they can behavior

and some people claim that's also true

00:39:17.969 --> 00:39:17.979
and some people claim that's also true
 

00:39:17.979 --> 00:39:21.190
and some people claim that's also true
evade so these are three three arguments

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200
evade so these are three three arguments
 

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.829
evade so these are three three arguments
that have been put forward for the Dutch

00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839
that have been put forward for the Dutch
 

00:39:23.839 --> 00:39:26.529
that have been put forward for the Dutch
disease of natural resources and some

00:39:26.529 --> 00:39:26.539
disease of natural resources and some
 

00:39:26.539 --> 00:39:28.269
disease of natural resources and some
people claim there's a great deal of

00:39:28.269 --> 00:39:28.279
people claim there's a great deal of
 

00:39:28.279 --> 00:39:31.239
people claim there's a great deal of
similarity with aid in that and that's

00:39:31.239 --> 00:39:31.249
similarity with aid in that and that's
 

00:39:31.249 --> 00:39:32.650
similarity with aid in that and that's
one these are some of the reasons why

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:32.660
one these are some of the reasons why
 

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:34.779
one these are some of the reasons why
eight is ineffective there's one more i

00:39:34.779 --> 00:39:34.789

want to put forward which blames the IMF

00:39:39.069 --> 00:39:39.079
want to put forward which blames the IMF
 

00:39:39.079 --> 00:39:40.949

to to explain to defend their position
 

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:49.420
to to explain to defend their position
but that argument is one of the reasons

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:49.430
but that argument is one of the reasons
 

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:53.199
but that argument is one of the reasons
that a may be ineffective is that the

00:39:53.199 --> 00:39:53.209
that a may be ineffective is that the
 

00:39:53.209 --> 00:39:59.199
that a may be ineffective is that the

00:40:04.949 --> 00:40:04.959
to put the aid effectively into reserves
 

00:40:04.959 --> 00:40:08.799
to put the aid effectively into reserves
so the result of this is because they're

00:40:08.799 --> 00:40:08.809
so the result of this is because they're
 

00:40:08.809 --> 00:40:10.930
so the result of this is because they're
worried about the macroeconomic effect

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:10.940
worried about the macroeconomic effect
 

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:15.249
worried about the macroeconomic effect
it is on the effective eight in the

00:40:15.249 --> 00:40:15.259
it is on the effective eight in the

IMF insisting on reserve accumulations
which mean that in fact there isn't more

00:40:29.499 --> 00:40:29.509
which mean that in fact there isn't more
 

00:40:29.509 --> 00:40:31.299
which mean that in fact there isn't more
money and there have been some studies

00:40:31.299 --> 00:40:31.309
money and there have been some studies
 

00:40:31.309 --> 00:40:33.579

actually done by the IMF will show that

00:40:33.579 --> 00:40:33.589
actually done by the IMF will show that
 

00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:34.870

truth in this allegation so just like to
 

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:46.170
truth in this allegation so just like to
get your your views on on that issue I

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:46.180
 
 

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:50.769
 
think there is some truth you are forced

00:40:50.769 --> 00:40:50.779
think there is some truth you are forced

fourth point and placing aid in

00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:56.960
fourth point and placing aid in
 

00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:00.170
fourth point and placing aid in
in results but I think it has to be put

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:00.180
in results but I think it has to be put
 

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:04.130
in results but I think it has to be put
within a context my view is that you

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:04.140
within a context my view is that you
 

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.850
within a context my view is that you
need a medium term expenditure framework

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:06.860
need a medium term expenditure framework
 

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:11.120
need a medium term expenditure framework
designed by the government and then

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:11.130
designed by the government and then
 

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:14.090
designed by the government and then
government's looks at different sources

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:14.100
government's looks at different sources
 

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.970
government's looks at different sources
of financing some of the sources would

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:16.980
of financing some of the sources would
 

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:19.730
of financing some of the sources would
be domestic and the other sources would

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:19.740
be domestic and the other sources would
 

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:25.430
be domestic and the other sources would
be eight and just like for natural

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440
be eight and just like for natural
 

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:28.250
be eight and just like for natural
resources you need to have a medium

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:28.260
resources you need to have a medium
 

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.320
resources you need to have a medium

with certain desired growth levels if

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:33.870
with certain desired growth levels if
 

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:36.980
with certain desired growth levels if
you don't do it that way then you will

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:36.990
you don't do it that way then you will
 

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:38.900
you don't do it that way then you will
have an expenditure framework that is

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:38.910
have an expenditure framework that is
 

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:41.990
have an expenditure framework that is
influenced by aid and you go through the

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000
influenced by aid and you go through the
 

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.150
influenced by aid and you go through the
cycles as it comes in increase

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160
cycles as it comes in increase
 

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.730
cycles as it comes in increase
expenditures as it goes down you reduce

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:46.740
expenditures as it goes down you reduce
 

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.520

your expenditures what we did in Uganda

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:49.530
your expenditures what we did in Uganda
 

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:51.770
your expenditures what we did in Uganda
was to have such a medium expenditure

00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:51.780
was to have such a medium expenditure
 

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:55.370

why I said that there is an element of

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:07.080
why I said that there is an element of
 

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.910
why I said that there is an element of
truth so whether you are dealing with

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920
truth so whether you are dealing with
 

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:14.510
truth so whether you are dealing with
with natural resources or eight you must

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520
with natural resources or eight you must
 

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.910
with natural resources or eight you must
have an expenditure framework the

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920
have an expenditure framework the
 

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.640

government must design an expenditure

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:19.650
government must design an expenditure
