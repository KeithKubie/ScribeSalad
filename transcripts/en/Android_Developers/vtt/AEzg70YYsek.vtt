00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.570
We started as a media
business, and built up

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.930
a big group of readers who took
the recommendations that we

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.210
made to heart, and
actually acted upon them.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.400
We acquired a small
business called JackThreads,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.390
which sort of served as the
supply side to the demand

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.390
that we were creating
through our content.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.080
And we have since
built JackThreads

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.985
into the fastest-growing men's
e-commerce business on the web.

00:00:30.985 --> 00:00:31.860
My name is Ben Lerer.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.520
I'm the co-founder of
Thrillist Media Group.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.190
When Android was
growing so quickly,

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.030
we said we need to
give this a real shot.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.280
We need to build
something truly native,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.180
and we need to work with
the folks at Android

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.180
to figure out what that's
supposed to look like.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.864
And we're really happy we did.

00:00:44.864 --> 00:00:46.530
Since he redesigned
the JackThreads app,

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.940
we found that 30% of new
sign-ups through Android

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.210
are actually becoming
daily active users, which

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.830
is an engagement metric
that's pretty unparalleled.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.600
And not only that,
but our Android users

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.280
are two times as likely to
sign up as any other platform.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.880
We tend to be developing
Android first at this point.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.640
And so the two things that
really move the needle for us,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.710
one is an ability to
A/B test in real time.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.780
What that does is it lets us
focus on engagement, lets us

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.460
really get into the
data, and make sure

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.110
that the changes we're making
to the app are the right ones.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.740
A developer console
provides the tools

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.125
for testing that
you really can't

00:01:20.125 --> 00:01:21.420
get on any other platform.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.590
We can roll out a
really cool idea

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.680
we have to part of our
users, see if it works.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.966
If it doesn't, roll back.

00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:28.090
If it does, go to everyone.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.530
And it's really allowed
us to lead with Android

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.890
and design wholeheartedly.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.410
We're in 14 international
markets right now.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.444
I think there's a big
opportunity to leverage

00:01:36.444 --> 00:01:37.860
Google's tools to
provide a better

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.737
experience for those markets.

00:01:39.737 --> 00:01:42.320
One of the biggest pain points
we see in apps is getting users

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.944
to enter their credit
card information.

00:01:43.944 --> 00:01:45.695
Having that already
available to our users

00:01:45.695 --> 00:01:48.250
is a service that is
completely unparalleled.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.260
Last year, we grew our Android
sales by just short of 2000%.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.530
And over the past
three months, we've

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.760
increased sales by
just short of 500%.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.150
So we're showing really
explosive growth there,

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.780
and the numbers are
not slowing down.
