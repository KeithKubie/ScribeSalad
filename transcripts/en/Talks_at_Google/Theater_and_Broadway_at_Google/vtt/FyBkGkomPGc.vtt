00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.600
And I play one of the
princesses in this royal family

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.769
of Arcadia, Pamela.

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.560

No.

00:02:33.682 --> 00:02:33.925
TAYLOR IMAN JONES: No.

00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:34.410

Peppermint and I play

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.376
Pythio the Oracle in the show.

yeah, well, in person.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.664

Google all the time.

PEPPERMINT: Yes.

BONNIE MILLIGAN: I
don't know if that--

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.260
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Every time
you say it, we get $0.10,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.860
so keep saying--

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.045
TAYLOR IMAN JONES:

00:03:02.045 --> 00:03:02.260
MICHAEL SHAYAN: --it, perfect.

TAYLOR IMAN JONES:
--Google, Google, Google.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.760
MICHAEL SHAYAN: So this
show just gave me--

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.593
I mean, it really just
gave me so much life.

00:03:06.593 --> 00:03:11.130
And seeing you three onstage
is just, like, such a delight.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.060
Let's just start by talking
about these Broadway debuts.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.570
Peppermint, obviously,
you are making history

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.780
as the first out trans person
to originate a role on Broadway.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.280
Which is--

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.238
PEPPERMINT: A mouthful.

00:03:24.238 --> 00:03:25.784
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:25.784 --> 00:03:27.659
MICHAEL SHAYAN: I
practiced that beforehand--

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.960
PEPPERMINT: Oh yeah?

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.043
MICHAEL SHAYAN: --perfect.

00:03:29.043 --> 00:03:30.825
I mean, what's that like?

00:03:30.825 --> 00:03:32.450
How did you get
involved with the show?

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.482
And just, how does
it feel to be--

00:03:34.482 --> 00:03:35.940
PEPPERMINT: It's
a dream come true.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.790
I mean, to make your
Broadway debut is so--

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.970
I'm on cloud 900.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.450
And it's-- and you're right,
it is an historic moment.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.767
And I don't take that lightly.

00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:52.850
It just feels so great
that I have the opportunity

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.136
to audition and
actually, you know,

00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:59.840
the drag gods were in
the world-- in the room

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.590
when I auditioned.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.350
And I got the part.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.110
And initially, I was just
excited to be on Broadway,

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.110
but then I had a chance to
read more into the script,

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.700
and obviously, meet
the fabulous cast.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.320
And just the entire experience
has been great for me.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.709
And then I'm also
really happy that there

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.280
is this historic moment,
and not only my casting,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.410
but also in the character.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.027
And that's not
lost on me at all.

00:04:26.027 --> 00:04:28.610
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Yeah, tell me a
little bit about the character

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.820
and how you sort of
created this character.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.570
How do you interpret
the character Pythio?

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.710
PEPPERMINT: I didn't
create the character, but--

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.425
MICHAEL SHAYAN: You
know what I mean.

00:04:35.425 --> 00:04:37.628
No, I mean, like, how do you
create the character on stage.

00:04:37.628 --> 00:04:38.919
PEPPERMINT: Oh, OK, originate--

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.084
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Originate.

00:04:41.084 --> 00:04:42.500
PEPPERMINT: Well,
the character is

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.790
Pythio who is the Oracle of
Delphi, who has, for those who

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.610
come to see the show, a
few different connections

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.620
to each cast member in the show.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.160
And I guess it's important
to say that this show is

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.380
essentially about a
family on the run,

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.640
on a journey of self-discovery,
to say it very quickly.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.430
And so the Oracle is
instrumental in that,

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.590
and gives some key prophecies
that are kind of dooming.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:19.550
And so the Oracle themselves
identify as gender non-binary.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.480
And so that's, I think, an
historic moment as well.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.790
I've never heard of
any Broadway characters

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.330
self-expressing as non-binary.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:35.620
And so getting into the
role, I mean, luckily

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.740
the non-binary part of it
is not very daunting for me,

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.970
just, obviously having dealt
with my own issues of gender

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.650
and kind of exploring
that myself.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.800
But on top of it,
there's something kind

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.280
of mythical and mystical
about my character

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.070
in a very positive way.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.140
And they're very empowered.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.570
And they're very
powerful and in control

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.320
at every moment in the
show, which is, I think,

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.480
rare a lot of times
for queer folk,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.660
and especially
gender-non-conforming folk who

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.260
are oftentimes the butt of
the joke, killed off way too

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.320
soon, or just like
this mythical being,

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.270
like a unicorn, which is lovely,
but we're more than that,

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.770
obviously.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:24.140
So it's great to have kind
of a full circle moment.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.970
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Yeah,
beautiful, I mean,

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.424
we will talk about
representation,

00:06:27.424 --> 00:06:28.340
because I think it's--

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.400
I mean, on one level, just
seeing the three of you here

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.370
on this stage, just such fierce
and talented gor-- you know,

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.040
amazing--

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.220
PEPPERMINT: What?

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.553
Did you just say gorgeous, what?

00:06:37.553 --> 00:06:38.415
Oh my god.

00:06:38.415 --> 00:06:40.040
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Six
pages of it, honey.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.190
PEPPERMINT: OK.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.380
MICHAEL SHAYAN: OK?

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.030
PEPPERMINT: Do you get paid
every time you say gorgeous?

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:43.331
TAYLOR IMAN JONES: Yes!

00:06:43.331 --> 00:06:43.934
PEPPERMINT: Gorgeous, gorgeous.

00:06:43.934 --> 00:06:45.027
TAYLOR IMAN JONES: Gorgeous,
gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous.

00:06:45.027 --> 00:06:46.485
MICHAEL SHAYAN:
Gorgeous, gorgeous.

00:06:48.726 --> 00:06:50.840
So representation on
that level, I think,

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.420
is just, like, really beautiful.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.790
Bonnie, we've talked
about representation

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.895
as a person of size.

00:06:56.895 --> 00:06:57.220
BONNIE MILLIGAN: Yes.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.511
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Can you talk
about your song Beautiful?

00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:02.010
BONNIE MILLIGAN: Well, I get
to be the beautiful princess.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.300
And everybody onstage
agrees and says, yes.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.940
Like, I'm not a butt of a joke,
which is sadly revolutionary.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.162
TAYLOR IMAN JONES: She's the
most beautiful princess--

00:07:09.162 --> 00:07:09.690
BONNIE MILLIGAN:
The most beautiful.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.315
TAYLOR IMAN JONES:
--in the whole land.

00:07:11.315 --> 00:07:14.900
BONNIE MILLIGAN: And I have
a love story, spoiler alert,

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.950
with Taylor.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.450
And it is something that--

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.310
you don't get to see
plus size people,

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.120
A, be on stage without
being, like, I don't know,

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.670
explained why you're there
in some kind of way with,

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.160
like, well, she's struggling
through her self-worth,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.997
or some kind of fat
joke, or something.

00:07:32.997 --> 00:07:33.830
It's just not there.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.180
And you have like, "Hairspray,"
which paved the way,

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.200
but it was about her
size and overcoming it.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.650
And "Margaritaville,"
there are different things

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:42.770
we talk about the size.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.590
And this is the first time, I
think, in a Broadway musical,

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.600
where you have a
plus-sized woman

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.637
being the beautiful girl on
stage, and having a love story,

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:51.470
and falling in love.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.840
And it actually-- the
lesbian love story

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.890
is just filled with
joy and discovery.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.600
And we embrace it.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.670
And everyone onstage
embraces us, which

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.140
is also sadly revolutionary.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.630
So I love representing all
that and giving more voice

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.080
to lots of people.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.580
MICHAEL SHAYAN:
Yeah, I mean, what I

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.790
love about the show is that
it takes these sort of tropes,

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.880
you know Elizabethan
language and characters

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.950
from the 14th the 15th
century, and queers them,

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:23.510
and in a very hilarious
and smart way.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.290
But like, it is looking at the
show-- it's a very queer show.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.120
And there's queer love,
which I think is beautiful,

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.370
Taylor, looking at you, like--

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:32.536
TAYLOR IMAN JONES: Oh, yeah?

00:08:32.536 --> 00:08:33.470
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Yeah.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.053
You know, just talk
to me a little bit

00:08:35.053 --> 00:08:38.279
about the love
stories in the show.

00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:39.820
And like, what does
that mean to have

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.370
a queer love story
represented on Broadway,

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:44.810
and many queer love stories?

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.640
Like, what's that
like for all of you?

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.990
TAYLOR IMAN JONES: I think
one of the coolest things

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.240
about our show is there
are many love stories.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.350
And none of them are
really gender based at all.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.830
Like, everyone's in
love with someone else.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.230
And they either find out
it's not what they expected,

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:01.640
or it is what they expected.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.760
Or they don't care whether it
was what they expected or not.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.750
And I think that's what we-- we
have a character who's dressed

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.100
in drag for a lot of the show.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.360
He's a male dressed as a female,
but the King and Queen both

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.910
find themselves
attracted to this person.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.830
And along with
the young princess

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.600
is attracted to this person
no matter who they are.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.465
And I think that's
really important,

00:09:23.465 --> 00:09:25.790
and it feels so cool
to be a part of,

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:29.155
and to get to share that with
everyone, and like you said,

00:09:29.155 --> 00:09:32.400
have people are at the stage
door see themselves on stage,

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.400
finally, in a positive--

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.566
BONNIE MILLIGAN: Celebrated.

00:09:34.566 --> 00:09:35.858
TAYLOR IMAN JONES: --way, yeah.

00:09:35.858 --> 00:09:37.899
MICHAEL SHAYAN: I want to
ask about the reactions

00:09:37.899 --> 00:09:38.450
to the show.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:39.950
Peppermint, obviously,
hello, Season

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.780
9 of "RuPaul's Drag Race,"
which you were, you know--

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.110
PEPPERMINT: Season 9 runner-up
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:46.994
TAYLOR IMAN JONES: Queen to us.

00:09:46.994 --> 00:09:52.010
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Yes, is there a
crossover in the audiences of--

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.660
do you see a lot of Drag
Race fans coming to the show?

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.660
PEPPERMINT: There must--

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:55.910
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Clearly.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:56.570
PEPPERMINT: I think so.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:57.445
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Yeah.

00:09:57.445 --> 00:10:00.560
PEPPERMINT: Yeah, Drag
Race is so mainstream now.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.060
So there's definitely people,
especially at the stage door

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.800
which is really the opportunity
to meet people who obviously

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.980
have seen the show and hear
what they have to express,

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.140
and a lot of them say, I
watched you on Season 9.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.700
And now I'm getting to see
you here, which is great.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.640
So yeah, Drag Race is a
nice little intersection.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.400
MICHAEL SHAYAN: When I saw the
show, Sasha Velour was there--

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:22.900
BONNIE MILLIGAN: What?

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:23.265
PEPPERMINT: Oh, yeah.

00:10:23.265 --> 00:10:25.098
MICHAEL SHAYAN: --right
in front of us, yes.

00:10:25.098 --> 00:10:27.027
Have other Drag Race
sisters of yours come--

00:10:27.027 --> 00:10:27.735
PEPPERMINT: Yeah.

00:10:27.735 --> 00:10:28.180
MICHAEL SHAYAN: --come through?

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.930
PEPPERMINT: Yeah, and a
whole bunch more are coming--

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:30.290
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Oh.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.360
PEPPERMINT: --this-- I think
Drag Con is coming up--

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:32.690
BONNIE MILLIGAN: Oh yeah.

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.520
PEPPERMINT: So there's
going to be plenty.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.415
But yeah, Sasha was
there, Bob the Drag Queen.

00:10:38.415 --> 00:10:39.665
Thorgy Thor was here recently.

00:10:39.665 --> 00:10:40.780
TAYLOR IMAN JONES: Yeah, Carmen.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.071
PEPPERMINT: Yeah, they've all--

00:10:42.071 --> 00:10:43.900
Carmen, yeah, they've
all come to support--

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:44.900
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Oh, wow.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:45.740
PEPPERMINT: --and
hopefully enjoy.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.755
TAYLOR IMAN JONES: Which
is super great for us.

00:10:47.755 --> 00:10:49.541
Super great for us.

00:10:49.541 --> 00:10:52.040
MICHAEL SHAYAN: I think this
is a good time to take a pause.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:52.340
Thank you--

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:52.850
BONNIE MILLIGAN: Thank you.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:53.255
TAYLOR IMAN JONES: Thank You.

00:10:53.255 --> 00:10:54.800
MICHAEL SHAYAN: --Taylor
and Bonnie for joining us.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.690
They will be back at
the end of the show

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.891
to treat you guys to a--

00:10:58.891 --> 00:10:59.890
PEPPERMINT: To kill you.

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.689
MICHAEL SHAYAN:
Yeah, to kill you.

00:11:01.689 --> 00:11:02.980
PEPPERMINT: With their voices--

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.210
I shouldn't have said that.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.150
Hi, security.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:06.860
BONNIE MILLIGAN: No, no, no.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:07.820
MICHAEL SHAYAN: To
slay you, perfect.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:08.030
PEPPERMINT: Yes.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.300
TAYLOR IMAN JONES: Yes.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:08.970
PEPPERMINT: Yeah.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:09.465
TAYLOR IMAN JONES:
With our voices.

00:11:09.465 --> 00:11:11.612
MICHAEL SHAYAN: So I
want to invite up--

00:11:11.612 --> 00:11:12.695
thank you, thank you both.

00:11:12.695 --> 00:11:13.582
TAYLOR IMAN JONES:
Yeah, thank you.

00:11:13.582 --> 00:11:13.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.335
MICHAEL SHAYAN:
Give them a hand.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.300
It's my pleasure and
honor to invite up

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.220
a number of leaders
and activists

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:30.110
from our community to have
a discussion about exactly

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.780
what we're talking about,
representation, identity.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:39.100
So please give a big, big
Google welcome to Rain Dove,

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:43.240
to Chase Strangio,
and Geena Rocero.

00:11:50.488 --> 00:11:53.250
Yes, perfect, so
just to quickly give

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:55.880
bios, and then I want
to hear from all of you.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.970
Rain, you were just on
the cover of Vogue Italia?

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:58.630
RAIN DOVE: Mhm.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.540
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Amazing,
we will talk about that.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.060
And you're a model, a
longtime model in New York?

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.180
RAIN DOVE: Mhm.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.300
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Chase,
you are at the ACLU.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.280
You are the first
out trans person,

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.374
first out trans attorney
the ACLU, is that right?

00:12:13.374 --> 00:12:15.040
CHASE STRANGIO: I
mean, that we know of.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.400
MICHAEL SHAYAN: That we know.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.210
CHASE STRANGIO: Sure, Yeah.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.480
MICHAEL SHAYAN: OK, great.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.932
And Geena-- hey, Geena.

00:12:18.932 --> 00:12:20.329
GEENA ROCERO: Hi.

00:12:20.329 --> 00:12:22.120
MICHAEL SHAYAN: You're
a model, a producer,

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.368
and founder of media
advocacy group Gender Proud.

00:12:25.368 --> 00:12:27.284
One more big hand for
all of our [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:27.284 --> 00:12:28.236
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:28.512 --> 00:12:29.220
PEPPERMINT: Yeah!

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.053
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Yes.

00:12:30.053 --> 00:12:33.669
RAIN DOVE: And for
you, and for you.

00:12:33.669 --> 00:12:35.210
MICHAEL SHAYAN: So
we've sort of been

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.670
talking a little
bit about identity,

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.050
and sort of representation.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:44.120
And I want to sort of open
by posing to the group here,

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.605
like, how does your identity
show up in your art?

00:12:47.605 --> 00:12:50.139
Can we talk a little bit about--
and you talked a little bit

00:12:50.139 --> 00:12:51.680
about this as, like,
but I would love

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.560
to hear you talk more
about, does your identity

00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:02.120
as a trans woman inform your
identity as a performer?

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.260
Let's start there.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.725
PEPPERMINT: Yeah, for
a long time my drag--

00:13:07.725 --> 00:13:09.350
I've been working in
New York as a drag

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.650
queen for 20-something years.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.200
Most of that time
was before I had

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.090
really medically
transitioned, or even,

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:23.030
like, mentally transitioned.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:27.950
And so for the longest time,
expressing myself as Peppermint

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:33.860
the queen was the only access
that I had to people affirming

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.620
this feminine,
female, this womanly

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.480
identity that I created.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:43.970
And so my drag character
persona is really

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:48.232
just my trans identity,
kind of heightened.

00:13:48.232 --> 00:13:49.940
And for a longest
time, that's all I had,

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:57.350
until eventually I was able
to wrap my head around more

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.740
and able to kind of, I don't
want to say separate the two,

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.700
but really cement my own
identity, my own self,

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:07.640
everyday, as a trans woman.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.140
All the while I
kind of transitioned

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.770
underneath my drag persona.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.990
So she, Peppermint
the drag queen

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:18.440
kind of protected me from
people judging me about,

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.990
why am I wearing this
clothing, or why do you still

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:23.060
have makeup on, and are
you going to a show,

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:27.140
and all these are questions
that I would sometimes get.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:31.250
And also, for myself, it
allowed me kind of this space

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.250
to see me as I had--

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.440
to create myself, which I
had already done as a queen.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:44.390
And so yeah, my art, my
first art, which is my drag--

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:48.350
and I still work
as a drag queen--

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:53.932
definitely is 100% made up of
everything that's Peppermint.

00:14:53.932 --> 00:14:57.871
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Oh, wow,
so do you think that--

00:14:57.871 --> 00:14:59.370
I'm just interested
in this idea of,

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:04.452
like, you're using your drag as
a protection and as a shield.

00:15:04.452 --> 00:15:05.910
Was that a conscious
thing for you?

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:08.340
Like, were you aware of
that while it was happening?

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:08.655
PEPPERMINT: Oh, yeah.

00:15:08.655 --> 00:15:09.446
MICHAEL SHAYAN: OK.

00:15:09.446 --> 00:15:12.190
PEPPERMINT: I mean,
yeah, in many ways.

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:14.190
I mean, I knew
that I wanted to--

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:15.030
I felt fabulous.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:20.730
And I wanted to wear
these women's clothing,

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:21.900
and strut my stuff.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.930
And obviously, you know, I have
a joy and love of performing,

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.900
so drag was the
perfect calling for me.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.550
And there really wasn't any--

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.850
there weren't any other realms.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:32.370
There was no other
Broadway roles

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:34.320
that were being written
that were supportive

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.510
of trans identities or even
gender nonconforming anything,

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:43.170
really, in my
experience, especially

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:46.065
as a black person auditioning.

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:53.440
It was pretty shallow
and narrow, I should say.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.246
So I created this drag persona
to kind of include everything

00:15:57.246 --> 00:15:58.370
that I always wanted to be.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:03.510
And I knew that, for me, the
kind of fantasy of Peppermint

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.660
the drag queen was just
everything I always just wanted

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.370
to be, how I want to be seen.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.600
And if I can't access
that in any other way,

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.740
then I'll do it onstage.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.060
And I'll get paid for it.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.440
And people are going to clap.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.006
And that's kind of what
I started it out as.

00:16:20.006 --> 00:16:21.750
MICHAEL SHAYAN:
Wow-- yeah, Geena?

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:23.291
GEENA ROCERO: I want
to add something

00:16:23.291 --> 00:16:26.200
about what Peppermint was
saying about protection,

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.070
and that persona, and creating
that whole identity for us

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:29.640
by us.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.250
Because it's more
than protection.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.270
It's survival, right?

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:34.860
I mean, for so long,
we really needed

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:39.720
to find our way for us to find
platforms for ourselves, for us

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.540
to express ourselves, and
to find those safe spaces.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.730
I mean, for me personally,
I was born and raised

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:45.840
in the Philippines.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.090
We have this culture in the
Philippines of transgender

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:51.960
beauty pageants that happens
during the most traditional

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.760
Catholic religion tradition.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.590
Irony is not lost on me.

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:58.140
But we did it.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:59.950
So it's part of our culture.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.040
So in a way, growing
up as a young person,

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:06.780
we needed to find those ways and
avenues to express ourselves.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.550
So these trans
beauty pageants that

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.380
happens all over
the Philippines,

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.060
you know, this is
how I first learned

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.770
about myself at 15 years old.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.920
This is how I first
learned how to really get

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.797
to know about who I
am and surround myself

00:17:18.797 --> 00:17:20.880
with the community that
loved me and supported me.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.950
And I found my chosen family.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.829
So just to build up
on that finding ways

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:28.230
to protect ourselves is
also a way to survive,

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:31.290
and also building off
to that as people,

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:34.024
as communities, to
thrive as a community.

00:17:34.024 --> 00:17:36.190
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Yeah, you
mentioned chosen families.

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:37.500
I just want to talk a
little bit about that.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.540
I mean there's this idea
in the queer community

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.030
that we, as queer
people, often get

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.590
to choose our families
and the people

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.000
that we surround ourselves with.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.458
Can you just talk
a little bit more

00:17:46.458 --> 00:17:47.750
about what that means for you?

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:49.800
And this is-- and
you know, Chase,

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.050
we'd love to hear from you
too about how this shows up

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.404
in your in your activism
and your legal work.

00:17:55.404 --> 00:17:56.820
CHASE STRANGIO:
Yeah, I mean, just

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.770
going back to the
initial question

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:00.260
and thinking about,
well, what does

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.970
it mean to show up as
ourselves in our art,

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:09.344
to sort of be a disruption of
the expectations that are often

00:18:09.344 --> 00:18:11.760
imposed on us-- and so I sort
of like the idea of thinking

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.030
about law as art,
because we're narrative

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.780
storytellers as lawyers.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.750
The work that we're doing is
always engaging with culture.

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:22.500
And so if you take me
showing up in my body

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:26.850
and being public about
that, making it visible--

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.860
you know, I was assigned
female at birth.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:32.160
I don't have a very masculine,
traditionally masculine

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.660
presentation in the
courtroom or anywhere else.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.410
And that is very
much a disruption

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.230
to the gender-normative
structures in the courtroom

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:41.410
and in the law.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:45.750
And I think the law doesn't
really allow for nuance.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.630
It tries to box
people into binaries.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.460
It tries to tell
people that they

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:54.600
can't live intersectional,
nuanced, complex lives.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.300
And so if we cede that
terrain to our opponents,

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.180
to the legal
structure, then we're

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.680
never going to make
space for people

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.290
to survive and step
into their existence.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:08.400
And we have to be really careful
about, especially in sort

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.800
of conservative and
repressive political climates,

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.890
really giving up on the
idea that we have the power

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:16.710
to tell our own stories in
all the different places

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:17.820
that we show up.

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.760
And naming our bodies
and naming our truth

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.230
is, in and of
itself, a disruption

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:24.950
that is dangerous
for many people,

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:26.700
particularly people
of color, particularly

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.560
people who don't live
in binaries, people

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.050
who are bisexual, people
who are non-binary,

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:34.950
people who are people of
color, whose existence is

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:37.920
a threat to the power
structures that exist.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.460
You know, it is
imperative that we

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:44.460
name the complexities
of our lives

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:48.420
and step into spaces where we're
not expected and allowed to be.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.520
And so that's how
I try, as a lawyer,

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:54.960
to walk into the courtroom and
to tell stories of my clients

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.440
and myself so that
we aren't erased

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:02.080
from the power structures that
try very hard to erase people.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.538
MICHAEL SHAYAN:
Yeah, I want-- yes.

00:20:03.538 --> 00:20:04.038
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:04.038 --> 00:20:05.194
RAIN DOVE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:06.378 --> 00:20:07.086
That was amazing.

00:20:07.086 --> 00:20:09.460
CHASE STRANGIO: Thanks.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.720
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Yeah, I
mean, I totally hear you.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.370
And I think just on that sort
of piece of naming, and claiming

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.860
your own identity
and personhood--

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.950
like, Rain, I heard
you in an interview,

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:23.826
you said you identify
as gender non-believing.

00:20:23.826 --> 00:20:26.410
RAIN DOVE: Oh no, it's
not gender non-believing.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:29.710
My identity is, I am I. So
I don't have any language.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:33.160
I allow other people to use
whatever they feel is fit.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.870
You know, we're
born into language.

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:38.320
And that language is tailored
to each person, specifically.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.970
It's a unique experience.

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:41.440
In order for
language to work, you

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.160
have to have an understanding
of the history of the sound.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.590
And if I said the
color red right now,

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:50.330
I guarantee everyone has a
different shade in their head.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:53.590
So I don't police other
people's language for me.

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:56.920
When people-- like, I always
say a pronoun is just a sound.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.940
And all I'm listening for
in that sound is positivity.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.910
So you can use she,
he, it, one, they.

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:06.770
Whatever you want to use
for me is appropriate.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:08.620
However, for some
people-- like, for me,

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.030
that's ultimate freedom.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:11.950
I'm in this little
flesh-bound thing.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.870
We don't look like ants.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.892
And even ants look different
under a microscope.

00:21:15.892 --> 00:21:17.350
So why are we
comparing each other?

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:18.808
Why are we homogenizing
each other?

00:21:18.808 --> 00:21:20.480
It doesn't make any sense to me.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.810
However, for some people,
finding their identity,

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:24.520
and having that
label, and having

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.624
that kind of stability in that
thing, it's their freedom.

00:21:28.624 --> 00:21:30.790
Because they had to give
up so much, their families,

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:35.500
their careers, their lives,
maybe even lives of others,

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.760
in order to be able
to say, this history,

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.280
this history of this word is
a thing that I want to be.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.120
So I don't police the way other
people identify themselves

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:46.820
either.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:50.000
And I don't see other people
as imprisoning themselves.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.810
In my work, I talk about gender
as, like, gender capitalism,

00:21:55.810 --> 00:22:00.170
the idea that we've weaponized
this division in society,

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:04.090
he and she, as something that
you can capitalize on and make

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:06.190
money off from,
and sometimes even

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:07.940
have advantages given to you.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.240
So a lot of my art actually
goes around comparative photo.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.080
So I just [INAUDIBLE]
did an experiment

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.550
with domestic violence.

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:17.860
I went on to the New
York City subway trains.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.730
And I presented as societally
very masculine, and then

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.140
societally very feminine.

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.922
And then I had two
other people with me.

00:22:26.922 --> 00:22:28.630
And we yelled at each
other on the train,

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:31.180
culminating in a
slap across the face.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.190
When people perceived
that there was

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:36.670
a female yelling at a
male, they'd be like, girl,

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:37.570
you get that guy.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:38.380
You get him.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.140
You get him.

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.490
Oh boy, you're in trouble.

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:43.450
But the minute that
guy raised his voice,

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:45.520
people would literally grab me.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.900
They would grab me.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.040
They'd sometimes--
they would even hit me.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.440
And we have a couple of times
where somebody was like, bro,

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.356
you need to chill out.

00:22:51.356 --> 00:22:53.350
And they hit me.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.630
And when I did it where it
looked like the same two

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.690
genders by societal perception
of what is male and female,

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.900
people just took out their
cell phones and recorded.

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.280
And it made it very
clear that it is actually

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:08.020
more advantageous to be a female
in a public situation in which

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.730
you are, you know,
you need help.

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:13.270
Whereas, if you're
a male, people

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:15.160
tend to sit back
a little bit more.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.712
And with same-sex or
same-gender presentation,

00:23:18.712 --> 00:23:20.170
we just don't have
enough education

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:21.670
to be able to
identify when somebody

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:23.140
is being abused at all.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.003
People just didn't
know what to do.

00:23:25.003 --> 00:23:27.370
So I mean, that's the
kind of experiment I do.

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:28.450
I take, like, the videos.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.040
I show side by side.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.020
It's just, I was
born into this body,

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.540
but by identifying
with one or the other,

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.150
why do I deserve less?

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:42.640
Why do I deserve less because
I might have more here,

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.540
or I definitely have more here?

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:48.237
You know, it doesn't
make any sense to me.

00:23:48.237 --> 00:23:49.820
MICHAEL SHAYAN:
What's your experience

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.190
been in modeling and in fashion?

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:57.910
What's that space
been like for you

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:00.940
as you've been sort of in
the community for years?

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.250
Like, how did you sort
of enter it, navigate it?

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.415
And how does it sort of
play out for you now?

00:24:06.415 --> 00:24:08.540
RAIN DOVE: So basically,
in the modeling industry--

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.660
it's one of the few industries
in which men make more--

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:14.870
make less than women, by far.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:18.596
And I model as everything,
whatever you put me in.

00:24:18.596 --> 00:24:21.850
In the industry,
I find that there

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:25.530
is a lot more protection for
women for sexual harassment.

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:30.280
So when I do
male-perceived jobs--

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:30.950
is there water?

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:31.450
[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:32.930
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Yeah.

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:34.440
RAIN DOVE: Sorry about that.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.794
But when I do
male-perceived jobs,

00:24:36.794 --> 00:24:38.960
I tend to find that people
want me to take off more.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.400
They want me to expose more.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.470
And for male portfolios,
actually, there's

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.012
a lot more nudity,
but it's something

00:24:44.012 --> 00:24:46.345
we don't talk about, because
men are supposed to be more

00:24:46.345 --> 00:24:47.600
comfortable with their bodies.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.230
And men are supposed to be able
to stand up for themselves.

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:53.930
However, with a lot of the women
stuff, the clothing that they

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:55.940
want you to wear, the
garments, even the heels

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.130
can be absolutely
crippling and damaging.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:00.080
And it's so brutal.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.750
You walk into a room,
people will flat out say,

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:03.960
you're fucking ugly.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.400
Why did you even come here?

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.430
This is the women's casting.

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:10.070
Come here when you pick a team.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:13.040
And the women are very
competitive with each other.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.030
So they tend to put you down
a lot behind the scenes,

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:18.660
because it is so intense.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.004
So the women, they're hungry.

00:25:20.004 --> 00:25:21.170
They're told to lose weight.

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:22.880
I'm actually up right now for--

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.680
I just really got the
Louis Vuitton runway

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.980
show in campaign.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:26.480
But--

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:27.510
Oh, than, you.

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:28.370
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Yes.

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.286
RAIN DOVE: I'm very excited.

00:25:30.286 --> 00:25:31.910
But it turns out it's
the women's show.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:36.185
And they want me to lose 15
pounds before September 5th.

00:25:36.185 --> 00:25:37.810
PEPPERMINT: Don't
drink any more water.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.290
RAIN DOVE: I've lost six total.

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:48.470
And that's as far
as I'm going to go.

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:50.648
And they can fuck off.

00:25:50.648 --> 00:25:52.592
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:53.564 --> 00:25:56.090
But, yeah, I mean, I was
going to say, I really wanted

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:57.840
to, like, point out
Geena, because I mean,

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.700
Geena, you've been in
this industry a lot too.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.065
And you know,
like, it's intense.

00:26:01.065 --> 00:26:01.395
It's brutal.

00:26:01.395 --> 00:26:03.690
GEENA ROCERO: Yeah, no, I
wanted to just put context

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:05.340
to what Rain was talking about.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.560
It's important to
understand also

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.120
what had happened for so long.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:13.920
I mean, personally, I now
produce documentaries, web

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.520
series, and stories that center
the narratives of the most

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.710
marginalized in our
community, specifically,

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:22.110
trans women of color,
especially created

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:23.430
by a trans woman of color.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.440
For me, that was very
important, very critical,

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.562
both for representation and
the nuanced storytelling.

00:26:29.562 --> 00:26:31.270
I was born and raised
in the Philippines.

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:35.790
And I moved to New York
in 2005 to pursue my dream

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:37.140
to be a model.

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:41.560
And in 2005, there is not an out
trans-identified fashion model.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.430
So it's important to have the
context that we're having now.

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:47.220
For so many people, when
they see what's happening now

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:51.090
in fashion, gender non-binary,
gender fluid, all that stuff,

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:53.640
like, that was not the
case three years ago,

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.080
four years ago.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.780
So when I moved in
New York City in 2005,

00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.355
I made the decision to not
share to my model agent

00:27:00.355 --> 00:27:04.140
that I'm trans, acknowledging
the degree of privilege

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.250
around that.

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:07.950
Because for so long,
I've had this--

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.455
there's many women,
pioneers who came

00:27:10.455 --> 00:27:13.170
before me, women like Tracey
African Norman, Caroline

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:15.870
Cossey, Lauren
Foster, and many women

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:18.930
who paved the way for me
as a transgender model,

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:22.110
that when they got found
out, their careers basically

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:23.400
disappeared.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.190
So in a way, they
were both a sense

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.920
of possibility of what
could happen for me,

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.830
but also a sense of fear,
that like, oh, if I actually

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:34.620
come out, that's what's
going to happen to me.

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.192
So I was working as a
model for about 10 years.

00:27:37.192 --> 00:27:39.150
And you know, I was
working, doing commercials,

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:40.205
cover of magazines.

00:27:40.205 --> 00:27:41.580
But every time I
would go home, I

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.010
would always feel so
scared and so paranoid

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:45.982
that, oh, the "New
York Post" page six

00:27:45.982 --> 00:27:47.190
will find out that I'm trans.

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:50.020
My career would be over, so
I was living in paranoia.

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.140
So a lot of,
obviously, things that

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.840
has changed when it comes
to media representation.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.900
But after almost 10 years of
doing that, I've had enough.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:01.170
So I made the decision to
take ownership of my story.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:04.480
I wanted to tell the world
and come out to the world.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:08.070
So I decided to come out
in a TED Talk in 2014.

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:12.210
And even just 2014 to
2018, so much has happened.

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:15.000
I feel like it
feels so long ago,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.630
because all of a sudden,
this conversation of gender--

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:22.930
"Time Magazine," Laverne Cox,
what we see on media right now,

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:25.590
"Pose" being written,
created, starred

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.170
by trans people of color,
centering the narrative.

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:29.760
So much has happened.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.250
So it's important to
understand the context in which

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:33.700
where we're at right now.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.071
Certainly, there's so much
more that needs to be done.

00:28:36.071 --> 00:28:38.070
But it's important to
understand that there's so

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:39.930
many people, especially
the pioneers, who

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:43.793
suffered basically for paving
the way for so many people.

00:28:43.793 --> 00:28:44.560
RAIN DOVE: Yeah.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.707
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Yeah.

00:28:45.707 --> 00:28:47.040
I want to talk about coming out.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.460
And your TED talk, Geena, I
think is really beautiful.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:51.090
Everyone should go watch it.

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:54.090
It was titled, "Why
I must come out."

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:58.900
And something about that word
"must" just sort of struck me.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:28:59.400
So--

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.630
GEENA ROCERO: I didn't
title that talk by the way.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:01.457
MICHAEL SHAYAN: OK.

00:29:01.457 --> 00:29:03.540
GEENA ROCERO: So it's
important to even have that.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:07.620
You know, but certainly, I now
have a different understanding

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.240
of this word coming out.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.990
You know, because what
does that really--

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:15.372
for me, growing up in the
Philippines, I knew I was.

00:29:15.372 --> 00:29:16.830
You know, I came
out to my mom when

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:19.710
I was wearing my t-shirt on
my head, telling my mom, mom,

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:20.430
this is my hair.

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:21.870
This is me coming out at 5.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:25.595
I came out again at 15,
started joining pageant.

00:29:25.595 --> 00:29:29.580
We want to have this nuanced
conversation about these words,

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.010
because we all deserve
that, you know,

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:33.930
to have those
conversations, especially

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.720
the cultural context in
which all of these things

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.160
kind of plays a part.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.790
Certainly in 2014, so
much was happening.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.547
I mean, Chase and
I, we're actually--

00:29:42.547 --> 00:29:44.130
we haven't seen each
other in a while,

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:46.380
but we were even just talking
about, when did we meet?

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.050
When did we actually-- and
we actually met around 2014.

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:52.920
Because a lot of things
are happening in 2014 as we

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:53.940
all could remember.

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.340
It's "Time Magazine"
said this tipping point.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.410
Obviously, that's
something to argue about.

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:02.055
But this word of coming out,
what does that really mean,

00:30:02.055 --> 00:30:02.555
right?

00:30:02.555 --> 00:30:03.600
CHASE STRANGIO:
Well, and also, just

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.880
to build off what Geena is
saying and what Rain said,

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.620
like, we all have
a responsibility

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:09.690
to understand that
gender is a system

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:10.980
that we're all complicit in.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:14.730
And it leaves some people
imperiled by the system.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.800
And others are
benefiting from it.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.570
But the very concept
of coming out

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:21.510
is predicated, first, on
an assumption of cis-ness

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:25.110
and an assumption of
mono-sexual identity.

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:30.710
If we're not calling
it the question of,

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:33.750
well, what are we of
deploying every day

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:37.560
as the signifiers of gender,
of the assumptions of sort

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.240
of a bodily coherence--

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.300
and even the "Head Over
Heels" plays on this,

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.730
because it assumes that, if
you hear the word vagina,

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:48.390
you think woman, you hear the
word penis, you think man.

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:50.550
But those are political
choices that we're

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:53.910
making that then situate
very particular bodies,

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:55.650
and in vulnerable ways.

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:57.810
And we have a responsibility
to unpack that.

00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:59.820
Because yes, a lot has
happened since 2014.

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:01.710
But I can tell you,
as a parent of a kid,

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:04.270
we're not doing a very good
job of dismantling gender.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:06.480
We're actually doing a
catastrophically terrible job.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.080
And we're all
responsible for that.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.230
So I think we should
really pay attention

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:14.090
to how our language assumes
things about other people,

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:15.840
both in terms of their
bodies and in terms

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:19.290
of their attractions to others,
and who is left out by that.

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:21.880
Because it really does have
life-or-death consequences.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.170
And I think we're all very much
responsible for building up

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:26.465
those systems.

00:31:26.465 --> 00:31:27.090
RAIN DOVE: Wow.

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:28.590
MICHAEL SHAYAN:
Yeah, I mean, I love

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:31.230
what you said about coming
out, and just sort of, like,

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:35.010
just taking that idea
and sort of turning it

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:36.330
on its head a little bit.

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:38.987
I'm interested, though,
how that sort of plays out

00:31:38.987 --> 00:31:39.570
in the public.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:42.000
I mean, Peppermint, you
came out-- you, sort of,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.359
came out very
publicly on Drag Race.

00:31:47.359 --> 00:31:49.650
I just want to understand,
what was your relationship--

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:51.720
what is your relationship
to coming out?

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.360
Let's start there.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.850
PEPPERMINT: Just as Geena
said, it's an ongoing process.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:03.070
It's something that you
do over and over again.

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:06.880
Because coming out,
really, is, for me, it's

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.940
just telling people more
information about myself that's

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:11.530
always existed.

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:14.410
And so just as Geena
said, there could

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:18.304
have been many moments where I
revealed something about myself

00:32:18.304 --> 00:32:20.470
that would have been very
telling about my identity,

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:24.430
whether I was a child,
or an adult, or what--

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:27.500
regardless of what
language I was using.

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.930
And so you know,
yeah, it's funny.

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:33.340
A lot of people
read, and people who

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:36.610
are fans of Drag Race who
hadn't known me personally

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:40.150
will say, oh, you came
out in 2016 as trans.

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:42.400
And for them, and I
guess for a lot of people

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:47.440
when you hear that, it means
that's when I transitioned,

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:51.490
realize personally
for myself who I was.

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.380
And that's not the case.

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:58.510
I've been living as a trans
woman publicly since 2012.

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:01.300
And I just wasn't on TV.

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.950
So yeah, I needed--

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:06.070
I felt the need to
have a conversation

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:10.210
with the people who were in
the room alone-- well, alone

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:10.760
with cameras.

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:15.040
And I didn't know
these humans, so I

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:18.010
wanted to talk to them
about my existence.

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:19.540
But it was more
than just me saying,

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:22.990
guys, I have something to
confess about my shame.

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.680
It wasn't that.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.140
It really was, in
the context, as Geena

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:31.950
was saying, of trans-ness and
how it meets, and intersects,

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:37.176
and supports drag,
and always has.

00:33:37.176 --> 00:33:38.550
Far too many times,
there's a lot

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:40.500
of people who-- just
as Rain was saying,

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.900
people want you
to make a choice.

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:45.000
You know, are you trans
or are you a drag queen?

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.980
Tell us which one so we'll know.

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:50.940
And, A, it's none of their
business, but B, it's--

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:53.580
you know, I don't see
the two as incongruent.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:54.090
It's a job.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:55.050
I'm a woman.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:56.199
And I have a job.

00:33:56.199 --> 00:33:58.240
Why do I have to choose
between those two things?

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.780
And so you know, that's--

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:05.220
the coming out thing has
always been an interesting kind

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.150
of language.

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:08.969
Because I always feel the need
to qualify and explain it.

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:11.400
Like, yeah, I came out
on "RuPaul's Drag Race,"

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.850
but you should know,
that's not really what it--

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:15.000
I didn't come out.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:15.840
I did, but I didn't.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:16.674
So it's complicated.

00:34:16.674 --> 00:34:18.423
GEENA ROCERO: I think
there's a sense of--

00:34:18.423 --> 00:34:20.150
I think the word
that's the through line

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:21.594
is sense of ownership, right?

00:34:21.594 --> 00:34:22.260
PEPPERMINT: Mhm.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.690
GEENA ROCERO: Because when we
talk about media, and media

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:26.820
that's being created,
whether it's in a Broadway

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.946
show, or a TV series,
or anything, a web

00:34:29.946 --> 00:34:31.320
series, whatever
that is, there's

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.650
a sense of ownership that,
like, when trans people declare

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:36.934
ourselves, initially
the reaction

00:34:36.934 --> 00:34:40.110
is like that you have to even
validate yourself even more.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:42.840
You know, like you're not
believed that you are this.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.900
Because for so long,
especially American media,

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:49.770
it's predicated
upon this thing of,

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:52.937
you don't own that identity,
because people were not

00:34:52.937 --> 00:34:53.520
exposed to it.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.400
Can you believe like, I found
this out about two months ago.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.950
Jerry Springer
was just canceled.

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:01.242
So it's been on for that long.

00:35:01.242 --> 00:35:02.538
MICHAEL SHAYAN: It's still on?

00:35:02.538 --> 00:35:03.402
GEENA ROCERO: Isn't that crazy?

00:35:03.402 --> 00:35:05.550
So I was born and raised
in the Philippines.

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:08.880
When I moved to the US--

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.179
we had transgender beauty
pageants on national TV

00:35:11.179 --> 00:35:11.970
in the Philippines.

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:13.257
It doesn't mean it makes it--

00:35:13.257 --> 00:35:15.340
you know, it's such a
progressive, accepted place.

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:15.840
But

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:18.390
We have this very mainstream
media representation

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:20.250
where people go to church.

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:20.850
They go home.

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:23.280
They watch the trans
beauty pageant.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.189
That's what they did.

00:35:24.189 --> 00:35:24.980
That's what we did.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:26.580
But then when they
move to the US,

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:29.280
the first representation that
I saw on mainstream media

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.688
was Jerry Springer, which is
all about, like, you're this,

00:35:32.688 --> 00:35:36.150
you're horrible this, a man,
woman I was just like, whoa.

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:37.830
And for so long,
American media is

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:42.000
predicated upon that, that we
don't own about our identity.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.740
So all these things
that we're always

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.790
having to validate
ourselves is because

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:48.150
of this thing of ownership.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:50.730
Obviously, here, we're
speaking about it

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:52.920
because we are who we are.

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.380
You know, we don't
need to go deeper into,

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.330
yes, we're educating,
but we don't

00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:00.980
need to go to validate ourselves
that we are this human being.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:02.970
Obviously we are.

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:04.800
But you know, I
think that it's--

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.884
I think a lot of the
things in representation

00:36:06.884 --> 00:36:08.550
that's happening right
now, whether it's

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:10.020
in Hollywood,
whether it's, like,

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.080
who gets to produce
stories about trans people,

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.000
documentaries
about trans people,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.900
or, like, who gets to play a
role, trans roles in Hollywood,

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:21.650
in any of these content
that we're seeing.

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:23.850
So obviously, there's
a lot more to go,

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:26.010
but the nuanced
conversation is everything.

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:29.370
But certainly, as someone who
produces content and stories,

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:31.950
you know there's a big
difference when there's

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:34.260
a trans person or gender
non-conforming people

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:37.670
behind, not just in front of the
camera, but behind the scenes.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:40.440
I mean recently, Rain
was part of a documentary

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.800
that I did with Logo and
VH1 about the history

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.630
of transgender models.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:49.140
When I was doing that project
as an executive producer,

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.850
I couldn't believe
that I was doing that.

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:53.260
Because for so long,
the representation--

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:56.880
I got to invite Tracey
Africa Norman, Lauren Foster,

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.700
Crimsona Kaiser-- these are the
woman that I mentioned before

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.590
that paved the way for me--

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:03.510
and sort of bring them
to the conversation,

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:07.950
and give them that space of
ownership about their stories

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:10.840
that, for so long, they were
denied, because they got

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.310
"outed."

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:14.274
That was the media
landscape for so long.

00:37:14.274 --> 00:37:16.440
So I think this sense of
ownership about who we are,

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.920
or our abilities,
or our talent--

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.830
it's important to
understand that.

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:23.055
RAIN DOVE: I would like to
build on that a little bit

00:37:23.055 --> 00:37:23.574
if I might.

00:37:23.574 --> 00:37:24.240
Is that a thing?

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.073
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Yes,
you should build on it.

00:37:26.073 --> 00:37:28.080
We just want to open
it up to questions,

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:31.230
so if you have questions, from
the audience, please line up

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:33.039
at one of the mics
on either side.

00:37:33.039 --> 00:37:33.830
Sorry to interrupt.

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:35.079
RAIN DOVE: No, of course--

00:37:35.079 --> 00:37:36.870
yeah, so, I mean, first
of all, I was like,

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:37.911
am I supposed to be here?

00:37:37.911 --> 00:37:39.390
Because I don't
identify as trans.

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:41.490
However, a lot of
times, people who

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:44.400
fall within the
non-binary spectrum

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.930
are seen as people within
the trans community.

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:49.050
But I do experience
a lot of transphobia.

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:52.850
And it was a really important
thing, I think, that you did.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:55.240
It was really amazing.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:58.140
I just want to build on the idea
of people behind the camera.

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:01.440
Right now, I just want to
put a big, like, warning out

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.320
to everyone.

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.900
There are a lot
of advertisements.

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.500
It is popular to have diversity
in your ads right now.

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.970
But just because you
see diversity in the ads

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:10.860
doesn't mean that they're
doing good things.

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.570
You really have to
research the products

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:14.700
that you're buying,
because you might say,

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.170
what I'm buying isn't
just a great product.

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:18.870
It's also making me
feel good because I

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:24.060
see Rain, or Geena, or
Peppermint on these like ads.

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.250
But they still support
animal testing.

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:28.460
They still support
factory sweatshop labor.

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:29.660
They still use palm oil.

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:32.510
They still use things that
deforest the rain forest.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:36.260
People are trying to use our
anguish, our frustration,

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.900
our marginalization in
the feel-good Cinderella

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:42.530
story, that someone finally
sees us, to sell us something.

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:46.010
That is a beauty product
that has ugly practices.

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:47.760
And I really do want
to encourage you all,

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.551
like, if you take
something away from this,

00:38:49.551 --> 00:38:51.442
it's to just continue
to educate yourself

00:38:51.442 --> 00:38:52.400
and really do the work.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.941
There are some really
great apps that

00:38:53.941 --> 00:38:56.030
can scan the barcode
or even, like,

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:57.674
the UPC code on all products.

00:38:57.674 --> 00:38:59.090
So if you have a
favorite product,

00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:00.320
you can just use the app.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.960
And it will tell you where
it sits on an ethical scale.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.070
I know it might be
a little bit more

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:05.870
expensive for ethical
products, but that is

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:07.490
the cost of a clean conscience.

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:09.290
And we really have
to invest the money

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:12.430
in people who truly want
to invest back in us, yeah.

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:13.949
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:17.735 --> 00:39:20.110
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Thank you--
we have a question over here.

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:22.130
AUDIENCE: Thank you
guys for coming.

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:23.650
I want to know
what you guys think

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:29.380
about how we can raise the next
generation to kind of approach

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.060
this subject in
a better fashion.

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.272
I heard one of you
at least is a parent.

00:39:33.272 --> 00:39:34.980
How would you raise
your kids, basically?

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:39.060
CHASE STRANGIO: Well--

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:42.945
PEPPERMINT: Let's examine
your parental skills.

00:39:42.945 --> 00:39:44.320
CHASE STRANGIO:
Well, no, I mean,

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:51.910
I think that, in general,
it's so easy to be--

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:54.550
first of all, caretaking,
it is hard labor

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:58.960
that disproportionately
falls on women and people who

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.000
are fem-identified
for a lot of reasons,

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.180
and also people of color.

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:04.554
If you walk around a rich
white neighborhood in New York,

00:40:04.554 --> 00:40:06.520
you'll see lots of
people of color caring

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.174
for older people
and younger people.

00:40:08.174 --> 00:40:10.090
And I think we have to
be really conscious of,

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:12.250
like, the white
supremacy that's at play

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:13.500
in our caretaking in general.

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:16.240
So I just wanted to say
that, because that just,

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:19.840
it always strikes
me in New York.

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.390
I just think we
have to be really

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:25.420
conscious of the fact that
gender is a system, and that

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:29.217
every single day, we are
gendering people and behaviors,

00:40:29.217 --> 00:40:31.300
and that there are costs
and consequences to that.

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.850
And so if we can do
anything, it would--

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:38.170
my sort of goal is
to urge us to stop

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:40.100
assuming coherence of bodies.

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:43.240
So for example, my child
doesn't have a concept

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.370
that body parts
correlate to genders.

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:48.040
It would make no sense, because
my child has seen me naked.

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:51.070
And that just-- I can't be
like, oh a penis is a boy thing,

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:53.230
but your dad doesn't have
one-- you know, and so

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:56.320
that, being really conscious,
and naming our bodies,

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.384
and then de-stabilizing
the idea.

00:40:58.384 --> 00:41:00.550
Because if we think about
the violence against trans

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:02.920
and non-binary
communities, particularly

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:06.040
fems of color, women
and fems of color,

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.440
it's based on the
idea of a betrayal

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.480
of the truth of a body
that doesn't line up

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.780
with people's assumptions.

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.140
And if we don't start to get
rid of those assumptions,

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:16.240
we're going to keep
seeing this violence.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.820
And just to go back to Geena's
point about representation,

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:20.740
you all may not have
consumed Jerry Springer,

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.614
but I bet you watched
"Silence of the Lambs,"

00:41:22.614 --> 00:41:24.490
or "Ace Ventura," or
the "Crying Game."

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:27.320
And these are predicated
on the idea of,

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.470
oh my god, there's a penis.

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:30.100
And oh my god,
that's so shameful.

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:33.220
And our kids still
internalize that,

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:35.260
because we are
participating in the idea

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.120
that bodies are
coherently gendered

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.430
and a gender is not a system,
but a biological truth.

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.110
And if we don't
move away from that,

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:43.900
then I think we're just going
to keep entrenching the binary

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:46.040
and keep making it harder
for people to survive.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.080
And that's on all of us.

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:47.713
Listen to your language.

00:41:47.713 --> 00:41:48.730
How often do you say ladies?

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:49.729
How often you say dudes?

00:41:49.729 --> 00:41:51.490
How often you say
girl parts, boy parts?

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:54.970
How often do you assume that
people in the men's bathroom

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:56.290
stand up to pee at a urinal?

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:59.070
What are the way in which
we're participating in this

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:02.170
and imposing that on a younger
generation and the people

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:05.290
that we caretake,
because we all do it.

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:06.230
We do it too, 100%.

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:07.605
GEENA ROCERO: It's
a lot of work,

00:42:07.605 --> 00:42:10.720
but it's a worthy
endeavor to do, certainly,

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.492
because it affects everybody.

00:42:12.492 --> 00:42:14.950
RAIN DOVE: Yeah, you've been
brainwashed since birth to use

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:16.200
a particular type of language.

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.920
I still make mistakes, actually.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.710
I preach this thing of, like,
we need to drop and change

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:23.140
our language, but I still
make mistakes all the time.

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:26.939
I say dudes a lot, or
like, hey man, what's up?

00:42:26.939 --> 00:42:28.480
And that comes right
out of my mouth.

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:30.350
It's this, like, natural thing.

00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:34.030
So it's not something
that happens overnight.

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:36.094
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Yeah,
thank you for that.

00:42:36.094 --> 00:42:37.510
I want to go back
to something you

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:42.530
said, Geena, about sort of
who gets to play the roles,

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:45.280
like who gets to write the
stories and tell the stories.

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.940
And Peppermint,
obviously you are--

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:47.740
PEPPERMINT: I'm writing
all the stories.

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:49.000
MICHAEL SHAYAN: You're
writing all the stories.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:49.546
PEPPERMINT: I've
written them all.

00:42:49.546 --> 00:42:51.900
GEENA ROCERO: This
is the next show.

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:54.132
MICHAEL SHAYAN: As
the storyteller for--

00:42:54.132 --> 00:42:55.840
PEPPERMINT: --for
history, for humanity--

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.026
MICHAEL SHAYAN: --for humanity--

00:42:57.026 --> 00:42:58.026
CHASE STRANGIO: If only.

00:43:00.874 --> 00:43:02.290
MICHAEL SHAYAN:
No, I just kind of

00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:04.060
want to ask that
question of, what

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:07.990
does it mean for you to
be a trans woman playing

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:12.250
a non-binary role on Broadway?

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:13.630
PEPPERMINT: It means everything.

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:17.050
And even just before
that, it was--

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:19.840
even though I've been
doing it for 20 years,

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:24.430
I was made to feel, after
so many of my contributions

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:27.400
and hard sweat, blood,
sweat, and tears

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.470
in the drag world
in New York City,

00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:36.130
sometimes earning $50 a
show, traipsing to the bar

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:39.940
and having to take the
subway home, after all

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:42.490
of those dues that I
feel that I have paid,

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:45.490
I felt that I
didn't have support.

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:48.490
And marching across the Brooklyn
Bridge for marriage equality,

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:51.880
showing up for AIDS
and HIV research,

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.710
and education, and
prevention events,

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:55.450
and giving my time
to charity, which

00:43:55.450 --> 00:44:00.400
I think charitable work is
a huge part of drag for me,

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.140
after doing all
those things, I felt

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:03.760
that I didn't have
a single friend

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.970
or ally in any single
one of those spaces

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:14.480
when I was dealing with
sorting out my trans-ness.

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.330
I didn't feel that my
jobs would be protected.

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:20.060
I worked seven days a
week in bars and clubs.

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:24.610
And I was in the room when
a very popular queen who

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:28.130
had since transitioned and was
kind of sorting all that out, I

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:31.640
was in the room when the manager
of the bar was, like, well

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.860
let's fire her, because
she's a trans woman now,

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:37.910
as if she doesn't have rent
to pay in New York and maybe

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:41.090
medical expenses.

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:44.810
That terrified me that I would
have to choose between the two.

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:48.350
And the reason why I really
went so strong into drag

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:52.070
was because I went to college
for musical theater performance

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:55.340
thinking that maybe I'd
have a career on Broadway.

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:58.010
And there was none
of me represented

00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:00.265
in any of the rooms,
in any of the scripts.

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:04.970
In school, I was told
that I would have

00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:07.105
to butch it up, and have to--

00:45:07.105 --> 00:45:09.860
at best, you might
be able to play

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:15.410
a handful of characters that
are written as black gay guys.

00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:18.820
And none of those
people were leads.

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:22.460
And so not that that was
what I was seeking, but just

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:28.100
to have an existence,
and being able to earn

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:30.770
a living in Broadway,
and then also

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:33.350
as a drag queen on
a major platform,

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:35.360
seemed impossible to me.

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:41.000
And I was faced with the very
real thought that I would have

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.330
to, if I wanted to do anything
more than pay my rent,

00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:48.050
which is exactly what
I was doing with those

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:51.500
seven-day-a-wee, jobs, I
would have to investigate

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.870
and consider survival sex work.

00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:56.095
This was just three years ago--

00:45:56.095 --> 00:45:56.720
RAIN DOVE: Wow.

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.160
PEPPERMINT: --that
I would not be

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:01.130
able to continue my
medical transition,

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:06.110
or do anything more, have $1
to spend more than my rent.

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:07.610
After working seven
days a week, I'd

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:11.252
have to engage in
survival sex work.

00:46:11.252 --> 00:46:12.710
And that was the
only option that I

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:15.440
thought that I had before
auditioning for Drag Race.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.320
And even then, no one was
saying, come do Drag Race.

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.550
You're a trans woman.

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:20.490
We'll put you on.

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:21.920
No one was saying that.

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.230
I just-- I had
auditioned several times.

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:27.050
And I just said the last
time during the audition,

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:28.980
I'm just going to do my thing.

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:31.130
I probably won't
get on, who cares?

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:32.590
And obviously, I got on.

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:36.410
And so I didn't really,
to answer your question,

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:39.770
I didn't envision
any possibility

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:44.870
that I would ever be
on a Broadway stage

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:50.600
at all, let alone a principal,
and playing a character who

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:57.320
is self-aware, and reassured,
and confident in who they are,

00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:00.200
and a very real
character in that way.

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:03.410
And representation does matter,
because when I was growing up,

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:08.180
the closest I had to seeing
myself was Richard Simmons.

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:11.030
And you know--

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:12.515
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:12.515 --> 00:47:13.600
That's that.

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:18.820
So I'm so happy that we
have shows like "Pose,"

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:20.530
among other things
that are bubbling up,

00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:23.800
and then that I have this role
on Broadway, which is rare now.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:28.640
And it feels so good to be--
to have a moment in history.

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:31.675
But it also, at the same
time, as everyone on the panel

00:47:31.675 --> 00:47:35.560
has said, it also reminds me
of how little opportunity there

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.880
has been for people like
me, and including myself.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.350
And so yeah, did I
answer the question?

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:46.740
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Has the
publicness of this role

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:50.170
and of your time
on Drag Race, has

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:53.590
that changed your
understanding of allyship

00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:56.500
and your feeling
of allyship at all?

00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:00.590
PEPPERMINT: Yeah, I mean,
not those things alone.

00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:04.210
I think the times changing
has clearly helped.

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:07.810
I think, for so long, we'd be
remiss by not acknowledging

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:11.380
that drag queens,
and trans folk,

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:13.870
and gender non-conforming
folk have always

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:18.000
been connected to the
queer community, obviously,

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.380
but gay bars and nightlife.

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:26.740
And I would entertain in Chelsea
and in Hell's Kitchen primarily

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:29.980
gay, white, male audiences,
every single night, giving my

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:32.410
all every single night,
all those seven nights.

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:36.190
And then you know, not one--

00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:38.720
I just didn't feel like there
was any understanding at all,

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.440
or any sense of responsibility,
or any acknowledgment

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:46.300
that there is a privilege,
that even gay white men have.

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.550
Even though they are
a minority and we

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:51.730
are a family, within
the queer community,

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:53.695
there are moments where--

00:48:53.695 --> 00:48:57.160
and certain things that I
will never have access to,

00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:00.000
and certainly, in the
past, have never had.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.722
And so it was very
upsetting to me

00:49:01.722 --> 00:49:04.180
to march across that Brooklyn
Bridge for marriage equality.

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:05.440
I'm not getting married.

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:07.300
And even if I were,
my partner would not

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.640
be seen for who he says he is.

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:12.430
As a heterosexual
woman, a lot of people

00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:14.320
would attack my
partner for being gay.

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:19.930
And even I've seen gay guys
in the presence of my partner

00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:22.750
or trans women's partners say,
oh, you're really just gay.

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:23.730
You know what you like.

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:25.340
Just come over to our side.

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:27.280
And so that feels
like a betrayal.

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:31.540
And then in I think
2013, Island Nettles

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:34.090
was one of many
trans women of color

00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:36.760
to be murdered
viciously on the street.

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:41.320
And there were several
vigils, and public moments

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.240
that were had.

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.220
And I went there.

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:49.060
There were no people from our
community that I could see.

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:51.670
There certainly weren't
any-- a lot of white faces

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:55.440
or gay white faces that I
knew of that were there.

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.212
And that felt like
a betrayal as well.

00:49:57.212 --> 00:49:58.670
Like, I'm a part
of this community.

00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:59.794
I've been entertaining you.

00:49:59.794 --> 00:50:00.710
You know who I am.

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:02.770
And if I were murdered,
would you show up?

00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:06.490
And that's a real thing.

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:09.190
But it's changing , because I'm
hearing conversations that are

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.950
different.

00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:11.380
This conversation helps.

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:12.670
CHASE STRANGIO: But also,
I just want to say--

00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:14.410
I mean, you're now put in
the position to say that.

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:16.034
I want to say, like,
as a white person,

00:50:16.034 --> 00:50:17.980
I want to call on the
white queer community,

00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:23.560
like, we consume the
black and brown labor

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:24.970
and then don't show up.

00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:28.000
And you know, Peppermint has
been putting herself out there,

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000
and educating
folks, and dancing,

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.560
and performing for people.

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.897
And then to not show
up, like, what is that?

00:50:34.897 --> 00:50:36.980
And what is allyship really
mean in our community?

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:41.020
Because the LGBTQ community
is horrible at not showing up

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:43.990
for each other, and especially
when it comes to bi folks,

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:45.580
trans folks, and
non-binary people.

00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:49.105
We erase and exclude, and
then benefit from their labor.

00:50:49.105 --> 00:50:51.730
So I just want to say, like, we
can stand here and congratulate

00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:52.229
ourselves.

00:50:52.229 --> 00:50:54.170
Yes, we're doing better,
but not good enough.

00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:56.740
And the fact that three years
ago, Peppermint could not

00:50:56.740 --> 00:51:00.850
afford to basically
survive is a indictment

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:03.256
of how much work we
have to do internally.

00:51:03.256 --> 00:51:04.630
And I just want
to say, like, you

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:06.490
shouldn't have to
name that, but I

00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:08.496
feel like we should hold that.

Thank you all so much

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:21.640
for this really beautiful
and important conversation.

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:25.300
I wish we could go all day.

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.790
I hope we can continue
the conversation, just

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:33.220
as a community, and that we take
this with us out of this room.

00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:35.860
And for those watching at home,
just really take these words

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:38.550
with you.

00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:42.820
And yes, so before we
close, we do have a--

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:44.320
