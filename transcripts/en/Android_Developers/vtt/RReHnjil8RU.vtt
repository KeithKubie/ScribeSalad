LAURENCE KOZERA: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:01.726 --> 00:00:03.190
Thank you for
joining this session.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.481
I hope that there is no one
standing because we do have

00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:06.020
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:06.570
OK.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.320
No one's standing.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.280
Cool.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.200
So do you remember,
10 years ago, 2007,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.460
when people didn't really think
that smartphones would really

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.920
become something?

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.330
Do you remember 2008,
only top executives

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.690
and a few nerds started
buying these smartphones

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.090
and actually using them?

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.170
And do you remember how straight
after this trend exploded

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.790
upwards?

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.790
And finally, do you remember
how many of you maybe thought,

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.910
oh, I wish I had spotted
that trend a bit earlier?

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.540
I wish I had put more
resources into it before.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.430
I'm not asking for
a show of hands,

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.250
but I'm sure it happened
in some companies.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.230
This change is happening
again right now

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.060
towards conversational
computing and smart assistance.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.840
You may have heard this morning
from [? Rishi ?] that products

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.560
of the future--

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.500
I'm trying to quote precisely--
products of the future

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.380
should be conversational
and assisted.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.642
This is what today is about.

00:01:10.642 --> 00:01:12.100
This journey is
happening right now

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.030
and we're just at the beginning
of this typical new product

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.750
adoption curve.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.700
We spotted the trend, we tried
to apply it to us at Google.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.250
And this is why last year we've
announced a Google Assistant.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.550
It's a natural conversation
between you and Google.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.060
The Assistant is there to
help you throughout your day.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.220
And it's there to help
you and to help users

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.480
across more than
100 million devices.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.830
It's there on your phone.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.830
It's on the Android,
it's on iOS.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.770
It's there on your
watch and your headset.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.080
You can have the Pixel
buds but you can also

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.470
have the latest Bose
headset, for instance.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.030
The Assistant is there.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.470
It can be on your speakers.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.050
We have Google Home,
Google Home Mini.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.000
We have more speakers that are
integrated from Sonos, Sony,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.080
JLB and so on.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.340
It can be also on your laptop
if you get a Pixelbook.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.850
It can be on your TV if
you have an Android TV.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.580
And I'm sure I'm
forgetting a few.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.940
I think I covered most of them.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.720
And there are more
surfaces coming.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.820
There may be a huge
hint on this slide

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.020
but I'm not going to
spoil it just now.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.380
There are just more and
more surfaces coming.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.740
The audience is pretty big.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.750
And the beauty of
the Assistant is

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.130
that it blends the latest
advances in terms of machine

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.580
learning-- you've heard
so far this morning a lot

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.600
about machine learning.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.900
It has also artificial
intelligence

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.090
and natural language processing.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.700
So it creates this very advanced
conversation that is assisted.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.590
And when I say conversation
I don't mean just voice,

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.750
because with the
Assistant you can talk,

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.520
but you can also
type, you can tap,

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.750
or you can even use your camera.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.380
Meaning you are in a session,
let's say, during a conference,

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.090
approaching lunchtime.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.430
You want to organize
your lunch plans.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.860
Maybe you don't want to
speak to your device.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.050
Maybe you want to use
a keyboard instead.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.640
You can do that.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.950
Or even within the
same conversation

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.070
you may start with your voice
asking for a nice restaurant,

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.090
then being willing to
look at a menu and type

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.090
a few options on your screen,
and then use a keyboard

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.040
to actually confirm your order.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.670
So all of this can happen
within the same conversation.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.830
And with the camera, if you
are in a super busy situation

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.206
on the street, you don't
want to use a keyboard,

00:03:48.206 --> 00:03:50.080
you don't want to try
to shout at your device

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.110
on a busy street, you
can just use your camera.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.540
Point at something
and get the Assistant

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.480
starting from there with
the relevant information.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.460
This is the beginning
of your conversation

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.260
directly from your environment.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.840
Extremely powerful.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.500
This Assistant is really there
to help you get things done.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.280
From your daily things, like
building up your shopping list

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.210
to enjoying your media,
your favorite media at home.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.690
You can start your music.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.990
I know I use it to start
"Head, Shoulders, Knees, and

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.114
Toes" to play with my
little one at home.

00:04:22.114 --> 00:04:23.530
I don't have to
take out my phone,

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.150
I don't have to do anything.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.690
I can just talk to my
Google Home and it starts.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.650
So you can start
your movie as well.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.850
You can also dim your
lights to enjoy that movie.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.490
You can do all of that, all of
your comforting zone at home,

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.730
you can set up thanks
to your Assistant.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.820
Same in the morning.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.880
You're in no rush, you're
brushing your teeth

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.020
in the bathroom.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.436
You can listen to your
news using the Assistant.

00:04:50.436 --> 00:04:52.180
There are already
many features that

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.510
are available that can
really help you get things

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.360
done throughout your day.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.710
And with Actions on Google
there is going to be much more.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.580
So what you want
to do as a company?

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.480
First of all, the
Assistant comes with all

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.610
of the Google properties.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.210
So you want to make
sure that you're

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.147
happy with your presence within
the existing Google ecosystem.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.730
Are you happy with
the way you show up

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.350
on search, the way
you show up on Maps,

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.890
with your content on YouTube?

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:20.932
Got all of that.

00:05:20.932 --> 00:05:22.390
That's the beauty
of the Assistant.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.810
It can be leveraged to
your users directly.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.560
We're going into
machine learning,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.960
so it's going to be leveraged.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.400
But it needs to be right.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.250
So make sure you invest
some time on that.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.050
Same with your data.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.240
If you are, say,
a news publisher

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.360
you want to leverage
your archive corpus.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.480
You may want to throw a few
mockups at it before it's

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.760
leveraged by the Assistant.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.610
All of this thinking,
you need to keep

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.710
embedding in your
roadmap to make sure

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.470
that you can leverage the
full power of the Assistant.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.560
The second layer where
you can take action--

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.490
and this is why we're here
today-- is Actions on Google.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.910
It's the developer platform
that allows you to build stuff

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.740
for the Assistant.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.830
From the smartphone
integration, if you

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.800
happen to produce your
own smart [INAUDIBLE],,

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.790
to creating
conversation on apps.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.520
And we're super proud because
we launched Actions on Google

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.970
last year only in
English only in the US,

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.700
as we tend to do because
that's where our engineers are

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.860
and we need to get
started somewhere.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.630
But already over
the past months,

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.870
we've added first of all,
additional variations to just

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:32.410
English.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.880
So now you can
build specifically

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.690
in British English, Australian
English, Canadian English,

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.770
and also in additional
languages, Japanese, Korean,

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.940
and my two favorite, in
French and in German.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.640
If you're talking
about a voice product,

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.620
this is a tremendous
accomplishment.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.400
But it was not enough
for our engineers.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.650
So they kept adding
stuff to what you

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.540
can do with Actions on Google.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.120
And they added a few
visual elements as well.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.910
So now you can embed
an image carousel

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.790
to make sure that your user can
swipe through the options that

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.720
are available.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.940
You can also use a
few suggestions tips

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:18.100
so that if your user is using
your Assistant up on a phone,

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.670
he can be guided throughout
the conversation flow.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:26.140
You can give that input
to the conversation.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.642
And last but not least--

00:07:27.642 --> 00:07:28.820
[SNEEZE]

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.860
bless you-- we've added
transactional capabilities.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.440
Meaning that users,
in the US for now

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.020
but coming soon to the UK
and to further countries,

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.510
users can now order
goods and services.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.110
Just imagine the
potential of that.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.020
This is pretty big.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.970
And what I'm trying
to say here is

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.280
that now is really
the right time

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.370
to start building an
app for the Assistant.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:02.440
You have a massive audience,
more than 100 million devices.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.320
You have a platform
that is not crowded yet.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.610
And for some services we
barely have any apps yet

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.400
or we don't even
have anyone yet.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.140
So you have a
massive opportunity

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.490
there to be the first.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.240
You have the opportunity to be
the first or even second, which

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.090
globally is still pretty good.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.190
You also have, thanks
to the Assistant

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.700
to the conversation product,
you have the opportunity

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.360
to have this one on one
conversation with your users.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.190
If you wanted to
call them one by one,

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.669
you couldn't do it
even so precisely.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:42.640
This is brand new technology
where you can address

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.270
them one by one separately.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.030
They're all signed in.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.120
So just make sure
you leverage that.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.290
And in terms of timing, the
last thing you want to do

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.540
is to wait for
additional features

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.900
to be available in your country.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.450
You don't want to wait
for, say, transactions

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:04.900
to be available in Germany
before you start looking

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.870
at your 2018 roadmap and
see, OK, which developer can

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:11.470
we free up 20% to
start looking at this.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:15.220
What you want to do is to
build a team right now,

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.220
have a few people,
give them the time

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.550
to learn about smart assistance,
not just the Google Assistant,

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.020
all of them.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.420
They need to learn, they
need to train themselves,

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.080
they need to launch
they need to iterate.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.990
And you want to be ready so
that every time a new feature,

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.450
a new capability comes
in you're already there

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.496
and you only have to enhance.

00:09:36.496 --> 00:09:37.620
But this is very important.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.900
Start building your
team right now.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:45.670
And here are a few insights
briefly to get you started.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:49.400
Conversation is more than
information retrieval.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.340
This is very important.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.290
Everybody is super
curious, I'm sure,

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:57.700
about the address of your
business, your opening times.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.430
But for a smart assistant
it can be a bit boring.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.450
You may want to
do more than that.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:06.490
You want to try to be
entertaining, where it fits,

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:11.290
and customize your information.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.890
You also want to be assistive
everywhere where you users are.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.130
We said, you have
100 million devices.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.530
You want to make sure that
you build an experience that

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:24.040
fits for every device so
that the user doesn't see you

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.430
as a nice app they can
use on their Google Home,

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:30.040
but as the one app
they want to use

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.980
for this service
throughout their surfaces--

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:38.290
on their watch, on their phone,
on the go, any situation.

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.590
And last but not least, when
you start building your app,

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.560
the first thing you have
to do before you even build

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.160
is to think thoroughly
about your use case.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.007
You want to take one or two
days, a very conscious mindset

00:10:52.007 --> 00:10:54.340
from the time you wake up in
the morning to the time you

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:59.440
go to bed, and identify all of
these tiny moments where you're

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.280
think, I wish technology
could make that easier for me.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.670
If you find one that fits
well with your brand,

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.380
you have your use
case and this is where

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.730
you should start building.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.220
So with no further
ado you I think

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.200
it's better that I
stop saying you should,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.590
you shouldn't, but that's
you hear from someone who

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.600
has gone through this process.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.060
And please welcome on
stage Ben from BlinkList.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:29.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.230
BEN SCHUMAN-STOLER: Hi.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.789
That's my face.

00:11:33.789 --> 00:11:34.330
I'm Benjamin.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:35.913
So I'm the head of
audio at BlinkList.

00:11:35.913 --> 00:11:39.410
BlinkList Is an app that
is helping people learn

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.620
by taking the core ideas
of nonfiction books

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.350
and giving them to you in a way
you can either read or listen

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.390
to.

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.300
So why were we so
eager to build an app

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.860
for the Google Assistant?

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.150
Quick show of hands, this is
kind of dumb but it's easy.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:58.310
How many people listened to
audio content in the last week?

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:03.270
Podcast, interviews,
yeah, everybody.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.370
So why were we so excited
to build something

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.080
for the Google Assistant?

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.270
Because audio is magic.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.340
You guys all said
you listen to audio.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.860
But not just that, you guys
are probably doing something

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.094
while listening to audio.

00:12:15.094 --> 00:12:17.010
And audio is magic because
it's the only thing

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.260
that you can fully
focus on while fully

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.760
focusing on something else.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.740
How else can you
describe or explain

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.050
that feeling when you put
on your favorite episode

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.090
of "This American Life"
and then it's over,

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:30.060
and you come to and all of
a sudden dinner's ready.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.320
Audio is magic.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.180
And at BlinkList we're
trying to figure out

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.830
how to give people
these kind of aha

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.940
enlightening moments in ways
that fit their lifestyles.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.320
A modern knowledge worker
needs to learn everywhere.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.850
So this is the BlinkList
Minute, originally conceived.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:49.060
We used it to give people more
content, a cool one minute's

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.000
worth of information, a
cool fact, cool story, joke,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.630
take away from a great book in
a way where they already were.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.610
We met them where they
were, in their inboxes.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.410
It was a daily email.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.710
Audio can work in the same
way if you meet people where

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.480
they're already listening.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.830
Go to where people
are already listening.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.530
Seems simple but it's
actually awesome.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:13.311
Because as we've
already learned,

00:13:13.311 --> 00:13:15.310
Google Assistant is going
to be available on 100

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:18.070
million-plus connected devices.

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.530
And that's even more important
considering what we know

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:21.821
about how people are listening.

00:13:21.821 --> 00:13:23.170
You guys all raise your hands.

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.000
None of this is
surprising anymore.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.889
Let's take podcast as a
stand in for audio content

00:13:29.889 --> 00:13:31.180
that people like to learn from.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.936
Can be interviews, can be
courses, it can be audio books.

00:13:33.936 --> 00:13:35.560
We know that people
are listening a lot

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.670
and it's growing.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.711
And we know that people
are listening everywhere.

00:13:38.711 --> 00:13:40.990
They're listening at the
gym, they listen at work,

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.330
they listen in the car,
they listen on the bike.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.380
And with 100 million-plus
connected devices,

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.830
it's a no-brainer.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.340
So that's why we
were so excited.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.776
How did we do it?

00:13:52.776 --> 00:13:55.910
A few simple steps.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:57.290
Click.

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:59.940
Number one, find a developer.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.640
See you out there probably.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.410
Number two, lock down a persona.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.850
More on that in a second.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:09.060
Number three, start
on the conversations

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.520
and use the tools
that Google gives.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.350
Three and four, real quick.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.300
Conversations is
becoming a buzzword now.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.030
And the term, we heard Laurence
talk about conversations

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.770
as more than
information retrieval.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:22.680
Go through the Google
documentation on conversations.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.870
It's really helpful.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.990
Because as you all know from
first dates and bad networking

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:32.220
events, starting a
conversation is hard sometimes.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.187
And that's because, like
our testers found out

00:14:35.187 --> 00:14:37.770
when we put them in a room with
Google Home with the BlinkList

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.050
Minute on Google
Assistant in the home,

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:43.320
the question is
sometimes, what do I say?

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.940
And that's the whole thing.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.660
It's not easy to
start a conversation,

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.210
especially with something new.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.380
So you could see that as a
challenge or you could see it

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.495
as something kind of fun.

00:14:53.495 --> 00:14:55.620
We have a new technology
and we get to play with it

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.857
and figure out how people
are going to use it.

00:14:57.857 --> 00:14:59.940
Because the technical
implementation is not really

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:00.523
the challenge.

00:15:00.523 --> 00:15:01.990
There's a lot of
smart people here.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:03.900
Google has made it so
easy to make the stuff,

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.800
even I understand how to do it.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.780
And it's not the challenge of
actually building the tech.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.850
The challenge is going
to be how people use it.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:13.170
What do I say?

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:14.880
What am I talking to?

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.886
What is it actually going
to do once I say something?

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:25.280
So that can go down a kind
of scary, mind-bending path.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.750
But we try to keep it simple.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:30.110
Instead of thinking about
what am I talking to?

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.240
We took Google's advice
and started to think about

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.740
who am I talking to?

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:39.450
BlinkList is a company that is
trying to help people learn.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.600
We read books.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.960
It's awesome.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.890
And our products have to reflect
that because it's what we know.

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:48.690
So if we're trying
to help people learn,

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:52.359
the Minute, the Assistant, the
Minute on Google Assistant,

00:15:52.359 --> 00:15:54.150
she has to have a
persona that makes sense.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.704
She's friendly, she's
attentive, she's funny,

00:15:56.704 --> 00:15:58.870
but she's also smart and
she's got it under control.

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.210
She wants to help
you learn something.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.501
She's going to be wherever
you want to learn something.

00:16:02.501 --> 00:16:05.256
Right there, give you a
quick Minute to help you out.

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:06.630
And that's just
a piece of advice

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.110
I want everyone to keep in mind.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:09.274
Laurence also hinted at.

00:16:09.274 --> 00:16:11.190
We don't know necessarily
how people are going

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:12.940
to use these technologies.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.880
They're out there
for us to build.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.089
We're going to build on them.

00:16:16.089 --> 00:16:18.588
But if we don't know what habits
or behaviors they are going

00:16:18.588 --> 00:16:21.180
to lead to, then stick to what
you know, stick to your brand,

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.260
stick to your use cases.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.380
Cue up the video.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.290
There's a one-minute video
of how the Minute for Google

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:29.124
Assistant will work.

00:16:29.124 --> 00:16:29.789
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:29.789 --> 00:16:30.506
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:30.506 --> 00:16:34.470
- OK, Google, talk
to BlinkList Minute.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:35.130
- All right.

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.370
Here's the BlinkList Minute.

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:40.770
- Hey, sleepyhead, we're
adding some joie de vivre

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.530
to your mornings in this
BlinkList Minute, called "You

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:45.300
Snooze, You Lose."

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.700
- You can soothe your email
addiction in this BlinkList

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:51.990
Minute, called "Stop
Looking At Your Emails Now."

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.540
- You probably know that
your liver is essentially

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.190
your body's sewage plant.

00:16:56.190 --> 00:17:00.090
In this Minute, we take a look
at a surprisingly simple way

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:02.610
to shave a few inches
off your waist.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:05.430
- How much do you concentrate
on your food when you eat?

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:07.470
You probably tend to
gulp down your food

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:10.800
while reading, messaging,
or gawking at videos.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.200
- Study after study
has shown that in order

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.020
to perform at our best we
need a good night's sleep.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.619
Listen to this BlinkList
Minute, called "Thomas Edison,

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:22.020
the Man Who Hated Sleep."

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.859
- The BlinkList
Minute, helping you

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:27.970
fit new knowledge into
your daily routines.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.750
- These ideas from nonfiction
books brought to life.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:31.390
[END PLAYBACK]

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:32.712
BEN SCHUMAN-STOLER: OK.

00:17:32.712 --> 00:17:33.420
It's cool, right?

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:38.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.470
Again, something the video is
trying to show, meeting people

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:42.550
where they already are.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.050
Giving them audio
where they already

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:46.460
are through [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.800
To finish, what I
want to say, we're

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.260
all in here because we want
to see where this is going.

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:57.080
This was super helpful for me.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.630
If you don't know,
follow the advice

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:03.020
of wizard man David Allen
on the "Simplify" podcast.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.640
Look it up if you don't know it.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.190
And just get moving
and course correct.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:08.990
We got moving.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.850
I hope you guys do too.

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:11.580
That's it for me.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.899
I'll give it back to
Laurence to finish this off.

00:18:13.899 --> 00:18:20.417
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:20.417 --> 00:18:21.750
LAURENCE KOZERA: Thank you, Ben.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:26.160
Thank you for sharing your
learnings, your best practices.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:31.120
Very briefly, we've just
launched a community program.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.870
This is for developers.

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:34.770
There are some perks.

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:39.390
First of all, if your app
is reviewed and approved you

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:43.280
can get $200 per month
in Cloud Credits.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.680
This should cover more than
what you need to run your app.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.970
So it's a nice perk.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.340
You also get a
very fancy T-shirt.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.100
So don't miss out on that one.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.980
And very importantly as
well, if you have high usage,

00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:01.590
an engaging app, if you
internationalize your app

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.650
and you're going to
be able to win Google

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.960
Home and additional goodies.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.710
So it sounds a bit
trivial, but hopefully it's

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:11.940
a true motivation.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.770
There is obviously
a winner dashboard.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.940
So it should be a nice
motivation for developers.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.360
And here are the resources.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.150
The very fancy QR code here.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:25.080
We made it happen.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.810
There is even a small
teddy bear in the middle,

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.350
if you can spot that.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:31.560
And that's going to lead
you to the instructions

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.740
to try out the Assistant,
depending on your device.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.450
Now if you are more on the
product developer side,

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:40.260
this is what you want
to take a picture of.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.450
These are the links that
are going to bring you

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:46.350
to the relevant documentation,
developers.google.com/actions.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:48.270
You have everything
from the design

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:52.840
to the console to the review
process and the policy process.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.810
We also have a
developer community.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:56.220
There is a G+ community.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:00.270
There is massive community
on Stack Overflow.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:01.620
And we have a mailing list.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:05.010
So if you want to know the
latest, what's happening,

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.950
what's launching,
what's enhanced,

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.027
make sure that you sign
up for that newsletter.

00:20:10.027 --> 00:20:11.610
And it's a global
newsletter so you're

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:14.760
going to hear from the
latest from in the US

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.590
but also for your
region and your country.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.370
Thank you very much.
