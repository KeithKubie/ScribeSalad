1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:01,420
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,870
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr, Eh,

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,450

4
00:00:07,451 --> 00:00:09,050

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,030
We'd gone until this
fucking Thursday stairs day.

8
00:00:23,921 --> 00:00:28,510
Well fuck you and your job, man.
I used to get paid on Thursday.

9
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,290
I skip paid on Thursday and
I used to keep my money.

10
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,970
I used to have my money.
I spent it on May.

11
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,310
Well, where do you want to go? Who's
it up to make? Oh, I mean depended.

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,343
She got none.

13
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:50,430
My life was mine and that
260 bucks a week that I made.

14
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:53,740
I had a fucking car
payment for $138 a month.

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,610
I was rolling in it, you
know, fucking rolling in it.

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,860
I didn't even realize
it. I was like, Oh gee,

17
00:01:02,861 --> 00:01:07,420
wouldn't it be great someday to
fucking get out there in the world?

18
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,180
Yeah.

19
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,890
Get my own place. Have a car,
drive down the street, man. Right.

20
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:16,650
What happens? You get out there
and you fucking, you stupid.

21
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,090
You like a little toddler walking,

22
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:21,450
crawling up to a fucking Cobra and
they forgot to so its mouth shut.

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,930
You know like how they do that
shit over in India. You know,

24
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,650
we just born into a family of
snake jam as whatever happens over,

25
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,280
they haven't seen that video. I
assumed it was in India, you know,

26
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,600
and don't get mad at me.
Blame Hollywood. Alright.

27
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,960
I've hung out with disease a few times.
I never,

28
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:41,370
I never brought the Colbert thing up.

29
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:43,710
I forgot the F to find out
if this was true or not.

30
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,160
I could have been like a zs a is this
or is this not a your people things

31
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:50,040
specifically.

32
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,180
And then he could have been like Dodd
no built is actually this snake charmers

33
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:57,970
all over, uh, all over the world.
You know when I would've said it,

34
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,150
was it fair enough? But
I didn't. So anyway,

35
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:04,020
she ever seen those fucking videos where
they saw the goddamn cobras fucking

36
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:08,490
mouth shut. Can I curse more than
that sentence? Have you seen those?

37
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,930
Um, have you seen that footage
where they take the unknown? And I,

38
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,590
at this point with this voice,
I'd have to know the Latin name for Cobra.

39
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:20,160
They sell the fucking things mouth shut
and then they have a baby crawl up to it

40
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,730
and the,
and the,

41
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,480
the snake is like freaking out cause
you're gonna understand it small as a baby

42
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:27,400
is to a person for a snake. It's still
pretty fucking big. Like what is,

43
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,800
what is that?
Is that a mongoose?

44
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,010
Is that going to run up and just grabbed
my face and give me a couple of shakes

45
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:32,844
and then that's it.

46
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,390
Last thing I see in my life is the
inside of a fucking Mongooses esophagus.

47
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,863
Okay.

48
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:41,950
That's what the snake is thinking.

49
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,400
It's just a snake only has
one fucking expression.

50
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,160
You know, reptiles are like
redefine resting bitch face

51
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,490
reptiles never look like
they're in a good mood

52
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,210
or they just stay

53
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,860
on. They just have like, no, they just
kind of fucking sitting there like a frog.

54
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,000
Right. It's not a fucking reptile
today I'm fib Ian. Well whatever it is,

55
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:08,020
doesn't have any hair on it.

56
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,580
They have a little bit, oh, that was
less cool. Less Claypool's line. Right.

57
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,700
Was talking about some woman said
she was finer than frog hair. Um,

58
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,890
what the fuck song was that?

59
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,290
That was one of his solo albums.
His bucket of Bernie brains.

60
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:31,790
Something of the hunt.
I can't remember. Oh,

61
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,670
my brain's going. Oh, I bought,
I don't know where to start.

62
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:37,520
I was talking about babies fucking
messing with, with uh, cobras.

63
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,760
I Dunno how I got there.
I don't even what's going on?

64
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:45,500
How many minutes just went by three
42 just like that. Just like that.

65
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:49,280
Three 42 you drive home and
you drive to work. Right?

66
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,820
Well maybe you have really tiny headphones
and your wife's bitching at you right

67
00:03:52,821 --> 00:03:54,950
now. You listen to this.
Oh, your boyfriend. I Dunno.

68
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,290
I Dunno what the fuck
he's doing. Um, yeah.

69
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,170
You had that dream that you're going to
go out in the real world and your money

70
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:03,230
was going to be made and it was going
to go into your pocket. And Dude,

71
00:04:03,231 --> 00:04:05,020
I'm going to have a fucking keg of Raider.

72
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,530
We here fucking Pool Table Air Hockey.

73
00:04:09,531 --> 00:04:10,880
And what happens

74
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:17,210
20 years goes by 20 years
where they go 20 years at Aldo,

75
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,690
right?
Bob Seger.

76
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,970
Sometimes I sit and wonder where
they gone pass smart is Bob Seger.

77
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,930
Bob Seger was smart enough to
realize that most people lose.

78
00:04:27,931 --> 00:04:32,931
And he sang right to those fuckers and
they showed up with their fucking what

79
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,010
does,
what does that old Milwaukee's right.

80
00:04:35,011 --> 00:04:38,790
And they sat right in the front row at
that bottom, lips quivering, you know.

81
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,460
And then the wise you look over
like, oh honey, what's the matter?

82
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:44,370
And then they'd have to slap their wife
cause you couldn't show that you cried

83
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:48,300
back then when the song first came up.
Now I can sit there,

84
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,560
cupcakes and kittens on your shirt is a
man sit there Indian style wearing yoga

85
00:04:52,561 --> 00:04:54,900
pants and you, your wife, you know,
I don't know what she's doing.

86
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,300
She's got work boots on and a trucker hat.

87
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,250
I don't know what goes
on with the youth today.

88
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,850
I don't pretend to know I'm
an older person. All right.

89
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,220
All I know is somehow all the bands went
into the computer and they never came

90
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:12,270
out again.
And then they just became one person.

91
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,570
You know, like Mayweather
says form like Voltron, right?

92
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:20,380
Doesn't Voltron like one guy. I know what
the fuck it is. Wow. The hell would they?

93
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:21,910
I mean I'm from the age of like,

94
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:25,720
I mean I was too old for stomp or
four by fours when they came out.

95
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:27,850
That's how I played with
Tonka trucks. People. Okay.

96
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:29,890
There was no batteries in that thing.
You wanted it to move,

97
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:31,000
you had to fucking push it.

98
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,633
All right.

99
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,360
Then you wrote those things
down the driveway and right
before went into traffic,

100
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,780
you bailed off of it and you prayed to
God that it would make the other side

101
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:44,490
without getting run over by a
milk truck. Right. There you go.

102
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,850
So
unlike you,

103
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,900
I also don't know what I'm talking
about at this point anyways. Yeah.

104
00:05:50,901 --> 00:05:53,660
You thought it was going to be all yours,
right? In 20 years fucking goes by.

105
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:55,480
Yeah.

106
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,100
Okay. And then one day you walk
a d house and you just looking

107
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,250
around at all the shit and all it
really is is it's just a bunch of shit.

108
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,450
What's the,
what is all this shit?

109
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,660
Fucking tables and couches chair.
We're gonna fucking chairs here.

110
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,650
How many kids do you plan on having? Why
are there so many? God Damn chairs. One,

111
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,950
oh,
there's no money to do this.

112
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,510
A perfect area right here where
a drunk kid could go. You know?

113
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,860
What is that stupid picture?

114
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:23,950
Why don't you take it off the
wall and put up a fucking dad?

115
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,210
I just feel like that wouldn't look right.

116
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:33,970
Be kind of awkward. Why would that
be awkward? You know, it's awkward.

117
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:37,240
Every room. Vaguely looking the same. We
look like we live in a furniture store.

118
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,650
There's nothing in here but furniture.
How about some function?

119
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,280
What about that game where
you try to punch it as hard
as you can to seal strong?

120
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,180
You are, you know where that
game would you shoot the baskets.

121
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,120
You can't just have one of those. I
don't know. I just feel like that was,

122
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,340
you know,
maybe in the garage.

123
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,030
Is there a way to put it behind
the house and down the street?

124
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,910
I don't want to have company over and
have them see that you're having fun.

125
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,200
I want
my wife better not listen to this.

126
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,440
I want them to come over and see that
you are totally in control under my

127
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:19,540
control and you are,

128
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,690
you are listening to the fucking
decisions that I want to make.

129
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:28,550
I'm just fucking with you. Um, anyways,

130
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,540
whatever. Most of that isn't
truthful. Only the set part. Um,

131
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,780
it starts to everybody either
get paid today and tomorrow.

132
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:37,690
What do you do with your money?
Huh?

133
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,490
What are you gonna do when Your Bank of
America evidentaly their entire fucking

134
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:44,930
system was down. How does that happen?
That's not scary enough. Is it?

135
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,360
Jesus Christ? I hope they didn't.
You know, I should look that up.

136
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:52,970
I should look that up before
I cause a run on a bank.

137
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,850
Is that the name of a song? Run on
a bank? Is that a Bob Seger Song?

138
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,830
Was that a no surprise? Oh, that's
love on the rocks. Not Run on a bank.

139
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,640
Love on the rocks.
Ain't no big surprise.

140
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:13,260
I thought it was run on a bank
grabbing by their ties.

141
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,130
Especially with him.
Milk, white fucking ties.

142
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,570
Why does my internet suck
in every fucking room? Yeah.

143
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,750
I swear to God, who am I? Internet
company is they have to have a poster.

144
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,050
Be on the welcome.
We need more customers like this.

145
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,860
He pays 10 times what he should
fucking pay. It never works.

146
00:08:31,861 --> 00:08:35,100
And he never complains unless he's
doing his podcast. But who gives a fuck?

147
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:37,800
Cause he never calls us.
So what do we care?

148
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,060
We just keep taking his fucking
money. All right, here we go.

149
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,130
Bank of America.
Fuck yeah.

150
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:53,570
Everyone in the world is jealous of us.
Yeah.

151
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,020
Be One wants to be like us.
That's why they hate on us.

152
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,340
All right. Maybe. Maybe we've gotten
out of line in a few areas. All right.

153
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,510
Evidently it's loading.

154
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,513
You know what I mean?

155
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,650
Watching my computer. Try to get on the
Internet, like waiting for it for load.

156
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:13,590
It's like watching me try to remember
shit from fucking two days ago.

157
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,270
Yeah.

158
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,990
Oh you sneaky fucking bastards.
This isn't what I wanted.

159
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,500
I didn't want your website.
I wanted to fucking gossip.

160
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,050
Yeah.

161
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:29,000
What do I gotta hit? Bank of America
Slash Tmz Bank of fucking America.

162
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:35,140
Here we go again. Bank of America. Google.

163
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,900
Here we go. Here we go. What
do you got? What do we got?

164
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,750
Customers shout out of accounts during
a parent Bank of America outage.

165
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,770
Oh boy.
Okay.

166
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,150
Oh boy. I'm just picturing someone
with one of those. What's that?

167
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:55,470
White masks that those fucking hackers
where when they want to shut down the

168
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,760
corporations. Um, all right, here we go.

169
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:03,660
Bank of America customers was shut out
from their accounts. Oh, an advertisement.

170
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,410
Oh, Ralph's. Jesus. You know what?
I will buy a Honeywell am all right.

171
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:12,270
What Bac Bank of America customers were
shut out from their accounts for several

172
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,820
hours,
Wednesday in a system outage.

173
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:16,650
Okay.

174
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,430
You know, somebody fucking, you know,

175
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,080
didn't get dialysis or their
heart stops at you, would you,

176
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:25,490
would you as such with with so at
the feet of these fucking cops,

177
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:31,070
coral springs resident,
Eric's, oh, he's asleep.

178
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:32,690
But you never think you
could run that fast.

179
00:10:32,691 --> 00:10:34,850
And those work boots and
there he goes down the street.

180
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:39,410
So we got what looked like a phishing
email from the bank Wednesday and

181
00:10:39,411 --> 00:10:42,980
immediately started calling customer
service to see if something was wrong,

182
00:10:42,981 --> 00:10:46,820
a message on his online accounts that
it could not pull up his information.

183
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,870
When we called,

184
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,830
this local branch manager said that local
managers are calling each other trying

185
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:56,831
to figure out what caused what appeared
to be a national outage and why they

186
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:01,760
were unable to provide certain services
like what provides you with the money

187
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:05,600
that you need. Um, on down detector.com,

188
00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:08,120
a website that tracks reports,
have system outages.

189
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,350
Reports started spiking after 11:30
AM and the website was inundated with

190
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:17,351
comments from Bank of American customers
don't what the fuck send around the

191
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:20,810
country saying they couldn't
access online banking.

192
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,530
Computer did it by 1:00 PM they had
received nearly 1000 reports of problems,

193
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,340
but by Wednesday evening all although
some customers were still reporting

194
00:11:28,341 --> 00:11:29,340
problems that never reports,

195
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,710
I'd gone down considerably to about
200 and then this is their common,

196
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:36,800
I know that the tape is working
quickly to bring everything back up.

197
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,630
As time progresses,
they should be able to go back online.

198
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,890
I would really love to
see what really happened.

199
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,933
Okay.

200
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:52,790
A Bank of American system y system wide
outage on the damn closing on closing on

201
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:56,560
my, and there's nothing I can
do about it. Bank of America,

202
00:11:56,561 --> 00:11:58,660
you closed my bank account with no notice.

203
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:03,280
How can I deposit my check when I no
longer have an account stuck in Thailand?

204
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,310
What is up with not being able to transfer
as the system has been down for three

205
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:13,510
hours? Oh, Jesus. Jenny. That's nothing
compared to the guy stuck in Thailand.

206
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,230
The clerk at Bank of America just said,

207
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,260
I can't make a Dakota deposit
because a nationwide disruption.

208
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:23,800
Anyone know what's up? All
right. Yeah. Okay. All right,

209
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,610
well let's just hope that was a one
time thing. Okay. Nothing to see here.

210
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,920
That's fucking scary.

211
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,180
That's why you got to have your
money in like three different banks.

212
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,270
I don't care if you get 40 bucks,
put 15 one 10 and another.

213
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,620
What do we got left in? Was that 25 you
can 15 the last one, right? 1515 and 10.

214
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:48,860
It's a fucking shell game out there, man.
Um, and when you got to pay your rent,

215
00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:49,800
you write three to four checks.

216
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,770
Why don't you just write
it for the full of mouth?

217
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,090
Because I'm not going to get stuck in
Thailand. You can't, what do you care?

218
00:12:58,091 --> 00:13:01,660
As long as it all works. Um, all right,

219
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,710
let's get back to the
podcast here. Um, I am,

220
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,500
when you listen to this,
I will be in New York City.

221
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:12,700
By the time you listened
to this. I am going to the
airport to not to, not to not,

222
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,780
um,
I'm going back to New York

223
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,580
for about a week.

224
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,810
I'm going to be there
for a week, week, um,

225
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,480
doing an acting gig out there.
As I mentioned before,

226
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:26,890
they rebooting sex in the city and uh,

227
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:31,120
I'm going to be playing this
Cynthia Nixon character. Um,

228
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,850
they said to keep my head shave. Maybe
they could do some sort of, I dunno, post,

229
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,570
uh, you know, cancer free, I guess.

230
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,970
Craig Nixon, I don't know what my fucking
name is going to be, but you know,

231
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,330
I wanted it to be the, the fabulous
one. Whatever the fuck her name is.

232
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,080
What the fuck was her name?
I saw him one time at a Knicks game.

233
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:57,530
She looked still with beautiful, you know,
but they're thin fucking head. What the,

234
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,050
you know,
she needs more head and I need less head.

235
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:02,140
If we could somehow combine the
two of us, I think, you know,

236
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,710
they could have something there. The
fuck is her name. She started it,

237
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,270
honey. Remember Cynthia Nixon
and you don't remember the
other one. Sarah. Jessica.

238
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:14,563
That's right.

239
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,950
S J p she had a fucking basketball shoe.

240
00:14:18,951 --> 00:14:21,610
How about those red sox won in
the last three out of four. Yeah,

241
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,410
I do like that shit.
Okay.

242
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,510
What two and two against the fucking
yaggies all where then we, uh,

243
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,540
took two or three from the Blue Jays.
I watched the whole blue Jay series.

244
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:38,140
I enjoy you. And what's great is
Dennis Eckersley up in the booth.

245
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,970
The man loves the game. The man played
the gang. The man can talk the game.

246
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,500
God dammit. He does it
for nine innings. I love,

247
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:45,910
especially when it's
like a low scoring game.

248
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:50,240
If you have a fucking picture up there,
he's incredible little x.

249
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,243
You make it exciting.

250
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,890
Think it's going to kill me with the
fucking I do break and ball here.

251
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,470
Guy Throws a breaking ball. He's
like, get this guy that he's like,

252
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,700
it's like he has fucking ESP. It's
like he pitched in the fucking league.

253
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:04,870
Everybody. How does this man
know what happens if you gently,

254
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,480
the Yankees made some sort of move to
cock block the red sox. But you know,

255
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,050
I tried to get annoyed by that, but
you know, it's been three world series.

256
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:15,410
I think we're good. Who gives
a shit? We're in first place.

257
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,270
I think it's kind of over. I think
the Yankees Red Sox thing is, uh,

258
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,150
it'll never be what it
was and I'm happy for it.

259
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,890
I'm actually glad that it won't
be, I don't miss it because,

260
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,980
uh, you know, it usually didn't work
out for, I worked out for us once

261
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,400
and then it was over. Um, anyways,

262
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,510
uh, oh by the way, still in posted a
picture of my drum kit. I swear to God.

263
00:15:42,511 --> 00:15:44,250
You know,
I'm going to fucking send it right now,

264
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,170
so I'm going to send it right fucking now.

265
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,160
You probably already see it by the time
it's things posted. Let me just fucking,

266
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:54,300
it's not the greatest picture. I was
by myself. What do you want from me?

267
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,590
Come on. Oh Shit. You know, I was
reading something the other day.

268
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,570
I'm going to get to it.
Um,

269
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,690
about good fellas.

270
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,420
It was this really cool thing that
said 30 things you might not know about

271
00:16:06,421 --> 00:16:10,080
Goodfellas and it's actually 30
things that I didn't fucking know. Um,

272
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,770
even though they still talked
about how, uh, how am I funny?

273
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,350
What do I amuse you? What
am I, some sort of clown.

274
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,160
Everybody knows that that was Improv,
but like patching,

275
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:24,570
those guys were saying we would improv
it and then he would write it all down

276
00:16:24,571 --> 00:16:26,790
and then, you know, take the
best parts in that write it down.

277
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,650
Then you had to memorize it,
then you'd fucking go do it.

278
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,640
Which makes sense because you can't like
fucking improv every different take and

279
00:16:32,641 --> 00:16:35,400
then he moves to cameras around you saying
different Shit that you did the other

280
00:16:35,401 --> 00:16:38,370
time and then it's not, it's not
going to line up. So anyways, he was,

281
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,710
here's what it was the best,
one of the best ones. Um,

282
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:45,210
that whole tracking scene where,
um,

283
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,540
Henry Hill takes carron

284
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,470
what did you Joe, Oh, you just killed us.

285
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,093
Okay.

286
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,360
Savvy,

287
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,710
right. Um, he takes her
in through the kitchen,

288
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:03,770
right then he'll track and shot and
that was one sentence in the book that

289
00:17:04,561 --> 00:17:08,870
Scorsese got this idea. There's a,
there's a line in that book wise Guy,

290
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,210
whatever the fuck the one that
Henry Hill wrote, it said, um,

291
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:18,120
on crowded nights when people were
lined up outside and couldn't get in the

292
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,930
doormen used to let Henry, I'm
sorry, the prince really small.

293
00:17:21,931 --> 00:17:25,920
My eyes are going used to let Henry
and our party in through the kitchen,

294
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:31,470
which was filled with Chinese cooks and
we go upstairs and sit down immediately.

295
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,980
That one sentence in
that poll fucking book,

296
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,510
I mean, how many times did you read that
book? He just read it one time and said,

297
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:44,280
oh, that gives me an idea. Bam. Um,

298
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,200
you'd think it would at
least be a paragraph.

299
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:47,770
Yeah,

300
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:51,510
some sort of story attached to it.
It's just one goddamn sentence

301
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,020
and that guy's fucking
able to do all of that.

302
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:58,170
And that my friends is why he's one of
the great directors and all the time.

303
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,760
All right, let's, let's get a good
one here. Let's get a good one.

304
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,700
Yeah.

305
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,460
Oh No.
Dottie.

306
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,460
Oh, there we go. There we go.
Symbols that are fucked up angle.

307
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,250
I had to run out of there.
I'm a dad now.

308
00:18:15,251 --> 00:18:17,260
It's like whenever I get a fucking chance,
I run over there.

309
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,310
I ran over there this morning.

310
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,670
I literally played four
songs and then went to work.

311
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,740
I didn't stretch it all
cause I didn't have time to,

312
00:18:26,741 --> 00:18:30,490
and then my fucking forearms and hands
were all fucked up. I'm an idiot.

313
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,810
All right, let me send this right now.
You guys are literally listening to me.

314
00:18:34,811 --> 00:18:38,110
Send a fucking picture.
Uh,

315
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:44,110
[inaudible] oh, guess who wants to come
back? Guess who wants to come back?

316
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:45,890
Okay.

317
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,030
After after fucking dump in this podcast.
Guests who wants to come back?

318
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,220
Huh?

319
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,290
After a,
it's not nature's box.

320
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,913
Okay.

321
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:02,560
It's a hold on a second.
Post this with pod cast.

322
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,340
You can't, I didn't say that. Alright.

323
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:10,870
Guess the draft kings wants to come
back with a fuck. Did they go? Huh?

324
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,230
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Um,

325
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,990
did you hear what's his face got 'em
they're going to be backed by the way,

326
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,501
cause they said,

327
00:19:17,501 --> 00:19:20,400
I can say whatever the fuck I want with
means I can make the advertising is

328
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,680
funny as I want you to meet you
guys all listen and then you go,

329
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,800
that's all that's all advertising is
just get people to listen and maybe

330
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:30,010
somebody will buy.
Um,

331
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,380
there was a rumor I heard
that,

332
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,900
um, what's his face? Connor. Connor.

333
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,930
Connor Mcgregor got knocked out
by your sparring partner and a,

334
00:19:43,931 --> 00:19:46,540
I looked it up and what I love was made,
whether it is like,

335
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,360
I don't believe it until I see
footage, I don't believe it. Like,

336
00:19:49,361 --> 00:19:54,361
maybe that was a strategy by my McGregor
and it kind of all got fucking just

337
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,170
explained away like, no, it
didn't happen. So there you go.

338
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:03,790
There's one for you guys who are still
going to order it. There was no proof.

339
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,640
It was debunked by the name of

340
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,280
Greg Kamp Mayweather wouldn't
that does not believe it.

341
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,200
So there's still a chance,

342
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:15,310
there's some stupid article out there
calling Conor McGregor yet another great

343
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:18,820
white hope. It's like this is
not another great white hope.

344
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:23,290
Great White Hope would be if he was an
actual inboxing trying to win a fucking

345
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,124
title.

346
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:25,470
Yeah.

347
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,950
You know this guy holds two titles.
He already is a champion.

348
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,630
Okay. He already has a champion, you know,

349
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:38,520
and it's not a whites only league. So I
don't know. Always a great white hope.

350
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,470
This is a fucking spectacle.

351
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,040
That's what this is too goddamn spectacle.

352
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:49,750
I am going to try so fucking hard to
order it already agreed with Rogan that I

353
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:51,070
might watch it the next week with them.

354
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,470
He does this thing where you've just
fucking watch it together and you talk

355
00:20:53,471 --> 00:20:57,340
about it. I might do that with Rogan. If
I can find some God damn time to do it,

356
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:00,580
I have to do it. Um, that's also
a good way to watch it for free,

357
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,550
for free.
Um,

358
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:05,621
maybe that's what I'll do.

359
00:21:05,621 --> 00:21:08,500
I'll be the fucking grumpy guy that didn't
watch it and then I'll solo ready to

360
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:12,400
watch it and really just a tight fuck.
I'm going to watch it for free. Huh?

361
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,260
Remember that expression fucking
ante up yet tight. Fuck. Hey,

362
00:21:17,261 --> 00:21:21,730
does anybody know how the
expression on the arm came about?

363
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,160
We're trying to figure that
out today in the writer's room.

364
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,520
Meaning it's for free.
The best they could get is that it's,

365
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:32,110
it's a policeman slang on the arm
and all I could think was, you know,

366
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:35,710
the long arm of the law, the
arm of the law. Why is, why,

367
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:40,410
how does the expression on the arm
come about?

368
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,540
What is the origin?
That means it's free.

369
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,650
Don't pay for these drinks there
on the arm. Can anybody tell me,

370
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,570
cause people already told me p's and q's.

371
00:21:48,571 --> 00:21:53,280
Mind your own ps and Qs came from the
bars and the pubs where they used to give

372
00:21:53,281 --> 00:21:57,690
beer in pints and courts.
So when people got a little,

373
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:58,990
you know,

374
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,040
out of line and sticking their nose in
other people's business or getting ready

375
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,170
to fight a mind,
your p's and q's,

376
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,540
you'll look at your fucking glass.

377
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:09,610
You don't look at anybody else or
whatever the fuck it meant. Right.

378
00:22:09,611 --> 00:22:13,370
So I like that shit. So if you could
tell me how on the arm came about,

379
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,090
I don't give a shit. If you make
up stuff, I'll read it like it's,

380
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:21,150
it's a fact dental ended up on Wikipedia
and then at least people will have an

381
00:22:21,911 --> 00:22:26,410
answer. Um, anyways, so these fucking

382
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,460
Toronto Blue Jay fans would talking
shit cause I actually watched that whole

383
00:22:30,461 --> 00:22:32,230
fucking 14 and end game.

384
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,083
MMM.

385
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,460
Where Hanley Ramirez hit the walk
off home run, right. It was three,

386
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:43,450
three after regulation and then
13, um, after nine innings,

387
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,010
what are the fuck you say in this sport?
And then,

388
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:48,790
and like the 12th inning or something
like that, blue jays scored a run,

389
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:52,240
went up four to three and then we somehow
scored a run, made it four to four.

390
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:57,070
And then Hanley Ramirez on the bottom,
bottom of the 14th, hit a walk off,

391
00:22:57,071 --> 00:23:02,071
crushed a hanging curve ball out onto
the fucking mass pike there and loved

392
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,900
Eckersley he was saying, he was saying
that the handle is going, I love you.

393
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:07,780
I love it cause he just, we just wants
to go home. It was fucking hilarious.

394
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,920
MMM.

395
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,430
Especially cause we that 19 and a game
with the Yankees a few days earlier.

396
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,010
But um,

397
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,270
oh Jesus,
what the fuck was I talking about?

398
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,040
I literally just forgot
everything I was talking about.

399
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:25,041
There was a point I was trying to make
there on the arm then to the red sox

400
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:30,000
and then fucking out my year down my pant
leg and I don't know where the fuck it

401
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:33,120
went out on that and what the fuck I
was talking about there. Oh, I know.

402
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:35,670
I was talking shit.
Why didn't talk shit?

403
00:23:35,671 --> 00:23:39,300
These fucking a blue Jay fans are
giving me shit. So out of nowhere,

404
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,250
this fucking drum company symbol making
company that I'd never heard of before

405
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,370
called dream symbols. I don't know
where it starts talking shit going egg.

406
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:54,890
If, if uh, I forget I have to rent it,
the Red Sox win at the Red Sox win.

407
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,150
We'll give you a free bag as symbols.
If the Blue Jays wind,

408
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:04,230
uh, you know, you got to give
us free advertising. So the
Red Sox win. They're like,

409
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,260
ah, fuck it. What kind of symbols
do you want to whether they would,

410
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,580
if they were even serious,
I was just like,

411
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,670
I'm not going to be a bag of fucking
symbols. I already have symbols.

412
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,350
I can't play the cymbals.
I have.

413
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:15,530
Why would I take a bag of yours that
you could actually sell to someone who

414
00:24:15,531 --> 00:24:18,560
knows how to play drums? So just for
the fuck of it, I'm gonna, you know,

415
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:21,860
but if I'm going to start the
advertising with a free read,

416
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:27,620
I've never heard of these guys. Dream
symbols, dream symbols. Yet at Ge,

417
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:32,390
we could have some symbols.
Have them in a bag, ma'am.

418
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,150
Uh, though relatively
new on the market dreams,

419
00:24:36,151 --> 00:24:40,100
cymbals and gongs produced
worldclass handmade producers.

420
00:24:40,101 --> 00:24:45,101
Worldclass handmade symbols out of
a factory in China's Wu Han region.

421
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,330
Am I going to be put on a watch list?
I didn't know you.

422
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,030
I thought we thought
those guys were the enemy.

423
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,090
Okay.

424
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,820
Which is crafted excellent
gongs for generations,

425
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,740
for drummers searching for their own
style. Dream is a dream come true.

426
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,750
Each symbol has its own unique voice,

427
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:03,750
enhancing musicians
distinct in this dreams.

428
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,560
I actually listened to get us a
couple of people play the cymbals.

429
00:25:05,561 --> 00:25:07,300
They sound pretty good,
you know,

430
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:12,100
and I would imagine because they're
lesser known, Aka not Siljan,

431
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,320
not Zildjian, not Sabian, none fucking

432
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,750
paste or paicey over the fuck you say it.
Meinl all the kids play meinl now

433
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,140
everybody's got to play the MEINL.
She want to be different.

434
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,510
Why don't you play dream symbols or don't?
I don't give a fuck.

435
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:30,344
They're not paying me.

436
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,890
You can buy the set of these symbols and
roll them down the fucking hill for all

437
00:25:33,891 --> 00:25:35,890
I give a shit all right now
into the real stuff. All right.

438
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,960
That was just a warmup. Maybe I'll
start doing that. Free advertising.

439
00:25:38,961 --> 00:25:43,000
Just a warmup.
I apologize if I'm making a lot of noise.

440
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,340
I've got a cough drop and
fucking my voice. Oh, who is it?

441
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,820
Oh, look who's here. Hey
Sweetheart. My daughter's walking.

442
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:54,190
She's already knocking on doors.

443
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,850
Guess who learned how to crawl?
She crawls like an inchworm. Ah,

444
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:05,360
you don't care about your toys though,
do you? I love this new shiny thing.

445
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:09,020
She does what she sees and she
looks away. What's up, buddy?

446
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,701
You're going to hang out.

447
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:13,550
Watch another 14 things are red
sox baseball with me tonight.

448
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,810
We actually already won. Oh, okay.
All right. It's hot as hell in here.

449
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,830
Turn it on if you don't mind.
Okay, bye. Bye. Hey Nia,

450
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,580
what would you do if somebody
had that level of bad breath?

451
00:26:28,581 --> 00:26:30,330
I read that thing to you,
val.

452
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:34,790
It's Osis and literally had like that
fucking slime along the gum line.

453
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:39,920
There's no way you're kissing
them, right? No, it's too gross.

454
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,130
Would you say anything?
I honestly think

455
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:47,910
it depends on how much he likes her.
You know what I mean? If you really,

456
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:51,210
really liked her, like, damn, I couldn't
really see myself with this girl.

457
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,180
Then you say something.

458
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:56,440
How do you see past,
you know what all I could think of person.

459
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,780
All I could think of was
when you know when they,

460
00:26:58,781 --> 00:27:02,680
just the day when they just empty the
dumpster and you look inside of it and all

461
00:27:02,681 --> 00:27:06,160
that. Fucking that liquid slime.
That's all I could. Ugh. God,

462
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,071
no.

463
00:27:07,071 --> 00:27:12,071
I feel like if someone is that
poor with their dental hygiene,

464
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,110
I feel like that definitely is a red
flag, to be honest. If it were me, yeah,

465
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,620
you're not going downstairs.
You've seen the attic. Yeah,

466
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,740
and I don't want to see the base

467
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,020
right now.

468
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,280
I know.
She's so cute.

469
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,950
Okay. All right. Bye.

470
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:32,550
Turn on the AC. You don't mind?
I'd bug me last night. By the way.

471
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,620
You all impressed that I
got her to go to sleep.

472
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,840
It bugs me
every time I think I'm out.

473
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,710
You pull me back in. Yes, I know,
but I was trying to compliment you.

474
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:48,090
I know you felt,
you know

475
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,190
I didn't know yet. I don't know why the
difficulties getting her to go to sleep.

476
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:53,803
You were like,

477
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,250
oh that just means I don't want to do it.
I can do it. I just don't want to do it.

478
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,660
Oh

479
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:05,520
really? Cause you made it seem like
I like you made me feel bad for you.

480
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,840
Like you felt like, oh it's not
like I do it everyday like you do.

481
00:28:09,841 --> 00:28:13,500
Like you felt somehow
it bothered you inside?

482
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,460
No, I just knew it was easier. No,

483
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:20,310
I just knew it was easier for you to do
it cause you know you can always tap out.

484
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,170
It's like drunk drivers with Uber's,

485
00:28:22,171 --> 00:28:24,930
you can always take your boob out
and then put her to sleep with that.

486
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:28,680
I can't do that. Okay. I'm a
man without a country there.

487
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,890
Right. And I thought that, yeah,

488
00:28:31,891 --> 00:28:36,891
I thought that meant that you felt like
you didn't really have a place in terms

489
00:28:36,961 --> 00:28:40,980
of like getting her to go to sleep, but
now I'm realizing that you're just lazy.

490
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,090
So

491
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:45,350
Lazy. I worked all day in a writer's
room staring at a computer screen,

492
00:28:45,351 --> 00:28:47,420
trying to think of chokes
for animated children.

493
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:49,863
Okay.

494
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,400
Um, all right. Just for that,

495
00:28:52,401 --> 00:28:54,770
I'm drinking tonight and I'm
going to be really belligerent,

496
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,090
extra belligerent tonight.

497
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:03,080
I know she's adorable. And you know
what? Adorable is not funny. So

498
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,400
for the past five minutes,
you keep calling me back yet.

499
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,160
Do you see what she does?
Is she see, she yells at me.

500
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,570
Could you put the AC on police,
sweetheart,

501
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:13,640
you have me that one more time. I swear
to God. I'm going to turn. All right.

502
00:29:13,641 --> 00:29:14,474
All right.

503
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:18,590
I gotta read this one thing for you.
I read this one thing for you. No,

504
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,700
I'm trying to lead.
Goodbye. Put the AC on.

505
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:27,060
Don't doubt out.
All right.

506
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,960
You could have got me worse.
He could've got me worse.

507
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,210
Um, alright. Passionate women hit hard.
I don't feed. I've ever noticed that.

508
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,970
You did some chicken,
which says no direction.

509
00:29:38,971 --> 00:29:41,780
She bawls her fist up and then you can
literally just continue eating your club

510
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:42,191
sandwich.

511
00:29:42,191 --> 00:29:46,480
But if he gets a woman with passion that
or if they had an older brother that's

When I read this copy,

573
00:33:41,111 --> 00:33:45,130
what I learned from Lyft is that if you
drive for that other company that rhymes

574
00:33:45,131 --> 00:33:45,964
with Boober,

575
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,610
they evidently treat you like shit
and you don't get tipped or something.

576
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:52,030
I don't know what the fuck happens,
but that, that totally good. No. Yeah.

577
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,110
This is the place.

578
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,250
This is the ride sharing app that
gives a fuck about their drivers.

579
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,693
Okay.

580
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,630
Lyft is the ride sharing company that
believes in treating it's people better.

581
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:07,430
Lift believes that being a ride sharing
drivers should be fun if you're having a

582
00:34:07,431 --> 00:34:12,350
good time. So are the
passengers, uh, well, yeah, not
if you're partying. You know,

583
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:16,230
I don't have too much fun up there, buddy.
Okay. My license your hands there. Uh,

584
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,610
if you're choosing a ride
sharing company to drive for,

585
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,130
go with a company that treats you better.
Like Lyft.

586
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:27,200
Lyft was the first to offer in
APP tap tipping. When you tribe,

587
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,080
when you drive for Lyft,
you'll keep 100% of the tips.

588
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,710
Drivers had been paid over $200 million
in tips since the feature was introduced.

589
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,200
Lift as even taking the
guesswork out of pickups.

590
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:40,850
The new amp device uses color coding
to help passengers find the drivers.

591
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:45,240
You can earn hundreds of dollars a week
plus tips. Want to earn more money? Well,

592
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:50,380
do you drive more? It's never
been easier to give you self. Uh,

593
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,640
I'll drive more. It's never been
easier to give yourself a raise.

594
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:55,340
That's all I gotta do is work more.
Well, that's kind of how every job works,

595
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:58,850
isn't it? Unless you want salary.
Uh, it's a simple formula.

596
00:34:58,851 --> 00:35:00,560
Happy drivers mean happy passengers.

597
00:35:00,561 --> 00:35:05,360
Maybe that's why nine out of 10 Lyft rides
get a perfect five star rating and go

598
00:35:05,361 --> 00:35:09,770
to [inaudible] dot com slash bird today
and get your $500 new driver bonus.

599
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:11,390
That's lyft.com/burr

600
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:15,400
lyft.com/bar I don't know
why I just thought this,

601
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,400
but I don't think Ferrari's going
to catch Mercedes. I just don't.

602
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,170
I don't know what the
fuck's going on over there.

603
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,650
I know this season is only halfway over,
but I don't know

604
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,930
both Ferrari's both fucking left front
tire is both in the final five laps.

605
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:32,403
Yeah,

606
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,980
no,
it's like a bad fucking Sitcom.

607
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:35,640
Okay.

608
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,610
I'm sorry with all the fucking
mealy mouth on this podcast.

609
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,230
I'm trying not to do it on the mic.

610
00:35:42,231 --> 00:35:46,100
It's just I got this halls in my mouth
because my fucking voice is shot once

611
00:35:46,101 --> 00:35:49,130
again and I got all this actin to do,
so I'm taking a break,

612
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,670
a momentary hiatus from
screaming my jokes on stage.

613
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:59,080
You know, I just really need to, do
I need to break smarter jokes? Yeah.

614
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:02,450
All I gotta do is just come out the
same, wear a suit, bing, bang, boom,

615
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:07,130

And uh, you know what
kills me is, uh, I just,

652
00:38:14,991 --> 00:38:18,680
I found out too late that guns and roses

theater that night.

30th anniversary of the,
um,

655
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,920
of appetite for destruction. They're
going to be doing it there. I,

656
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:35,150
I fucking could have figured out a
way to weasel my way into that show.

657
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,040
It's done through

659
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:41,740

there and I completely fucked myself cause

660
00:38:41,741 --> 00:38:43,120
I didn't realize that show was going on.

661
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:48,450
And then I'm going to be in New
York and while I'm in New York,

662
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:53,820
John fucking mayor with the night game
opening up with Davey latch on drums at

663
00:38:55,421 --> 00:38:58,840
the La Forum.
Steve Jordan on drums,

664
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,550
two of my favorite drummers of all
fucking time to incredible fucking bands.

665
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,160
One of the best venues to
see a god damn concert.

666
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:10,660
And I show up like a fucking day or
two later and I missed that. You know,

667
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:17,470
I just feel like I moved everything.
Um, anyways, that's the podcast.

668
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,560
Thank you guys so much for listening.
I hope you have a wonderful weekend.

669
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:25,510
You can't. Um, yeah, that's
it. Listen to this music is,

670
00:39:25,511 --> 00:39:26,740
we uh,

671
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:31,580
transferred to another half hour free
shit here from a Thursday afternoon

672
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,150
podcasts from a Thursday
gone by in a year.

673
00:39:34,151 --> 00:39:36,970
That already happened or maybe
it's early this year. I don't know.

674
00:39:36,971 --> 00:39:40,360
I don't choose them. That's
it. I'll talk to you on Monday.

675
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,353
You were afraid of the guy

676
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:46,450
ecologist at a fucking, uh, I
am a 28 year old college guy.

677
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:50,980
Who has, was it Jane or
Phobia? The fear of women?

678
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:56,170
I've never heard of this.
Uh, he said when I was a kid,

679
00:39:56,171 --> 00:40:00,130
I used to get the shit kicked out of
me and girls would always spread rumors

680
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:04,540
about me and it would really
screw with my mind. Wait a minute.

681
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:09,400
You didn't get along with men or women.
Well, what were you, what were you doing?

682
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,570
You know what? That's the last
thing you needed to hear. Well,

683
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:16,360
what's wrong with you?
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

684
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:20,020
I'm not a trained professional, so you
know, you're asking a moron and you know,

685
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:24,130
I'm gonna behave accordingly.
Here we go. As I grew up,

686
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:28,870
I started to resent and hate all the
people around me that my mother tells me

687
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,920
about false rape accusations.
And that makes, oh,

688
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:38,220
and that makes females look even
more scarier than they already were.

689
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,980
See,
guys just kicked the shit out of you.

690
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:47,460
Females psychologically fuck you up bad
and don't even have a tint of remorse or

691
00:40:48,911 --> 00:40:49,744
empathy.

692
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:50,850
Yeah.

693
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:53,220
Oh Jesus Christ.
All right dude.

694
00:40:53,221 --> 00:40:57,660
So your mother's a psycho and she
put all these fears on you. Yeah.

695
00:40:57,661 --> 00:41:01,320
You gotta maybe I would
seek some professional help
before you turn into Norman

696
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,930
Bates. Uh, all right,
let's continue this then.

697
00:41:03,931 --> 00:41:08,610
I hear about all the women raping men
in the divorce courts and in general

698
00:41:08,611 --> 00:41:12,750
adding more fuel to the fear. Dude. Yeah.
You're, you're over thinking this shit.

699
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,540
I mean, you've probably heard half
of that from me, but I'm an idiot.

700
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,403
Don't listen to me.

701
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:21,000
He said it's gotten to the point where
when a female introduces herself to me,

702
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:25,590
I just see her as a potential mind
raping and prolonged exercise of getting

703
00:41:25,591 --> 00:41:30,330
verbally abused. So I just
always say sorry, but I have
somewhere to be right now.

704
00:41:30,331 --> 00:41:31,164
Goodbye.

705
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:33,903
Huh?
Huh?

706
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,420
And I walk away, sir, can
I steal that from you?

707
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:44,900
I want to use that next time we get
pulled over guidelines is Reza. Sorry,

708
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,740
when I have somewhere to be
right now, goodbye. And you just,

709
00:41:48,741 --> 00:41:51,200
just act like the rain man.
And they'll fucking leave you alone.

710
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:54,380
That's actually brilliant.
He said they scare me so much,

711
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:57,920
but I'm still attracted to them. Oh
my God, Dude. You listen, you gotta,

712
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,350
you gotta you gotta get past this.

713
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:04,130
Hopefully you're still
young and this is early on,

714
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:07,340
but this is something where you were,
you know,

715
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,360
everybody is trying to go towards the,
uh,

716
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:14,570
we'll just call it a whatever
planet live happily ever after.

717
00:42:14,571 --> 00:42:16,760
But if you're off by just one degree,

718
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:20,930
you're not really going to notice
when you're 22, 24, you know,

719
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:24,650
but by the time you're 40, you're going
to be about a million miles off course.

720
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:29,300
So let's try and get you some help.
I would go see a therapist, sir.

721
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:31,370
Um,
and I know I've been joking around,

722
00:42:31,371 --> 00:42:35,360
but I kind of have to do that
because this is a podcast. But, um,

723
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,900
well actually because it's a
podcast that's supposed to be funny.

724
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:43,970
I'm not saying you can't
have a serious podcast. Um,

725
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:48,230
yeah, we'd go get some help quickly
and I would get rid of all those fears.

726
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:50,880
And I would say a lot of
the fears are probably, uh,

727
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,590
put into your head by your mom when you
were really young and you need to try

728
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:58,130
and get those out of there before they
take any more route than they already do

729
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:02,720
already have. Well, let's finish
here. He said, my mind says,

730
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:06,920
stay the fuck away while my Dick
says do it. Do it. Fucking do it. Uh,

731
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:09,500
but in this climate of unrestrained female

732
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,020
hypo agents and what the fight,
I mean,

733
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,850
this shit that makes women invade male
spaces and makes them change everything

734
00:43:17,851 --> 00:43:22,110
to suit them through. Dude, you're taking
your fucking fear of women. You're,

735
00:43:22,111 --> 00:43:26,310
you're, you're, you're
blowing by me. Listen,

736
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,650
are you a great guy?
If you're a great guy,

737
00:43:28,651 --> 00:43:31,340
there's a great woman out
there for you and the,

738
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:34,920
and it's a beautiful thing
then at all like this.

739
00:43:34,921 --> 00:43:38,100
What you're doing is you're taking the
worst of the worst of females and you're

740
00:43:38,101 --> 00:43:42,760
praying it with the broad
brush. All right. Um, AH,

741
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:45,630
Jesus Christ. I'm relating
to this guy here. He said,

742
00:43:45,631 --> 00:43:48,660
I'd rather stay celibate for life
right now. I don't relate to that.

743
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:53,490
I am a loner to a vast degree,
but I got a loving family to back me up.

744
00:43:53,491 --> 00:43:55,110
So I am on the fringe or anything.

745
00:43:55,111 --> 00:43:58,140
I plan on just working
towards my career and it did.

746
00:43:58,141 --> 00:44:00,240
I write this like 20 years ago.

747
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:04,110
Jesus Christ plan on just working
towards my career in education,

748
00:44:04,111 --> 00:44:08,160
but either way I'll have to deal with
women and it's been hard to do since

749
00:44:08,161 --> 00:44:09,390
lately too.

750
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:13,650
So lately since my social skills
tanked over the last nine months,

751
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:15,761
trauma,

752
00:44:15,761 --> 00:44:20,620
Conga Line of horrific events happened
and I am working on getting the

753
00:44:20,621 --> 00:44:24,940
confidence back through Brazilian
Jujitsu already lost 11 pounds and I'm

754
00:44:24,941 --> 00:44:28,570
starting to feel a lot better. All right,
well just don't go choke out any women.

755
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:33,150
All right, I'll try to put
them in the triangle. He said
anyways, is there any way,

756
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:36,810
but martial arts are a great way to
build self esteem from what I've heard

757
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:38,220
anyways.
Is there any,

758
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:42,300
is there any way to get rid of the insane
fear I have about women or is it just

759
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:45,570
15 years of hurt that will
take almost forever an undo?

760
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:50,360
Thanks and go fuck yourself six ways
from Sunday and good luck with your stand

761
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:54,480
up. Um, all right, I'll see. You're
only 15. Is that what you're saying?

762
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,620
All right dude. First of all, it's
great you took up Brazilian Jujitsu,

763
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,410
you should know how to
defend yourself and uh,

764
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:03,720
don't be a cunt about it when
you become a black belt, uh,

765
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:07,410
use it to save nerds and protect yourself,
but never be a bully.

766
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:09,990
Um,
and then as far as women,

767
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:14,100
I would actually try and talk to somebody
about this and I would try to have

768
00:45:14,101 --> 00:45:17,640
more of an open mind because right now
if you're only 15 years old or even if

769
00:45:17,641 --> 00:45:21,690
you're young in your early twenties,
mid twenties, you're basically,

770
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:26,050
you've got the lottery pick as
far as women goes. All right.

771
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,770
They're all available.
All first round draft picks,

772
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:33,300
bunch of first round draft
picks just sitting there.

773
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:35,100
Yeah.

774
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:35,641
And you know,

775
00:45:35,641 --> 00:45:39,420
depending on when you open your mouth
and start talking to one is when you pick

776
00:45:39,421 --> 00:45:42,360
in the draft, if you know what I
mean. Sooner rather than later.

777
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:46,960
But I would just talk to
somebody about, um, about,

778
00:45:46,961 --> 00:45:49,960
about some of your issues.
Maybe it's school,

779
00:45:49,961 --> 00:45:53,260
they got some free fucking therapy or
something like that if you're too young to

780
00:45:53,261 --> 00:45:54,094
pay for it.

781
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,580
But,
um,

782
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,360
I dunno,
I would talk to somebody,

783
00:45:59,361 --> 00:46:03,170
I would talk to some of your
guy friends about it. I would,

784
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:03,921
you know what I would do,

785
00:46:03,921 --> 00:46:08,921
I would openly talk about
your fear of women to,

786
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:13,280
um, to friends, you know, and I would,

787
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:16,200
I would sit down with your
mother and just say, listen,

788
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,020
I have major issues with women right now.

789
00:46:19,021 --> 00:46:22,170
And I think some of it stems from a lot
of the negative things that you've said

790
00:46:22,171 --> 00:46:26,790
about them. And I need you to stop doing
that because it's, it's fucking with me.

791
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:31,800
Don't, don't say that part, but say it in
a nicer way. Um, but if she's, you know,

792
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:33,803
I dunno,

793
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:38,660
that's the hardest fucking thing is
because you are born into the religion of

794
00:46:38,661 --> 00:46:41,490
your parents, you know, and,

795
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:46,850
and to all of their beliefs and
hopefully they have more good than bad,

796
00:46:47,061 --> 00:46:50,750
but they're humans so they're
going to be wrong. And you know,

797
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:54,560
when you're a little toddler all the
way through like seven, eight years old,

798
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,810
your parents are godlike.

799
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:58,520
You just think they know everything
and they have all the answers.

800
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:02,210
They never look unsure.
You do everything that they fucking say.

801
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:08,480
So a lot of that stuff just
really takes deep root. Like it's,

802
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,690
it's law in your head and then he,
a teenage years,

803
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:17,020
you start breaking away. You realize
some of his bullshit and let's win.

804
00:47:17,021 --> 00:47:19,120
Some anger can come out
and that type of stuff.

805
00:47:19,121 --> 00:47:22,750
So I would say what you're
going through is normal.

806
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,480
It's just that you may be had an extreme,

807
00:47:25,481 --> 00:47:28,810
a helping of some fucking anti woman shit,

808
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:32,830
which I can relate to because I did too.
And I had to fight through that shit.

809
00:47:32,831 --> 00:47:37,150
I mean, it took me and get married till
I was 45. I had made your fucking issues.

810
00:47:37,151 --> 00:47:39,840
But uh, it's like anything, look, it,

811
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,850
just use the martial arts thing as a,

812
00:47:42,851 --> 00:47:46,720
a metaphor or a simile.
Whatever the fuck you're supposed to.

813
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:51,250
Whatever the right terminology is. Look
at you. You did that. You stuck with that.

814
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:55,030
You lost 11 pounds. You work towards
that. Look at, look at what you're,

815
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:59,080
you're getting, you're getting positive
results and it hasn't been easy, right?

816
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,720
But You keep showing up,
you get positive results.

817
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,270
I would do the same thing
with your women issues.

818
00:48:04,271 --> 00:48:08,800
I would just start working
on it. Um, you know,

819
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:12,040
next time a woman comes up and says hello,
don't say I have somewhere to go.

820
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:15,790
Just say hello back and stay in the
conversation for as long as you can.

821
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:18,550
And when you feel like
baling, just say, listen,

822
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,420
I'm really shy around women and it's
something that I'm trying to work on.

823
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,530
Just put it out there.

824
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:28,150
And you know what I guarantee
80% of them are going to say, oh,

825
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:31,870
you know, when they do that, they're
gonna love it. And next thing you know,

826
00:48:31,871 --> 00:48:36,760
you're out there watching a romantic
comedy with some lady having a good time.

827
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,240
But I would, I would address it sooner
than later. I'm telling you, dude,

828
00:48:40,241 --> 00:48:44,440
it's you literally, it's, you think
it's a mountain. It's, it's a fucking,

829
00:48:44,441 --> 00:48:46,900
it's stepping up onto the curb.
It's all in your head.

830
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:51,940
And that's totally normal because I would
guess that your fears started when you

831
00:48:51,941 --> 00:48:55,180
were in your mom's godlike
phase of your life.

832
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:58,900
So you think you think it's
a, hey, what's going on?

833
00:48:58,901 --> 00:49:03,470
Fucking Mount Everest and it requires
the client is wanting podcast is from,

834
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:07,660
it's a little fucking ant hill and John,
you can do it. All right. I believe in,

835
00:49:07,661 --> 00:49:09,650
you know, good luck, sir. There you go.

836
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:15,080
It's going to be the 20th
right now. Wait a minute,

837
00:49:15,081 --> 00:49:17,330
I'm on September here.
God dammit

838
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:21,290
it is the 20th.
The fucking odds.

839
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:25,130
Are there any ways what's going on?
It's a Bill Barr,

840
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:29,990
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,
July the 20th,

841
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,450
and I'm actually doing it Sunday night.
Cause A,

842
00:49:32,451 --> 00:49:36,200
whenever you're listening to this fucking
thing, I'm, I'm probably out golfing.

843
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:38,580
Yes.
Believe in a,

844
00:49:38,581 --> 00:49:43,581
not a guy who already has too many God
damn hobbies with his pathetic drumming

845
00:49:44,931 --> 00:49:48,830
and guitar playing. Um, I don't know.

846
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:52,130
I've somehow got sucked into that game,
fighting it,

847
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,220
fighting it my entire adult life.

848
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:59,510
All my friends that all my friends
to a bunch of fucking people I know.

849
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:03,280
They date day golf. And, uh,

850
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:07,580
I always viewed it like drinking coffee.
I just didn't like,

851
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:10,880
I don't know,
I just didn't look like that much fun,

852
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:16,070
but everyone was completely addicted to
it. You know, I took a sip of fucking,

853
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:21,230
uh, coffee when I was like eight
years old and it tasted like shit.

854
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:26,450
Tasted like dirty water and it looked
like dirty water and that's what it tasted

855
00:50:26,451 --> 00:50:28,130
like.
And I know I never,

856
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:32,420
I never got into it and done
it all my whole adult life.

857
00:50:32,421 --> 00:50:34,130
I just watch all these
people walking around.

858
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:37,730
They can't start their fucking day
unless they get a cup of this shit.

859
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:39,733
You know,

860
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:44,570
all these people talking about people
on crystal meth and addicted to alcohol

861
00:50:44,571 --> 00:50:48,920
and shit like that. I mean, I guess
they're not fucking slurring their speech,

862
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:50,120
you know,

863
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:53,480
it doesn't cause them to slap that fucking
wife around or something like that.

864
00:50:53,481 --> 00:50:56,940
So I guess it's kind of harmless.
But I dunno,

865
00:50:57,310 --> 00:50:59,330
I remember this kid when
I worked in a warehouse,

866
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:02,900
he used to drink like fucking
eight cokes a day, you know,

867
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,390
he'd like sucked down like one
an hour when we were working.

868
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:10,250
And one day decided to try to quit
cold Turkey and this kid couldn't even

869
00:51:10,251 --> 00:51:14,510
function. He had like this
migraine headache. He lasted
like an hour and a half,

870
00:51:14,511 --> 00:51:17,690
maybe two hours for up until our
first break. And he just finally,

871
00:51:17,691 --> 00:51:21,560
he drank a coke and he just
felt better. So, uh, yeah.

872
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:26,090
So I avoided that shit.
And uh, I don't know,

873
00:51:26,091 --> 00:51:28,520
I've been kind of worried about losing
my memory and somebody told me if you

874
00:51:28,521 --> 00:51:31,670
actually drink caffeine that
actually helps with Alzheimer's.

875
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:36,671
I had an Italian meal a few weeks ago and
I drank a shot of espresso or espresso

876
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:41,510
ever the fuck you say it. And uh,
I dunno, I have to, uh, I know,

877
00:51:41,511 --> 00:51:45,170
I know it was fucking brutal. I got it
over with though. And then someone's like,

878
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,980
no, no, no. I actually read
where it adds to Alzheimer,

879
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:53,480
Alzheimer's disease. And I was like, you
know what? I don't give a fuck. You know,

880
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:57,500
none of you are doctors who are
giving me this advice, you know,

881
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,320
it's fucking ridiculous. He might not
like, how many times do you get done that?

882
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:05,670
You know, you just sit in a bar
and somebody just says that.

883
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:10,550
Well actually caffeine helps,
uh, helps against a, helps
prevent a Alzheimer's. Uh,

884
00:52:10,551 --> 00:52:13,510
they'd done studies. Oh really? Really?

885
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:17,430
Do you have any of those studies in front
of you? What the fuck do you do? Huh?

886
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,510
What do you, what do you, what do you,
what does anybody do anymore? Huh?

887
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,030
What are you doing?

888
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:26,030
Why don't you sit in a fucking cubicle
looking at spreadsheets of the sweatshop

889
00:52:26,121 --> 00:52:29,360
labor. This is how fucked up this
country is right now. As far as like,

890
00:52:29,361 --> 00:52:33,590
I'm really just trying to
buy American made shit. Um,

891
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:38,870
I actually went on, I got a
couch and I went to this, uh,

892
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:43,580
this furniture store over here in
the valley and it was, uh, you know,

893
00:52:43,581 --> 00:52:46,210
allegedly American made shit.
So I,

894
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:49,070
I ordered this couch cause you know,

895
00:52:49,071 --> 00:52:51,500
you don't want to take the one that's
on the floor that everybody's fucking

896
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:55,040
plopped down on. So I get this
couch, right. So I'm like,

897
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:57,080
when I asked before I bought the couch,
you know,

898
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:01,250
cause I want to buy American
made shit made by Americans.

899
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:06,470
You know what I mean? Get this
fucking country going again. Well,

900
00:53:06,471 --> 00:53:09,650
like we can't make a couch.
You know,

901
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:14,780
we've made the best look and fucking cars
of all goddamn time before we started

902
00:53:14,781 --> 00:53:16,670
being cheap motherfuckers about it.
All right.

903
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,520
We went to the moon and we
faked going to the moon.

904
00:53:19,521 --> 00:53:22,130
I don't know what the fuck we did.
Okay, but it was, it was impressive.

905
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,820
We can make a goddamn couch. Okay. I
asked the guy, where's the couch made?

906
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,650
He says, it's made in Pasadena. Long
story short is I have a problem.

907
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:34,620
I end up having a problem
with the upholstery that they
put on the fucking thing.

908
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:38,910
So that was when I actually know, and
I've had to send the stupid couch back.

909
00:53:38,911 --> 00:53:41,790
I actually learned of their process.
This is what they do.

910
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:45,060
They do make the couch in Pasadena,
they build the damn thing,

911
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:49,320
but when they put the upholstery on it,
they actually,

912
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,980
that part of the job,
they shipped it down to like Honduras.

913
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:59,940
Okay. Think about that. They build it
in Pasadena. I live over here in la.

914
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:04,680
All right. And they fucking
ship it to Honduras. To, to,

915
00:54:04,681 --> 00:54:07,740
to have the, uh, the, uh,

916
00:54:07,741 --> 00:54:10,800
what did the upholstery put on it and
then they ship it back to America.

917
00:54:10,801 --> 00:54:15,801
So my thing is like how fucking cheap
is the Goddamn labor down there that

918
00:54:16,981 --> 00:54:21,750
that's, that that's financially
a better way to go. You know

919
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:25,140
the fuck am I talking about golf here?

920
00:54:25,141 --> 00:54:27,630
I'm talking about fucking shipping
couches to Honduras. I don't know.

921
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:30,630
It's late at night here and I'm trying
not to fucking scream and yell cause uh,

922
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,930
cause my neighbors are sleeping here.
Um, yeah. So anyway, so I've uh,

923
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,990
taken up golf and a,
I still refuse to take it seriously.

924
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:45,000
Although I did go out and buy
a little tiger woods outfit,
you know, I don't know.

925
00:54:45,001 --> 00:54:47,850
I just didn't want to go down there
looking like a Douche, you know,

926
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:53,130
like the frat boy. I figured if
I dress nicely, even if I suck,

927
00:54:53,131 --> 00:54:55,620
maybe I look like, you know, I'm
having a bad day or something.

928
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:01,950
So, uh, anyways, I'm golfing right
now. That's what the fuck I'm doing.

929
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:04,710
And uh, I missed that. Oh,

930
00:55:04,711 --> 00:55:09,330
a British open yesterday
where a Tom Watson,

931
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:13,980
Tom Watson, I thought the
guy was like dead, you know,

932
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:17,520
even though our in Palmer still alive,
this fucking guy is like 59 years old.

933
00:55:17,521 --> 00:55:20,700
He almost won the British open,
but then he didn't,

934
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,720
which is typical of golf. Oh
my God, something's great.

935
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:27,060
Great's going to happen
and then it doesn't.

936
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,120
And then you watch somebody choke
in front of their entire family.

937
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,990
I still haven't gotten over the math
master's, you know, even though, uh,

938
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:39,540
with Kenny Perry said his name, he's
one another. Uh, he wants to see,

939
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:41,640
I don't know what the fuck you want,
but he didn't get a green jacket.

940
00:55:41,641 --> 00:55:45,120
I can tell you that. Can fucking tell you
that. What am I talking about this week?

941
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,570
Hey, this is the deal.
All right. You know,

942
00:55:48,571 --> 00:55:50,850
it's a deal cause I started
the sentence off with, hey,

943
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:54,900
I was trying to get your attention
there. Uh, I'm going to be at the, uh,

944
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,640
the comedy works in Denver,

945
00:55:56,641 --> 00:56:01,260
Colorado on a Thursday,
Friday and Saturday of this week.

946
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,030
It's one of my favorite clubs out there.

947
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:07,590
And I also want to thank everybody
who came out to see my show. Um,

948
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:10,170
a week ago,
I'm at the punchline.

949
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:16,030
My had a great time as a first time I was
onstage headlining since the middle of

950
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:20,700
May because I was being a little fancy
fucking dude. There's Jimmy Norton says,

951
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:24,460
uh, make it a movie or sitting
around waiting to do my 11 lines,

952
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:25,720
however the fuck you want to look at it.

953
00:56:25,721 --> 00:56:29,500
But I'm going to say it in the positive
way. I was making a movie and a,

954
00:56:29,501 --> 00:56:34,060
I was a little, a little rusty, kind of
found my, I was a little, little, uh,

955
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:36,970
it's a little messy, but
uh, I got through it,

956
00:56:36,971 --> 00:56:39,310
but I was a by the second
show is back on my game.

957
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:42,430
So I'm really looking forward to this
and if you guys haven't been listened to

958
00:56:42,431 --> 00:56:43,600
my podcast,
um,

959
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,690
I am going to be doing another special
and it looks like it's going to be in

960
00:56:46,691 --> 00:56:49,810
December and it looks like
if everything works out,

961
00:56:49,811 --> 00:56:54,130
I'm going to be taping it
in San Francisco. So, um,

962
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:59,190
I am going to be in a theater or a
comedy club near you from here till then,

963
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:04,960
from right now until then
that I say that correctly. Um,

964
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:06,880
I kind of have a bit of a,

965
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:10,990
it starts getting going basically
right at the end of August and I'm just

966
00:57:10,991 --> 00:57:15,190
hardcore September, October,
November and half of December.

967
00:57:15,191 --> 00:57:16,270
And then I'm going to take the thing,

968
00:57:16,271 --> 00:57:20,740
I am going to be hardcore on the road
like the old days when I wasn't making any

969
00:57:20,741 --> 00:57:23,410
money.
So I had to go out like three,

970
00:57:23,411 --> 00:57:26,680
four times a fucking month and then
do a bunch of spots in the city.

971
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,880
I'm going to be doing it like that and uh,
I'm looking forward to it.

972
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,690
I'm going to try to eat healthy on
the road. These are my goals now.

973
00:57:34,691 --> 00:57:37,940
Am I going to do it? Who? To?
Who the fuck knows? All right.

974
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:42,010
I'm gonna try not to drink when I'm
on the road and try to do some yoga.

975
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:46,540
I'm going to try to fucking do
some cardio, do some pull ups,

976
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:50,140
get myself in shape physically and uh,

977
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:53,290
not look like a bloated jackass. That's
the last thing you want to fucking do.

978
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:56,440
You don't want to sweat and you want to
look like a bloated jackass during your

979
00:57:56,441 --> 00:58:00,810
special. And, and then thirdly, you
want to be fucking hilarious, but that,

980
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:05,130
that is the, uh, that is the order.
Number one. You do not want to sweat we,

981
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,530
you balls. It's no big deal. They'll
throw some laughter in there.

982
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:11,560
Maybe that'll sweeten it up
or maybe they'll just play
it once and people forget

983
00:58:11,561 --> 00:58:15,520
about it. But if you're
pouring fucking sweat people,

984
00:58:15,521 --> 00:58:20,470
people remember that Shit, you
know? Now why would you, no,

985
00:58:20,471 --> 00:58:24,430
you don't fucking, you don't do stand up.
All right, I'm a little out of it here.

986
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:29,740
Uh, all right, what do we got here? Um,
let's get on with the questions here.

987
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:32,580
Oh and if you knew my
podcast, welcome, um,

988
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,200
my joke every week that I
only have like 14 listeners,

989
00:58:35,201 --> 00:58:36,910
but I gotta admit I was at the,
uh,

990
00:58:36,911 --> 00:58:41,080
when I was at the punchline on Monday
punchline in San Francisco, somebody, uh,

991
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:46,090
somebody yelled out Pau Gasol cause they
wanted to see my impression as I was

992
00:58:46,091 --> 00:58:50,440
talking about, I did one here
on the podcast. So before
I just launched into it,

993
00:58:50,441 --> 00:58:53,680
I asked the people in the crowd, hey,
how many you guys listen to my podcast?

994
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,930
And it was literally like
three quarters of the crowds.

995
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:58,330
So I was kind of blown away by that.

996
00:58:58,331 --> 00:59:02,260
So I think I might be up to
about 27 listeners, their people.

997
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:07,660
Um, anyways, so, uh, let's get
on with the podcast here. Uh,

998
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:12,250
last week I was talking about all
the celebrities who died and uh,

999
00:59:12,251 --> 00:59:13,930
and how all these morons,

1000
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:18,580
when Ed Mcmahon died and
then Farah died and then, uh,

1001
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,330
Michael Jackson died. People, what do
they say? Oh, there you go. You know,

1002
00:59:23,331 --> 00:59:26,210
bad things, common tree, you know,

1003
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:31,060
you fucking commentaries and then Billy
Mays dies, right? And then fucking, uh,

1004
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:35,870
what's his face fucking died earlier
that month jerking off he dies,

1005
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:39,300
right?
So that's five.

1006
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:44,550
So you know what some fucking
jackass sends me this email.

1007
00:59:44,551 --> 00:59:47,820
He was half joking around.
He goes, you know, he goes,

1008
00:59:47,821 --> 00:59:51,270
I'm one of those guys who actually says
all the time that bad things come in

1009
00:59:51,271 --> 00:59:55,470
threes. And I actually put
up on my Facebook when those
three celebrities dies,

1010
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:58,350
when they died,
I wrote bad things come in three.

1011
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:01,380
But then he mentioned that
Karl Malden died. He goes,

1012
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:05,400
so technically that six.
So that's three and three.

1013
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,530
So I am right.
Really?

1014
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:09,660
Yeah.

1015
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:10,493
That why isn't,

1016
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:14,510
why isn't it bad things come and six you
people are with the bad things come in

1017
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:16,440
through you guys.
You're out of your fucking minds.

1018
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:18,410
Okay,

1019
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:19,520
bad things come in threes.

1020
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,490
So then what if somebody else
dies and it goes up to seven,

1021
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:25,820
then you keep your fucking mouth shut
until two more people die and you're going

1022
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:29,000
to see you there. There you
go. It comes back around again.

1023
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,530
So you guys just basically,

1024
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:35,830
you basically open your mouth when
whatever bad shit has been happening is

1025
01:00:36,681 --> 01:00:39,380
divisible by three to
prove your fucking point.

1026
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:40,920
Okay.

1027
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:41,360
You know,

1028
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:45,240
I could say bad things come at eight and
just wait for the eighth bad thing to

1029
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:47,190
fucking happen and then rattle them off.

1030
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:48,860
Okay.

1031
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:52,730
They don't come in three bad things
just continue to fucking happen,

1032
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:57,650
which is why they have ice
cream and alcohol, you know?

1033
01:00:57,651 --> 01:01:00,500
So you can do fun shit while
you're waiting for the neck,

1034
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:02,090
the next bad thing to happen.

1035
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:03,470
Okay.

1036
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:07,490
You know, we had a heat wave out here
there. That's seven bad fucking things.

1037
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:10,490
How, what do you where
you were fucking old lady.

1038
01:01:10,491 --> 01:01:14,990
What kind of a fucking human book kind
of a man says that shit. I'm all right,

1039
01:01:14,991 --> 01:01:17,270
let's move on to some other stuff.
I know like I was just joking.

1040
01:01:17,271 --> 01:01:19,250
The guy who sent me the email in six,
but you know,

1041
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:24,020
if I don't take it seriously then I
don't get emotional about it and then the

1042
01:01:24,021 --> 01:01:25,670
podcast isn't funny.
All right.

1043
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:30,020
And then I lose a listener like that one
woman from a fucking couple months ago.

1044
01:01:30,021 --> 01:01:35,021
I never heard from her again or her
alleged friends who are listening.

1045
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:37,220
So anyways,
uh,

1046
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:41,360
which really affected the overall value
of this podcast because I'm actually

1047
01:01:41,361 --> 01:01:44,960
doing this to get to a certain number
and then I'm going to go corporate and

1048
01:01:44,961 --> 01:01:49,490
then I'm going to sell it just like these
fucking cons, who start the, my space,

1049
01:01:49,491 --> 01:01:53,990
these, the social, uh, social networks,
whatever the fuck you call them,

1050
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:58,340
what they really are as they're basically
clubs on the Internet. You know, like,

1051
01:01:58,341 --> 01:02:01,490
I've never believe it or not,
I was never into the club scene.

1052
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,240
I know it's hard to believe that I
didn't put on Cologne and go, all right,

1053
01:02:05,241 --> 01:02:09,260
maybe I did it a couple of times,
but I failed so horrifically,

1054
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:13,640
and I've always said, one of my strengths
in life is I've known what I sucked at.

1055
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:18,080
Okay. And going to the night
at the Roxbury things is, uh,

1056
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:21,660
not something I was never good at.
Skews me. I need to drink here.

1057
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,870
All right,
that's gross.

1058
01:02:24,871 --> 01:02:27,420
You don't want to hear anybody chewing
gum or fucking take a sip of anything,

1059
01:02:27,421 --> 01:02:31,380
but you know, it's hot as fuck out
here. I was playing drums all day.

1060
01:02:31,381 --> 01:02:34,170
I was actually playing with other
human beings, if you can believe it.

1061
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:37,950
It's a whole different kind of drumming.
Um,

1062
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:41,070
you know when you play by yourself and
you do whatever the fuck you want and you

1063
01:02:41,071 --> 01:02:43,680
screw up, there's nobody looking
over their shoulder. Like really?

1064
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:47,580
You said you could play drums there.
There's nobody looking at you like that.

1065
01:02:47,581 --> 01:02:51,600
So it was a whole different
fucking level. Um, anyways,

1066
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:55,620
I wasn't of sound, but the social
networks say there, they're like clubs,

1067
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:56,551
you know what I mean?

1068
01:02:56,551 --> 01:03:00,150
Where you got the new hot club and all
the cool kids who go in there and then

1069
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:03,600
all the nerds show up and the bridge
and tunnel crowd and all that shit.

1070
01:03:03,601 --> 01:03:06,540
And then everybody took off to Facebook.
That's what the fuck happened.

1071
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:09,960
And then all the nerds went over there
and then all the cool kids went over to

1072
01:03:09,961 --> 01:03:13,770
Twitter and now all the nerds have
fallen them over there. And it just,

1073
01:03:13,771 --> 01:03:16,770
it's going to be never
fucking ending. So, uh,

1074
01:03:16,771 --> 01:03:21,570
that's why I'm still here on my space.
I like it. It's a quiet bar now.

1075
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:25,200
You know, they can put the game on.
I could sit here, sip on my drink,

1076
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:29,940
having a good fucking time. Dot.
All these crazy kids, you know,

1077
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:35,220
it's like a dive. That's why I like my
space. It's like a dive bar right now,

1078
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:39,930
you know? Now. Okay. Maybe it isn't.

1079
01:03:39,931 --> 01:03:42,960
Maybe I'm just a fucking loser.
It really is just a vast wasteland here.

1080
01:03:42,961 --> 01:03:46,380
I'm not even gonna lie to you. I
just, it's just whores and musicians.

1081
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:50,820
That's all that's left here. Um,
and one lonely comedian. All right,

1082
01:03:50,821 --> 01:03:54,710
let's get to some feedback here. This is
from a woman, uh, from a couple of weeks,

1083
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:59,070
weeks ago when I was trashing that
Carrie Underwood song. Um, she said,

1084
01:03:59,071 --> 01:04:02,460
I am a woman and I've recently become
a regular listener to your podcast.

1085
01:04:02,461 --> 01:04:07,200
I was listening to your July 6th
podcast and laughed uncontrollably.

1086
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:08,280
I actually liked,

1087
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:12,150
I actually liked that Carrie Underwood
song and cannot argue with the things you

1088
01:04:12,151 --> 01:04:12,930
said.

1089
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:17,520
The two piece combination to the
cabbage comment was fricking hilarious.

1090
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,000
Just thought you should hear it from
a woman. That was awesome. All right,

1091
01:04:21,001 --> 01:04:23,970
well you know what, I should, well
thank you very much. I appreciate that.

1092
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:25,800
And just because you brought that up,

1093
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,850
I'm going to actually give you the history
behind the two piece combination to

1094
01:04:29,851 --> 01:04:34,851
the cabbage actually where I heard
that it was actually a slide.

1095
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:36,450
I gave a variation of it.

1096
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:41,990
I was on my way to do a standup Gig in
one of the outer boroughs in New York.

1097
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:44,340
Um,

1098
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:48,810
and I was with somebody and they were
pissed at somebody else and they were

1099
01:04:48,811 --> 01:04:53,811
saying how they were going to kill him
and they were not joking and they were

1100
01:04:54,061 --> 01:04:58,520
going off and just like,
you know this motherfucker,

1101
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:01,950
this is my fucking dad.
I'm going to fucking Bubba ball his shit.

1102
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:04,320
And he was basically,

1103
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:10,260
and I'm looking at the Duke because
he really, you know, you know,

1104
01:05:10,261 --> 01:05:11,850
some people just don't,
I'm going to fucking kill this guy.

1105
01:05:11,851 --> 01:05:16,550
This guy was dead serious.
So it was kind of an awkward moment in,

1106
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:18,130
I'm just sorta like nod.
And you know,

1107
01:05:18,131 --> 01:05:21,100
trying to act like I hear
somebody everyday tell me
that they're going to kill

1108
01:05:21,101 --> 01:05:23,890
another human being.
And uh,

1109
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:28,750
he was talking about he was going
to shoot him in the head. And uh,

1110
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:32,750
he, the way he put it, he's the,

1111
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:34,780
granted I hadn't laughed up to this point.

1112
01:05:34,781 --> 01:05:37,750
He said he was gonna
shoot him in the head.

1113
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:41,720
And then there was this awkward silence
and then he just says a throw away,

1114
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:43,270
throw away line.
He just,

1115
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:50,910
he said two beans to the cabbage
and it was like a half second pause.

1116
01:05:51,941 --> 01:05:54,100
And I just started roaring laughing,

1117
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,240
which got him laughing and then
we were just fucking laughing.

1118
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,890
And then he kept trying to say, no, I'm
serious son, as he's fucking laughing.

1119
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:06,700
And it was just one of those great fucking
moments and nobody ended up getting

1120
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:09,790
killed at the end of it. And it was
just something that's just stuck.

1121
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,660
It's not the beans, it's the
cabbage. This just something,

1122
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:17,080
there's something about when you do damage
to somebody's head that it literally,

1123
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:22,660
cabbage is the, I don't know why it's
just perfect. It's just perfect. So, uh,

1124
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:27,270
that's how I got the cabbage reference.
And, uh, of course everyone was remade.

1125
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,760
I even tell you the borough, say
right there, that's how you do it.

1126
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:33,430
Where the fuck am I kidding?
If anything ever happened?

1127
01:06:33,431 --> 01:06:36,550
And they dragged me and they wouldn't
have to do good cop, bad cop,

1128
01:06:36,551 --> 01:06:40,410
all they'd have to do is slam
the door. And I'd be like,
okay, we were driving. Oh,

1129
01:06:40,411 --> 01:06:43,990
the lie. And, um, anyways, all right,

1130
01:06:43,991 --> 01:06:48,370
here's a fucked up new story for you. Ah,
Shit. God Damn. Piece of shit computer.

1131
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:52,510
Um, or maybe it's the person
operating it. All right, here we go.

1132
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:56,440
Here's a fucked up new story that
somebody sent me, a Lacrosse woman.

1133
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,780
Now this is not a woman
who plays Lacrosse.

1134
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:02,050
It's a woman from a town
evidently called Lacrosse.

1135
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:07,000
And this story is so fucked up that I
actually researched it on the internet.

1136
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:08,560
And by research,
I mean,

1137
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:13,420
I did a quick search and I clicked on
the first story and it agreed with me and

1138
01:07:13,421 --> 01:07:18,010
therefore it became fact. So with
that background, let's read the story.

1139
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:23,010
All right? Yeah. I lacrosse
woman, a woman from Lacrosse, uh,

1140
01:07:23,011 --> 01:07:27,060
is accused of stabbing her boyfriend
Tuesday after she caught him watching

1141
01:07:27,061 --> 01:07:31,680
pornography and masturbating
according to Lacrosse police reports.

1142
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,460
Okay. She caught him watching
pornography and masturbating,

1143
01:07:35,461 --> 01:07:38,920
so she allegedly stabbed him.
Uh,

1144
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:40,620
Rachel Ferrara,

1145
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:44,280
23 found her 24 year old
boyfriend inside her home.

1146
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:46,351
Um,

1147
01:07:46,351 --> 01:07:51,351
the couple argued and four are accused
the man of explicative being a,

1148
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:56,520
an explicative cheater being a fucking
cheater because evidently he was

1149
01:07:56,521 --> 01:07:59,220
masturbating to pornography.
Uh,

1150
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:02,820
she evidently punched him twice in
the abdomen, kicked him in the groin,

1151
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:07,080
four Ferrara,
then back the man into the kitchen,

1152
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,380
which I know a lot of
people like, oh my God. Oh,

1153
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,270
women couldn't back them in into the,
yes,

1154
01:08:12,271 --> 01:08:16,220
she can because we can not lay a hand on.
So when you go psycho,

1155
01:08:16,221 --> 01:08:20,840
that's what you do. You back into the
room going, honey, relax, relax, crazy.

1156
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:25,400
He'd take a couple of more, you know, put
you, if you try to do the George for me,

1157
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:29,280
you know, George Foreman covers
up his body late in his career.

1158
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:33,560
You've got one forum soda in front of
your face and the other one below you.

1159
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:37,430
It's almost like you're starting to
cross your arms to do that run DMC thing,

1160
01:08:37,431 --> 01:08:41,480
but you start midway, you
know, like the end of chips.

1161
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:47,390
Um, anyways, God bless you if
he got that joke. All right.
Uh, so for hour then back,

1162
01:08:47,391 --> 01:08:48,410
the man is to the kitchen.

1163
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:53,680
She grabbed a five inch serrated knife
and slashed his arms before stabbing him

1164
01:08:54,111 --> 01:08:57,500
in the abdomen. According to reports, uh,

1165
01:08:57,501 --> 01:09:00,890
she reportedly refused as attempts
to calm down, calm her down,

1166
01:09:00,891 --> 01:09:02,360
and she screamed at him to leave.

1167
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:06,170
The man drove himself to Gunderson blood,

1168
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:09,050
a medical center where he
was treated and release. Uh,

1169
01:09:09,051 --> 01:09:13,520
the woman Ferrara was arrested on charges
of disorderly conduct while armed and

1170
01:09:13,521 --> 01:09:15,230
recklessly endangering safety.

1171
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:18,980
She's expected later today in
Lacrosse County Circuit Court.

1172
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:24,050
So the man who sent me this said really
disorderly conduct while armed and

1173
01:09:24,051 --> 01:09:25,850
recklessly endangering safety.

1174
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:30,890
If I as a guy went and
stabbed my girlfriend in the
abdomen because she had a

1175
01:09:30,891 --> 01:09:32,300
vibrator in her Twat,

1176
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:37,850
I would get charged with attempted
murder and possibly rape.

1177
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,640
But I guess that's why we
make a dollar more an hour.

1178
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:44,120
Oh Shit that I just steal one of
your jokes. Oh, well sincerely.

1179
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:48,830
And then he names the name of a
comedian who's known for stealing jokes.

1180
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:53,090
Um, yeah, that is a kind of a
light charge. Wouldn't you say?

1181
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:55,281
You know,

1182
01:09:55,281 --> 01:09:59,240
I'm not sitting here saying that she
actually did any of this shit because I

1183
01:09:59,241 --> 01:10:04,160
understand that when I know what a
legend means. Okay. But my thing is what,

1184
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:08,510
you know, if she did do this
shit, which they're trying to, uh,

1185
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:14,200
prove disorderly conduct while armed
and recklessly endangering safety.

1186
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:20,870
Now what does that mean to you guys?
Okay.

1187
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:26,270
If I told you I was arrested of disorderly
conduct while armed and recklessly

1188
01:10:26,271 --> 01:10:29,940
endangering safety, you
know what, that would me.

1189
01:10:29,941 --> 01:10:34,941
That would mean I'm at a gun range and
I'm shit faced and I didn't properly

1190
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:40,310
Holser my,
my weapon after I shot at a paper target.

1191
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:43,070
That's kind of what it seems like,
you know,

1192
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:46,280
or maybe I'm doing something,
you know,

1193
01:10:46,281 --> 01:10:49,230
I'm trying to shoot a bottle of rocket
out of my asshole or I don't know.

1194
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,860
I don't know what, you know what I
mean, but that we would, you know,

1195
01:10:54,861 --> 01:10:56,300
if I told you I got
arrested for that Shit,

1196
01:10:56,301 --> 01:11:00,230
you wouldn't thought that I
fucking stab somebody, you know,

1197
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,690
slashed their arms and then fucking
stabbed him. You know, I, I,

1198
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:07,280
I don't understand.

1199
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:14,040
When is the world going to
understand that whoever is a knife,

1200
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,410
if they stabbed somebody,
you know,

1201
01:11:16,411 --> 01:11:20,490
regardless of their sex
that is attempted murder,

1202
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:27,480
isn't it? It's fucking unreal.
I got to tell you something. Uh,

1203
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:30,870
I'm going to go see that movie coming
out. Um, I think it's called orphan.

1204
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:35,310
I don't know. What would that little scary
girl in it where they, they, they uh,

1205
01:11:35,311 --> 01:11:39,150
they rescue this girl like
some fucking psycho pit bull,

1206
01:11:39,151 --> 01:11:42,330
like the one that I have. Um, oh my God,

1207
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:45,420
she had a fucking dream the other night
and fuck you, you dude from England.

1208
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:47,250
All right.
You fast forward through this shit.

1209
01:11:47,251 --> 01:11:50,610
I don't give a fuck do
from a couple of weeks ago.

1210
01:11:50,611 --> 01:11:52,140
He says he can't stand
my stories about it.

1211
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,240
I'm going to fucking tell when
every week just to annoy you.

1212
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:59,340
This is how crazy shelter dogs are.
My fucking dog is lying there.

1213
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,290
And I'm about, and I'm like, you know,

1214
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:04,330
drifting off to sleep and all
of a sudden I'm hearing like,

1215
01:12:04,690 --> 01:12:05,820
or or

1216
01:12:09,190 --> 01:12:12,370
hi, and it's like seeping into my
dream. You know, I'm fucking, I dunno,

1217
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:15,820
talking to some whore in my dream and all
of a sudden she turns into like a bear

1218
01:12:15,821 --> 01:12:19,270
or some shit, right? So I
fucking wake up. I'm like,

1219
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:23,230
fuck on a dream is then I look over
and there's my damn dog sound asleep,

1220
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:29,020
move in. One of his paws
gone her doing that shit.

1221
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:34,510
So I don't know what the
fuck to do, right? You know,
you're not supposed to awake,

1222
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,090
uh,
sleeping sleepwalk and human being.

1223
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:42,130
What do I do with fucking psycho pitbull
that's evidently having words with

1224
01:12:42,131 --> 01:12:46,600
somebody in a goddamn dream. So I
decided to wake her up. I was like, Cleo,

1225
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:47,890
Cleo,
cleo.

1226
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:51,250
And then she immediately just sort of
woke up and then looked at me and just

1227
01:12:51,251 --> 01:12:53,950
started wagging her tail.
Like, oh, hey, how's it going?

1228
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:56,440
And then just put her
head back down again.

1229
01:12:56,441 --> 01:12:59,020
Like all that shit just didn't happen.
It's just fucking

1230
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:04,890
the fucking things. Nuts. All right, let's
get back to the, uh, let's get picked to,

1231
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:08,500
I want to see that movie,
that movie a orphan there. Um,

1232
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,950
which is, uh, you know, it's just,

1233
01:13:11,951 --> 01:13:14,950
there's something about women
when they're the bad guy. It, I,

1234
01:13:14,951 --> 01:13:19,060
it's extra scary to me. You know what
I'm talking about, a guy being a maniac.

1235
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:23,920
I know. You just look at it, ah,
fuck that guy. Fuck am I, you know,

1236
01:13:23,921 --> 01:13:25,330
whatever. I drop, kick them. You know,

1237
01:13:25,331 --> 01:13:28,720
you just think shit like that for the
most part. But there's something about,

1238
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:33,700
I don't know if it's, they've
always freaked me out and
for some reason, you know,

1239
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:38,770
I was thinking about that. How like
women, you know, women being the, uh,

1240
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:43,390
the Michael Myers to me is way
more scary than the guy. Um,

1241
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:48,780
and I remember when I wave back and
like 82 or 83 when I first got cable,

1242
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:53,090
um, I was watching late night
and I can't even, you know, I,

1243
01:13:53,091 --> 01:13:57,160
I really feel bad for people of this
generation who have just grown up with

1244
01:13:57,161 --> 01:13:57,994
cable.

1245
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:02,530
You have no idea how
fucking insane cable is.

1246
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:07,840
You have no idea. We had three
networks to uhs and that was it.

1247
01:14:07,841 --> 01:14:11,680
And nobody cursed, no
titties, no nothing. It was,

1248
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:14,050
it was unbelievable.

1249
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:19,000
Unbelievable when that shit came out.
So anyways,

1250
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:24,420
so I'm watching late night and I was
watching this movie and I looked it up on

1251
01:14:24,881 --> 01:14:25,391
youtube.

1252
01:14:25,391 --> 01:14:30,010
It's actually the movie
is called curtains and uh,

1253
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:33,510
it has one of the most bizarre
fucked up scenes. You know,

1254
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:37,870
I went back and I watched it. It
really didn't hold up over time. Um,

1255
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:43,900
but back in the day it really fucking
freaked me out. Um, it basically,

1256
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:48,901
there's a scene in that movie curtains
where there's a girl who's out on a pond

1257
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:54,550
and she's fucking take it.
I can't even explain it for,

1258
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,520
I forget cause I haven't seen the
movie in so long. The clip I watched,

1259
01:14:57,521 --> 01:15:01,900
she's basically uncovering snow
and you think it's a dead body,

1260
01:15:01,901 --> 01:15:04,900
but it's a doll underneath.
And then she's holding it up.

1261
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:08,710
The doll has a weird look on her face
and then there's sort of cutting to these

1262
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:13,450
fucking ice skates slowly in slow motion,

1263
01:15:13,451 --> 01:15:16,480
just beginning to skate across
the pond towards this girl.

1264
01:15:16,481 --> 01:15:21,430
And of course she has no idea that this
fucking thing is coming towards her and

1265
01:15:21,431 --> 01:15:24,940
they just show it from a distance
and it just looks like a person.

1266
01:15:24,941 --> 01:15:28,780
And as it gets closer and closer,
it just,

1267
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:32,710
it's this fucking psycho f I think
it's a woman, I can't even remember,

1268
01:15:32,711 --> 01:15:34,990
but it looks like a
woman's got a female face,

1269
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:39,880
like a which face with long hair and she's
skating like she speed skate and then

1270
01:15:39,881 --> 01:15:42,040
she pulls out like this fucking sickle.

1271
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:48,160
I can't exceed. It's fucked up,
right? I mean, I dunno dude.

1272
01:15:48,161 --> 01:15:50,850
I went from Barney Miller to that.
That was,

1273
01:15:50,890 --> 01:15:53,950
that's what it was like to have
no cable and then to have that,

1274
01:15:53,951 --> 01:15:57,820
and I'm like literally 12, 13 fucking
years old. The movie's called curtains.

1275
01:15:57,821 --> 01:15:59,190
Just look it up.
Um,

1276
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,390
it's the only part of the movie
probably worth worth watching.

1277
01:16:01,391 --> 01:16:04,780
You can actually watch the clip and
when you're a, when you're there,

1278
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:09,760
there's another clip that you have to
watch that kind of ties into this whole

1279
01:16:09,761 --> 01:16:13,570
thing where a women, you know,
when they do violent shit,

1280
01:16:13,571 --> 01:16:16,990
they just don't get charged with
the same stuff that a guy does.

1281
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:22,530
And if you really feel that there's no
justice in the world ever when it comes

1282
01:16:22,931 --> 01:16:26,530
to females physically doing stuff to guys,

1283
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:31,090
I have a video for you and I cannot
take credit for this youtube video.

1284
01:16:32,410 --> 01:16:34,780
Um,
this isn't even youtube video of the week.

1285
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:38,500
It's not youtube video of the
month as far as I'm concerned.

1286
01:16:38,501 --> 01:16:40,990
This is youtube video of the fucking year.

1287
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:44,260
This is what I want you guys to
Google right here. Go whatever.

1288
01:16:44,261 --> 01:16:49,150
Go on Youtube and search tough
talk in college girl. All right,

1289
01:16:49,151 --> 01:16:52,840
somebody sent me this clip
is unbelievable. Okay.

1290
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:57,220
And toughest spelled t u f F.
Okay.

1291
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,160
And it basically and resolve balls.
The classic scenario,

1292
01:17:00,161 --> 01:17:03,790
the hot chick in the bikini,
there's some guy hitting on her.

1293
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:07,000
She uh,
starts giving him shit back.

1294
01:17:07,001 --> 01:17:11,450
He gives her shit and then she
throws drink in his face, you know,

1295
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,330
and then turns around and walks away.

1296
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:17,780
Cause that's what you do when you throw
a fucking drink in somebody's face.

1297
01:17:17,781 --> 01:17:18,980
You just walk away.

1298
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:23,220
Yeah.

1299
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:24,510
You know,
now as a guy,

1300
01:17:24,570 --> 01:17:27,690
I feel bad for guys or whoever's fucking
listen to this right now and you're not

1301
01:17:27,691 --> 01:17:31,080
near a fucking computer cause
you're really just need to watch it.

1302
01:17:31,081 --> 01:17:36,000
You've really need to watch it because
in a perfect world this is what you'd be

1303
01:17:36,001 --> 01:17:37,650
able to do as a guy.

1304
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:39,773
All right.

1305
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:44,660
No I don't. I have to talk about this
video. I, I, you know, spoiler alert,

1306
01:17:44,690 --> 01:17:46,210
I'm going to tell you
what the fuck happens.

1307
01:17:46,211 --> 01:17:51,020
So if you want to hit pause and fucking
watched the video or if you want to

1308
01:17:51,021 --> 01:17:53,480
listen to me talk about
the video and this is,

1309
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,630
I'm babbling right now to give
you that opportunity. Okay?

1310
01:17:56,631 --> 01:17:59,600
Cause I'm going to ruin
what the fuck happens. Okay,

1311
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:03,230
I'm going to talk about it in three,
two, one. Alright, here we go.

1312
01:18:03,231 --> 01:18:06,650
So she throws the fucking drink in his
face and just turns around and walks away.

1313
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:10,520
Okay. Cause that's what happens
in movies. Nothing ever happens.

1314
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:11,443
And not to mention,

1315
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:15,100
if you ever do go to make a move on some
girl who does some shit like that to

1316
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:17,090
you, there's usually a couple of
bouncers there to choke you out.

1317
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:20,840
Basically the scenarios that are
outside of the pool, you know,

1318
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,650
I can't defend the kid who got
the drink thrown in his face.

1319
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:28,940
He definitely kind of looks like a, he
could be a bit of a Douche, but whatever.

1320
01:18:29,450 --> 01:18:32,690
He's got the balls to walk up to this
hot chick that back in the day when I was

1321
01:18:32,691 --> 01:18:36,500
his age, I wouldn't have the balls to
walk up to. So I give the kid props. Okay.

1322
01:18:36,501 --> 01:18:41,180
But he does have his sunglasses dangling
from his ears and hanging underneath

1323
01:18:41,181 --> 01:18:44,630
his chin. So right there, that Douche
level of that guy's pretty fucking high,

1324
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:48,950
so whatever. So she throws the fucking
drink in his face and just walks away.

1325
01:18:49,370 --> 01:18:49,790
You know,

1326
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:52,580
she doesn't give a shit that he's got to
go home and change or he's got to stand

1327
01:18:52,581 --> 01:18:57,581
there and be sticky in 80 degree
weather outside the fucking the pool.

1328
01:18:58,430 --> 01:18:59,570
So he immediately,
you know,

1329
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:03,230
takes a half a pause and then just fucking
walks up to the girl and she's still

1330
01:19:03,231 --> 01:19:05,660
trying to act tough. She's
like, what? You know,

1331
01:19:05,690 --> 01:19:09,560
you know like white girls because they've
watched reality TV now know how to act

1332
01:19:09,561 --> 01:19:13,310
ghetto. She's like what? And throws the
empty plastic cup down on the ground.

1333
01:19:13,311 --> 01:19:16,610
Like she's going to do something.
All right. And the dude,

1334
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:19,430
I thought he was going to wind
up in blast or in the face.

1335
01:19:19,431 --> 01:19:23,060
So at this point I'm watching it with
one eye cause I don't give a fuck what a

1336
01:19:23,061 --> 01:19:27,470
girl does. You never want to see her get
hit, fucking closed fisted. It's, it's,

1337
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:30,640
it's just, it's ugly even though
she threw the drink. But the dude

1338
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:36,110
fucking just, I had to watch
it twice to see what he does.

1339
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:41,120
He does a fucking leg sweep that,
that I swear to God,

1340
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:44,210
he could've beat one of the Gracies
with one of his this, he just,

1341
01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:48,880
it's like the girl standing up
and then she is not, he just went,

1342
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:51,530
I can't believe like from her knees down,

1343
01:19:51,531 --> 01:19:55,040
both those parts of her legs didn't
fly off like a mortar hit him.

1344
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:57,440
That's how fucking he just fucking,

1345
01:19:57,570 --> 01:19:59,900
I'm at literally standing up
acting in and out again. Huh.

1346
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:02,510
This is like when I told the Rosebowl
story back in the day, right.

1347
01:20:02,511 --> 01:20:07,511
He literally just fucking leg sweeps her
and she just goes back down the ground

1348
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:08,100
and she

1349
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:11,400
hits the back of her head on the concrete
and that's the part we like, Ooh,

1350
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:16,440
not good. Funny until the back
of the head hits the concrete.

1351
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:18,280
But she immediately goes like,
ah,

1352
01:20:19,650 --> 01:20:24,210
screaming basically sounding the alarm
for all the guys to come and rescue her,

1353
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:29,310
which they kind of don't. They kind
of all stand up like, hey dude, whoa,

1354
01:20:29,311 --> 01:20:33,360
what's going on? You know, and uh, I know,
you know, why did I try to describe the,

1355
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:36,780
I can't do justice. You have to see
this tough talk in college girl,

1356
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,940
just Google that and spelled tough.

1357
01:20:38,941 --> 01:20:42,150
T U F F and I swear to God,

1358
01:20:43,410 --> 01:20:46,200
like I said,
I don't advocate hitting a woman.

1359
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:51,820
And I think women should respect that
rather than take advantage of it.

1360
01:20:51,821 --> 01:20:56,110
And I really think if you take a full
drink and you throw it in somebody's face,

1361
01:20:56,590 --> 01:21:01,090
you're really taking advantage of that.
A man should never hit a woman. Okay.

1362
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:06,340
And uh, I really have to be honest with
you. If the guy punched her in the face,

1363
01:21:06,341 --> 01:21:07,630
I would have said that he was a Douche.

1364
01:21:07,990 --> 01:21:11,420
But there's something about a
leg sweep that it had a, uh,

1365
01:21:11,421 --> 01:21:15,340
a gentleman quality to
it. You know, in fact,

1366
01:21:15,341 --> 01:21:18,170
that's the comment I left under
the first time the video was up.

1367
01:21:18,370 --> 01:21:19,330
It was taken down,

1368
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:23,740
but the comment I left was
leg sweep equals gentlemen,

1369
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,600
I gotta be honest with you.
I've seen girls get punched.

1370
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:35,550
I've seen them get slapped. Okay.
I've seen a guy, Shaker girl,

1371
01:21:35,551 --> 01:21:39,030
I've seen a dude, choker girl. None of
this I advocate, but I've seen all that.

1372
01:21:39,031 --> 01:21:43,620
I have never seen somebody go
for the legs sweep. And it was,

1373
01:21:43,621 --> 01:21:47,940
it was uh, it was uh, it was
surprising. You know what I mean?

1374
01:21:47,941 --> 01:21:50,550
It's like when you see a movie and you
think you know how it's going to end,

1375
01:21:50,551 --> 01:21:55,410
like oh Jesus. And then the hero comes
in and the white horse and then no, no,

1376
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:59,460
Leonardo Dicaprio gets popped
in the fucking elevator
and you're like, Holy Shit.

1377
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,880
Holy Shit. I didn't see
that common. That's what,

1378
01:22:02,881 --> 01:22:04,560
that's what that fucking
leg sweep was like.

1379
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:09,210
It was like seeing DiCaprio get popped
in the departed fucking phenomenal

1380
01:22:09,570 --> 01:22:12,090
youtube video of the year.
Why don't we have that?

1381
01:22:12,150 --> 01:22:16,470
That's a new segment here on uh,
my Monday morning podcasts. Let's,

1382
01:22:16,471 --> 01:22:19,770
let's have nominees. Okay. Cause
when they nominate the Oscars,

1383
01:22:19,771 --> 01:22:23,850
it's usually like two, three months ahead
of time. That's all I have in December.

1384
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:24,900
You guys just remind me,

1385
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:29,640
we will have the nominees for
youtube video of the year for me.

1386
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:35,130
Okay. Uh, that movie is
like the equivalent to the,

1387
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:38,070
uh,
I'm not going to say there will be blood.

1388
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:41,580
It's more like no country for old men

1389
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:46,570
and all that kid should just had a bowl
cut and just not blinked when he fucking

1390
01:22:46,571 --> 01:22:51,200
did it. And, and that, that I, I
would have bought it on DVD. Um,

1391
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:54,070
all right. So there you go. Okay.
Was that misogynistic enough?

1392
01:22:54,071 --> 01:22:56,710
We always have to have that moment
in this fucking podcast. All right,

1393
01:22:56,711 --> 01:22:59,860
let's wind it down here with the questions
because it's getting late. And, uh,

1394
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:04,780
I gotta get up early here cause I have
a tee time. A whole new stopped on the,

1395
01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:10,270
all right. Questions. Um, hey Mr. Byrd,

1396
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:13,870
how's that for making you feel fucking
old. It did, it did make me feel it.

1397
01:23:13,890 --> 01:23:18,100
All right. All right. Um, I was just
wondering what your thoughts on we're on,

1398
01:23:18,101 --> 01:23:20,200
why people are so easily offended,

1399
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:23,140
especially by foul language.

1400
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:27,850
I thought you might have some insight
here as someone who uses the word cunt and

1401
01:23:27,851 --> 01:23:32,770
fuck quite regularly, um, hey,
guilty as charged. Um, maybe, um,

1402
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:35,410
it has something to do with the
fact that I live in the south,

1403
01:23:35,411 --> 01:23:39,970
but it seems like you dropped
the f bomb here. Oh, I see.

1404
01:23:39,971 --> 01:23:42,520
What you're saying? Uh, maybe it has to
do with the fact that I live in the south,

1405
01:23:42,521 --> 01:23:46,490
that if you drop the f bomb
here or tell someone, um,

1406
01:23:48,370 --> 01:23:51,370
tell someone with all,
all the fucking padding,

1407
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:55,990
why didn't I enlarge this? I am
the worst reader. I'm sorry guys.

1408
01:23:55,991 --> 01:23:57,340
Let me start this again.
Ah,

1409
01:23:57,370 --> 01:23:59,320
maybe has something to do with
the fact that I live in the south,

1410
01:23:59,590 --> 01:24:02,590
but it seems like if you
drop the f bomb here or tell,

1411
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:07,270
tell something to someone without all
the fucking padding and they just lose

1412
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:08,163
their shit.

1413
01:24:09,230 --> 01:24:12,400
And do you think this has something to
do with the Pussy fication of America?

1414
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:18,210
Or do most people just grow up in a
household where ball busting or do most

1415
01:24:18,401 --> 01:24:22,120
people not grow up in a household where
a ball busting is commonplace? Um,

1416
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:25,390
I dunno, you know, when I go across to
America, I don't see a lot of pussies.

1417
01:24:25,391 --> 01:24:30,280
I see a lot of psychos. I just think
in general that, um, this country has,

1418
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:31,541
you know,

1419
01:24:31,541 --> 01:24:36,541
just really become corporate and they
cast a wide net there always commercial

1420
01:24:37,061 --> 01:24:40,750
fishing.
So they're trying not to offend people.

1421
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:46,180
So a lot of the shows on TV as
sort of been a dumbed down I think,

1422
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:48,460
but in general,
I mean,

1423
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:53,200
I live in America and I say
fucking content all the time
as do all of my friends.

1424
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,350
And uh,
there you go.

1425
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:59,920
So I'm defining America by how I behave.

1426
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:05,470
Um, I dunno. I think, I think
certain people grow up, uh,

1427
01:25:05,471 --> 01:25:07,360
with ball busting and other people don't.

1428
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:12,170
And the reality is everybody has
a different line. And I think the,

1429
01:25:12,171 --> 01:25:16,210
the real thing is that people who
get offended are way more organized.

1430
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:22,270
Um, and they complain and they write
letters and people who don't give a fuck,

1431
01:25:22,990 --> 01:25:27,190
don't give a fuck enough to write a letter
to say, I don't give a fuck. You know,

1432
01:25:27,670 --> 01:25:29,160
so there you go.
Did you guys hear that Burp?

1433
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:32,590
That was one of those internal burps that
I heard in my head and I can't tell if

1434
01:25:32,591 --> 01:25:37,120
that was out loud. All right. Um, all
right, let's move onto the next one.

1435
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:42,130
Hey, Bill. Big Fan. Love your community.
And you purchased a fucking Hilarious,

1436
01:25:42,131 --> 01:25:46,750
thank you very much. Uh, I appreciate
that you're doing for free. Thank you.

1437
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:48,550
Anyways,
I have a question for you.

1438
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:52,120
When a comedian such as
yourself records a CD or a DVD,

1439
01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:57,190
is that a one time shot or are you able
to reshoot if you are unhappy with the

1440
01:25:57,191 --> 01:26:01,540
show? Um, it all depends.

1441
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:06,050
Um, I can for the most part, yeah.
If you do like a standup special,

1442
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:09,230
you do a,
you do at least two shows.

1443
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:13,670
I was watching a guy recently on HBO
hype and his special and he was talking

1444
01:26:13,671 --> 01:26:18,320
about working somewhere in Texas and he
was going to do four shows and from the

1445
01:26:18,321 --> 01:26:20,480
four shows he was going to
put together the special,

1446
01:26:20,481 --> 01:26:24,980
but for the most part you do at least two.
So this is how it's worked with me.

1447
01:26:24,981 --> 01:26:29,270
I did a CD called emotionally unavailable,
which is available on iTunes.

1448
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,680
Um, I really need a whore out my
shit more too, by the way. Um,

1449
01:26:34,370 --> 01:26:36,110
but how I did that was,

1450
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:41,860
I taped that at the laff house in
Philadelphia and I was doing four shows to

1451
01:26:41,991 --> 01:26:45,200
Friday and two Saturday
and I taped all the shows.

1452
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:50,860
I listen back to all the shows and I
just liked the second show Saturday night

1453
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:57,920
and I liked it and I got heckled and there
was some awkward moments in it and it

1454
01:26:57,921 --> 01:27:00,350
just sounded like a show.

1455
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:05,330
And what I liked about the old school
comedy albums that I used to listen to

1456
01:27:05,331 --> 01:27:09,200
when I was growing up as
you really felt like, um,

1457
01:27:09,710 --> 01:27:12,650
you were Kinda in the nightclub when you
were listening and that type of thing.

1458
01:27:12,651 --> 01:27:15,170
And it just, I don't know,
with all those pro tool stuff,

1459
01:27:15,171 --> 01:27:20,090
you can really make something sound
really slick. And I, you know,

1460
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:23,390
I think I wrote that in the liner notes.
Wow. I'm really going back a long way.

1461
01:27:23,391 --> 01:27:24,980
I can,
the liner notes actually wrote like,

1462
01:27:24,981 --> 01:27:28,460
I didn't kind of want to splice
together our performance.

1463
01:27:28,461 --> 01:27:32,150
That never really
happened, you know? So, uh,

1464
01:27:32,151 --> 01:27:34,910
and then the other half was I
was fucking lazy and it was true.

1465
01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:39,910
I wasn't gonna go through four hours of
fucking audio and just listening to me

1466
01:27:40,311 --> 01:27:43,010
do the same. I just couldn't fucking
do it. Sounds like, you know what?

1467
01:27:43,011 --> 01:27:45,620
I like that second show Saturday.
So that's how I did that.

1468
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:49,070
That one on the Hbo one,
when I did my half hour,

1469
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:54,110
there was a two tapings and my
first show went really well.

1470
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:55,820
So I knew I had a good special.

1471
01:27:55,821 --> 01:28:00,500
And then I came out the second one and
the second one I was even more loose and

1472
01:28:00,501 --> 01:28:04,520
that one just went ridiculously great.
And afterwards the director was like,

1473
01:28:04,521 --> 01:28:04,821
you know what?

1474
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:08,810
I think that second one was the one
other than this one little joke.

1475
01:28:08,811 --> 01:28:11,150
So why don't we just take one
little joke from the first one,

1476
01:28:11,151 --> 01:28:14,210
stick that in and the rest will be the
second show. And I said, works for me.

1477
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:16,490
So that's how that one went together.

1478
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:20,600
And why do I do this was only one show.

1479
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:27,170
Um, that one. And that
was because of the budget.

1480
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:32,240
Uh, we kind of waited a little too long
to get a theater and we had to spend more

1481
01:28:32,241 --> 01:28:33,320
money than we thought.

1482
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:37,910
And then in the end we only had
the budget to do one of them. So,

1483
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:42,740
um, what you see is what you get on
that one. That was just one, one take.

1484
01:28:42,830 --> 01:28:47,360
And I left out some tags and that type
of shit and it was kind of freaking me

1485
01:28:47,361 --> 01:28:51,380
out in the beginning of the special.
Um, if you look closely in my eyes,

1486
01:28:51,381 --> 01:28:56,060
you'll see it a couple of times.
Um, but then I was just like,

1487
01:28:56,061 --> 01:28:59,540
well fuck it. No one's going to know
that I missed the tags, you know,

1488
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:03,990
this is the special bill. Why don't
you get present and fucking deliver it?

1489
01:29:03,990 --> 01:29:08,610
So I just, you know, um, yeah,
that's how I did that one. But,

1490
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,370
um, yeah, basically speaking, yeah,

1491
01:29:11,371 --> 01:29:14,400
you don't just do one unless
you have no fucking budget.

1492
01:29:14,490 --> 01:29:16,200
Are you fucked up your budget
or something like that.

1493
01:29:16,201 --> 01:29:19,770
So this one that I do and uh,
San Diego,

1494
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:24,480
San Diego and San Francisco, I
am going to be doing too. Um,

1495
01:29:24,510 --> 01:29:27,540
and also I'm going to be doing a
bunch of fucking roadwork before, uh,

1496
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:31,140
before I come up to it. So I'm
going to be extra ready. Um,

1497
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,740
and I actually learned something
last time when I did an hour,

1498
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:39,270
basically when I did my half hour for
HBO was on the road doing 50 minutes.

1499
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:41,190
So to do a half hour was a joke.

1500
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:44,730
It's kind of like if you're doing cardio
for 15 minutes and then one day he did

1501
01:29:44,731 --> 01:29:46,920
30 be easy.
So,

1502
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:50,790
but what I wasn't doing when I trained
for the hour was when I was doing the

1503
01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:55,110
hour I was doing right
about an hour. So, um,

1504
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:59,700
it felt like more work than
doing the half hour. Um,

1505
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:01,590
so this time when I go through,

1506
01:30:01,591 --> 01:30:04,710
I'm going to be doing at least an
hour and 10 an hour and 15 minutes.

1507
01:30:04,740 --> 01:30:09,420
When I'm on stage, especially
September, um, September,

1508
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,600
October, November, I'm, unless
I'm doing three shows at night,

1509
01:30:12,601 --> 01:30:15,300
I won't do that cause I don't
want to back it up at a, you know,

1510
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:20,010
I get actually I am actually really
against doing more than an hour on stage.

1511
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:24,750
I think it becomes a, you
know, people are just like,

1512
01:30:24,751 --> 01:30:28,770
all right and we got it. You're funny.
Or we have to go to work tomorrow. Okay.

1513
01:30:28,771 --> 01:30:31,500
My face hurts.
It's like you're overselling.

1514
01:30:31,501 --> 01:30:34,050
I always feel like when you do more
than an hour, you kind of overselling.

1515
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:38,880
Although I did an hour and 13, I just
uploaded that one from San Francisco,

1516
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:41,400
not where you guys can listen,
where I can listen to it. And uh,

1517
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:44,310
it actually holds together.
I think maybe a,

1518
01:30:44,311 --> 01:30:48,390
I just wasn't in shape enough to do it.
Um, but I just, I don't know. I just find,

1519
01:30:48,391 --> 01:30:51,780
you know, once you get like
an hour, hour and 15 and it's
like, Dude, enough. Enough.

1520
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:54,360
All right. Jesus Christ. Bill,

1521
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:57,450
how many fucking different ways you're
gonna answer that? All right. Overrated.

1522
01:30:57,451 --> 01:31:01,200
Underrated. And then I'm going
to get out of here. Uh, okay.

1523
01:31:02,430 --> 01:31:06,210
Underrated. Uh, Bill
Burke. Thank you. Lewis.

1524
01:31:06,211 --> 01:31:11,130
Black Don Cheadle, Samuel Jackson
Beer. Real hip hop in parentheses,

1525
01:31:11,131 --> 01:31:14,180
common.
Most def to lead

1526
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:17,900
Kweli Kweli I don't know
who the fuck that is.

1527
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:21,960
That he is underrated and I have
no idea who that is. Kanye West.

1528
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:27,360
Okay. How about the fuck is
Kanye West underrated? Uh,

1529
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:31,410
overrated.
Everything on B e t m t v V h one

1530
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:37,980
Sonia Sato mayor. I don't know who that
is. Barack Obama, United States military.

1531
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,400
I was a marine for five years.
Uh,

1532
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:45,510
J fucking Cutler is still
won't help the bears for shit.

1533
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:51,260
Um, you don't actually reminds me, you
know, something. I finally, you know, I,

1534
01:31:51,270 --> 01:31:54,060
I've gotten into some sort
of old school like a hip hop,

1535
01:31:54,061 --> 01:31:57,380
but I just don't know what
the fuck to listen to. Um,

1536
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:59,830
I've kind of talking like late eighties,
early nineties.

1537
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:04,270
Anything pre biggie if he can,
if you've got some shit. Um,

1538
01:32:05,230 --> 01:32:05,591
you know,

1539
01:32:05,591 --> 01:32:09,370
and not just obvious shit that like Kool
moe Dee that they played on like MTV,

1540
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:13,720
like some underground shit like this. Just
stuff that I always hear. I'll be like,

1541
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:15,370
oh, you know, I kinda liked
this guy, the big, oh,

1542
01:32:15,371 --> 01:32:20,371
he was in leaders of the new school or
a WHO's that group Eric sermon was in,

1543
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:24,340
you know, like if you know any of that
shit, if you're going to let me know,

1544
01:32:24,370 --> 01:32:26,020
give me the heads up on that.
I'd like,

1545
01:32:26,050 --> 01:32:30,760
I'd like to download some of that shit
cause uh, I dunno, I'm into it now.

1546
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:34,210
I'm trying to play drums to it and it's
fun again for a challenging. All right.

1547
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:38,330
Another underrated comics, uh,
overrated. Here's an overrated ones.

1548
01:32:38,350 --> 01:32:40,030
This is what kind of an obscure one,

1549
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:44,500
a comp overrated comics who do a
visual bit during their specials,

1550
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:47,740
um,
and acknowledged to the live audience.

1551
01:32:47,741 --> 01:32:50,950
How funny it is that the
CD listeners are left out.

1552
01:32:51,610 --> 01:32:55,030
You made a funny face. We get it. Yeah.
You know what? I think I've done that.

1553
01:32:56,230 --> 01:32:56,680
Or You,

1554
01:32:56,680 --> 01:33:00,490
you're recording a CD and you do a visual
joke and then you comment how everyone

1555
01:33:00,491 --> 01:33:04,840
at home. I wasn't going to understand that
joke. Oh, we're all doing it. All right.

1556
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:07,450
Um, last thing asked bill. Hey,

1557
01:33:07,451 --> 01:33:12,340
bill just started listening to
uninformed last week. Um, and that's my,

1558
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:16,660
uh, show radio show that I do
on a Sirius satellite radio,

1559
01:33:16,661 --> 01:33:20,500
Sirius Xm, whatever the fuck
they call it. And you know what?

1560
01:33:20,501 --> 01:33:22,420
Somebody just sent me a fucking

1561
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:28,140
a thing here on where they
hell you could listen to those

1562
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:31,560
bill, read this. You Fag.

1563
01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:36,120
This is like the new thing everyone's
doing because at one guy uninformed,

1564
01:33:36,121 --> 01:33:36,954
here we go.

1565
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:39,590
Uh,

1566
01:33:39,590 --> 01:33:42,000
all right, here's where you can listen
to all the uninformed shows that,

1567
01:33:42,001 --> 01:33:46,260
that I've done with Joe
to Rosa, uh, for free. Um,

1568
01:33:46,350 --> 01:33:51,120
you can on mini mini,
nova.com.

1569
01:33:51,150 --> 01:33:55,770
M I, N I, mini, m, I, N. I, Nova,

1570
01:33:55,771 --> 01:33:58,860
N O v, a, all lowercase, no spaces.com.

1571
01:34:01,110 --> 01:34:01,800
Uh,
there you go.

1572
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:05,480
You can listen to all of them and we're
going to start doing them again. Uh,

1573
01:34:05,490 --> 01:34:08,250
we had one here in July. I don't even
want to fuck. They even put it out.

1574
01:34:09,090 --> 01:34:12,150
Fucking disappointing. How disorganized
we go with that Shell. But anyways,

1575
01:34:12,270 --> 01:34:16,620
let's get to ask bill here.
Bill, just start a list to
uninformed. We could go. Um,

1576
01:34:16,621 --> 01:34:19,500
I downloaded a package of
all the shows done to date,

1577
01:34:19,770 --> 01:34:24,750
hence the ancient reference anyways.
Uh, you oh cause I said no XM.

1578
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:25,621
Uh,
anyway,

1579
01:34:25,621 --> 01:34:30,270
you mentioned a while ago that you
were really socially awkward as a kid.

1580
01:34:30,690 --> 01:34:34,080
I'd love to hear how you overcame that.
I dropped out of high school at 16,

1581
01:34:34,081 --> 01:34:36,030
and it seems the more
time I spent the loan,

1582
01:34:36,031 --> 01:34:39,870
the harder it gets to inject myself into
any situation that involves other human

1583
01:34:39,871 --> 01:34:44,400
beings. I'm now 21, apparently
and adult, but anytime I have to,

1584
01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:48,630
uh, have to do a task that may involve
other people, it's a real problem.

1585
01:34:48,870 --> 01:34:52,830
Even simple things like taking out
the garbage or going grocery shopping,

1586
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:54,930
make me shake and sweat.

1587
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:58,220
My situation is probably
more severe than yours was,

1588
01:34:58,221 --> 01:35:01,600
but I'd love to hear
any advice, uh, to uh,

1589
01:35:01,670 --> 01:35:06,230
to overcome this nonsense. Um, all right.

1590
01:35:06,890 --> 01:35:10,850
Uh, okay. Well, all right, where
can I start with that shit?

1591
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:15,050
This is all right. Here's how
bad mine was. I was literally,

1592
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:19,640
I would like be at an ATM and if someone
was standing behind me and I had two

1593
01:35:19,641 --> 01:35:20,510
transactions,

1594
01:35:20,511 --> 01:35:24,500
I would only do one and I would get out
of line for fear that the person behind

1595
01:35:24,501 --> 01:35:24,591
me,

1596
01:35:24,591 --> 01:35:27,920
the second I started the
second transaction would
literally beat the shit out of

1597
01:35:27,921 --> 01:35:29,360
me.
Okay.

1598
01:35:29,361 --> 01:35:33,140
Now all this shit is going on in my
head because that's how it worked in my

1599
01:35:33,141 --> 01:35:36,510
family growing up. You know, if you
took too much time, like seeing,

1600
01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:39,080
I have a bunch of brothers,
so we ended up fist fighting.

1601
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:41,450
But until you verbalize it out loud,

1602
01:35:41,451 --> 01:35:45,020
you don't realize how fucking
ridiculous it is. And uh,

1603
01:35:45,290 --> 01:35:50,000
so I don't know what did I do? I
basically, while to become a comedian,

1604
01:35:50,001 --> 01:35:54,740
I was in college at the time and what I
did was I knew that I could barely give

1605
01:35:54,741 --> 01:35:57,830
a book report without
my face turned beet red.

1606
01:35:57,831 --> 01:36:00,060
So what I did was I just
started taking classes,

1607
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:02,840
classes where I knew I'd have
to get up in front of the class.

1608
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:07,220
And the more I did it, the more I
enjoyed it and the more it just,

1609
01:36:07,221 --> 01:36:10,940
it felt awesome. So
what I would do is, um,

1610
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:16,970
I dunno, uh, I get out a piece of
paper, write out what your fear is.

1611
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:20,420
Like what, what are you, what are
you thinking is going to happen?

1612
01:36:20,980 --> 01:36:22,070
So that's another thing too,
man.

1613
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:27,100
You'll spend your whole life cowering
over this great fear that only exists in

1614
01:36:27,201 --> 01:36:28,640
your fucking head.
And I swear to God,

1615
01:36:28,641 --> 01:36:33,641
and that is most times it's just for some
shit that happened when you were a kid

1616
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:37,850
and your brain was foreman,
how it was going to view the world.

1617
01:36:37,851 --> 01:36:40,850
And you just saw some shit or some shit
happened to you at the wrong fucking

1618
01:36:40,851 --> 01:36:45,851
time and then that shit just becomes law
in your head as like a five year old,

1619
01:36:47,150 --> 01:36:47,571
you know,

1620
01:36:47,571 --> 01:36:52,080
and you'll literally 21 years old making
dis fearful decisions of a five year

1621
01:36:52,081 --> 01:36:56,330
old and a believe me, do what I did
that. And I can tell you this, you know,

1622
01:36:56,331 --> 01:36:59,060
you're young enough, we, it's
Kinda easy to undo that shit,

1623
01:36:59,450 --> 01:37:02,510
but if you wait later in life,
like I kind of did it with a lot of stuff.

1624
01:37:02,810 --> 01:37:03,261
What it is,

1625
01:37:03,261 --> 01:37:08,261
is that little seed of a fucked up thought
kind of grows into this big fucking

1626
01:37:08,301 --> 01:37:12,920
oak tree that you got to hack
down. So what I would do is, uh,

1627
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,950
you know, um, I dunno, what the
fuck can you do? I don't know what,

1628
01:37:18,951 --> 01:37:22,010
I don't know what you do for
a living. I would, you know,

1629
01:37:22,011 --> 01:37:26,030
try to be more social at work.
Try to shoot the shit,

1630
01:37:27,260 --> 01:37:31,160
uh, get involved in something. If you're
good at sports, join a softball league.

1631
01:37:31,161 --> 01:37:33,440
If you play an instrument,
start jamming with other people.

1632
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:37,940
You got to get yourself into the
mix of people and uh, you know,

1633
01:37:37,941 --> 01:37:40,760
it's Kinda like a, you know, I knew
somebody who really sucked at driving,

1634
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:44,090
you know, and they were freaking
out about it. And just so you know,

1635
01:37:44,091 --> 01:37:47,810
the more they did it, it's just
like stand up. If you swear to God,

1636
01:37:47,811 --> 01:37:49,130
I would never show you guys these tastes.

1637
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:51,820
But if you could ever see video of
when I first started doing standup,

1638
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:53,720
when I got on stage,
I was so fucking nervous.

1639
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:56,910
I never stopped moving the
whole time I was on stage.

1640
01:37:57,270 --> 01:38:00,810
I will get on stage and I would just pace
the entire time that would be pouring

1641
01:38:00,811 --> 01:38:02,940
sweat.
It's like,

1642
01:38:03,870 --> 01:38:08,870
it's almost like a performance art or
some avant garde cause it doesn't even

1643
01:38:08,911 --> 01:38:10,470
fucking make sense when you watch it.
I said,

1644
01:38:10,471 --> 01:38:13,650
I can't believe I ever even got
any laughs. But as he, you know,

1645
01:38:13,651 --> 01:38:16,640
years went by and the more shows I did,
the more comfortable I got,

1646
01:38:16,650 --> 01:38:18,150
the more presence I could be.

1647
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:22,200
And that's basically how to do it.

1648
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:25,620
But don't be tough on yourself. Just
know you're going to bomb the same way.

1649
01:38:25,621 --> 01:38:29,580
I bombed as a comedian. And, uh, I dunno,

1650
01:38:29,610 --> 01:38:33,810
find humor in your
shortcomings, you know, and uh,

1651
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:36,810
just keep working on it. And,
uh, you know, believe me, dude,

1652
01:38:36,811 --> 01:38:38,910
you're not just going to start
talking to somebody in the next day.

1653
01:38:38,911 --> 01:38:43,740
You're not going to be, you know,
shy or whatever. So give you,

1654
01:38:43,741 --> 01:38:48,600
give yourself permission to fuck up for
awhile as you work your way through it.

1655
01:38:48,990 --> 01:38:53,250
Don't do this shit where you kind of
say half a sentence and then you get

1656
01:38:53,251 --> 01:38:56,250
freaked out, and then you stop. And
then the person's looking at you like,

1657
01:38:56,251 --> 01:38:56,821
what the fuck?

1658
01:38:56,821 --> 01:39:01,110
And then you feel like a Douche and then
you don't try it again until the next

1659
01:39:01,110 --> 01:39:04,740
decade. That's not the way
to go. All right, you're 21.

1660
01:39:04,741 --> 01:39:09,000
You should be out there drinking should
be out there banging fucking whores and,

1661
01:39:09,190 --> 01:39:12,180
uh, having a good time because
someday you're going to get married.

1662
01:39:12,570 --> 01:39:14,030
And even if you have a great marriage,

1663
01:39:14,050 --> 01:39:17,970
the level of responsibility and the taxes
and what the fucking bankers do to you,

1664
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:23,190
he life's gonna suck. So, uh,
yeah, you can do it. Do it. Don't,

1665
01:39:23,191 --> 01:39:25,770
don't, don't, don't fucking, just
don't be too hard on yourself.

1666
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:28,140
That's the biggest thing. When you're
trying to learn new shit, just know,

1667
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:31,500
give yourself permission to suck out at
the beginning and then Bam. There you go.

1668
01:39:31,501 --> 01:39:34,920
How's that? There's a nice feel, good
way to end this podcast. You know,

1669
01:39:34,921 --> 01:39:38,730
I started off the fuck was
I talking about coffee,

1670
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:41,280
golf and then a leg sweeping a chick,
you know,

1671
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:44,940
was looked like it was going to go off
the rails and look at it ended very

1672
01:39:44,941 --> 01:39:49,660
nicely. See, I'm not all bad. Am
I? All right. There you go. Well,

1673

I think I'll be doing like
fucking cranberry juice.

1681
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:17,220
And the line is that what the
fuck I'm going to do? Jesus.

1682
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:21,030
That's going to be fucking brutal. All
right. You guys have a good week. And uh,

1683
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:23,520
that is all hate.
And the new segment,

1684
01:40:23,521 --> 01:40:27,560
is that a nominees for youtube
clip of the year? Well,

1685
01:40:27,570 --> 01:40:30,150
maybe we'll do other month, whatever.
We'll work it out as we do it.

1686
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:32,250
All right guys. All right.
Have a good week. Take it easy.
