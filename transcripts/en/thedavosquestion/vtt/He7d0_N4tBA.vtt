00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.470
This year, you have the opportunity to go
to Davos for the World Economic Forums' Annual Meeting

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.700
And put forward your idea. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
My name is Rebeccea McQuigg

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.000
I'm Julia Lalla-Maharajh

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Hi I'm Sloane Berrent

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.500
I was chosen to go to Davos in 2009 to attend Davos

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.900
I was the 2010 MySpace WallStreet Journal Citizen Journalist 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.900
I was chosen in 2010 to attend Davos

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.900
One of the key topics this year's agenda is how 
everyone can benefit from economic prosperity - inclusive growth

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.500
Did you know that the global economy is worth over 70 trillion dollars,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.500
and yet over 3 billion people live on less than $2.00 a day?
How do we close this gap?

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.800
Upload and submit your video describing ONE idea
that you think can drive inclusive growth.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
If your idea is chosen, you'll have the opportunity to
present it in front of people who can make it real.
