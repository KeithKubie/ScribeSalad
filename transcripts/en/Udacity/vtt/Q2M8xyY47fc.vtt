00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.670
It looks like Maura didn't really get anywhere by adding

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.530
age as color to her plot. But I want you to

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.540
know that's okay. Sometimes when we conduct exploratory data analysis

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.210
we do reach dead ends. Let's see if we can get

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.480
any further in examining our relationship between friends count and

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.270
age by adding a third variable. Previously we noted that female

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.710
users have more friends on average than male users. And, we

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.420
might wonder, is this just because female users have a different

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.700
age distribution? Or, maybe conditional on age, the differences

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.590
are actually larger. Here's a box plot of ages by

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.760
gender. Now, I'm going to add the mean for

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.390
each gender to the box plots, using stat summary. Here

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.500
we can see the averages marked by an x

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.380
since I used shape=4. Since male users are a bit

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.890
younger, we might actually think a simple male to

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.870
female comparison doesn't capture their substantial differences in friend count.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.860
Let's look at median friend count by age and gender instead.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.660
A lot of this code should look familiar, and if it doesn't,

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.850
I want you to post any questions that you have about

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.680
it in a discussion. When I run this code, we can see

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.630
that nearly everywhere the median friend count is larger for women

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.910
than it is for men. Now there are some exceptions, and this

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.570
includes these noisy estimates for our very old users. Now, I'm

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.960
using old with quotation marks here, since we're not really confident about

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.600
these reported ages. And notice that users reporting to be

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.230
70, have more or less the same friend count, regardless

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.880
of reported gender. You're going to reproduce the same plot,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.340
but first let's see if you can create the summary data

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.270
to create it. Recall that we can produce the same

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.240
summary data underlying this plot by using the D plier package.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.680
We can divide the data by age and gender and

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.350
then compute the median and mean friend count for each sub-group.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.970
In this next program assignment you're going to do just that by

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.570
using the group by, summarize, and arrange functions from the dplyr package.
