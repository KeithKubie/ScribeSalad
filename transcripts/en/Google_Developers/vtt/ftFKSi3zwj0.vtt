00:00:03.325 --> 00:00:04.010
Thank you.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.850
Thank you very much.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.250
Today I want to talk
to you about how

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.580
to make your users fall
in love with your apps.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.690
I don't hear myself, so
if I shouting too much,

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.700
tell me so, OK?

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.810
Feel free, it's a conversation.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.810
Have you ever asked yourself,
why we are so addicted,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.380
why we are so connected
to such devices?

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.720
Why can't we take
our hands off it?

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.640
Let's put it in a different way.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.940
How can we make our users
fall in love with applications

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.570
that we are creating.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.550
And this is exactly what I
want to talk to you today.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.150
I'm going to talk a
little bit about UI,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.340
user experience, and emotions.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.900
And then we're going to
make a deep dive into love.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.660
We are going to talk
about human love,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.610
and the way we are falling
in love with applications.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.810
So stay tuned.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.980
I'm so excited.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.950
If you want to make a great
application, first of all,

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.750
you have to make a nice UI.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.209
And this is what the
Android guidelines tell us.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.610
Easy to use, and
easy to understand.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.330
OK, here's an example.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.840
This is from a gas
station in Israel.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.570
I would kindly ask you to
raise your finger and point

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.420
to the screen.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.560
Come on, don't be shy.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.660
Point to the screen,
and dial a number

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.580
that you all very well know.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.895
Try to dial a number.

00:01:21.895 --> 00:01:23.560
Do that?

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.630
You simply fail.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.241
No way that you can do this.

00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:26.740
Why?

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.360
Because a smart guy tried
to be very smart here,

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.390
and he twisted the keypad.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.270
So people try to press 10
to the number, the pin code,

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.645
and then they
press the Continue.

00:01:37.645 --> 00:01:38.820
See the Continue?

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.350
It's all tiered out.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.960
Why is that?

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.460
Because they are clicking
something, it all goes wrong,

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.360
and they do it again
and again and again.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.500
And then they move the finger
toward the assistance button,

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.880
which is located on the
right side of the keypad.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.670
How do I know that?

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.002
Look at the white line.

00:01:57.002 --> 00:01:58.960
Do you see the white line
above my yellow line?

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.050
Is the path of despair.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.840
People try, and try, and
try, and move the finger

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.760
along the keypad, and
simply fail to do this.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.320
Now this is a really lousy UI.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.270
You really don't
want to make such UI.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.240
This is really bad.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.350
If we're talking about
UX, there's experience.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.070
If we are talking
about experience,

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.290
we're talking about emotions.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.780
Now, how do we use our
emotions while interacting

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.350
with applications?

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.250
Back in the '90s, the
late Professor Nass,

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.690
here-- from
California, actually--

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.560
suggested a great
model named, CASA.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.480
Remember that, Computers
As Social Agents.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.300
What he stated was that we are
human beings treating computers

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.920
and applications
and devices just

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.210
as we're treating human beings.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.610
That is, we tend to see humans
in the devices and applications

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.810
that we are using.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.800
This is exactly why
applications drives you nuts

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.490
And this is why you
love applications,

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.715
and you hate applications.

00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:00.570
Nobody love or hate
the chair, right?

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.520
You love or hate an application.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.690
And this is the
model that he used.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.240
And if we're talking about
the emotions, what about one

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.370
of the strongest
emotions on earth?

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.330
Love.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.980
We are told to talk about love.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.800
Why?

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.870
First, it is a very
important emotion.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.280
And B, even more important
than that, we all-- designers,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.570
and developers, and startups,
entrepreneurs-- all of us

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.890
want to create applications
that people somewhere

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.770
will love and use.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.830
So let's have a look at love.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.670
And this is my
talk is all about.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.760
We are going to talk
about love, and then we'll

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.360
understand why we fall in
love with applications,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.000
and then we'll understand
why we cheat on applications,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.100
and so forth.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.130
So let's start by
talking about love.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.400
Am I speaking too
fast, as always?

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.730
Is it OK?

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.820
OK, I keep on talking too fast.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.640
20 years as a User
Experience Designer.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.140
I'm older than most
of you, probably.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.920
I keep on hearing, Jacob, make
me something sexy, something

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.520
attractive, something
lovable, something

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.920
that users will like to use.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.670
Now, is it a way of talking?

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.960
No, it isn't.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.280
We have ancient,
subconscious mating patterns,

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.620
and we use them
toward applications.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.940
We are falling in love
with applications.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.590
Well, OK.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.440
So if we want to
understand how we

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.149
fall in love with
applications, first thing to do

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:23.420
is to better understand how we
fall in love with each other,

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.750
as human beings.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.270
Now there are many, many
theories regarding love.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.840
This is an average of
many, many theories.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.140
First of all, there is
the falling in love stage.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.400
The first phase.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.050
The stars are shining,
the birds are singing.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.800
The sky's so blue,
where are you, my love?

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.040
Do you know this feeling?

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.660
This is a short,
very intensive stage.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.200
Then comes four years of love.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.830
Why four years?

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.240
That's life, sorry.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.050
Why four years?

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.230
Because most theories assumed
that this is the time that it

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.780
takes us to get the
kid born and raise

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.000
him or her til the
stage that he or she

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.780
can place with the rest
of the kids of the tribe.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.935
Four years, and then,
unfortunately-- or fortunately,

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:05.475
it's by the eye
of the beholder--

00:05:05.475 --> 00:05:07.940
there's a loss of interest.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.280
This is love.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.940
Enough with love, let's
talk about application.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.050
OK, Draw Something.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.351
Anybody play Draw
Something around here?

00:05:15.351 --> 00:05:15.850
Yes.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.050
Anybody's playing
Draw Something now?

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.950
Hm.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.210
Let's look at Draw
Something statistics.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.010
It started as a discovery.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.660
Then it went on to
long-term usage.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.020
Needless to say, much
shorter than four years.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.420
It was almost four months.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.000
But it was a plateau, and
then, lost of interest.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.290
Look familiar to you?

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.580
Yes it does, and it should.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.510
Why?

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.410
Because we are subconsciously
falling in love

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.241
with applications we use.

00:05:44.241 --> 00:05:45.740
And if you will
understand that, you

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.970
will better know how
to design applications.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.940
Now, since I know that
you don't believe me,

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.930
let's address a more
credible source.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.460
MTV Networks made a big
research a few years ago.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.430
How do we engage
with applications?

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.650
Guess what they found?

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.770
They found that there are
four stages-- the discovery,

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.960
and then the adoption, and
then the trial that you try,

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.060
and then you decide
if you keep it or not.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.410
This is exactly the path
of love, completely.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.140
So here's my tip.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.990
Think about love
when you design.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.790
Here's something that you, I'm
sure that when you attended

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.320
I/O, you didn't think that
you were going to hear.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.990
Each of you is working, let's
say, on an application, or part

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.720
of an application,
or model, or so.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.565
Try to think about
the project that you

00:06:28.565 --> 00:06:31.083
are working right
now as human being.

00:06:31.083 --> 00:06:34.120
Call him-- give
it a name, and try

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.420
to think, what will make
other people love this person?

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.080
Again, think about
the application

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.090
that you are working
now as a human being,

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.550
and try to think what
will make people love it.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.900
You'll be suprised.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.910
So we know about now
that we are falling

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.180
in love with applications.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.850
And we know about
now that hopefully we

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.650
are using it subconsciously.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.330
So here's a great question.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.620
What makes us fall in love
with a certain person?

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.140
As you understand the
logic of this talk by now,

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.070
I always start talking
about human beings,

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.170
and then switch to applications.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.510
So here are results
of a 20,000 people--

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:18.700
men, actually-- survey in
Yotango, which were asked,

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.350
what attracts you?

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:21.660
As simple as that.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.320
And here goes the data.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.800
First of all, sexual chemistry.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.280
God knows what it is,
but it's something

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.660
has to do with sexual chemistry.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.200
And then comes the
smile, then the kindness,

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.580
then sense of humor.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.010
Fifth list general body type.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.890
Love this one, general
body type, probably the way

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:37.670
she looks.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.950
And then the eyes, and
then the intelligence.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.830
Then communication skills, teeth
and lips, and finally, hair.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.750
And I keep telling my
wife, invest your time

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.610
in improving your smile,
not making up your hair.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.020
But she don't listen to me.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.230
So this is what happens
when you fall in love.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.180
This is what attracts men.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.660
Three months later,
here are the results.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.680
It's changing.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.980
For example, sexual chemistry
drops from the first place

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.470
to the fourth place.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.200
Smile goes to the sixth place.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.420
Kindness, surprise,
surprise, first place.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.650
And sense of humor,
second place.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.960
Anybody can predict
what will be the next.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.850
Very simple, it's written on
the board, communication skills.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.730
From eighth place to the
third place, surprising.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.430
This is the picture
of how it looks.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.040
Now there's something
really serious, here.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.880
You have to think about
what attracts human beings

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.159
to human beings when you
design applications, right.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:36.350
You have to think
about it not only

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.080
during the launch
of the application,

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.669
but a few months later.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:43.789
And we're going to get back
to that very, very soon.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.400
But let's get back to
the first impression.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.780
I have marked in
red a few items.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.770
It's the smile.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.520
It's the general body
type, it's the eyes,

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.600
it's the teeth and
lips, and it's the hair.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.600
Why is that?

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.140
All of them has in common
one thing, they are visual.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.970
Five out of ten characteristics
which actually drives

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.260
our attention while getting
attracted to a person

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.430
are visual.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.060
Therefore, when you
design an application,

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:14.280
you have to think about the
visuals very, very carefully.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.370
Now if I would tell you, make
great looking applications,

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.380
it's like telling you nothing.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.090
You have to know what to do.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.270
So, back to the 17th century.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:23.910
Really.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.930
17th century, the golden
ratio was presented.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:30.180
That is, if we have a picture
with distinguished area

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:35.170
inside it, the ratio between
the length and the size

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:39.420
of the areas will determine if
it will perceived as beautiful

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.390
or not.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:43.950
And these are the
correct ratios.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.010
Here is an example.

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.120
Let's turn it, and
let's see this picture.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.640
Recognize this lady?

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.530
The Mona Lisa.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:52.340
She is not the most
beautiful woman on earth.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.700
She is not sex machine.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.840
But when you see
this picture, people

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.000
can't move their eyes off it.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.710
Why?

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:01.690
I guess that you've
guessed by now.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:07.110
Because she completely,
exactly, obey the golden ratio.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:13.040
Now let's turn into a more ugly
face, also known as me, OK.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.060
So this is Google+,
sorry, here's Google+,

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.550
and you can see the
upper section, here.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.120
And surprise, surprise,
surprise, golden ratio

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.680
works here, just almost perfect.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:29.060
A little tip to Google, just
make this part of the screen,

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:32.030
this picture, a little bit
wider, and you're perfect.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.720
But it's almost there.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.040
This is why we are
attracted to that.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.810
So here's my tip-- create
beautiful interfaces.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:41.180
Forget it, never mind.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.305
I thought that you will be
finding some [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:43.305 --> 00:10:44.050
there, but OK.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.820
Always question jokes.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.510
OK, just a short reminder.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.970
We are using subconscious
mating patterns.

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:54.500
Therefore, a short
question-- what is this?

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.430
It's Google Play?

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.860
Forget about it, it's a bar.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.420
It's a bar full of
beautiful people.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.290
When you get into
a bar, and you want

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.120
to talk to someone tonight,
have beer, talk, and chat,

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.850
and so forth, you have lots
of faces that you don't know.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.960
And you have to think, or
select somebody to talk to.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.140
This is exactly
what happens here.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:24.500
Actually, I have compared the
top 100 apps in Google Play

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.450
to the lower 100 of
the top of the line.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:31.306
And it can be easily
observed that the graphics

00:11:31.306 --> 00:11:34.800
are completely different, OK.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.590
If I may say so, you
don't get a second chance

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:39.040
for first impression.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.710
Now, I'm in the same
industry as you are.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:45.360
And we are talking about
clean startups, and lean UX,

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.440
and agile development,
and so forth.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.660
And show seekers.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.970
But, keep in mind-- invest
the minimum in graphics,

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.106
otherwise people won't
love your applications.

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.830
We spoke about the way it looks.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.780
Now here, let's have a
deeper look about moves.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.370
Now it you're talking look,
talking about materials,

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.020
there's a nice guideline,
presented only yesterday.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.080
Try to read it.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.710
And we are talking
about the physics

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.610
of the animations [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:14.650
It should as a
mass, and it should

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:18.460
obey to the law of gravity, and
law of physics, and so forth.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.510
But I want to add
something else.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.890
Let's talk about dance.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:25.903
I know you didn't
expect it, it's OK.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.950
Dr. Nick Neave, from the
UK, made a very interesting

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:32.600
research.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.740
He took videos of three,
four, five men, dancing.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.250
Then he presented
these men to women

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.420
and asked them to evaluate
how attractive these men are,

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.900
on a scale kind of 1 to 9.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.490
That's very easy to do.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.600
Now, in addition, he took
blood tests from these men.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.380
It's looking for genetical
mutation, that is, how

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.520
genetically wise,
healthy, are they?

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.985
And surprise,
surprise, the men that

00:12:58.985 --> 00:13:01.810
were evaluated as
the more attractive,

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.980
according to their
dance were those

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.460
who had to the little
genetical mutation.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.130
Put it in a different way.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:14.330
When a woman see
a man dancing, she

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.290
can tell by the
way you dance, what

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:21.370
would be the quality of the
genes that you can supply her.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:23.600
Sounds weird, but
it's completely true.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.500
And it doesn't work vice versa.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.470
That is, when a man
see a woman dancing,

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.825
he can tell nothing about
the quality of the genes.

00:13:30.825 --> 00:13:31.980
It was tested.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.070
Really, I'm not kidding.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:34.570
Now what does it
have to do with us?

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.550
It has a lot to do with us.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:41.020
Women are attracted to the
healthier men by their dance.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.730
Now, what is a good dance?

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.280
He checked that, and there
are three major factors.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.050
1, it should be symmetrical.

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.810
B, it should be smooth.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.820
And 3, it should involve
body core movement,

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.880
that is the torso, and so forth.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.640
Now, try to look at
animations that you know.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.850
All great animations show
the exact movement patterns

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.570
as great dancers.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:03.420
Why is that?

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.630
Remember the CASA, remember the
theory that I presented before?

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.650
We are using subconscious
mating patterns.

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.680
And this is exactly
what happens here.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.180
When we see an animation
dance, we actually

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.280
see a man or a woman dancing.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.720
And we are attracted
to this animation

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.730
because it is a good dance.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.280
This is why good animation
never flips this way.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.110
Because you can't
dance this way.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.460
But animations do flip this way.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.309
That was a lousy
dance by me, sorry.

00:14:32.309 --> 00:14:33.350
But you know what I mean.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:36.050
And this is why animation goes
down, because there's gravity,

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:37.320
and it goes up.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.600
So here is my
little tip for you.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.400
When you are alone
in your room-- alone,

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.540
let me emphasize this
point-- get off your chair

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.210
and dance the animation
that you have just designed.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:51.590
If you can dance the animation
that you have just created,

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:52.870
perfect animation.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:57.420
If it looks something like this,
back to the drawing board, OK.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.300
I'm really serious.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.170
That's the tragic of my life, I
real serious, and people laugh.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.070
No, I'm just kidding, it's OK.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.520
So think of animation
as a dancer.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.320
And since I have
only two minutes,

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.210
I want to talk to you,
last but not least,

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:14.800
about how can we
keep love going on?

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.550
A short reminder--
we all start here,

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:22.080
and then unfortunately,
we are going here.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.740
And this is exactly
the stage when

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:28.120
you as an entrepreneur, or a
software developer, or company

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.280
owner, say, oh, they don't
love my application anymore,

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.360
they don't like it.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.780
How can we keep our vows?

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.960
OK, you know the system by now.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.170
If we want to better understand
how to keep the vows,

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:43.020
we have to better
understand what

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.950
happens in our interpersonal
relationship, how loyal are we?

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:48.490
And we are not that loyal.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:51.380
Actually, when you
ask people, why

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.840
do you leave the applications?

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.030
About half of them will
say, because there's

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:58.450
nothing new over there.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.830
No new content, no new
interaction, no new visuals,

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:02.710
nothing new.

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:03.820
So I'm getting bored.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.600
It's not interesting anymore.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.650
It's just the same as
many divorced couples

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:12.610
say, people who want to divorce.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:13.510
She's boring.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:17.210
I know exactly what my husband
is going to say, and so forth.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:21.330
Read some marriage consulting
papers, you'll find it.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.620
So what is the
advice to avoid this?

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.290
Very simple.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:27.590
Make it look a little
different, from time to time.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:30.430
That is, in a sense
you can take the graph

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:33.220
from this point
back to the love.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.690
Now since it sounds very
vague, here is an example.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:43.250
How many times was Gmail changed
during the last few years?

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.840
Let's look at the Android,
it started in 2010,

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.760
and then Gingerbread '11,
and then Ice Cream Sandwich,

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.850
and then Jelly Bean,
and then KitKat.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:57.050
You can easily see that this is
the same family of interaction.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.530
This the same family
of graphic design.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:03.100
It's just as if me in my
first days of my marriage,

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.940
the second day of
my marriage I find

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.520
something new to
surprise my wife.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.260
And so forth, and so forth.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.440
And this is something
that you want to do.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:16.440
You should and want to supply
constant minor changes.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.810
Even though there's no
technical or UI need for that.

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:23.420
Keep on surprising your users.

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.730
But keep in mind, don't
make too big surprise.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:30.520
Otherwise, the guy you were just
married is changed completely,

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.760
and we don't want to
live with this guy.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.260
I really want to
thank you for being

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:36.426
with me at the last session.

00:17:36.426 --> 00:17:37.520
Thank you very much.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.540
Thank you.
