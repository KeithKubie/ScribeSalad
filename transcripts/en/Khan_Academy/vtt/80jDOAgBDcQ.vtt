00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.990
- [Instructor] Assume that
the United States economy

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.460
is currently in a short run equilibrium

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.430
with the actual unemployment rate above

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.160
the natural rate of unemployment.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.550
Part A says draw a single
correctly labeled graph

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.840
with both the long run Phillips curve

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.140
and the short run Phillips curve.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.780
Label the current short
run equilibrium point P.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.220
So like always, pause this video,

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.230
get a pencil and paper out

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.760
and see if you can sketch this yourself

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.240
before we work through this together.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.600
You'll get more out of this video.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.720
Alright, now let's do this together.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.580
So if we're thinking
about Phillips curves,

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.950
we're going to, we're gonna have two axes.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.720
Our horizontal axis is going
to be the unemployment rate.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.210
Unemployment rate,

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.130
which is going to
expressed as a percentage.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.590
And our vertical axis is going
to be our inflation rate,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.470
which is going to be
expressed inflation rate,

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.640
which is also going to be
expressed as a percentage.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.130
So let's start with the
long run Phillips curve.

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.460
So the long run Phillips curve,

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.410
that's just going to be fixed

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.360
at the natural rate of unemployment,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.480
so that's just going
to be a vertical line.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.310
So let's just put that right over there

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.210
and let me label it.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.370
That is our long run Phillips curve

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.080
and now let's do the
short run Phillips curve.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.720
Well, the short run Phillips curve

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.230
sews this association
between our inflation rate

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.380
and our unemployment rate.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.400
High rates of inflation are associated

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.410
with low unemployment,

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.130
and low rates of inflation are associated

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.970
with high rates of unemployment.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.550
And so our short run Phillips curve

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.510
is going to look something,
something like that,

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.400
and so let me just label
that short run Phillips curve

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.160
and now they want us to label

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.250
the current short run equilibrium point P.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.730
So a lot of times when people
talk about equilibrium points,

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.720
it's tempting to just
look at the intersection

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.270
of these two curves,

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.130
but that wouldn't be the case here.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.230
The equilibrium point is
going to be some point

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.740
along our short run Phillips curve.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.230
In fact, every point on our
short run Phillips curve

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.770
represents a potential equilibrium point.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.410
If we were looking at aggregate demand

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.920
versus aggregate supply,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.710
well then our equilibrium point would be

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.950
at the intersection of
the aggregate demand

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.070
and short run aggregate supply,

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.530
but here, our equilibrium
point could be any point

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.520
along our short run Phillips curve,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.780
and they say that we're
currently in a place

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.380
where the actual unemployment rate

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.930
is above the natural rate of unemployment,

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.130
so the natural rate of
unemployment is here,

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.610
the actual rate of unemployment is higher,

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.580
but we're going to be on our
short run Phillips curve,

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.870
so we could be at a point just like that.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.330
So let's just label that point P.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.820
So part B says assuming no
policy actions are taken,

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.130
will the short run Phillips
curve shift to the right,

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.850
or upward, shift to the left and downward,

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.110
or remain the same in the long run.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.440
Explain.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.670
So pause this video again

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.900
and see if you could work through that

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.990
before I do that with you.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.100
So the way to think about this is

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.100
when aggregate output,
aggregate output is less than,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.160
less than full employment output,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.720
you have higher unemployment
rate and lower inflation.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.130
You have a higher unemployment
rate above the natural rate,

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.190
higher unemployment rate,
and lower inflation.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.570
This decreases inflation expectations.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.570
This decreases inflation expectations.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.700
So one way to think about it,

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.500
at a given unemployment rate,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.640
you will over time have
a lower inflation rate

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.320
because of the lowered
inflation expectations.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.920
And so instead of our inflation
rate being right over there,

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.640
it might be right over here.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.050
And so for this point on
our short run Phillips curve

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.960
instead of the inflation rate being there,

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.640
it might be over there.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.260
And so it would actually shift
the short run Phillips curve

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.420
to the left and downwards.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.070
Now, they're not asking us to draw that

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.510
so I don't wanna do that here.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.910
I just did that to hopefully
help explain the intuition,

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.700
but I will just answer their
question right over here.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.700
So this, so this shifts, shifts
the short run Phillips curve

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.750
left slash downward, downward.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.510
Alright, part C.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.460
If the Federal Reserve Bank
wants to lower unemployment,

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.270
what expansionary open market
operation should it use?

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.060
So pause the video again and
see if you can answer that.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.520
Well, there's several tools
that the Federal Reserve Bank

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.080
can use to lower unemployment.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.010
It could change the reserve
requirements for banks,

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.220
but here they're explicitly talking about

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.230
open market operations,

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.890
and so the typical open market operation

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.020
that the Federal Reserve Bank would do

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.710
if it wants to lower unemployment,

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.210
it wants to inject more
money into the economy.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.240
It wants to increase the
amount of reserves in banks

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.610
which will of course
increase the money supply.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.430
And so to do that,

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.520
they will go out into the
open market and buy bonds.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.520
So the Federal Reserve
Bank will buy bonds.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.490
Remember, when they're buying bonds,

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.820
the people who sell those bonds will take

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.600
those Federal Reserve Notes,
deposit them in banks,

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.070
that will increase the
reserves of the banks,

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.300
the banks will be able to lend more,

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.130
and the money supply will increase.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.080
Part D, how will the open market operation

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.840
you identified in part C
affect each of the following,

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.370
federal funds rate, explain.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.460
So I just touched on it.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.460
We can say buying bonds
will increase bank reserves,

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.340
bank reserves, which will lead

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.230
the federal funds rate to go down.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.230
So the fed funds rate will decrease.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.880
Remember, the federal
funds rate is the rate

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.320
which banks borrow
reserves from each other.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.000
If there is a total of more reserves now,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.320
well then there's less demand to borrow

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.500
and there's more supply of reserves,

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.190
so the cost of borrowing,
which is the interest rate,

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.550
the federal funds rate, will decrease.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.380
Real interest rate in the short run.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.150
Well, this will also decrease.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.883
Also decrease.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.520
An increase in the money supply,

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.193
so I could say an increase,

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.340
increase in reserves slash
money supply, money supply,

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.080
will decrease nominal
and real interest rates,

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:32.240
interest rates in the short
run, in the short run.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.870
There is a situation where maybe you have

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.480
run away inflation, the
nominal rates go down,

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.840
but somehow that doesn't
affect the real rate as much,

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.720
but in the short run, we
can pretty confidently say

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.450
that if nominal interest
rates are going down

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:49.020
that real interest rates
will go down as well.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.940
And then there's a last part
here that is off the screen

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.070
and it says given your
answer in part D two,

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.440
this last part, what is the effect on

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.670
real gross domestic product,
GDP, in the short run?

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.440
Explain.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:07.440
Well, lower real interest
rates, interest rates,

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:16.670
lead to more interest, interest sensitive,

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:24.083
interest sensitive
consumption, consumption

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.060
and investment, investment,

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.750
and we're talking about investment,

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:36.240
we could talk about plant
and equipment, equipment,

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.380
which should increase GDP, real GDP.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:48.380
Which should increase
real GDP in the short run,

00:08:53.003 --> 00:08:57.883
in the short run, and we are done.
