00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.930
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah, any
questions about this?

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:20.630
Yeah.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.510
AUDIENCE: I actually have two.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.695
One's an incidental question.

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:24.445
You keep mentioning
something that I never

00:00:24.445 --> 00:00:26.577
heard of called "ardeeno",
or something like that.

00:00:26.577 --> 00:00:27.285
PROFESSOR 1: Yes.

00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:28.620
AUDIENCE: What is that?

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.060
PROFESSOR 1: Arduino is a tiny
little microcontroller-- not

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.860
related to video games, really.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.600
But it's a tiny little
microcontroller.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.150
And you connect it
up to a circuit,

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.960
and then it can tell an LED
to blink every five seconds.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.570
And it can detect when
you press a button,

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.327
and it can read off
of a light sensor,

00:00:49.327 --> 00:00:50.410
whether the lights are on.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.660
So it's a little
kind of computer chip

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.030
that you program to do
one particular task that

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.057
connects out to the world.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:58.640
AUDIENCE: So then
the more generally--

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.812
I'm curious what the connection
with Kinect is in this course.

00:01:03.812 --> 00:01:06.562
If we didn't want to use
Kinect, is that an option?

00:01:06.562 --> 00:01:09.020
The reason I'm a little nervous
is because I don't own one,

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.330
and I don't have access to one.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.290
So if I end up building
something that requires Kinect,

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.022
then I won't be able to use it.

00:01:15.022 --> 00:01:15.730
PROFESSOR 1: Yes.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.770
So you can buy a Kinect that'll
work with a PC for about $200.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.130
If you don't want to use
a Kinect, that's fine.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.220
We have four Kinects
and computers with Unity

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.360
that is all set up to use it.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.390
So if you want to use a
Kinect, you have the resources.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.367
AUDIENCE: OK-- not a necessary
part of doing this course.

00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:36.950
PROFESSOR 1: Not a
necessary part, no.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.470
AUDIENCE: --to Unity and
focus on web apps or whatever.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.720
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.700
You could do your
own thing, totally.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.700
And the Kinect is--

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.900
really, it's amazingly simple.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.350
So if you have a game
that connects with a mouse

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.190
click and a drag, then you
can instantly take the Kinect

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.230
and say, where it was
a mouse click and drag,

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.060
make it the palm.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.400
And it takes like zero
transference, right?

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.380
PROFESSOR 2: Yeah.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.430
So in those simulations
you saw, all

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.285
you need to do to change them
from being a Kinect thing

00:02:10.285 --> 00:02:12.400
to a not Kinect
thing is uncheck one

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.470
of the scripts in this panel.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.510
So pretend this were
my own product--

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.320
which isn't on this computer--

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.080
this would be with
Kinect, and then this

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.150
would be with the mouse.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.200
So you don't have to
exclusively choose one.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.926
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:02:24.926 --> 00:02:27.700
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah, and then
you can program a whole Kinect

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.320
thing on your
computer just assuming

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.120
mouse clicks are Kinect.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.167
And then when you're
ready, drag on the script

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:34.750
or click on the
little thing, and it's

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.290
ready to work on
a Kinect system.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.790
That's part of what he's been
tasked to do over the last six

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.010
months was make it really easy
to use Kinect if you want it.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.199
Any other questions?

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.740
And if I don't see
your hand up, it's

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.031
probably because you're in
my periphery, so say things.

00:02:50.031 --> 00:02:50.998
Yeah?

00:02:50.998 --> 00:02:58.060
AUDIENCE: Thought of detecting,
[INAUDIBLE.] Is there anything

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.130
we should download,
development kit or anything,

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.430
to use at home so that
we're on the same page

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.264
as what's happening in class?

00:03:07.264 --> 00:03:08.820
PROFESSOR 1: Good question.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.490
PROFESSOR 2: There
is a Kinect SDK,

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.975
and you can download it
from the Microsoft website.

00:03:12.975 --> 00:03:14.850
We are using the newer
version of the Kinect.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.100
However, the older
version is very similar,

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.220
and I think you
just have to remove

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.136
the little v2 at the
end of all the Kinect

00:03:22.136 --> 00:03:25.790
references in the code.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.582
PROFESSOR 1: And it
only works on Windows.

00:03:28.582 --> 00:03:30.540
PROFESSOR 2: It does only
work on Windows, yes.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.498
PROFESSOR 1: And I see
a little apple, I think.

00:03:32.498 --> 00:03:35.230
AUDIENCE: I have a thinking on
this, so I could probably work.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.450
PROFESSOR 1: Oh, OK.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.560
PROFESSOR 2: Great.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.910
AUDIENCE: What only
works on Windows?

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.234
PROFESSOR 1: The Kinect, yeah.

00:03:40.234 --> 00:03:41.182
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:03:41.182 --> 00:03:42.594
That's [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:42.594 --> 00:03:43.552
PROFESSOR 1: All right.

00:03:43.552 --> 00:03:46.366
[THE PROFESSOR AND STUDENT
 LAUGH]

00:03:46.366 --> 00:03:46.865
Any other?

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.530
Nope?

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.239
All right, then--

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.779
AUDIENCE: Is there
a Kinect simulator

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:55.305
so that you could
run it on a Mac?

00:03:55.305 --> 00:03:59.194
Or does that also
only work on Windows?

00:03:59.194 --> 00:04:00.860
PROFESSOR 1: It
probably just only works

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.750
on Windows, because it uses
developments library, a DLL

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.270
link library that runs
on Windows and knows

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.387
what to do with the
inputs that it's getting.

00:04:11.387 --> 00:04:12.970
PROFESSOR 2: The
version one, I think,

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.680
can do it-- you can do on Mac.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.860
PROFESSOR 1: Oh.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.776
PROFESSOR 2: It's specific
to the version two.

00:04:16.776 --> 00:04:20.089
The version two, it
pushes the USB 3.0s back--

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:21.754
like, really hard.

00:04:21.754 --> 00:04:25.010
And it's so much
data, that I don't

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.142
think Microsoft wanted to put
any extra effort into that.

00:04:31.094 --> 00:04:34.172
It used to only
work on Windows 8.

00:04:34.172 --> 00:04:36.130
PROFESSOR 1: And now we
can work on Windows 10.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.880
PROFESSOR 2: Yeah.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.901
PROFESSOR 1: Yay!

00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:38.400
All right.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.034
So thank you.

00:04:39.034 --> 00:04:40.450
AUDIENCE: Would
it be useful to do

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.964
a poll of who uses Macs,
who uses Windows, and Linux,

00:04:43.964 --> 00:04:44.868
and things like that?

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:49.470
PROFESSOR 2: I mean, you can
still program it on the Mac

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.999
and just do it with the mouse.

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.540
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.120
PROFESSOR 2: And then just check
the little box, as it were.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.328
PROFESSOR 1: And yeah, so
you can send it over to one

00:04:56.328 --> 00:05:00.841
of the systems that has the
Kinect and uncheck the box.

00:05:00.841 --> 00:05:02.340
It shouldn't end
up being a problem.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.210
If you start working
on a Mac, then it

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.502
should take a little bit
of time to look and go,

00:05:08.502 --> 00:05:10.710
oh, yeah, no problem-- check
this, send it over here,

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.335
and it'll work.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.410
What I would say is,
don't worry about it.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.560
Do what's comfortable
right now, and then we'll

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.700
figure out what needs
to be adjusted later.
