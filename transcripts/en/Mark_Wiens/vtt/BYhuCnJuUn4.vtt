00:00:00.226 --> 00:00:03.090
(sizzling)

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.040
- I'm sitting right here
in the steam of the pork,

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.170
and this fire is so incredibly hot.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.320
They're making fresh salsa.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.600
You can smell the habanero
as they crush them,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.910
and the roasted tomatoes.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.480
And then they have this giant griddle

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.570
with a huge bonfire where
they're cooking the tortillas.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.950
Oh, this is a great place.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.854
I can not wait to try this salsa.

00:00:24.854 --> 00:00:27.437
(upbeat music)

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.473
Good morning.

00:00:46.473 --> 00:00:48.140
I hope you're having an
amazing day, It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.150
I'm in Playa del Carmen in
Quintana Roo, state of Mexico.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.330
It's gonna be a road trip today.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.180
We are starting off in Playa del Carmen,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.270
and we're gonna drive
all the way to Merida,

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.600
which is the capital of Yucatan Province

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.470
on the Yucatan Peninsula.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.759
But along the way, we're gonna stop to eat

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:05.178
some amazing Mexican food.

00:01:05.178 --> 00:01:08.210
We're gonna visit some of
the famous attractions.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.500
I'm gonna share it all
with you in this video.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.260
I'm the first one up this morning.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.240
Just loading up the minivan,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.860
and hopefully we should all
be ready in about 30 minutes,

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.910
and we're on our way.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.780
But first things first, we
have to stop for breakfast.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.910
We're on our way for some
breakfast nourishment.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.800
This is the spot right over here.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.130
It's kind of in the industrial
area of Playa del Carmen.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.530
There's some factories around.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.690
There's some car dealerships.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.250
We're right next to the highway.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.020
And yeah, this place looks awesome.

00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:51.193
(upbeat music)

00:01:51.193 --> 00:01:55.110
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.440
- This is a very cool place.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.130
It's setup underneath a tent.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.670
They have a number of different
tacos that you can order,

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.420
but they specialize in cecino,

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.680
which is like a very thin beef,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.190
and so she cuts off a
chunk and she weighs it

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.719
to get everything right
and then they grill it.

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:16.740
They have a list of tacos.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.100
I tried four different
types of tacos on a plate,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.860
and it smells incredible.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.060
Yeah, it smells so good.

00:02:24.116 --> 00:02:28.033
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.680
- What I love about this place already

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.040
is that everything looks fresh.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.180
They are making everything there.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.330
They're making their tortillas.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.630
They're making the salsas.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.290
They're assembling, they're
grilling that meat over fire.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.860
They're assembling everything.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.760
The beef aromas in this tent.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.900
If only you could smell the
beef aromas in this tent.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.767
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.510
- Wow, these tacos are incredible.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.770
This place is a meat lover's
taco dream come true.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.630
It's just all meat and lots
of chicharron, fried skin,

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.140
all those onions on there.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.800
And then, so they assemble.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.520
I got one of each, though,
so they're all different.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.020
But they're all beef based, I think.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.853
Oh, except for one.

00:03:23.853 --> 00:03:25.410
One is only chicharron with a big

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.240
hunk of guacamole on the bottom.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.070
And then a ton of sauteed onions.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.360
And they also top them with nopales,

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.630
which is the prickly pear cactus.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.760
And then he also added
on some salsa already.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.890
There's nothing better than when your taco

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.690
overflows off of the plate
and touches the table.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.740
Look at that piece of meat.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.860
Oh, this is the biggest piece of meat

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.120
I've ever seen in a taco.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:59.643
Wow.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.070
Oh that's awesome.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.930
Oh that is crazy good.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.810
That beef is extremely
tender and really salty.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.080
And then you've got those
sweet, tender onions.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.960
You've got, oh the nopal in there,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.760
which just kind of has a neutral taste.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.640
I think it's about all
those onions and that beef.

00:04:25.548 --> 00:04:29.610
There's nothing like
morning taco nourishment.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.580
Tacos are so good as they are,

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.320
but I just have to try
a little bit more salsa.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.990
Maybe something a little bit more spicy.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.620
Oh, and I wanna try some of the
salsa that she freshly made.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.440
The next one I'm gonna try is all,

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.730
he put on a couple huge
pieces of chicharron,

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.270
which is just crispy skin,

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.290
and then he added on a
huge dollop of guacamole,

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.230
and then the onions again.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.620
Yeah, this is a very interesting taco.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.660
I've never had a combination
like this before.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.470
This is all squeezing out the top.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.440
Whoa, that's just solid guacamole,

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.550
and then you get that
crunch from the skin.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.200
Oh, that one is a winner as well.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.610
It has quite a meaty taste, too.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.600
Next up is the one with omelet

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.180
And again, it has beef
mixed within the omelet.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.560
He fried it on that same griddle,

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.780
so it has all the beef juices.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.060
Check out just how
overstuffed this taco is.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.350
What a beautiful thing.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.650
Absolutely gorgeous.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.620
The cactus, the nopales.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.660
It's really good.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.830
It almost has like a
mushroom texture to it.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:47.900
A little bit slimy.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.310
And those onions, superb.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.840
I might squeeze on a little
bit of lime on this one.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.190
Okay, onto the final taco.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.230
And this is the same beef,

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.110
but it's been cut up
into small little pieces,

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.500
and then he added a handful of kind of,

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.970
I think it's chicharron,

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.540
but it's been kind of cracked already.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.290
So they're in small pieces as well.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.170
Again, onions and nopales and some salsas.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.760
What I love is that they're
all totally different.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.100
This is not a light breakfast.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.172
Carlos, how were those tacos?

00:06:37.172 --> 00:06:38.005
- The tacos were good.

00:06:38.005 --> 00:06:39.170
Very cocecina tacos.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.920
- Those were some serious tacos.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.595
They were so good.

00:06:42.595 --> 00:06:45.459
And next up, we're gonna
drive over to a cenote.

00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:48.042
(upbeat music)

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.140
We have arrived to a cenote
that's called X'canche,

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.373
Cenote X'canche, and it's a
little bit off the beaten path,

00:07:21.373 --> 00:07:24.350
but there's so many cenotes
that you can choose from

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.780
that eventually you just gotta choose one.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.730
And we wanted to go to
one that was quieter,

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.270
that was a little more
off the beaten path,

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.860
since we have the minivan.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.619
And it's also still in
kind of on the route

00:07:35.619 --> 00:07:37.640
that we're taking today towards Merida.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.465
So yeah, here we are.

00:07:41.465 --> 00:07:45.382
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.100
- It's about a two kilometer
walk down the road,

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.840
down the path here.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.530
So you can either rent a bicycle,

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.360
or you can walk, or you can
rent a tricycle and get there.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.628
So we thought it would be
fun to take the tricycle.

00:08:00.628 --> 00:08:04.740
Okay, entrance to the cenote is 50,

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:09.000
and then the tricycle taxi
rental is 100 per person.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.890
It's a little harder to
bike with all the kids,

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.520
so this will be fun.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.810
Oh, and by the way, you can get some

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.360
ice cream to enjoy on the road.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.840
Okay, and we're off.

00:08:20.772 --> 00:08:21.605
Whoa.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.850
Oh yeah, this bicycle
rickshaw, this is so relaxing.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.830
Going down the tree-lined path.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.610
Oh, it's breezy.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.010
This is actually really fun.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.412
We're cruising, too.

00:08:39.412 --> 00:08:41.995
(upbeat music)

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.260
Oh.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.270
- That was nice, huh?

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.830
- [Mark] Yeah, so relaxing.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:53.663
- That's a nice road.

00:08:53.663 --> 00:08:55.430
- I'm loving this place already.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.050
We gotta change, and then they said

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.320
we need to take a shower
before we go to the cenote

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.250
to keep it nice and fresh and clean.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.010
Okay, I'm gonna get changed.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.610
Okay, fully changed.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.300
I'm ready for the cenote.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.440
Had to take a quick shower.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.170
Wow, that water is cold.

00:09:11.258 --> 00:09:13.675
(chattering)

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.660
It's absolutely gorgeous.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.690
A sinkhole in the rock.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.990
The water is clear, it's deep blue.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:29.490
It's extremely deep as well.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.090
There's vines going down.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.200
It's the jungle canopy.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.930
And part of the reason
it's so beautiful also

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.310
is that it's so quiet,
it's so peaceful here.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.208
You can hear the birds.

00:09:39.208 --> 00:09:41.958
(birds chirping)

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.630
Yeah, you wouldn't really
wanna slip and fall here,

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.780
but if you did, you would
land in the water, luckily.

00:09:52.464 --> 00:09:55.297
(water splashing)

00:09:59.021 --> 00:10:01.955
(hollering)

00:10:01.955 --> 00:10:02.955
Oh that's beautiful.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.233
What?

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:07.927
It's not that cold.

00:10:07.927 --> 00:10:08.760
It's perfect.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.170
Oh wow, it's so incredibly beautiful,

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:27.390
especially when you're
swimming and then you look up

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.370
and you see the trees and the opening.

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:31.840
It's gorgeous.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.670
Back into the rickshaw.

00:10:44.984 --> 00:10:46.750
Okay, listo, we're ready to go.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.570
The cenote was so much fun.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.680
Swimming, and then just
the natural beauty,

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.410
and also partly why this
particular cenote is so nice

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.340
is because it's so quiet, so peaceful.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.173
When we were swimming,

00:10:59.173 --> 00:11:01.960
there were only other couple in there.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.770
The serenity, the peace, the
calmness, the natural beauty.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.237
This is a gorgeous cenote to visit.

00:11:08.237 --> 00:11:10.820
(upbeat music)

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.530
We're just stopping by
in this little town.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:21.990
It's called Pimcoko, and this
little town is full of meat,

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.450
so we're just stopping for a quick snack.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.450
This is actually not where we're
actually having real lunch.

00:11:27.806 --> 00:11:31.262
(speaking in foreign language)

00:11:31.262 --> 00:11:33.170
- So the sausage was gonna
take a little too long to cook

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:34.670
so we decided to get some of their,

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.970
what did they say, it's fried and smoked?

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:40.165
- Fried and spicy smoked pork.

00:11:40.165 --> 00:11:40.998
- Fried, spicy, smoked.

00:11:40.998 --> 00:11:43.450
Okay, every kind of
delicious flavor on pork

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.100
you can imagine, and there
was a big stack of it.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.630
This little town, it's
just a little tiny town,

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.090
but there's like 10 meat
shops in this place.

00:11:51.951 --> 00:11:52.850
(laughing)

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.005
We just got a whole steak.

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:55.040
Look at this thing.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.595
Carlos, you get half, I get half.

00:12:01.595 --> 00:12:03.845
(laughing)

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:08.343
How's that?

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.250
- Good, good.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.083
Salty, very salty.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.462
Tastes very good, very salty.

00:12:17.462 --> 00:12:19.010
- Oh wow.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.720
Oh, that is incredible.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.990
Extremely salty, but really smoky.

00:12:26.522 --> 00:12:29.960
It's like dry from being
smoked for so long,

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.860
but not like, it's still moist.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.330
That is incredibly salty delicious.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.860
Yeah it does almost have like
a ham bacon flavor to it.

00:12:40.776 --> 00:12:42.370
It's tender, too.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:43.203
Wow.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:47.380
That is like ham, but like
a crazy good salty ham.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.753
It's like overly salty.

00:12:50.753 --> 00:12:53.336
(upbeat music)

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.530
We're getting closer and
closer to Chichen Itza,

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:07.830
but along the road, we
stopped in this little town.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.130
It's called Kaua.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.860
And along the road, you'll
see so many restaurants

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.070
called La Tia, which is the auntie.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:16.370
Serving a dish, it's called Poc chuc,

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:17.240
which is a grilled pork dish.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.562
They call it La Verdadera Tia.

00:13:20.562 --> 00:13:24.730
So it's the true one, the original one.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.838
Oh cool.

00:13:29.838 --> 00:13:31.033
(speaking in foreign language)

00:13:31.033 --> 00:13:32.670
This is just a family home restaurant,

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.370
so they've invited us back to the kitchen

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:35.660
to see the cooking.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:36.493
Oh, cool.

00:13:38.532 --> 00:13:42.449
(speaking in foreign language)

00:13:56.628 --> 00:13:58.128
- [Mark] From the garden here.

00:13:59.231 --> 00:14:03.148
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.550
- This kitchen is amazing.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:14.660
It's all family run.

00:14:15.966 --> 00:14:19.883
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.708
- [Mark] The beans are
right from their garden.

00:14:24.708 --> 00:14:25.541
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:25.541 --> 00:14:28.350
- And she is the original
auntie here at the restaurant.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.320
This is the place to come.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.170
And it's such a cool kitchen.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.280
They're peeling the beans over here.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.480
And they're cooking over on this side.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.580
They're making fresh salsa.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.870
You can smell the habanero
as they crush them

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.180
in the roasted tomatoes.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.730
And then they have this giant griddle

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:47.540
with a huge bonfire, where
they're cooking the tortillas.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.165
Oh, this is a great place.

00:14:50.165 --> 00:14:54.082
(speaking in foreign language)

00:15:03.329 --> 00:15:06.246
(roosters crowing)

00:15:07.836 --> 00:15:10.836
(people chattering)

00:15:13.625 --> 00:15:17.542
(speaking in foreign language)

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:23.577
(meat sizzling)

00:15:46.405 --> 00:15:48.655
(laughing)

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.530
I'm sitting right here
in the steam of the pork,

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:02.390
and this fire is so incredibly hot.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.080
Wow, I can feel that heat
coming through my face.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.700
It's so hot.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.650
That pork smells unbelievably good.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.780
They're just grilling it
over this giant griddle,

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.780
along with the tortillas.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:16.480
And she added on some lard to that pork

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.300
to make it extra good.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.133
Oh, I can't wait.

00:16:19.133 --> 00:16:20.370
This is gonna be so good.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.610
Oh, some more lard.

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:23.219
Oh yes.

00:16:23.219 --> 00:16:25.469
(sizzling)

00:16:29.156 --> 00:16:29.989
Okay.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.850
God, that fire is so hot.

00:16:42.899 --> 00:16:46.816
(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.510
- We also ordered some longanisa,

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:07.030
which is a sausage, and
she's showing me how

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:07.890
she makes it right now.

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:09.470
They just throw it onto the coals,

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:10.920
and that must be some fatty sausage.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.024
You can see the flames just
erupting off of those sausages.

00:17:14.024 --> 00:17:15.426
Oh, that's beautiful.

00:17:15.426 --> 00:17:18.060
Wow, I am sweating back
here in this kitchen.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.220
The fires are so hot.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.180
And they throw everything in.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.080
The tomatoes were thrown into the fire

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.240
so that they roast for that salsa.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.190
You can just hear that sausage
just hissing with that pack.

00:17:32.352 --> 00:17:35.352
(people chattering)

00:17:47.119 --> 00:17:49.952
(rooster crowing)

00:18:23.707 --> 00:18:26.290
(upbeat music)

00:18:33.261 --> 00:18:37.178
(speaking in foreign language)

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.850
- Okay, we got all the food,

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:58.620
and it looks incredible.

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.527
And the family that makes
this food is just awesome.

00:19:00.527 --> 00:19:02.770
They're so friendly, they're so nice.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.490
We got all the grilled pork.

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:08.080
I think it's called Poc chuc,
poc chuc, that's what it is.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.210
And the tortillas are all hand made.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:11.780
Everything is hand made, even the salsa.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.190
They gave us the whole mortar.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.150
Those fire roasted tomatoes are in there,

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:16.850
then he pounded in some habanero,

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.550
and there's some tortillas.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:21.400
One is basted in lard and salt,

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.900
and then one is plain.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.330
We also got some longanisa,
which is some sausage.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.550
And she said the longanisa is actually

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.280
from that town where we got that meat.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.010
So we were planning to
try some sausage there,

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:31.060
but then it would take too long.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.590
So we're actually getting some sausage

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:33.480
from there that they made.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.350
Fire roasted.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:38.030
But yeah, the main thing
to eat here is what we got,

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:38.970
and it looks stunning.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:40.700
But we're starting first
with a bowl of beans,

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.520
which auntie was peeling those beans,

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.100
and then they were just
boiling over the fire as well.

00:19:49.873 --> 00:19:51.860
Yeah, those are good.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.805
Oh, and they're right
from the family's garden.

00:19:54.805 --> 00:19:57.250
Just like pure beans.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:58.220
Yeah, they're really good.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.200
They're really like, smoothy, silky,

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.270
creamy texture to them.

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:04.220
You can actually see your
reflection in this bowl of beans.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:09.343
Good beans.

00:20:09.343 --> 00:20:10.260
Let's move onto the pork now.

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.940
Okay so we each got a
plate of our own pork,

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.450
and yeah, it's very thin pork.

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:15.400
They grill it over that griddle.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.670
It just radiates heat.

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:17.503
It's so hot.

00:20:17.503 --> 00:20:20.560
And then she continually
drizzles it in lard

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.723
as it keeps sizzling away,

00:20:22.723 --> 00:20:26.740
and sprinkles on quite a
generous amount of salt.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.390
Let me just taste the pork first.

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:33.083
Wow.

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:35.990
Yeah, that's salty.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:37.250
It's really rich.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:41.030
It has like a natural pork flavor to it.

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:42.712
That's what makes it good.

00:20:42.712 --> 00:20:46.150
Yeah, that tastes like
country pig, that's for sure.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:47.578
These are the ones.

00:20:47.578 --> 00:20:48.411
You can see how glistening they are

00:20:48.411 --> 00:20:50.520
because she sprinkled a bunch
of lard on them as well.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.353
Gotta taste this one.

00:20:51.353 --> 00:20:52.630
It looks a little oily, though.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:53.870
Okay, let me grab that piece of pork,

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:56.700
stick that pork in, and I
gotta try that salsa this time.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.570
I can not wait to try this salsa.

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:09.570
(people chattering)

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.093
Wow.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.810
It's so salty, it's so porky.

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:19.120
The tortillas are awesome.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.553
That salsa is, we asked
him to make it spicy.

00:21:22.553 --> 00:21:24.974
He did make it pretty spicy.

00:21:24.974 --> 00:21:27.600
You can taste the habanero in there,

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.020
and then just those fire roasted tomatoes,

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.620
which are just lightly crushed in there.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.960
They're still chunky, chunky delicious.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.880
You know, I like the
tortilla with the lard

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.670
that does make it even richer,

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.440
but it's sort of like unnecessary

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.620
because you taste the
whole richness of the pork.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.630
I think I like just the
regular tortilla the best.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:45.518
Let me add in a whole piece
of pork, kind of break it up.

00:21:45.518 --> 00:21:47.620
Squeeze on some lime.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.430
And then I think I'm gonna
get some onions on here,

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:52.780
and some cilantro as well.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.150
This salsa is absolutely insane.

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:03.060
It's so good.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.210
Oh man, it's so juicy.

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:05.560
It's dripping out the back.

00:22:06.865 --> 00:22:09.448
(upbeat music)

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.750
That is ridiculously tasty.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:19.890
The whole combination.

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:21.070
Okay next up for the longanisa,

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.300
which is the sausage.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.620
Fire literally coal roasted.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.030
You know, you can see the burnt ends,

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:28.450
and then on this side,
that's the interiors of

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:29.590
that longanisa.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:38.140
So it has a little bit
of a sour taste to it.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.148
You can taste the charred
ends of that, that's for sure.

00:22:41.148 --> 00:22:42.490
A little bit spicy.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.890
Yeah, that's some good stuff.

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.770
That could get really addictive.

00:22:54.435 --> 00:22:55.350
(upbeat music)

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:57.380
Yeah, I really love the onion,

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.500
cilantro, and salsa combination.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.740
Squeeze on a little lime.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:22.930
That is delicious.

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:27.550
That salsa is just awesomely good.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:28.383
Oh, I love it.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.213
Wow.

00:23:36.441 --> 00:23:40.358
(speaking in foreign language)

00:23:42.017 --> 00:23:42.850
Whoa, where'd it go?

00:23:43.774 --> 00:23:46.050
Okay.

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:46.883
- One more shot, let's do it again.

00:23:46.883 --> 00:23:47.880
- [Mark] One more time.

00:23:53.704 --> 00:23:56.290
(laughing)

00:23:56.290 --> 00:24:00.207
(speaking in foreign language)

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:05.683
- We are rolling out of La Tia.

00:24:05.683 --> 00:24:08.600
There's really not a whole
lot going on in this town.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.550
It's pretty sleepy.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:12.340
I mean, there's a fair amount of traffic,

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.010
but it's a very sleepy town.

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:16.190
But man, they have some awesome food.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:17.160
They're really friendly.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.040
I loved watching them cook.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.290
They make Poc chuc very, very well.

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:23.040
Or is it, chuc poc?

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.430
Chuc poc or Poc chuc?

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:25.440
I think it's Poc chuc.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.790
Oh man, that's tasty.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.990
I have like, my mouth
is just kind of tingling

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:32.130
with saltiness right now, but
that was so incredibly good.

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:34.770
Total bill came to 300
for four of us eating,

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:37.154
and I got the official napkin receipt.

00:24:37.154 --> 00:24:38.520
(upbeat music)

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.210
Next stop, Chichen Itza.

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:51.910
We have arrived to Chichen Itza.

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:54.906
That was just about a 10
minute drive from lunch,

00:24:54.906 --> 00:24:57.256
but it's the middle of the afternoon now.

00:24:57.256 --> 00:24:59.400
We're hoping that it
won't be quite as busy

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.290
as it might be in the morning,

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:01.710
but I'm sure it will still be packed.

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:04.800
Yeah, there's about 50 tour
buses parked here still.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.170
Entrance was very easy.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:10.770
It cost 242 pesos per person.

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:12.440
And we're just now passing through

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.320
all sorts of souvenir shops.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.584
And on our way to the complex,
the Mayan city complex.

00:25:18.584 --> 00:25:21.584
(people chattering)

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.590
Wow, it's a really short walk,

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.460
and then you get out of the trees,

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.420
and all of a sudden, it
opens up and you see.

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.930
You have an amazing view of
what's called El Castillo,

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:34.290
which is the castle.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:36.870
It is the central step pyramid,

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:38.930
the main landmark of Chichen Itza.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.252
This entire Mayan city complex.

00:25:41.252 --> 00:25:43.610
And this entire complex, it dates back.

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:46.870
It was thriving between 600 and 1200.

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:48.527
And it was very powerful.

00:25:48.527 --> 00:25:51.880
They were very advanced for their day,

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.750
and the architecture.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:55.860
They're known for their
architecture, for their pyramids.

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.790
It's in incredible condition.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:25:59.533
Mika, Mika.

00:26:00.621 --> 00:26:01.774
(speaking in foreign language)

00:26:01.774 --> 00:26:03.420
- You can see the giant
steps that form the pyramid,

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.360
and then the steps that are going up.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.120
Hey, it's pretty awesome, very awesome.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.190
Chichen Itza, at its time, it
was one of the most powerful,

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:12.540
one of the most influential,

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:14.800
and also one of the
largest and most diverse of

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.270
all the Mayan cities, and that's why it is

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:20.410
so well preserved now.

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:21.780
Because they built so well,

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.340
and they had such amazing construction.

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.120
Actually, what I love to do when I visit

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.280
ancient sites like this,
is just imagine how it was

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.610
living without the technology
that we have today,

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:36.190
and just living amongst these,

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:39.610
the nature plus these amazing buildings,

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:41.620
construction that they built.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:45.630
All which serve various
purposes in their culture,

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:48.830
and Mayans had a lot of
interesting traditions as well.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:51.443
And yeah, very cool to visit.

00:26:51.443 --> 00:26:53.943
(man yelling)

00:27:01.006 --> 00:27:03.256
(giggling)

00:27:18.622 --> 00:27:19.653
- Come on, Mika.

00:27:19.653 --> 00:27:21.168
Come on, buddy.

00:27:21.168 --> 00:27:22.813
Come on.

00:27:22.813 --> 00:27:23.646
Good job.

00:27:25.469 --> 00:27:26.920
We're gonna always remember Chichen Itza

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.740
because little Mika, he's
taken a couple steps before,

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.040
but nothing like that.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.840
He really started, he got
really worked up walking,

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.630
using the stroller as a walker.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:38.920
And then he just decided to go straight up

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.180
and start running.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.900
Chichen Itza was amazing.

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.700
We're now back on the road,

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.600
and we are driving to Merida,

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.156
and it should be about an
hour until we get there.

00:27:48.156 --> 00:27:50.739
(upbeat music)

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:09.580
So we've made it to Merida
after an amazing day.

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:12.380
We're staying in this very cool, old house

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.880
in the central district of Merida.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.140
And yeah, today was a fantastic day,

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.620
starting all the way from breakfast,

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:21.620
driving all the way from Playa del Carmen.

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.084
Stopping at the cenote was incredible.

00:28:24.084 --> 00:28:26.550
The food was awesome.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:29.350
And finally, Chichen Itza,

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.390
and we're pretty tired this evening.

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:32.490
It's been a very long day,

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:35.120
so we just got some
takeaway food for dinner.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.930
So I'm gonna end this
video, this day trip,

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:39.760
day road trip right now.
