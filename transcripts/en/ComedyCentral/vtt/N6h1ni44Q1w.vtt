00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:03.703
Good news for masochists
and old receipt enthusiasts

00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:06.172
'cause Tax Day is Mon...
Oh, (bleep), Tax Day's Monday.

00:00:06.205 --> 00:00:09.175
Ah... Poop, poop, poop.

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:11.778
That means millions of Americans
are currently screaming,

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:13.646
"Oh, (bleep),
Tax Day is Monday,"

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.581
as they realize
it's way past midnight

00:00:15.614 --> 00:00:17.917
and they don't even know
what a 1040EZ is.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.919
It's tough navigating all the
loopholes and the deductions,

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:22.321
which is why we've enlisted the
help of three financial experts,

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:25.925
a comedian, a sportscaster,
and a half-shaved Wolverine.

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:29.195
Uh, so, comedians...

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:32.065
-Sorry, Annie.
-It's not... -Nice.

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:35.601
Again. Again.

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:37.670
Comedians, I want you to give us
as many...

00:00:37.703 --> 00:00:40.540
"Yeah, these wolverines just
left you on our doorstep, Mike.

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:43.209
"We don't know...
You're not naturally our child.

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:45.545
"You were raised in the wild.

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.080
Now it's time you knew."

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:51.617
You don't have a stomach like
this and a healing factor, okay?

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.821
Comedians, I want you to give us
as many last minute tax tips

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:57.090
as you can in 60 seconds.
And begin. Annie.

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:58.825
When listing your dependents,

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:01.561
find out how many people have
your Netflix password.

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:04.363
All right. Points. Rich Eisen.

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:07.166
-Lie.
-Yeah, points. Mike.

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:10.169
Make sure your accountant's name
rhymes with "Ibowitz."

00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:12.638
Points. Annie.

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:15.174
Write off Axe Body Spray
as a business expense,

00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:17.777
because your business
is getting that pussy...!

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.912
All right, points. Points.

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:22.515
Yeah!

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:24.050
Rich.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:25.718
Take no advice
from Wesley Snipes.

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:27.120
All right, points.

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:29.122
Mike Lawrence.

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:32.391
You only have to claim
the children you wanted.

00:01:32.424 --> 00:01:35.394
Points. Points. Annie.

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:38.731
Buying Mike Lawrence's CD
counts as a charity.

00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:41.701
-All right.
-(groaning, laughter)

00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:45.471
-Shots fired.
-Points.

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:47.340
Very nicely done, Annie. Rich.

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:48.941
Get real rich
and just don't pay them.

00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:51.077
Yes, points. Annie.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.746
Say your cat is your wife
and your dog is a religion.

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:55.715
(buzzer sounds)
