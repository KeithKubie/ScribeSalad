00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.960
LAURA LING: Matt Tilford
was just 18-years-old

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.170
and two weeks away
from graduation

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.220
when, on a camping
trip with friends,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.330
his truck sped off a
cliff, falling 600 feet.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.110
MATT TILFORD: The truck
started to tumble,

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.530
and I wasn't
wearing my seatbelt.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.520
I was ejected as we were
going down the hill.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.650
LAURA LING: Do you
remember going off

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.421
that cliff and landing?

00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:26.670
MATT TILFORD: I was going
in and out of consciousness,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.420
and I didn't realize
until I looked down.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.620
And that's when I realized, it's
like, oh man, I am paralyzed.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.580
This is serious.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.767
[SOMBER MUSIC]

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:36.850
LAURA LING: As someone who
thrived in the outdoors

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.430
playing sports, Matt
was suddenly confronted

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.957
with an entirely new reality.

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:42.790
MATT TILFORD: I was
definitely freaking out.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.956
I was thinking of my future,
what I was going to do.

00:00:44.956 --> 00:00:47.470
LAURA LING: He had to
relearn the most basic tasks,

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.987
like how to get dressed,
wash, move around.

00:00:49.987 --> 00:00:51.820
MATT TILFORD: After my
accident, I came home

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.240
and I was depressed.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.850
I didn't want to leave home.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.360
Watching my friends go off to
college and start their life,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.340
I felt left behind.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.780
LAURA LING: Four
years later, Matt

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.750
got a life-changing
opportunity to test out

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.530
a new exoskeleton
rehabilitation device being

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.800
designed by Ekso Bionics.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.810
What was that like, to put
on that exoskeleton suit?

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:17.980
How did that feel?

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.290
MATT TILFORD: It felt
absolutely amazing to be

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.020
bearing my own weight,
my legs holding myself up

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.850
within that device.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.697
It was surreal.

00:01:26.697 --> 00:01:28.780
LAURA LING: The suits help
people with spinal cord

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.270
injuries, or those who
have suffered a stroke,

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.730
stand and take
steps, something many

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.550
are told they'll never
be able to do again.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.620
How does the technology
work, and how does it

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.916
work with the body?

00:01:40.916 --> 00:01:42.790
RUSS ANGOLD: Think of
it as a wearable robot,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.690
and it has four actuators that
replace the user's muscles.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.724
And then the user
interacts with it

00:01:48.724 --> 00:01:50.140
by actually shifting
their weight,

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.420
just like you would
go to take a step.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.180
LAURA LING: The exoskeletons are
accessible around the country

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.880
at hospitals for
rehabilitative uses,

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.910
in hopes that one day the
patient will no longer need

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:01.619
the suit to walk.

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.159
RUSS ANGOLD: By having that sort
of interaction where they're

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.089
in control of the device, that
keeps the signals coming down

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:08.380
from the brain, trying to walk.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.339
At the same time, they're
getting that therapy,

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:12.546
and their legs are going
through a very natural gait.

00:02:12.546 --> 00:02:14.230
So that signal's
getting sent back up,

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.987
and that's really what you want
is that collision of signals

00:02:16.987 --> 00:02:18.820
to help with the
neuroplasticity and to help

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.420
them regain that ability
to walk without the device.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.460
LAURA LING: Given the
scope of Matt's injuries,

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.277
it's unlikely he'll ever
walk without an exoskeleton,

00:02:29.277 --> 00:02:30.860
but that doesn't
mean the suit doesn't

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.579
have other major benefits.

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.120
MICHAEL GLOVER: It gives them
that sense of independence back

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.230
a little bit.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.514
There are other benefits
just of being upright.

00:02:38.514 --> 00:02:40.930
You might have improvements
of your bowel and your bladder

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.150
function.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.500
Some people have some pain
stemming from their nerves

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.560
because they're just in
that improper position.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.087
That sometimes goes
away with some folks.

00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:53.420
LAURA LING: So this is the
history of some of the things

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.950
that you've built
over the years.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.074
RUSS ANGOLD: Exactly right.

00:02:56.074 --> 00:02:58.310
They go all the
way back to 2006.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.680
This was our
[INAUDIBLE] exoskeleton.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.620
This is a medical exoskeleton
that has six actuators, so

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.530
powered ankles.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.730
Some devices for
powering your knees

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.080
for military applications.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.750
And the last one's our
industrial chassis prototype

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.660
for construction
industrial workers.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.450
LAURA LING: The history of
the exoskeleton goes way back.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.360
In 1890, Russian
inventor Nicholas Yagn

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.650
patented the first exoskeleton
powered by compressed gas bags

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.380
to assist with blocking,
jumping, and running.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.990
Whether it was ever
built is unknown.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.410
In the 1960s, General
Electric and the US military

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.640
created the Hardiman suit using
electricity and hydraulics,

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.090
but the device was so dangerous
and uncontrollable it was never

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.700
powered on with a person inside.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.610
Even more recent models
in the early 2000s

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.590
were considered too heavy.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.350
But around 2005,
battery technology

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.292
became a game changer.

00:03:52.292 --> 00:03:54.500
RUSS ANGOLD: We figured out
how to do it efficiently.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.750
We had the lightweight
materials and structures,

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.994
and then we had the
computing processing power,

00:03:58.994 --> 00:04:01.160
which is a key one to
actually bring it all together

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.630
and make it work.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.250
LAURA LING: Other companies,
such as suitX and ReWalk

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.370
Bionics, are designing
suits for patients

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.680
to use in their everyday
lives at a price

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.020
tag of around $70,000 per suit.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.140
Ekso is also working
on technology

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.800
that could potentially impact
the over 17 million people

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.190
in the construction industry,
who perform rigorous work

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.570
with heavy machinery.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.903
RUSS ANGOLD: We now have a
product out there that really

00:04:25.903 --> 00:04:27.140
makes their tools weightless.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.510
And that doesn't seem
like much until you

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.310
try to operate a 35-pound
tool all day long,

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.390
and it's just exhausting.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.640
LAURA LING: It's true, though.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.920
I mean I can't imagine
doing that up and down

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.500
up and down all day long.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.610
RUSS ANGOLD: Right,
so now grab it.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.260
There you go.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.340
LAURA LING: Oh wow.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.450
It is weightless.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.950
That's amazing.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.630
What do you think the potential
is in this technology?

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.140
MICHAEL GLOVER: I'm not sure
that I can see an end point.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.690
I believe that there could
be those pants one day,

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.580
that is your exopants that
are so low profile that it

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.000
can support somebody.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.730
LAURA LING: For
now, Matt continues

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.750
to test Ekso Bionics technology
and rediscover the ability

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.439
to do things he once
thought would be impossible.

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.730
MATT TILFORD: I wanted to
prove people that I was still

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.354
going to be OK.

00:05:09.354 --> 00:05:10.830
I still going to be successful.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.905
I learned how to still
be active with sports.

00:05:13.905 --> 00:05:17.520
I waveboarded and
snowboarded, and once I did,

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.805
it was absolutely amazing.

00:05:18.805 --> 00:05:20.430
LAURA LING: What does
it feel like when

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.185
you're in the suit today?

00:05:22.185 --> 00:05:24.980
MATT TILFORD: I think every
time I go from sit to stand,

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.990
a smile comes on my face.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.012
Just knowing that I'm at eye
level with everyone else.

00:05:32.012 --> 00:05:33.720
It's going to give
people the opportunity

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.150
to do things that they
weren't able to do before.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.040
And it's cool to be at
the forefront of it.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.050
LAURA LING: On another
episode of Seeker--

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.925
TRACE DOMINGUEZ: It's
taken hundreds of years

00:05:45.925 --> 00:05:48.310
to understand how Earth's
magnetic field works.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.140
But now that we
do, scientists are

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.300
trying to find hints
from Earth's history that

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.780
might reveal the future of this
ever-changing invisible field

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.405
all around us.

00:05:56.405 --> 00:05:58.030

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.470
