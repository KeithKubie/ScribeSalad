00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.490
Karibu, and welcome to
Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.730
I've just had one of the most
mind-blowing weeks of my entire life 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.310
hanging out with my mum and
with Save the Children, 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.740
and now I get to
tell you about it. 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.070
So first, I met a guy called Frank Kapeta
at his home here in Dar es Salaam 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.470
along with his little brother
and his father, William. 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.810
Basically, I was thrown into a world that is
utterly different to what I'm used to at home 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.050
and spent the first day feeling a
little bit shell shocked. 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.480
Frank is a pretty
inspiring guy. 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.790
He's 15, he's the young ambassador
for Save the Children here,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.630
and when he was younger, he was one
of those starving kids in Africa 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.690
that we hear
so much about. 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.160
To be more specific, Frank used
to suffer from malnutrition. 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.750
So, he did have a little bit of food,
enough to survive, 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.560
but not enough
to grow up healthily. 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.870
As a result,
his growth was stunted 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.270
and so he's much smaller than
he should really be at his age. 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.250
And although he seemed to
me to be a very intelligent guy,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.600
malnutrition also affected
his brain growth, 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.830
so he could have been even
smarter than he currently is. 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.020
The issues of hunger and
malnutrition are, by the way, 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.020
the reason that I'm here.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.520
Save the Children invited me to come along
to support the IF Campaign, 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.740
which aims to make this year the
beginning of the end for world hunger, 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.060
which, obviously,
I'm in support of. 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.710
However, Frank isn't a
malnutrition statistic. 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.760
He's a person. 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.290
Like he does campaign against
because it's obviously an issue 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.500
that's very important to him, but he also
likes jazz music and supports Arsenal 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.040
and wants to be a journalist
when he grows up. 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.470
But most importantly, to me,
over the week that I've spent with him, 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.110
despite the language barrier,
he's become a friend of mine. 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.830
Even by the end of the first day, he was already
calling me, "my good friend Mr. Charlie." 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.500
So after Frank was nice enough to show me
and my mum around his house

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.400
where his dad works shining shoes
and his school as well, 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.960
we all got on this
tiny little plane, 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.080
the smallest plane I've ever been
on in my entire life, to Tanga, 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.230
and we traveled to the region of
Korogwe to visit a couple of villages 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.670
where the rest of Frank's family live
and where he grew up. 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.310
So, I think that we must have
met every singe possible member 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.130
of Frank's extended family
while we were there, 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.870
and I know that you're not
meant to pick favorites, 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.460
but I couldn't help but fall in love a
little bit with his grandmother, Bibi.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.590
LAUGHTER

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.190
SPEAKING IN SWAHILI

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.930
Her and Frank were both kind enough
to show me and my mum how to make ugali,

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.830
which is a very simple and
common staple food here, 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.050
and it's basically just flour and water
heated up a bit and stirred. That's it.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.640
I quite liked it, honestly,
but as you can probably guess, 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.670
it's not exact going to
fulfill your "five a day." 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.490
Sometimes, they're able to have other
more nutritious things with it. 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.180
We had some dried fish,
but vegetables work as well, 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.850
and if they're really lucky,
they might get some meat, 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.050
but even then, maximum that
they get is maybe two meals a day, 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.440
and that's just based on what
they can get their hands on. 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.500
For me, the experience
of going to the villages 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.670
was a little hard to get
my head around, honestly, 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.270
because, compared to
what I'm used to, 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.900
they really don't have
that much, but, as a result, 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.410
they're so incredibly thankful for
everything they do have in their lives. 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.970
They're so happy despite all of the
hardships they have to go through, 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.820
and it's just so inspiring
and so lovely. 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.980
I just feel incredibly honored that
I got to meet all of these lovely people 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.800
and that they invited me into their
lives with such open arms, 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.780
and now I just don't want
them to have any problems.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.320
Anyway, that's just
the first two days. 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.270
I've done so much more stuff on this
trip including getting food poisoning, 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.240
which I have now, yay, so I'm going
to save the rest for a second video. 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.790
Until then, asante sana. 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.100
Thank you very much, and I will encourage
you to check out enoughfoodif.org 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.400
if you'd like more information about
all of this while you wait for me. 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.770
That's all. Goodbye! 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.090
