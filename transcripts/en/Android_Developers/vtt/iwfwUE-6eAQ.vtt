00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.929
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Oh what a beautiful time for everything
to freeze up.

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:13.330
Okay, good afternoon everybody and welcome,
once again, to the Android Developers Office

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.330
Hours.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:22.489
This is the EMEA edition where we are answering
any and all questions Android developer, you

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:27.540
know, for all of you who are awake during
the middle of the afternoon in European time

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.540
zones.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.290
I'm Sparky, I'm based in Munich, Germany and
I'm also joined by Nick and Rich and is that

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.719
Matt in London?

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.420
&gt;&gt;All: Hi everybody!

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:45.469
&gt;&gt;Sparky: We're here and welcome you to the
post IO resumption of our regularly scheduled

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.649
weekly office hours.

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:55.460
So with that let's see who's in the hangout
and what, what did you think of Google IO?

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.569
[baby coos in background] and Johanni, what
did you think of Google IO?

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:03.739
Did you see any of it?

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.979
&gt;&gt;Rich: He did but his microphone's not turned
on so in the meantime hey Al, how ya doing?

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:10.979
[Laughter]

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:11.979
&gt;&gt;Al: I'm doing great.

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:12.979
[Laughter]

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:13.979
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Johanni's representing the silent
majority.

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.130
&gt;&gt;Al: Today he's gonna bring all his questions
to you in sign language.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.991
Um, I thought it was cool.

00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:22.010
It's always a great event.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.180
Went last year, went this year, it's always
good to see stuff.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.119
It's always a little disappointing for us
European developers to see U.S. only products

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.020
but that's the way things go, that's the world
we live in.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.780
So, I've had a lot of fun with the queue though.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.360
&gt;&gt;Rich: U.S. products like the Jellybean rollout
which is happening across Europe today.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.620
&gt;&gt;Al: U.S. products like the Glass Developers
Kit had me grumbling for days.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.620
[Laughter]

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.030
&gt;&gt;Sparky: So which is worse, is it worse to
be a European with no expectation of ever

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.799
getting these things or is it worse to be
an American transplanted into to Europe knowing

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.679
that because of where my account was created
I have access to some of these things but

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.369
when I try to actually navigate to their pages
it says this doesn't work here?

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.720
&gt;&gt;Al: I think you're in the worse position.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.229
[All talking]

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.970
&gt;&gt;Rich: Sparky in his first world problems.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.080
[Laughter]
[Mumbling]

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:24.050
&gt;&gt;Nick: So, Al, you've been on the Nexus queue
I see with some of your posts on Google blast?

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.370
&gt;&gt;Al: Yep.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.330
&gt;&gt;Nick: What did you manage to do so far?

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.730
One of my favorite lines at the key note is,
what did it say, eminently hackable?

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.810
&gt;&gt;Al: It's incredibly hackable.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.000
Um, you can unlock the boot loader so once
the source code hits the Android opens the

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.220
project, you're gonna be able to build your
own phone anywhere and do what you want with

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.220
it.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.720
I've had it running pretty much most of the
major Android apps including the Playstore,

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.200
Chrome, uh, you name it, it'll do it.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.760
It's just a case of working out a good user
interface to it.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.730
If you hook up a USB on the go, micro USB
to a USB host adaptor you can hook up mice,

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.650
keyboards to it, it really is one of those
devices that it's gonna have a big story to

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.370
tell, it's just up to everybody to see how
they wanna use it.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.840
In some ways I think it's nice that there's
no guidance.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.161
It's a case of here's a device, do something
cool with it and it'll be interesting to what

00:03:25.161 --> 00:03:26.161
everyone comes up with.

00:03:26.161 --> 00:03:28.060
&gt;&gt;Nick: Very cool.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.540
So you're basically just using ADV install.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.670
Is it just like pushed onto the device and
once you've got launch on there it's pretty

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.769
easy to do some things?

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:41.769
&gt;&gt;Al: Absolutely.

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.870
Yeah, once you've got ADV install to install
the apps you can switch the micro USB across

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.091
the USB onto the go one, plug a mouse in and
you've got yourself a control method.

00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:56.640
So you can do, I was playing Angry Birds on
it using the mouse, um, you can do pretty

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.500
much anything you want because the media APIs
are the same, video APIs are the same, there's

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.000
no special features or special APIs for the
queue it's just a case of if it's an Android

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.799
app you can run it on there as long as you
don't rely on things like multi touch or a

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:11.799
camera.

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.190
&gt;&gt;Nick: So have you had any, have you had
a look at the buildup prop to see what prop

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.180
it reports, do you have any problems installing
apps if they, say there were a touch screen

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.330
or anything like this?

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.610
&gt;&gt;Al: Um, I haven't looked at the buildup
doc prop but a lot of the ones, a lot of the

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.250
default properties mean you can use a mouse
instead of a touch screen.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.740
Multi touch is a big no no.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.660
If anything needs multi touch that won't work.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.020
And of course things like the camera, there's
no camera in it but a lot of Android apps

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.080
come in straight off the bat.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.740
It's just about making sure the experience
on a TV screen is usable and it's reasonable

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.840
for the size of screen.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.840
[Pause]

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.690
&gt;&gt;Al: I think London are frozen again.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:01.320
&gt;&gt;Sparky: So since you mentioned the key note,
I didn't see much of the key note live because

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.440
I was working out in the lobby but I've seen
some of the playback and I think my favorite

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.830
comment by far is when the sky divers are
on their way down and I think it was Sergey

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.620
said something like, "How's this for a hangout
on air?"

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.620
[Laughter]

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.050
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, that was an extremely cool demo.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.630
It's definitely one of those that's gonna
go down in history.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.699
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah I think my favorite comment is
someone just said, "We've won the internet."

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:28.699
[Laughter]

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:33.640
&gt;&gt;Al: Was that you won it was a prize and
it's being presented to Sergey next week?

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.110
&gt;&gt;Rich: You've won one internet [laughter]

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:47.960
&gt;&gt;Rich: Anyway, IO was like weeks ago, now,
like uh

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.919
[Pause]

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:55.820
&gt;&gt;Al: Done, built.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.480
Posted up some instructions, if anyone's having
trouble building on a Mac have a look at my

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.099
Google Plus stream I've put up how you can
build it on OSX live on the latest X code

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:05.099
version.

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:06.099
&gt;&gt;Nick: Brilliant.

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.099
Thanks for that.

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:08.099
That's very kind of you.

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:09.099
&gt;&gt;Al: Yeah, it's all there.

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:11.880
All the goodness is there for anyone to play
with.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.979
&gt;&gt;Sparky: So have you built it as a ROM that
runs on any of your other devices yet?

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:20.620
&gt;&gt;Al: I have it running as a Rom on my Galaxy
Nexus.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.620
I custom built IOS P ROM.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.710
&gt;&gt;Rich: Nice, good work Al.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.590
&gt;&gt;Al: Davey Q and the guys in his team do
a great job of merging in all the stuff internally

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.310
and they always make sure it's buildable on
the device when they release it.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.980
So it literally was a case, for me, of typing
in a couple of extra commands and presto,

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.490
I got myself a working Rom.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.100
&gt;&gt;Rich: That's excellent.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.310
I love these kinds of things.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.139
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Rich: So we have loads of questions this

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:48.849
week in the moderator.

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:53.449
So unless we have any direct questions from
our hangout to kick off with from Charles,

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:56.330
Johanni or Al, we'll start looking through
the moderator.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.610
&gt;&gt;Al: I was gonna put one out to Matt.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.419
Cause I see he's sitting there quietly in
the background.

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:09.170
[Echo]
&gt;&gt;Al: Just a quick question, is there recommendation

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.930
of how think developers in second screen in
applications?

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.940
&gt;&gt;Rich: Sorry, could you just repeat that
we had a bit of feedback on this end?

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.039
&gt;&gt;Al: Sure, no worries.

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:25.400
Is, are there any recommendations about implementing
the second screen features of Google TV in

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.540
Android applications and should developers
be looking to create separate apps or should

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:34.470
they look into, look to use second screen
as a feature of their app when their apps

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.360
also running on a Google TV device?

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:43.370
&gt;&gt;Matt: So I think [inaudible] goes down the
route of promoting a single APK but I think

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.651
a lot of developers are kind of getting to
a point where if the content really doesn't

00:07:47.651 --> 00:07:53.599
make sense to be the same on both, they probably
would go down the separate APK route which,

00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:56.430
I think, it does depend on the app.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:00.490
So most do have a single APK and [inaudible]
but essentially they're gonna go down two

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:04.690
very different routes even though they're
gonna be working with each other, then, yeah,

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:09.430
just go for multiple APK, I mean, it's whatever
makes sense, I think.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:14.300
It deviates so much from the phone, tablet
realm that you've really just got to think

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.389
what's gonna make your life as a developer
a little bit easier.

00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:20.060
&gt;&gt;Al: Cool, thanks.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.169
&gt;&gt;Rich: Okay.

00:08:21.169 --> 00:08:27.860
&gt;&gt;Johanni: Hey guys I just have one question,
if you don't mind me asking quickly.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:28.860
&gt;&gt;Rich: Sure.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:29.860
Go ahead.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.729
&gt;&gt;Johanni: It's just to do with the top developer
badge.

00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:38.070
Um, you may or may not be able to answer this
but we have a client who has an app in the

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:43.380
Playstore that's very popular, it's got about
two and a half million or so downloads.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:49.640
And they were sort of wondering how they could
earn this top developer badge.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.720
If there was any formal procedure or just
purely a case of you guys in the developer

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.400
relations team pick developers occasionally?

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.230
&gt;&gt;Rich: So it's not down to us at all in the
developer relations team.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.780
If you have a look through Dan and Ian's video
from IO you can see where the selections are

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:13.420
made, they're made deep in an underground
lair, made deep under Mountain View by the

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.960
editorial team.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:21.410
Occasionally we do recommend developers for
them to review but for the most part the scouring

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:26.590
on the Playstore themselves looking for people
who look likely to earn the top developer

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:27.590
badge.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:28.970
&gt;&gt;Nick: It tends to be a bit of a pipeline
as well.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.830
It's the same criteria as featuring, you know,
we have people looking out across the market

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.210
for good apps, watching the trending lists
and so on.

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:41.310
As well as developers that develop relations
directly and so that feeds into a pipeline

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.360
for that featuring and it's generally those
kind of apps which get narrowed down to apps

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:51.400
that we might want to make editors choice
or a developer whose got a great track record

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.580
of making high quality applications which
might get top developer.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.580
&gt;&gt;Johanni: Okay.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.550
&gt;&gt;Nick: So it's the same kind of pipeline,
really the same kind of process.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.610
Who's the, what's the app of interest?

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.850
&gt;&gt;Johanni: It's the Sky Scanner app.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.070
&gt;&gt;Nick: This guy's got other flight tracking

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.070
&gt;&gt;Johanni: Yeah.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.070
&gt;&gt;Nick: Okay.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:11.730
&gt;&gt;Al: From what you guys said it sounds like
it would need multiple apps from a developer

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:12.870
rather than just one.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.640
Is that the right way to think?

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.640
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:20.640
&gt;&gt;Rich: You stand a better chance if you've
got multiple, high rated, lots of in store

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.570
kind of apps, but you are gonna get developers
who do get the badge with one application.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:29.250
I think if you look through some of the big
names out there you'll see if they have the

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.390
top developer badge.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:34.790
We do use it to signify times when it's a
trusted developer as well as a top developer.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:41.750
&gt;&gt;Johanni: Okay, so there's nothing that,
that [inaudible] could do to sort of put themselves

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.860
out there as looking to have the top developer
badge?

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.580
&gt;&gt;Rich: I guess they just have to [inaudible]
[Laughter]

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.820
&gt;&gt;Johanni: Fair enough.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.580
&gt;&gt;Rich: There's no formal process or submission
process or anything like that.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.630
&gt;&gt;Johanni: Okay great.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.030
Well, thanks for that.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.820
&gt;&gt;Rich: This is as close as it gets.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.600
Okay, let's head off to the moderator then.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.800
We've got a lot to get through in the next
49 minutes.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.050
Do you wanna take over Sparky?

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:12.100
Someone just mentioned that there's a feedback,
a 3 second audio feedback, are anyone else

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.130
in the hangout hearing that?

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.890
&gt;&gt;Al: I had it briefly when I was asking my
question when you guys asked me to repeat

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.550
it but I have not heard it since then.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:20.970
&gt;&gt;Rich: Anyone else having trouble with the
audio?

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:24.670
I'll just leave it off speakers and microphones,
how about that?

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:29.090
This may be the last of the hangouts we do
from this room.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:35.760
We're hoping to shift to a hangout studio
very shortly, either next week or soon after

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.640
so there won't be, the quality of the hangout
should improve, no end, that's just the quality

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:43.060
of the video not just the quality of the content,
obviously there's no improving perfection.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.920
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Rich: Sparky, do you want to handle a bit

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.920
of the moderator?

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.480
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah, I don't know what's, I don't
know what's going on, you guys don't seem

00:11:51.480 --> 00:12:00.250
to be having the feedback anymore but I I'm
still getting it.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:01.410
[Echo]

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:09.480
&gt;&gt;Al: I'm getting it now from Sparky.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.630
[Echoes]

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:16.040
&gt;&gt;Rich: Okay, just check what windows you've
got open; if you've got the YouTube window

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:21.990
open as well we've had some issues before
which caused us to drop out.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:26.530
He's got to turn his camera around.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.940
Hey Doran, it's good to see you there in the
hangout.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:29.990
Thanks for coming along.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.000
Do you have any questions for us today?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.800
&gt;&gt;Doran: Hey, I just joined.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.460
I'm new; I'll start by listen more and [inaudible]
[Laughter]

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:41.430
&gt;&gt;Rich: Okay, come in with a killer Android
technical question for us.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.060
&gt;&gt;Doran: No, no.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.970
I just started getting the hang of the hangout
now, it's my first experience.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:47.970
So, wow.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:48.970
[Laughter]

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:49.970
&gt;&gt;Rich: Your first at a Google hangout.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:50.970
[Laughter]

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:51.970
&gt;&gt;Doran: Yeah.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:52.970
&gt;&gt;Rich: Well, this one's live.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:54.210
You should know that this is live on air with
YouTube, we should probably mention that.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:59.010
We usually do a disclaimer at the start of
each of these saying that this is hangout

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:00.010
on air.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:03.520
It's live on YouTube for anyone to watch and
also during the hangout we won't make any

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.840
announcements about road maps or product releases.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.300
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Rich: So I think Sparky is back with us

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.300
no.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.770
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I am back with you and you were
exactly right.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.570
It was the YouTube window; I didn't even realize
it was up because it was hidden behind my

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:19.570
hangout window.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.020
&gt;&gt;Rich: It's so much better.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:29.560
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah, let's see if I can find that
moderator.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:38.750
Just a sec, I had to close that combined Omnibus
window so now I'm just bringing up the bare

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:39.750
moderator.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.150
&gt;&gt;Rich: Right, [inaudible]

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.550
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Alright, operated question.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:50.010
It says, "VLC for Android developer here,
from Paris France," Bonjour!

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:54.030
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Sparky: "Do you plan to support the distribution

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.430
of the multiple APK architecture based for
a single application?"

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:04.230
It says, "We don't wanna have just a generic
20 meg APK out of which you only pick one

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.230
architecture."

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:11.460
So this is, this is a surprisingly popular
request, I think, given that there's hardly

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:15.370
any devices out there that aren't [inaudible]
based.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:23.690
But, you know, anything that just runs in
dalvik doesn't need to select based on architecture.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:29.560
So it's really only for APKs that have a native
component and I don't think we've announced

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.300
anything in that regard.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.240
So going back to what you were saying

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.420
&gt;&gt;Nick: I think we've got some questions in
the moderator which we may have tackled last

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.940
week with this being one of them where yeah
we this feedback that you wanna switch AVI

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.030
to multiple APK and yeah, it's on the roadmap
but don't know when.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:52.280
But thank you for the feedback; we'll feed
that through to the developers and [inaudible]

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.280
team.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:15:00.070
&gt;&gt;Sparky: So, let's see, next one, "My widgets
stop interacting with my application.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:03.660
One of the buttons is really simple it has
a pending intent to start the application's

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.240
main activity.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:12.750
What could stop a pending intent from working
and basically how can you get some sort of

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:16.540
inspection or debugging insight on pending
intents?

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.270
He says, "Can you get log cat info?"

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:23.510
I would presume that means or anything else.

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:28.580
I guess my first question is are you doing
anything to, say, refreshing the pending intent

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.740
when, say either when it fires?

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:35.420
Like if you click the button and then it fires,
are you refreshing it with code?

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:39.910
Or if you're leaving your activity and then,
basically if you're doing anything that restarts

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.950
your app or activity are you refreshing your
pending intent at any time.

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:47.030
Do you guys have anything to offer on that?

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:51.000
&gt;&gt;Rich: You know, I mentioned, we had this
one last week as well, we're gonna have to

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.480
ditch down to, I think the first one we didn't
answer was the [inaudible] master builder

00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:00.070
question cause we don't have your access to
the moderator.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:03.700
The other thing we did say last week was if
you're debugging your application and you

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:10.140
keep pushing new variances of it to the handset
from your development environment then you

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:14.270
have to revamp the widget each time as the
widget would become disassociated with the

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.270
application.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.560
But, other than that, in a production environment
it shouldn't be happening.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:24.780
The pending intent should remain associated
with the application [inaudible].

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:32.330
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Do you know of anything, like any
particular events that cause a pending intent

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.310
to get dropped or obsoleted or something?

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.310
&gt;&gt;Rich: No.

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:40.310
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Oh, okay.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:46.280
&gt;&gt;Al: If the intent, the pending intent is
taking place and not received by the application,

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:51.610
there should be a message in [inaudible] cat
that says that the intent has been fired even

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.200
if the application has not received it.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.830
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, I agree.

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:03.090
I was just admiring the little jellybean statue
in the background from the jellybeans.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:08.930
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Rich: Alright, so let's move on then.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:13.250
We've got a couple more just slightly further
down.

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:17.490
Did you get an answer for the blur mask filter
question, Sparky?

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:18.910
&gt;&gt;Sparky: For the which one?

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:20.920
&gt;&gt;Rich: blur mask filter?

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:21.920
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Not yet.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:28.199
I only, I reported it as, I filed it as a
bug this afternoon and of course the Mountain

00:17:28.199 --> 00:17:31.050
View guys haven't come online yet so they
haven't seen it.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.850
&gt;&gt;Rich: Excellent.

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:36.280
That's the kind of power you have when you
file a question inside of the office hours.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:42.290
So the question was, "Android Blur Mask Filter
has no effect on canvas dot draw oval, or

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:46.060
any other shape while the text is blurred
on quality report."

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:49.200
Apparently, there's a bug there.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:54.160
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Also, my comment there is out of
date.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:01.790
I took the information that he posted to stack
overflow and I made an app that uses his code.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.100
&gt;&gt;Rich: Fantastic.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:09.220
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah, I attached that to my bug
so the guys on the Android team should have

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.950
no excuse to say, "Oh, we couldn't reproduce
it here."

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:16.160
&gt;&gt;Man in hangout: I'm sorry that is, I am
[inaudible] that is my bug.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.870
I've been actually tinkering with it for over
a week and I just couldn't figure out what

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:24.760
was wrong and some other guy has posted that
it would perfectly on Gingerbread.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:28.090
But I'm not sure if Gingerbread has hardware
acceleration or does it?

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:29.090
&gt;&gt;Rich: No, no it doesn't.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:30.670
&gt;&gt;Man in hangout: That's why it worked on
Gingerbread.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.320
Thank you.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:39.130
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, so, on Ice Cream Sandwich or
Honeycomb above you can turn off hardware

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:43.630
acceleration if you wanna make sure it is
the hardware acceleration cause it is possible

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:45.270
that it is.

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:49.140
And then some of the hardware acceleration
is used with, is fixed again in Jellybean.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:54.200
So you may just need to turn it off for Honeycomb
and Ice Cream Sandwich if you find it is hardware

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.370
acceleration related.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:59.790
&gt;&gt;Nick: And also, a note on that, if you set
your target API at 15 for Ice Cream Sandwich

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:04.480
then you'll automatically turn on hardware
acceleration so you might not have realized

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.150
you turned it on.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:12.350
&gt;&gt;Man in hangout: Well, it was intended to
be because it's a heavy application.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:15.510
It just computes a lot of loads and everything.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:19.680
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, you'll definitely have to play
with the hardware acceleration.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.930
&gt;&gt;Nick: The hardware acceleration's not gonna
help with complication stuff it's just gonna

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:24.490
help with [inaudible]

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:26.570
&gt;&gt;Man in hangout: Right.

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:33.340
&gt;&gt;Nick: For those kinds of things you might
wanna look at run script.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.900
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, okay.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:41.260
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, the next question in the moderator
says, "The Spotify app and other music apps

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.200
have added cover arts, images and playback
controls on the lock screen.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:48.880
Can you point me to the API or tutorial to
amend this myself?"

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:55.510
Sparky's posted a [inaudible] stack load [indistinct]
but the answer remote control client.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:20:01.740
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah, basically the, there's some
information out there that was actually provided

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:07.920
by the guy who publishes, is it called widget
unlocker or widget locker?

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.880
&gt;&gt;Nick: This isn't that though, this is talking
about the official remote control client.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:18.420
So as of Ice Cream Sandwich there's, this
is what Spotify and the built-in music app,

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.430
and a number of apps like TuneIn radio, use.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:26.990
There's an official way on the Android like
stop lock screen to post the LMR and images

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.870
and so on and the playback tools.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:36.880
So he needs to look at the Android dot media
dot dot remotecontrolclient [indistinct] to

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.600
do that.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:44.400
I don't know that it's a sample code after
that, do you know, Sparky?

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:49.320
Has it been added to the random music playback
app?

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.470
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I haven't taken a look at it.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:53.470
&gt;&gt;Nick: Okay.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:57.510
I'm not sure that it will be but if you take
a look at the remote control client class

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:01.450
then you can come back to us here if you have
any further questions on that.

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:05.920
&gt;&gt;Al: There's a bit of a sample code, actually,
in the API doc to remote control client class

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.310
so hopefully that will be enough to get him
going.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:09.370
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:14.150
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Nick: Should we get to the next question?

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:20.770
&gt;&gt;Rich: Sure, I'm just looking through the
comments on the Google Plus thread.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:25.540
There's quite a few comments about how to
start up as a brand new Android developer

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.570
and how do you install the tool chain?

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:31.950
Apparently the it may, the documentation may
have got out of sync with the latest Android

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.760
developer tools.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:39.380
Um, we did notice this but we were doing code
laps at Google IO this year and the first

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:43.650
part of the code lap is to import the project
into eclipse and we started the code lap at

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:48.120
the same time as they release Android developer
tools 20 which changes the eclipse import

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.120
process.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:56.310
So, actually, no one can complete step 1.1
of the code lap but the steps on the developer

00:21:56.310 --> 00:22:01.460
Android dot com at the start for installing
eclipse should be all up to date so we'll

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.510
get that checked out if they're not.

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:04.510
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:12.280
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I would also say that unless your
app is really complex you can go a long, long

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:16.130
ways not importing the project.

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:25.070
My typical approach in Eclipse is either to
start a project with an external source rather

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:32.710
than importing it or failing that, or possibly
in combination with that, I can just create

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:39.990
a basic project with the Hello World app and
then copy the source, the res folder, the

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:45.780
source and res folders and the Androidmanifest
dot xml into the new project and just use

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:48.940
those and just go from there.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:53.880
&gt;&gt;Nick: Sneaky, well used [indistinct].

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:58.130
&gt;&gt;Rich: Still the application needs [inaudible]

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:03.000
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah, I've been and Eclipse user
for a long, long time and I've always been

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.040
pretty suspicious of any import wizards related
to Eclipse which is why I kind of learned

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:12.620
early to just copy files into a template app
[Laughs]

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.230
&gt;&gt;Sparky: And go from there.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:20.150
&gt;&gt;Rich: Alright, do you wanna hit up the next
question then?

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:26.510
&gt;&gt;Nick: We got a question from [inaudible]
and it says, "Is developing for the latest

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:35.030
API level, will make my app run on all Android
devices, say 13 or 12?"

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:39.590
So I'm gonna interpret that, I think there's
two things you can say when developing the

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:44.809
latest API level, you need to bear in mind,
there's the API level you're building against,

00:23:44.809 --> 00:23:49.660
so you know, that's the version you're looking
at real time.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:53.630
And then there's also the attribute in your
manifest with target API level.

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:59.050
So those two things can differ but I would
argue they are the same.

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:03.360
So I would say that you always want to set
both of those to build against and target

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:09.290
to the latest version of the Android release
which you know about and you've tested your

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:10.290
application on.

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:15.460
And then you can set a different min STK which
is the minimum version of Android on which

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.550
it will run.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:20.633
So by setting those two things, that defines
the level of devices that your app will run

00:24:20.633 --> 00:24:21.633
on.

00:24:21.633 --> 00:24:25.750
So you need to be aware when you set them
different you're basically signing a contract

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:30.980
saying I promise not call any new APIs on
any old releases and this is actually what

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:34.440
I gave a code lap on in Google IO.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:40.240
If you go to developers dot Google dot com/IO
and look in the code lap section there's one

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:45.720
about building backward possible Android apps
and from there you'll be able to find my slides

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.280
and a code lap there as well.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:52.070
So I hope that answers your question.

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:59.050
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I would just reinforce on that that
your target API level is not the maximum that

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:04.580
your app will run on, it's simply the maximum
who's features your app already knows about

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.190
at the time you write it.

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:11.470
But any device that has backwards compatibility
is just about all will do, even on a newer

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:15.550
OS will run it just fine.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:21.890
So don't be afraid to put your target STK
as high as you can and then your min STK to

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:23.059
the lowest you'll support.

00:25:23.059 --> 00:25:31.320
&gt;&gt;Al: It's also probably worth mentioning
that the min STK, it is a filtering market

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:35.600
so if you set it too high some users won't
be able to see it if they have an older device

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:40.610
so it's best to check that the features you're
using really do need the API level, if it

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:46.120
can be done with API level of 2-4 it's worth
dropping min STK down.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:54.559
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Right and for certain, if you're
looking for, you know, monetary justification,

00:25:54.559 --> 00:26:03.370
you know, it's really nice if you can go back
to 2.2 or 2.1 to get, if you wanna get the

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:08.670
long tail go back to 1.6 but you can cover
like 95 percent of your possible market place

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:10.940
by going back to 2.1.

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:17.930
&gt;&gt;Al: Was there any update on recommended
methods for using reflection to optimally

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:25.450
degrade features so you can support older
versions of devices or older versions of Android

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.730
as well as having features of the latest stuff?

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:32.950
&gt;&gt;Rich: I prefer to API gate things these
days, there used to be a need for reflection

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:41.890
in 1.5 and 1.6 but as of 2.0 you can include
code inside the class files that wouldn't

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:44.230
be able to run on the system as long as you
don't actually run it.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:47.200
&gt;&gt;Nick: Well, actually, I don't think there
was ever really a need for reflection unless

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:52.440
your manually building against, you know,
linking against the lower API level and then

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:57.910
trying to invoke later added APIs, that's
the only case I can think of where you need

00:26:57.910 --> 00:26:58.910
reflection.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:04.030
The issue with the pre 2.0 class load is to
blow up, if you try to incorp classes which,

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:08.410
you know, are running a Cupcake device, you
can get around that with a factory pattern

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:17.440
which are much nicer than the reflection,
in my opinion cause you still get [inaudible].

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.280
&gt;&gt;Al: Okay, cool.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.280
[Pause]

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.280
&gt;&gt;Rich: Okay.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:26.350
&gt;&gt;Nick: So there's some chat going on in the
G plus plus [inaudible] about getting started.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:30.260
Matt Storms is asking for some pointers on
getting started.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:33.370
So it sounds like it's not really getting
started with Android it's getting started

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:36.240
in Java programming is what it sounds like.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:41.240
Does anyone have any top picks of great places
to get jump start your Java development?

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:45.000
There's Code Academy I've heard good things
about, not used it myself but I heard that's

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.800
pretty useful for new starters.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.800
&gt;&gt;Matt: [inaudible]

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.550
&gt;&gt;Nick: What was that Yani?

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:53.770
&gt;&gt;Johanni: There's millions of tutorials on
Google [inaudible]

00:27:53.770 --> 00:28:02.830
&gt;&gt;Nick: There's a lot of tutorials I guess
it's just picking good ones.

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:09.510
&gt;&gt;Sparky: On actually a lot of the, a lot
of the introductory Android sample apps and

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:15.270
tutorials also give a pretty good sort of
gentle introduction to Java especially the

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.240
relevant bits.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.910
&gt;&gt;Johanni: [inaudible]

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:32.139
&gt;&gt;Matt: Do you have plans to get a step by
step tutorial going?

00:28:32.139 --> 00:28:47.381
&gt;&gt; Nick: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Matt: Yeah, that might be a good place to

00:28:47.381 --> 00:28:48.381
look
[Mumbling]

00:28:48.381 --> 00:28:49.381
[Pause]

00:28:49.381 --> 00:28:52.200
&gt;&gt;Nick: Alex is asking, "When, oh, when will
I finally get the new developer console?"

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.050
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Nick: I'm so excited.

00:28:56.050 --> 00:29:02.340
Like we said we can't really talk about dates
cause they'll probably change and they'll

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.340
be wrong and we'll look silly.

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:08.470
So all I can say is you keep doing the right
thing, signing up for the preview, the team

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:11.800
is working as hard as they can to get it out
as soon as possible.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:16.309
&gt;&gt;Rich: Well, done in signing up for the preview
as well.

00:29:16.309 --> 00:29:22.540
[inaudible] maxed out during the IO presentation
that announced the preview and it was live.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:24.350
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Rich: So if you managed to sign up that's

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:29.030
good because if you try to get to the link
now it just says Thank you but we've already

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.250
filled our quota.

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:34.940
So you will be one of the first people to
see and get it, it looks like, when the rollouts

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.670
do happen.

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:41.530
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Rich: We've got Trevor who

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:46.960
&gt;&gt;Sparky: We can hear Trevor so maybe he would
like to say hello and actually tell us what's

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.670
on his mind towards Android development.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:56.270
&gt;&gt;Nick: He's the strong silent type.

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:57.370
[Laughter]

00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:58.872
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Stunned him into silence.

00:29:58.872 --> 00:30:02.500
&gt;&gt;Nick: [Inaudible] our colleague in Sidney,
so it's what 10 o'clock there?

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.520
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:09.300
&gt;&gt;Nick: He's got a young baby though so he's
probably up at all hours.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:14.870
Making an excellent point about that backward
compatibility chat we were having earlier

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:18.101
saying that Lint helps you out so yeah, very,
very much so.

00:30:18.101 --> 00:30:23.300
I think one of the reasons people used to
change the level of Android they're building

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:28.350
against is just to make sure they weren't
provoking any new APIs, it's now kind of obsoleted

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:31.521
by the fact that you can use Lint to stats
and analysis of your code and it'll give you

00:30:31.521 --> 00:30:38.190
this new API warning if you're trying to invoke
an API that was introduced later than whatever

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:42.470
you set your min as, your min API level, so
that's a really good point.

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:43.470
It really helps.

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:47.320
And it's used extensively in that code lab
I mentioned which Rich is entering.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.880
&gt;&gt;Johanni: [Inaudible]

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:59.070
&gt;&gt;Nick: Can you say that again you're a bit

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:02.640
&gt;&gt;Johanni: Okay, I'll speak closer to the
mic.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:07.580
Is it still able to run the app on multiple
devices [inaudible] cause there's some things

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:11.230
like the way pop ups are canceled [inaudible]

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:12.360
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.490
&gt;&gt;Johanni: [Inaudible]

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:16.880
&gt;&gt;Nick: Voice testing our own device.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.880
[Pause]

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.840
&gt;&gt;Rich: I'm just driving this, sorry.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:28.330
&gt;&gt;Matt: How about another question from the
moderator?

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:32.309
[Pause]

00:31:32.309 --> 00:31:49.090
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah, so, I'm not sure how far,
or where in the moderator, you guys were in

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:53.090
a hangout last week when I wasn't here so
I don't know which ones you've covered or

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:54.090
not.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:32:00.850
&gt;&gt;Nick: Uh, Rich, you wanna look up?

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:05.700
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yep, one more word.

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.640
Alright,
[Pause]

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.549
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, that.

00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:14.090
So the question says, "[inaudible] with two
actions, stop and play, pause.

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:17.600
[inaudible] the list disappears when play,
pause" what?

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:18.650
I'm lost.

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:24.730
&gt;&gt;Rich: When you press stop the notifications
disappear but when you press play, pause the

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:28.860
notification with a new icon is sent with
a notification list stays open.

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:32.570
Are the two buttons at the bottom?

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:39.269
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, so I think he's talking about
the new Jellybean notification APIs.

00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:41.780
Is Krieger listening in?

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.100
He might be able to clear some of this up.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.630
&gt;&gt;Al: I know the project he's talking about,
it's the open intents time sheet.

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:48.630
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:54.050
&gt;&gt;Al: He's still pushing some code is basically
what he's trying to do it have stop, stop

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:58.290
the task but not remove the notification from
the notification bar.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:02.350
But what he's saying is when stop's pressed,
the notification is removed from the notification

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:03.350
bar.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:04.350
&gt;&gt;Rich: Pause stops the notifications?

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:05.350
&gt;&gt;Al: Yeah.

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:06.350
&gt;&gt;Rich: Hm.

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:07.350
Seems reasonable.

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:08.350
[Laughs]

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:12.390
&gt;&gt;Nick: So it's an ongoing investigation for
a background service?

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:16.590
&gt;&gt;Al: What he, yeah, what is basically is
is a time tracking application and he's trying

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:23.010
to use the stop button to stop the tracking
of time rather than stop the application itself.

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:26.530
But he's saying the stop button removes the
notifications.

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:29.200
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, is he using a builder to build
it up?

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.020
&gt;&gt;Al: I don't, I've asked him for the source
code and he's trying to get that across to

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:35.730
me so he might have it later today in which
case I won't use the moderator with that.

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:38.840
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, that'd be interesting to look
at cause I know on the builder you can set

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:43.780
auto cancel which I do actually wonder if
it's balanced with service where cancel actually

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.840
removes the notification when you press stop.

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.790
So that'll be my first thing I'd look at.

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:53.750
The API change right toward [inaudible] there
used to be a window flag that you could set

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:59.520
to say whether it flows to the application
or not but I can't remember, so I'll have

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.520
to check.

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:04.180
But, yeah, it'd be nice to see the code that
behind this behavior.

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:09.440
&gt;&gt;Al: I'll try to get a link up in the moderator.

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.869
&gt;&gt;Nick: Is that one new [inaudible] APIs yet

00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:14.090
&gt;&gt;Al: It's not.

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:18.669
&gt;&gt;Nick: It's probably one of the bigger developers
facing changes was JB.

00:34:18.669 --> 00:34:25.140
JB is a lot of polished butteryness and smoothing
things out and not a ton of new developer

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:29.040
features that the API guys are pretty sweet.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:45.150
So if you've not looked at those yet I highly
encourage you to take a look.

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:46.260
[Pause]
[Mumbling]

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:49.580
&gt;&gt;Nick: We should take another question.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.800
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:57.600
We're stumbling across more of the questions
we took last week now but there was one

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:01.300
[Pause]
[Mumbling]

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:08.140
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Is it maybe the volume keys question?

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:11.810
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, you can go for the volume keys
question there seems to be a lot of backwards

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:13.340
and forwards on that.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.859
You wanna take that?

00:35:14.859 --> 00:35:19.590
&gt;&gt;Sparky: So Yohan from the Netherlands says,
"I'm working on an app where he traps volume

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:24.510
up and volume down and on the Acer Iconious
7 inch tablet the buttons seem to be reversed,

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:25.619
any idea why?"

00:35:25.619 --> 00:35:34.160
Um, I noticed that the buttons appeared to
be reversed on the Nexus 7 as well and, and,

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:39.270
and also on an LG tablet that I've got.

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:42.630
And then it just suddenly hit me, it's a portrait
device.

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:47.970
The 7 inch tablet is by default a portrait
device and when you hold it in portrait that

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:53.250
lower button actually is volume down but when
you turn it landscape, hitting that button

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:58.480
the right, makes the volume bar go to the
left.

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:02.109
So my thought is that it is intended to be
a landscape device and it's not remapping

00:36:02.109 --> 00:36:05.790
the sense of the buttons when you change the
orientation of the device.

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:11.160
I think it should remap the sense of the buttons
as you change orientation but I don't know

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.900
that that's mandated by the platform or anything
like that.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:21.119
I actually opened up a, I don't remember if
it was a bug or a feature request on Jellybean

00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:26.250
that we should, in fact, change the sense
of the buttons as we change the sense of the

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:28.660
device.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.330
That was my answer to that question.

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:40.800
&gt;&gt;Rich: I mean, it seems very strange when
you've got the app and the landscape across

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:47.691
the top [inaudible] you press the right gear
pedal and the gear goes down and the left

00:36:47.691 --> 00:36:51.330
hand pedal, the display on the screen goes
the opposite way so that's very confusing.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:53.010
I'm sure they'll change that [inaudible]

00:36:53.010 --> 00:37:00.570
&gt;&gt;Nick: There's something to be said for the
expectation that this bit of the button always

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:05.820
turns the volume up, you know, you just always,
if you go away from that like it's a stable

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:11.110
experience right now, like I know that hitting
that always turns the volume up and they go

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:16.240
changing it around and flipping and reversing
it, I, I don't know.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:21.950
I'm sure there's tons of user studies behind
this choice so I will leave that to wiser

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:24.190
and more tested people than I am.

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:25.480
&gt;&gt;Rich: Good choice.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:29.030
&gt;&gt;Al: I get partly confused with which way
is up.

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:33.650
Um, how do you define which way is up with
the tablet when you hold it one way or whether

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:34.900
you hold it another way?

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.721
How do you define what the up button is?

00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:41.940
If you are gonna have a consistent experience
one way up could be another way down.

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:45.690
&gt;&gt;Rich: yeah, it's just the graphics on the
screen move the other way to the variations

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:47.210
you push the button.

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:54.060
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I think there's fair room for argument
on both sides because I think it is reasonable

00:37:54.060 --> 00:38:02.690
from a UX perspective to expect that the same
hardware affords, the same hardware thing

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:05.900
has the same result every time.

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:11.650
And that sort of runs contrary to the pressing
the right button makes the slider go right,

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:15.570
if you see what I mean.

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:19.790
&gt;&gt;Nick: Maybe we should just change it so
if you're in landscape the volume bar is like

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:23.710
vertical rather than horizontal and that'd
be way less confusing.

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:24.710
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, cause you're not touching on

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:27.010
the left and it's going right.

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:29.690
&gt;&gt;Rich: You have a second set of buttons here.

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:32.740
&gt;&gt;Nick: You touch here and it goes up.

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:33.740
Anyway.

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.490
&gt;&gt;Yohan: Sorry guys, I joined late.

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:38.310
&gt;&gt;Rich: Oh, we just answered your question.

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:39.310
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:40.310
[Laughter]

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:42.070
&gt;&gt;Yohan: I'll watch it later.

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:51.310
Maybe add a preference to reverse the effect
of the volume button

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:53.480
[Mumbling]

00:38:53.480 --> 00:39:01.100
&gt;&gt;Al: You could, in theory, do it in applications
by detecting the orientation device and then

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:04.490
altering the action in response to volume
up and volume down.

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:05.490
[Laughter]

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:09.320
&gt;&gt;Rich: We'd like to keep it consistent across
the applications.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.680
So we need to fix it in the platform if it
in an issue or we'll just accept that this

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.680
is

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.680
&gt;&gt;Nick: Change it.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:15.680
Change it.

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.680
&gt;&gt;Yohan: Okay.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:17.680
[Laughter]

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.500
&gt;&gt;Rich: Accept that it is right the way that
it is and you're just a bunch of monkeys.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:23.950
&gt;&gt;Al: What are you actually capturing Yohan?

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:28.090
Is it actually for volume control or is it
something else?

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:34.900
&gt;&gt;Yohan: Yeah it's the volume control but
it's for, um, how do you say it, server.

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:38.359
So I'm controlling an external device.

00:39:38.359 --> 00:39:44.900
It's basically we promote control in an app
[inaudible]

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:48.110
&gt;&gt;Rich: Okay, can you say anymore?

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:53.720
Is it Google TV or Nexus Q or anything?

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.260
[Laughter]

00:39:55.260 --> 00:40:06.410
&gt;&gt;Yohan: But you could say, um, I could increase
the volume [inaudible].

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:13.640
But it was one particular device so I'll figure
it out.

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:14.680
&gt;&gt;Rich: Good.

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.810
I'm glad you'll figure it out.

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:20.420
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Rich: Few interruptions, right?

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:21.420
[Laughter]

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:26.070
&gt;&gt;Nick: This is interesting app, did anyone
catch that new Twitter app Tweet Lanes that

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:30.150
came out over the weekend, I think it was,
which is using the volume keys to kind of

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:36.010
step onto the next tweet in streams so you
can sit there and tap, tap, tap and you don't

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:39.480
have to use the screen which is kind of interesting,
I thought.

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:43.030
I prefer scrolls smoothly, at the moment it
jumps which is a bit jarring.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:51.540
I prefer to use smooth scroll 2, I think is
the API they use but interesting new app.

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:54.790
[Pause]
[Typing noise]

00:40:54.790 --> 00:41:00.070
&gt;&gt;Nick: Go back to the moderator

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:03.580
&gt;&gt;Rich: I think we may have completed the
moderator.

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:05.150
&gt;&gt;Nick: Oh, interesting.

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:08.490
&gt;&gt;Rich: Let's have just another quick look
through the comments.

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:11.430
&gt;&gt;Sparky: There's some new ones that just
came in, I think.

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:13.310
&gt;&gt;Rich: In the moderator?

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:14.310
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah.

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:15.650
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Oh, yeah.

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:18.730
Like, "Why Nexus devices have no SD card slot?

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:22.710
I'd like to buy a Nexus 7 but 16 Gig isn't
very much."

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:25.410
It's all about cost.

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:28.080
Adding card slots costs money.

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:31.020
Adding, making cases that can be opened up
costs money.

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:32.020
&gt;&gt;Nick: What about the cloud?

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:35.210
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, there's a better answer to that
Sparky.

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:36.210
&gt;&gt;Nick: I was sure you were gonna say something
about the Cloud.

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:37.210
[Laughter]

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:40.990
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Oh, I knew I got it wrong.

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:41.990
[Laughter]

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:47.230
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, so technically it's probably
about cost but the message is about Cloud.

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:48.280
Why do you need, um

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:53.510
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, I've been using the 8 Gig version
and I haven't really been using it too much,

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:58.760
I mean, music, a couple of films, a few games
and it's not too big of a deal, really, I

00:41:58.760 --> 00:41:59.760
think I ran out once.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.760
&gt;&gt;Rich: I'm the opposite.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.010
I keep running out of space on the 8 gig.

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:07.859
I'd love to switch to the 16 but of course
you can just use the USB adaptor and put in

00:42:07.859 --> 00:42:11.730
128 gig memory stick in the bottom, maybe
find a little tiny one, maybe wrap around

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:16.740
the back, find some kind of adaptor, accidental
hard drive.

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:17.740
But for the price

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:24.119
&gt;&gt;Sparky: What are you filling up an 8 gig
tablet with?

00:42:24.119 --> 00:42:30.140
I mean I've got my entire music collection
and like a few dozen games and I think I've

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:31.140
got 6 gigs free.

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:32.140
&gt;&gt;Al: Enough movies for a flight to San Francisco
and back?

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:35.250
&gt;&gt;Rich: He's got 2 gigs of music to his name.

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:36.250
[Laughter]

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:37.250
&gt;&gt;Rich: That's crazy dude.

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.360
You must be using Google Cloud or something.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:40.790
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I am using the Cloud.

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:44.000
&gt;&gt;Rich: Let me just show you my games on here.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.900
Games these days are getting big, right?

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:46.900
&gt;&gt;Al: It's games for me

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.910
&gt;&gt;Rich: I've got Death Trigger, that's 600
megabytes.

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:51.710
Shadowland, that's a gigabyte.

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:57.609
I bought the games on sale; really, it's the
sales fault more than anything.

00:42:57.609 --> 00:43:02.780
&gt;&gt;Nick: While we're talking about sales and
Nexus 7 please, please, please can everyone

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:06.770
use some kind of syncing mechanism to sync
progress between phones and tablets cause

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:08.700
I'm getting annoyed at having to play catch
up with my progress and pay for a game twice

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:12.540
on my phone and tablet depending on what I
have with me.

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:15.640
&gt;&gt;Al: You mean like the Google drive API that
the SDKs gonna come out?

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.340
&gt;&gt;Nick: That's a perfect segue about what
I was gonna say next.

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:19.340
[Laughter]

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.109
&gt;&gt;Al: Have you seen their t-shirts?

00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:23.560
They have "I sync therefore I am" on them.

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:24.560
[Laughter]

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.619
&gt;&gt;Rich: I didn't catch those at IO.

00:43:26.619 --> 00:43:27.619
&gt;&gt;Al: Yeah
[Laughter]

00:43:27.619 --> 00:43:29.420
&gt;&gt;Al: I'll have to get me one of them.

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.800
That's a t-shirt I don't have, what's going
on?

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:32.800
[Laughter]

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:36.230
&gt;&gt;Al: I have it, Rich, this is scary.

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:38.860
You're usually the swag magnet.

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:41.450
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, you're the magnet, that's fine.

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:42.450
Whatever.

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:46.170
Okay, so are there any more questions from
inside the hangout while we figure out what

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:48.420
else is on the moderator?

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:55.310
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I'll refer to one question from
a newcomer who said, "How long do the hangouts

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:59.900
usually last and are you planning on always
hosting them at 2 o'clock in the afternoon?"

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:03.800
Yes, they last an hour and they're always
gonna be at 2 o'clock in the afternoon Wednesday.

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:07.650
UK time, that's 3 o'clock in the afternoon
Central Europe time.

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:10.650
&gt;&gt;Nick: We had that last week and I answer
it different, I was like, "Well, they currently

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:14.860
are but is there any, you know, is it a bad
time for you?"

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.610
But I didn't hear anything back.

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:19.859
No one, just seem to say it was a fine time
so it's gonna stay the same.

00:44:19.859 --> 00:44:25.570
&gt;&gt;Rich: We have a new single place we're coordinating
all of these hangouts across the products,

00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:31.080
the Chrome hangouts, the GPlus hangouts, the
Android hangouts

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.080
&gt;&gt;Nick: There's other products?

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.690
&gt;&gt;Rich: There's other products, they don't
get green rooms like this.

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:38.960
And that's at developers dot Google dot Com
forward slash live.

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:44.770
Google did a live launch just before IO on
June the 18th and it's a single portal for

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:48.180
finding out all the details for all these
hangouts and you can post all the questions

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:52.619
into the hangouts in different time zones,
you can watch the hangouts, yay.

00:44:52.619 --> 00:44:59.250
&gt;&gt;Nick: Which is incidentally why we didn't
use the events on GPlus, I think we're trying

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:05.530
to use live that's where all of the Google
club is, hangouts, office hours and so on

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:08.150
are gonna be hosted so [inaudible] really

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:13.920
&gt;&gt;Al: Is there any way of filtering this stuff
on live so I can only get Android stuff or

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.590
people can only get Chrome stuff?

00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:19.410
&gt;&gt;Rich: There may not be yet but I know when
we create the events it says which product

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:24.690
it's for so I'm sure, because the developers
live site just went live so there's a whole

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:27.560
team still working on the functionality of
it and maybe that will be added.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:28.700
&gt;&gt;Nick: [inaudible]

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.390
&gt;&gt;Rich: I can understand why you'd want to
filter the rest of that

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:34.490
&gt;&gt;Nick: Maybe we should use Gplus event, you
know, go into party mode

00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:35.490
&gt;&gt;Rich: [inaudible]
[Laughter]

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:40.300
&gt;&gt;Nick: Everyone can take a photo of where
they are.

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:44.210
&gt;&gt;Al: I did run an event with hangouts so
it'll be interesting to see if there's pictures

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:47.470
of hangouts taking place in browsers on various
people's desktops.

00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:48.920
&gt;&gt;Nick: Did anyone do it?

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:52.700
&gt;&gt;Al: There were people that said they were
coming and I think most of those came.

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:57.359
&gt;&gt;Nick: I'm gonna join your event now, place
a photo.

00:45:57.359 --> 00:46:00.700
Talk amongst yourselves.

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:07.910
&gt;&gt;Rich: Someone's joining the hangout.

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:09.980
[Mumbling]

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:23.990
&gt;&gt;Rich: I'm just trying to add you into the
hangout [inaudible].

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:30.540
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Rich: For some reason it's not letting me.

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.580
What have you done wrong?

00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:36.060
[Laughs]
[Pause]

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:41.730
&gt;&gt;Nick: everyone's signing up for Al's GPlus
event.

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:42.730
&gt;&gt;Rich: Right.

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:53.369
&gt;&gt;Al: I've taken the first photos so hopefully
we can see how it comes out.

00:46:53.369 --> 00:46:57.670
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I think we've got a new question
on the moderator here.

00:46:57.670 --> 00:47:04.030
It says, "I'm working on building an amateur
new hardware device, can't find any guide

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:07.990
on how to customize system apps like the ones
that reference internal values and such.

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:10.150
For example, [inaudible]launcher."

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:17.090
I would say that your route there is to download
the source from the Android open source project

00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:19.349
and built the social system.

00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:27.870
Now, the actual, like the Google system, um,
services apps, those you can't get from AOSP

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:33.850
but if you're gonna go that route then you
enter into a partnership with Google and then

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:37.510
maybe the PDK will be made available to you,
the new thing that we announced at Google

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:45.010
IO to help give hardware manufacturers who
are working on those devices with the Google

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:52.020
added services to get early access to upcoming
features on the platform.

00:47:52.020 --> 00:48:01.760
&gt;&gt;Al: It might also be worth mentioning the
CTS which is the set of which apps, uh, which

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:06.520
devices need to pass in order to be considered
Android compatible.

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:10.450
So if they are developing a new device, it
is well worth getting a hold of the CTS to

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:14.510
make sure they're not doing anything that
goes and takes that device outside the test

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:16.870
suite and that's the compatibility definition.

00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:19.470
&gt;&gt;Rich: How can you find the CTS?

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:23.570
&gt;&gt;Al: The CTS is part of the Android open
source project and you can download it to

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:28.700
serve part the bundles when you follow the
instructions at source dot Android dot com.

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:30.460
[Mumbling]
[Laughter]

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:37.950
&gt;&gt;Sparky: And if you think that the CTS does
not require a certain functionality that it

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:44.600
ought to then you can propose a new test and
maybe even write it and offer it as a patch

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:47.820
and maybe they'll accept it into CTS for the
next round.

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:52.970
&gt;&gt;Rich: Hm, do we have
[pause]

00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:57.450
&gt;&gt;Al: Do we have a frozen screen?

00:48:57.450 --> 00:48:58.599
[Laughs]

00:48:58.599 --> 00:49:02.040
&gt;&gt;Sparky: We do.

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:04.330
[Laughter]
[Pause]

00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:07.740
&gt;&gt;Sparky: And it's such a flattering one too.

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:08.740
[Laughter]

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:11.400
&gt;&gt;Rich: Don't know what happened there.

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:19.290
Um, there's a question come through the Gplus
chat from Boyd saying that he's not a developer

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:24.609
but is there, perhaps, a sample pack with
web view possibilities and what can I do to

00:49:24.609 --> 00:49:28.790
optimize HML5 for Android to work nice and
smoothly?

00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:33.960
Um, yeah, there's a few things, first of all
writing Android application that uses a web

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:38.910
view is pretty simple, you just drag a web
view onto there and stop floating your HTML.

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:45.980
You do still have to use the development tool
environment whether it's Eclipse or IntelliJ.

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:51.800
There are some third party tools which you
can use, word facilitate, not using the developer

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:53.700
[Pause]

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:57.911
&gt;&gt;Rich: Shouldn't recommend using any one
over any of the other ones of those you can

00:49:57.911 --> 00:50:01.230
just do a Google search for web development
on Android and hopefully you'll come across

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:02.460
those products.

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:06.180
But if you don't want to write an Android
app with web view it's all pretty simple.

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:09.880
It gets a little more complicated when you're
looking at making it super smooth because

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:13.430
the hardware acceleration of the web view
has varied throughout various versions of

00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:14.430
Android.

00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:22.240
There wasn't really in Gingerbread, with Honeycomb
we added some high acceleration for web view

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:25.410
but some of the functionality of the web view
wasn't hardware accelerated.

00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:30.180
We have an IO talk and some details you can
look for on the internet about what is hardware

00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:31.180
accelerated and what isn't.

00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:36.020
It improved a bit in Ice Cream Sandwich but
it's improved massively in Jellybean.

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:42.020
The Jellybean web view has good hardware acceleration
on; it fixes many of the issues you would

00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:46.290
have seen in the Ice Cream Sandwich and higher
and other web views.

00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:50.250
So the simplest way is to not use hardware
acceleration at all but you won't get great

00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:51.300
performance.

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:56.290
The best way is to optimize it for your own
Gingerbread, then Honeycomb and Ice Cream

00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:59.430
Sandwich and also Jellybean on top.

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:03.640
Maybe do hardware acceleration on Jellybean
and not on the previous ones.

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.890
It's gonna be more consistent from now on.

00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:11.040
That was a slightly distinct story for each
of the platforms with all that.

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:16.150
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I don't know if I would recommend
a web view for like really challenging stuff

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:18.530
that needs acceleration anyway.

00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:24.599
I think, a web app is a way to get, sort of,
a lowest common denominator application that

00:51:24.599 --> 00:51:29.130
runs on as many disparate platforms as possible

00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:30.130
&gt;&gt;Matt: Preach it.

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:31.520
&gt;&gt;Sparky: but it's never gonna be best in
class on any of them.

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:34.570
&gt;&gt;Rich: Sure, the guy who asked the question
is a web developer so

00:51:34.570 --> 00:51:37.630
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Rich: Clearly his easiest routes market

00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:41.840
but we would definitely advocate using of
major views and widgets, things like that.

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:46.020
&gt;&gt;Nick: It'd just be a way of limitations
in a web view, you're only gonna get so far.

00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:52.900
When you stack all your layers of abstraction
on top of each other then yeah, you're gonna

00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:53.950
have some limitations.

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:59.980
And I certainly never found a web app which
is as smooth as or couldn't be approved by

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:01.240
doing such a thing.

00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:09.730
&gt;&gt;Al: There was a talk at IO this year about
making high performance mobile web apps.

00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:14.580
I'll stick a link to that in the comments
but I've heard from people who have used the

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:19.330
evil apple IOS version of the Facebook app
which is purely a web app that is probably

00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:22.000
one of the most dire user experiences they've
ever had.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.260
So it's kind of setting the tone for a Facebook
on a apple device come out with something

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:29.780
that's dire, there's not a lot you can do
to improve it.

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:32.109
&gt;&gt;Nick: I mean, I'm not saying there's no
call for it.

00:52:32.109 --> 00:52:36.700
I mean, Gmail, for example, uses web views
to render some of its content and that's one

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:38.670
of my favorite apps of all time.

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:45.440
So I'm not saying there's no place for it
I'm just saying if you're trying to something

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:54.560
really, really kind of responsive and interactive
and flashy then you're gonna kind of run up

00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:57.930
against the limits of what it can do.

00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:04.060
&gt;&gt;Matt: Plus you've got users expectations
of downloading an app from the store and they're

00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:07.150
gonna be at a point where [inaudible]

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:11.580
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, definitely, very valid points,
both Matt and Nick.

00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:16.270
Text layout in any app, using a web view is
gonna be one of the easiest ways of doing

00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:19.810
that especially when trying to wrap text around
images and do custom layouts.

00:53:19.810 --> 00:53:26.430
But I still put the challenge out there to
anyone who wants to produce a web based app

00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:30.589
for Android, a web app, then hand it over
and see if we can tell whether or not it's

00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:31.660
a web app.

00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:36.030
Every time you pick one up, to us, it's instantly
obvious that it's a web app, the scrolling

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:40.950
is not right, I'm trying to bounce back in
Java Script or force field in Android in Java

00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:42.400
Script, it's gonna be tricky.

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:48.080
Trying to make anything that looks native
or feels, tracks the finger like a view pager,

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:52.530
like that kind of views, it's just tricky
on the web without it being janky and slow.

00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:58.609
So, good luck, but I still have hopes for
people being up to developing web technologies

00:53:58.609 --> 00:54:01.630
&gt;&gt;Nick: We're Android fan boys so we're gonna
be native all the way.

00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:05.050
&gt;&gt;Rich: And make apps which we can tell aren't
native

00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:06.690
&gt;&gt;Nick: That's only one.

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:12.880
&gt;&gt;Rich: Feel free to make it just make it
so I can't tell.

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:13.880
[Laughter]

00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:23.570
&gt;&gt;Nick: If we've got a bit of time left, I
would like to hear from Johanni who won a

00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:25.050
hack-a-thon this weekend.

00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:37.150
We have an interesting hack, I was wondering
if you might be able to describe it to us?

00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:44.869
&gt;&gt;Johanni: Sure, so we, weren't the only ones,
but we won the Google [inaudible]

00:54:44.869 --> 00:54:46.109
&gt;&gt;Rich: Speak up.

00:54:46.109 --> 00:54:55.880
&gt;&gt;Johanni: OK, so we won the Google category
of the hack with YouTube and another Google

00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:56.880
team.

00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:57.880
[Inaudible]London.

00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:05.839
So what we built, we built, basically we stole
the idea from the Nexus Q because the Nexus

00:55:05.839 --> 00:55:11.829
Q's not gonna come here so we built one for
us Europeans.

00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:19.160
So we built a Google TV application which
was basically just a dummy player so when

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:21.040
you fire up the Google TV app it shows the
UR code.

00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:26.250
Then we have the phone applications and public
applications which you can use to scan the

00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:33.210
UR codes and join the party and everyone who
scans the same UR code, size, product, same

00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:38.343
party and then you can just search YouTube
videos on put them on a common playlist.

00:55:38.343 --> 00:55:43.470
And the Google TV application will just play
the playlist until it runs out.

00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:44.470
[Inaudible].

00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:50.920
&gt;&gt;Nick: So this easy to do, you usually [inaudible]
YouTube player API, so basically

00:55:50.920 --> 00:56:03.579
&gt;&gt;Male #10: Yeah, new player API so we can
actually invent the player and videos and

00:56:03.579 --> 00:56:06.740
the application and not launch the YouTube
player.

00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:13.369
We used the Google Cloud method so people
don't have to use wifi [inaudible] then we

00:56:13.369 --> 00:56:18.670
used the, we rebuilt the application from
a couple of regular applications.

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:21.650
We [inaudible] tablet API,

00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:23.150
&gt;&gt;Rich: Good.

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:26.400
&gt;&gt;Nick: Is that using the new template style?

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:32.869
&gt;&gt;Male #10: No because the templates only
available if you ask apple [inaudible].

00:56:32.869 --> 00:56:41.470
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, so we've got the app [inaudible]
we didn't have Ice Cream Sandwich or anything.

00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:46.010
Well he says he built it but I haven't seen
a link in Playstore yet so

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:49.990
&gt;&gt;Male #10: I sent it a case to match so you
can see

00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:52.750
&gt;&gt;Nick: In your face, quite certainly.

00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:58.260
&gt;&gt;Al: So, um, your new, your new ego, slogan,
isn't it Nick?

00:56:58.260 --> 00:56:59.619
No Playstore link?

00:56:59.619 --> 00:57:00.619
Never happened.

00:57:00.619 --> 00:57:01.619
[Laughter]

00:57:01.619 --> 00:57:07.350
&gt;&gt;Nick: Well, I think that just about brings
us to a close.

00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:16.340
So unless there's any burning questions that
you guys have been chomping at the bit to

00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:21.530
ask but haven't been able to get a word in
edgewise then I think we might draw this session

00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:22.990
to a close.

00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:25.589
So thank you very much everyone who joined
us live

00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:28.710
&gt;&gt;Al: You asked if anyone had any burning
questions, maybe someone has.

00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:30.720
Does anyone have any burning questions?

00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:32.820
So the last people that joined want to ask
anything?

00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:33.820
&gt;&gt;Nick: I paused for half a second.

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:36.170
&gt;&gt;Rich: Half a second, I know, but there might
be lag

00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:37.170
[Laughter]

00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:40.839
&gt;&gt;Rich: It should be like does anyone have
any questions before we wrap up today?

00:57:40.839 --> 00:57:45.089
Okay you should carry on anyway.

00:57:45.089 --> 00:57:47.550
Sorry for the interruption.

00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:50.070
So your normal service shall resume shortly
[Laughter]

00:57:50.070 --> 00:57:54.280
&gt;&gt;Nick: I was just saying thank you everyone
for joining us on the live stream and watching

00:57:54.280 --> 00:58:01.070
on YouTube later on, hi people in the future,
but we'll do this every week so 2 pm UK time

00:58:01.070 --> 00:58:02.070

00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:04.070
