00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:01.550
Welcome back.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.820
In the previous video we had
this very positive scenario,

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.770
where I had originally bought
a house for $1.5 million.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.950
Then a year later, the value of
the house, or at least my

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.280
perceived value of the house,
went up to $1.5 million,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.530
because my neighbors sold
their identical

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.210
house for $1.5 million.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.570
And so my initial equity
investment went from $250,000

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.500
to $750,000.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.110
And why is that?

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.320
Well equity is nothing but, if
I have an asset that's worth

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.390
$1.5 million, and I owe
$750,000-- that was my

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.820
original mortgage on that
asset-- then what I'm left

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.480
with is the equity.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.810
So my equity just tripled.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.600
It went from $250,000
to $750,000.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.240
In this video, what I'm going
to do is I'm going to show

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.810
you, well, what can you
do with that equity?

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.950
I mean, it's not cash.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.000
It's kind of like this make
believe amount of wealth that

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.060
you have. You just
feel richer.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.580
And I'll show you that you can
actually turn it into cash

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.220
using something called
a home equity loan.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.350
And I'd argue that this is
actually what drove our

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.910
economy from about 2002 to
probably still, to this day.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.520
Although I think we're
in a recession now.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.840
In fact I'm about 100%
sure we are.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.300
But definitely until
about 2006.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.350
So what's a home equity loan?

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.500
Well I go to the bank.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.100
I say, wow, bank, I have this
$750,000 of equity.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.470
I wish -- I'm rich, but I
don't have this in cash.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.540
I want to do something, though,
with the equity.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.830
I would like to live
like a rich person.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.940
Well the bank says, Sal,
you know, you're right.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.970
Our only requirement is that
you have $250,000-- or our

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.260
only requirement is that
you have 25% equity

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.790
in your house, right?

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.470
Because they want a cushion in
case you can't pay and they

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.870
get the house back, and they
have to foreclose, and auction

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.330
off the house, et cetera,
et cetera.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.590
So they said, well, we're
willing to lend you up to 75%

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.220
of the value of your house.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.120
So what's 75% of the
value of my house?

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.390
So let's see, 1.5 times 75%,
let's see that would be

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.470
$750,000 plus half
of $750,000.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:09.270
It'll be 1.075 million,
I think.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.530
I did that in my head,
it could be wrong.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.170
But it's roughly the
right number.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.080
So the bank says, you know what,
we're willing to lend

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.820
you up to 75% of the value
of your asset.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.400
And it's of course going to be
guaranteed by this asset.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.850
So far, we lent you $750,000.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.660
So let's see how much you
have more that you

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.500
can borrow from us.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.420
Minus -- we're talking millions
-- that's 0.075.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.940
So that's what?

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.710
300, that's 250 plus 75, so up
to $325,000 more that you

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.380
could borrow.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.530
And what is this?

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.180
Where am I taking this
money out of?

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.100
Well I'm essentially taking this
money out of the equity

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.860
of my house.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.190
And how does that make sense?

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.440
Well, what's going to happen?

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.560
Let's say I take this loan.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.380
Let's say I say, bank, great.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.180
I want $325,000 in cash.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.530
I want it right now.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.340
So what happens?

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.990
Let me draw another series,
another balance sheet.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.690
I stopped using the word balance
sheet, even though

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.690
that was the original purpose
of this whole discussion.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.120
I'll draw it a little
bit bigger.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.110
Remember liabilities plus
equities are equal to assets.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.720
So what are my assets now?

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:47.040
So now I have a $1.5 million
house, and I also got $325,000

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:55.280
cash from the bank, so we
can call that 325K cash.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.860
Got it from the bank.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.640
Now what are my liabilities?

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.050
Well I have the original
mortgage on my house.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.080
The original mortgage
is $750,000.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.680
This is liabilities
on this side.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.696
Well not the whole side,
we're going to

00:04:13.696 --> 00:04:14.390
have equity down here.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.500
So just this is liability,
$750,000.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.060
And then I took a new loan to
get this $325,000 of cash.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.480
So I have a new loan here,
that amount is $325,000.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.150
And this was a home
equity loan.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.690
I took a loan against
the equity that

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:33.420
I have in my house.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.030
This was the equity
in my house.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.690
So what's the leftover equity?

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.430
Let me just make everything
clear.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.210
These are liabilities.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.442
These are assets.

00:04:42.442 --> 00:04:44.200
And equity is what you
have leftover.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.640
So what are my assets?

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:55.220
I have $1.825 million in assets,
minus -- now what are

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.440
my liabilities?

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:05.230
Minus $1.075 -- that was the
max that I could borrow --

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.110
liabilities.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.630
Assets minus liabilities
is owners equity.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.710
So let's see, 825 minus 75.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.570
I still have $750,000
of equity.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.710
And that makes sense.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.500
If I just enter into some
transaction where I get cash

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.680
in exchange for debt, my equity
shouldn't change.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.500
But now what does happen?

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.960
Well I have this cash, and I'm
feeling rich, because I've

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.800
never seen numbers
like $750,000.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.100
And that neighbor, that new
neighbor that just bought that

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.720
house right next door for $1.5
million, he just bought a

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.060
beautiful new Hummer.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.990
And being a very down-to-earth
person, I feel that I also

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.660
deserve a Hummer, like my
neighbor, because I am just as

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.570
rich as they are.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.260
So I go decide to go out
and I'm going to spend

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.940
$100,000 on a Hummer.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.260
Actually, let's not do a Hummer,
because a Hummer could

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.890
actually be considered
an asset.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.460
I want pure consumption.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.050
Although I think a Hummer is as
pretty close as a car gets

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.160
to pure consumption.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.430
Let's say that neighbor went on
a round-the-world vacation

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.050
for $100,000.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.830
And I too, because I did nothing
but sit on my house

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.710
and made $500,000 last year, I
feel that I also deserve a

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.730
$100,000 vacation.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.230
So what I do is I take $100,000
of this cash.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:33.930
So I'm now left with just
$225,000, and I have the great

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.940
experience of going
on a vacation.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.980
But of course I didn't get any
asset in return for that.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.820
Although maybe your happiness
is an asset, I don't know.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.840
But it doesn't show up on
your balance sheet.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.780
So we had $325,000 in cash.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:51.930
Now we have $225,000 in cash.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.410
So our total assets went
down about $100,000.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:55.160
What are our assets now?

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.550
It's $1.725 right?

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.840
Because we spent $100,000
of our cash.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.780
So what's going to be the
liabilities and equity?

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.360
Well the liabilities won't
change, right?

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.885
Just because I went on vacation,
the bank's not going

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:08.890
to say, hey Sal, you
owe us less money.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.300
I still owe the almost
$1.075 million.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.380
The $100,000 is going to come
all out of my equity.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.160
So now all of a sudden I
don't have $750,000.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:28.170
I only have $650,000.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.060
And this isn't the balance
sheet just for my house.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.960
This is kind of my whole
personal balance sheet.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.255
And now my whole personal
balance

00:07:34.255 --> 00:07:35.780
sheet, what just happened?

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.440
I just took some of that
original equity that I had.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.060
I took $100,000 of it, turned it
into cash, and just went on

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.610
a great one-year-long
vacation.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.980
And this is what home
equity loans are.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.840
And this is what, I would argue,
drove the economy.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.310
Or at least took us into
an expansionary stage

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.560
from 2002 to 2003.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.150
Because if you remember, a lot
of people were still getting

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.780
laid off in 2002, 2003,
but consumer

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:02.910
spending kept going up.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.300
So people are earning
less money, or they

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.010
don't even have a job.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.330
How is spending going up?

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.240
Well, the values of their
house went up, and they

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.190
borrowed against the value
of their house.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.760
They took cash out of it, and
they used that cash to buy

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:18.240
their Hummers, to go on
vacation, to buy fancy

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.130
clothes, whatever.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.710
And that drove the economy.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.270
And in the next video I'll
actually talk about, maybe,

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.820
why those housing
prices go up.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.590
Or why they went up, in
particular, during this

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.429
housing boom, this one that
we're definitely in the

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.340
process of getting out of.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.080
See you in the next video.
