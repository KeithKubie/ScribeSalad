Congratulations, I'm guessing this problem took you a bit to figure out. My

00:00:04.736 --> 00:00:09.088
teaching assistant Congard de Kana came up with this problem so it was fun for

00:00:09.088 --> 00:00:13.318
me to solve in my own way. The key insight for me was that each step needed to

00:00:13.318 --> 00:00:17.562
be a constant distance up and forward from the previous step. From the second

00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:21.316
step I started by adding the height of the first step to its location. This

00:00:21.316 --> 00:00:25.525
first step's height is the vertical step's pieces height plus the step's

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:29.500
thickness. The other piece of the puzzle is how far forward the second step is

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.880
from the first. From the diagram we see that this is the horizontal step depth

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.845
minus the step thickness. With these two values in hand I could create a loop to

00:00:37.845 --> 00:00:42.346
generate all of the steps. Here's my code. At the top I computed the height and

00:00:42.346 --> 00:00:46.751
depth I needed to offset between each step. Through experimentation I found I

00:00:46.751 --> 00:00:51.008
needed to make six steps with my loop. On each loop iteration I modified both

00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:55.818
the vertical and horizontal parts of the step by adding in the height and depth

00:00:55.818 --> 00:00:56.443
offsets.
