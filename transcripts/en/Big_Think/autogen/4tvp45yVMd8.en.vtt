more isolating because we're using the
 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.190
more isolating because we're using the
technology instead of having

technology instead of having

technology over face-to-face the biggest
 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.230
technology over face-to-face the biggest
culprit is email we're constantly

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240
culprit is email we're constantly
 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.959
culprit is email we're constantly
sending and receiving emails and that's

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:40.969
sending and receiving emails and that's
 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:44.109
sending and receiving emails and that's
led to a lot of misunderstanding and one

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119
led to a lot of misunderstanding and one

led to a lot of misunderstanding and one
face-to-face interaction is more

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740
face-to-face interaction is more
 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.099
face-to-face interaction is more
successful than 34 emails exchanged back

build on that relationship and you

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649
build on that relationship and you
 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.379
build on that relationship and you
become more effective in doing your

become more effective in doing your

projects we need more self-awareness for
 

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:08.020
projects we need more self-awareness for
how we're using technology because we're

minutes we are so addicted but

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930

might not be realizing it because it's

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579
might not be realizing it because it's
 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.610
might not be realizing it because it's
normal behavior and it's been normalized

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620
normal behavior and it's been normalized
 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.559
normal behavior and it's been normalized
in culture for people to look at their

on the subway walking down the street
 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.080
on the subway walking down the street
and so we need to account for this

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090
and so we need to account for this
 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.000
and so we need to account for this
behavior because the more we're using

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010
behavior because the more we're using
 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.160
behavior because the more we're using
technology the less were having FaceTime

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170
technology the less were having FaceTime
 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.080
technology the less were having FaceTime
and phone calls which lead to fewer

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090
and phone calls which lead to fewer
 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.940
and phone calls which lead to fewer
relationships weaker relationships so

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950
relationships weaker relationships so
 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.160
relationships weaker relationships so
it's important to always account for our

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170
it's important to always account for our
 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.319
it's important to always account for our
basic unity to connect with other people

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329
basic unity to connect with other people
 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.530
basic unity to connect with other people
in a human way and not let technology

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540
in a human way and not let technology
 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.209
in a human way and not let technology
trick us into thinking we have a lot of

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:46.219
trick us into thinking we have a lot of
 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:48.009
trick us into thinking we have a lot of
friends and that we're super connected

friends and that we're super connected
 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.830
friends and that we're super connected
and then we're hyper focused so we need

and then we're hyper focused so we need
 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.319
and then we're hyper focused so we need
a delicate balance of alone time and

a delicate balance of alone time and
