00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.610
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.400
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Baron:
Welcome, everyone,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.660
to the November meeting of
the Washington area group

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.430
for print culture studies.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.910
This will be our last
meeting in this calendar year

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.370
and we'll pick up again in
February and we will meet

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.240
in February, March, and
April in the spring.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.400
So we hope you'll try to join us
for those if you're interested.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.760
We have a reflector list if
anybody is here who's not

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.540
on the reflector list and you'd
like to hear about our meetings,

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.050
you talk to myself or Allen
and we can get you on the list.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.690
We keep it deactivated so you
don't get spammed through that,

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.050
if you'd like to
be on that list.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.670
Anything else, there's
been so much going

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.450
on in the past couple of weeks.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.220
So, after the talk we have to
clear out of here pretty much

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.400
at five o'clock on a Friday and
after the talk we go for drinks

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.700
and dinner with the speaker and
if you'd like an opportunity

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.550
to continue conversations
with the speaker,

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.490
that's a very good
opportunity to do that

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.060
and it's always a
very congenial group

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.190
that goes for that as well.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.940
So, if you'd like to join us,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.960
we'd like to invite
anyone who's interested

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.810
to come along and join us.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.980
And so we're very pleased today

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.460
to have Anthony Lee who's
been a member of this group --

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.760
and he has a handout

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.590
if you didn't get it there
are some copies by the door --

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.480
who's been a member of our group
and he's going to talk to us

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:08.770
about Johnson's Dictionary and
some well-known literary figures

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.940
and Eleanor will give Tony a
more detailed introduction.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.240
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Shevlin: Thank you,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.310
thank you very much
we are very pleased

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.300
to have Anthony Lee here today.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.900
His research centers on
Samuel Johnson and his circle,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.720
mentoring and intertextuality.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.820
He has published three books and
more than 30 essays on Johnson

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.630
and 18th century
literature and culture.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.610
He has three more books
forthcoming, very busy.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.030
One is Community and Solitude:
New Essays on Johnson's Circle

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.290
with Becknell Press and
that's coming out in 2018.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.430
Modernity Johnson: Samuel
Johnson Among the Modernists

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.000
and that's coming out
Thompson University Press 2019.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.510
In addition, he is currently
serving a self-imposed life

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.280
sentence editing The
Annotated Rambler.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.380
Anthony has taught at
a number of colleges

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.080
and universities including
The University of Arkansas,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.910
Arkansas Tech, The University
at Kentucky Wesleyan College,

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.010
The University of the District
of Columbia, and The University

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.570
of Maryland University College
where he also served as director

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.390
of English and Humanities
programs.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.090
Today's talk draws upon
two pieces scheduled

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.130
for publication in 2018.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.050
One will appear in Notes
and Queries and the other

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.150
in The Johnsonian's Newsletter.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.450
So.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.390
&gt;&gt; Anthony Lee: Thank
you, thank you.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.680
Thank you all for coming.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.290
And I'd like to thank
Eleanor and Sabrina for --

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.340
I'm not supposed to stray
too far from this --

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.860
Eleanor and Sabrina for
offering me the opportunity

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.510
to have a conversation with
you about Samuel Johnson.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.790
And I'd also like to thank
a former student of mine,

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.540
Debra Carson and her husband
John, who drove up here,

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.310
or down here I should say
from New Jersey to be here

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:27.390
so I'm very grateful that
they made the time to do that.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.190
I'm going to start with
a brief description

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.280
of an underlying premise of
this paper and then I'm going

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.600
to talk a little bit about
the methodological terminology

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.780
and then I'm going to plunge
into the narrative itself.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.220
So the underlying
premise, my approach --

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.110
also, my talk is fairly
detailed, textually,

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.220
so I'll have reference
to the handout and also

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.030
to the high points, so hopefully

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.410
that will help you
navigate the details.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.350
My approach will be to
look at small things,

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.930
things typically considered
marginal, both literally,

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.260
mottos which occupy the
margins of the page,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:23.730
and figuratively
unimportant by some people.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.150
It is my hope by the time that
I am done here that some of you,

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.330
perhaps, will be persuaded to
agree with Detective Somerset,

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:38.020
who's quoted on the handout,
and one of my mottos,

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.830
"Postulate that we should seek
to find one item, one detail,

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.050
until it becomes an
inexhaustible possibility."

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.850
And that's a wonderful -- it's
a very grizzly and gory movie,

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.810
but it's a wonderful
movie and Somerset is

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.110
like a literary critic.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.620
I mean, literally, he
uses Dante and Chaucer

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.110
to help uncover the criminal,

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.810
but I think he provides a good
model for us literary critics

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.700
who look for clues and try
to come up with hypotheses

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.600
and find what ultimately
may be the truth.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.720
So, the methodological
parameters, French theorist

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.930
and critic, Gerard Genette
has developed the concept

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.510
of transtextuality, which is
his general inclusive term

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.220
for the relationships
between a text and other text.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.150
He has identified five
transtextual regimes,

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.030
two of which I will
use here today.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.570
The first is on your
handout; intertextual,

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.280
a relation of co-presence
between two or more texts,

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.100
most often by the literal
presence of one text

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.610
within the other and these
typically consist of quotations,

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.100
allusions, plagiarism,
among other things.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.830
And the second term that I
want to use is paratextual,

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.490
that is the luminal devices
and conventions both within

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.120
and outside of the book that
mediate it to the reader

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.310
and these would include titles,
forewords, dedications, notes,

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:19.060
epigraphs, epilogues, et
cetera, among many other things.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.980
And for us today the
salient example is the motto,

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.500
the periodical essay motto.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:31.190
So, we shall plunge
into the narrative.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.140
Today I want to look
primarily at two texts,

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.870
two Johnsonian texts; The
Dictionary and The Rambler.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.670
The Rambler, as I'm
sure many of you know,

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.500
is a series of 208 periodical
essays that Johnson composed

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.010
between 1750 and 1752.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:54.890
They are considered by
many people, perhaps me,

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.980
to be his greatest work.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.030
Other contenders would be
The Lives of the Poets and,

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.890
for some people, Rasselas,

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.980
in terms of his literary
production.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:11.600
But I go back and forth
between them myself,

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.610
but I'm editing The Rambler,
I have to stick with that one.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:16.910
And then, of course,

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:20.210
The Dictionary probably
needs no introduction

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.670
to a learned audience
such as this.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.290
And Johnson was working on
both of these simultaneously.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:30.890
The Dictionary between 1747 and
'55 and The Rambler, as I said,

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:35.620
'50-'52, so there is
some interesting overlap

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.020
and interpenetration
between the two.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.920
So, we'll begin specifically
by looking at Rambler Number 2,

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.670
which is on the necessity and
danger of looking into futurity.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:51.910
Following The Spectator,
Johnson used classical mottos

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.810
to introduce his essays.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:57.000
In many respects he may be seen
as following in the footsteps

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.040
of Addison and Steele, despite
the significant differences

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.370
separating their respected
periodical projects,

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:10.420
the motto in both served as a
textual portal into the essay

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.410
as an oblique pracey [phonetic].

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.480
Given the close association
of the motto with the epigram,

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.930
proverb, maxim, et cetera,

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.230
genres with strong
moral connotations,

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.070
the motto melds snugly

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:31.330
with Johnson's overriding
ethical emphasis.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.900
The one that I've singled
out to look at today is taken

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:42.480
from the Latin Silver Age poet,
Statius, from his epic, Thebaid,

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:48.490
and the handout should
have a prose translation,

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.890
"To stand still is torture,

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.930
a thousand paces are
wasted before the start.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:02.680
The heavy hoof strikes
the absent flag.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:09.500
Both The Spectator and The
Rambler were aimed primarily

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.900
at a literate middle
class audience.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.920
Many of the readers would have
known Latin, but many would not,

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.290
and even less would
have known Greek.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.320
And so the classical
models may have been adopted

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.710
to lend an aura of
intellectual prestige

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.840
to the essays that followed.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:39.500
Nonetheless, many of the readers
would require translation.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.590
Lists were soon provided
with English translations

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:48.970
and for Johnson and The
Rambler, the first was compiled

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:55.060
by a man named James Elphinston,
a Scott from Edinburgh

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.710
who began publishing while
The Rambler as still going on,

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:02.240
in the same year,
what was called --

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.620
what is called The Edinburgh,
or the Second Edition,

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.180
in six untitled volumes.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:14.670
And in volume one of
this edition at the end,

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.210
the volume one contains
essays one through 26,

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:22.470
would publish the
mottos in English.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:26.210
Little is known about the early
relationship between Johnson

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:31.970
and -- I think I -- yeah,
there's the Edinburgh edition --

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:36.840
and this is actually
a very rare edition.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:43.640
There's only a few copies known
in the world so this is taken

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.440
from the second issue, actually,
which is much less rare.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.190
Not a whole lot is known about
the relationship between the two

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.330
at this early stage,
but apparently Johnson,

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:59.610
in a letter to Elphinston gave
his tacit approval to Elphinston

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:07.090
to do this edition and
to translate the mottos.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:15.390
Rambler 2 exemplifies, the
translation of the model

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:18.630
from Rambler 2, exemplifies
an Elphinston translation

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.140
that Johnson, at least
initially, approved,

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.590
but later had second
thoughts about.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.970
It is virtually unrecognizable
as Statius,

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:30.320
it's more of a summary,
verse summary,

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.060
of the essay as a whole.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:36.550
"Fond fleeting Hope, with
prospects ne'er destroy'd,

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:40.430
Roams ere she flies,
defeated while enjoy'd."

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:43.700

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.560
for the first 30 Ramblers
and these are clearly

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.870
from the Edinburgh edition
although it's not stated.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:01.400
The next edition, which I think
should be called the third

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.350
edition, but actually the great
Johnson bibliographer David

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:08.750
Fleeman, denominates the
second London edition.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:13.420
Six volumes in Dewey
Decimal appeared in 1752,

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.730
this one also lists motto
translations on a separate sheet

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.140
at the end of the last volume.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:25.030
But here we discern change.

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.680
Johnson drops Elphinston's
fumbling verses

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.550
and replaces them with two
couplets from Alexander Pope,

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:34.830
"Th' impatient courser pants
in ev'ry vein, And pawing seems

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.350
to beat the distant plain;
Hills, vales, and floods,

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.450
appear already crost,
And, e'er he starts,

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:42.590
a thousand steps are lost."

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:52.130
And then in 1756, what's called
the fourth edition was published

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.480
in four volumes and this
one is also extremely rare.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:00.240
This is the last edition
revised by Johnson personally

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.800
and it had served,
controversially,

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.780
for the copied text
for the Yale edition

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.360
of the works of Samuel Johnson.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:16.970
So, are there any Pope
readers in the audience?

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:18.270
Specialists?

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:20.470
You don't notice
anything unusual?

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:22.950
Okay, you have a
convenient excuse.

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:26.510
Anybody notice anything
unusual about this translation?

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:33.670
You would have to be a
Pope specialist to do so.

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:42.480
It actually is from a poem that
he wrote, an original poem,

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.090
called Windsor-Forest, 1713.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:54.910
And this is from the manuscript
which was published in 1752,

00:14:54.910 --> 00:15:01.510
and there are the
verses up close.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:32.720
&gt;&gt; [ Inaudible ]

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.840
&gt;&gt; Pope is famous for
practicing what's called

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.750
representative verse.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:44.490
Yeah, the sound imitates
the sense.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:48.000
And Johnson talks about that
number of times, particularly

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.160
in The Life of Pope, taking
issue with it, actually.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:56.930
So if he were here today he
may be disagreeing with you.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:02.350
So Johnson was also --
you mentioned mentoring --

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.850
Johnson was a great mentor,

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.860
famously generous
to younger authors.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:11.600
And he helped John Hawkesworth
launch a periodical series;

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.110
The Adventurer, patterned
closely upon The Rambler,

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.780
which Johnson vigorously
promoted and to

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:23.750
which he contributed some 29
essays and a number of mottos.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:32.580
One of the essays, number 45, he
recurs to the Statius passages

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.990
that we're looking
at, number 45.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:43.650
So he does it again,
he takes a Latin tag,

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:46.340
provides a translation
that's, apparently,

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:50.150
not really a translation;
however,

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:53.080
there is an explanation,
that's why I'm bringing it up.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:59.910
In 1751, seven years after
Pope's death, William Warburton,

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:05.180
his friend and apologist,
who made his career

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:11.250
on Pope's skirt tails,
edited a nine volume edition

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.220
of Pope's works and, of course,

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.980
Windsor-Forest was
included in it.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:21.170
And he pens a note,
or a line, verse 151,

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:23.820
and I think this is
on your handout, too.

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:26.500
So, I'll go ahead and read this.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.090
"These lines Mr. Dryden, in
his preface to his translation

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:33.820
of Fresnoy's Art of painting,
calls wonderfully fine,

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.510
and says they would cost him
an hour, if he had the leisure

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:40.520
to translate them, there is so
much of beauty in the original;

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.190
which the reason why, I suppose,

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.750
why Mr. P. tried his
strength with them."

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:49.380
So the Windsor-Forest passage
is, in fact a translation,

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.530
from the lines of
Statius's Thibead.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.320
According to Pope's
bibliographer,

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.260
Reginald Harvey Griffith,

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:03.450
the Warburton edition
appeared in June of that year.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:08.510
During the following year,
the second London edition

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:11.970
of The Rambler began
appearing in January 1752

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.450
and the sixth volume containing
the list of translations

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:17.940
at the end that first used
the Windsor-Forest lines was

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:23.390
advertised in July 1752
in Gentleman's Magazine.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:27.780
So the close chronological
proximity suggests

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:32.580
that Johnson read at
least this part of Pope's,

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.380
Warburton's edition

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.980
and appropriated it
for his translation.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:44.560
In addition to identifying the
lines as an actual quotation,

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.500
Warburton goes on to make
an important point, I think,

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.930
how Dryden's off-hand
comment spurred Pope

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:55.010
to do what his poetic master
disdained or neglected to do.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:19:00.000
The Dryden-Pope relationship
is a classic example

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.310
of what I elsewhere talked
about as symbolic mentoring,

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.890
where a writer is mentored

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.730
by another writer whom
they never actually meet.

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:14.300
An older author, but whose
work has a profound influence

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.600
on them.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:20.160
So the Warburton note exhibits,
from my perspective, a pregnant

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.110
and representative
example of the phenomenon;

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:27.930
for it combines the energies of
respect and emulation with those

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.380
that are gone in competition

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.870
that complexly mark these
sort of relationships.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:38.940
So, on one hand, the protégé is
seeking to emulate the master

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.230
and be like the master
and honor the master,

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:45.890
but also to out-do the master,
to prove that this is Bloomian,

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:50.780
a hero-Bloomian theory of
literary relationships.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:59.140
This is the original site
of the Dryden remarks

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.470
and since Warburton
summarized them we don't need

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:04.420
to read them again.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.070
Johnson was familiar
with this passage,

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:11.470
apart from the Warburton
connection.

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:20.480
In the Dictionary, he uses
illustrated quotations,

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:27.240
or what are called authorities,
to illustrate definitions

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.050
and this is, perhaps, the
most single contribution

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:35.170
of his Dictionary, this is where
the OED comes from, is this idea

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:39.920
of illustrating a word, through
showing its actual use rather

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.360
than trying to use merely
abstract definitions.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.390
And so he quotes from it
under the word, fustian,

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:50.470
the entry for fustian,
in the Dictionary.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:58.390
And, incidentally,
William K. Whimstat reports

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:02.070
that Johnson quotes 157 times

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:05.930
from Dryden's preface
in his Dictionary.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:11.630
A total that represents
roughly 38% of all

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:16.020
of the 415 illustrations
taken from the entire work,

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:19.930
which is almost, well it's
more than a third taken

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:22.070
from the preface rather
than the work itself.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:25.810
And my own analysis shows that
Johnson's Dictionary quotations

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:27.990
from the passage in
which Dryden's citing

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:32.350
of Statius is imbedded
include at least 17 entries,

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:36.740
that is just under 11% of all
the examples from the preface.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.850
So based upon this evidence,

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:42.240
the stretch of prose surrounding
the Statius lines compellingly

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.350
commanded Johnson's' attention.

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:48.240
And he refers to it again later

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.570
when he's writing
The Life of Dryden.

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:53.520
This is also in your handout.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.540
His, Dryden's, comparison
of the first line of Virgil

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.450
with the first of
Statius is not happier.

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:02.800
Virgil, he says,
is soft and gentle

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.420
and would have thought
Statius mad

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:11.330
if he had heard him
thundering out [Latin].

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:16.210
Statius, perhaps, heats himself
as he proceeds to exaggerations,

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:17.920
somewhat hyperbolical,

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.220
but undoubtedly Virgil
would have been too hasty

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:23.890
if he had condemned him to
straw for one sounding mind.

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:30.420
Of course Virgil was an
important symbolic mentor

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.430
to Statius as well
and this index

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:36.710
and their relationship
here, I think is something

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:43.620
that fascinates Johnson
and fascinates me as well.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.160
Incidentally, the first line
of the Statian quotation used

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:51.210
by Pope and Johnson is,
in fact, a misquotation.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:54.680
It includes a substitution
of Statius's original words

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.270
with those from Georgia's
384 [Latin].

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:02.800
So what we witness here is a
case of what might be called,

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:08.030
to borrow a Freudian term,
textural over-determination.

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:15.510
And this tiny little literary
site of the motto of Rambler 2,

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:18.000
we find something
densely saturated

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.750
with a number of
literary voices.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.640
And Johnson himself is
implicated in this phenomenon;

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.650
for he, in addition to absorbing
it and assimilating it,

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:31.640
deploys it in other of
his writings, elsewhere.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:35.420
So, thank you for
following along

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.910
with that fairly
intricate pursuit.

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:42.570
So what do we make of that?

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.840
What's going on here?

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.960
I'm going to go out on a limb
here, on dangerous ground

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:56.030
and borrow a term from quantum
physics called entanglement,

00:23:56.030 --> 00:24:01.670
which is the OED quotation is on
your first page of your handout,

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.380
one of my mottos again.

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.770
And I'm not standing up here
telling you I know beans

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:08.710
about quantum physics.

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:11.640
I think I heard that maybe there
are 100 people on the planet

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.540
that really know
what's going on?

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.020
Maybe that's an underestimate.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.470
I hope no one in here
is one of the hundreds

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:22.960
that will take me
to task for this.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.890
So here's what OED says, "A
correlation between the states

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:32.270
of two separate quantum
systems, such that the behavior

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:35.250
of the two together is
different from the juxtaposition

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:38.110
of the behaviors of
each considered alone.

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:42.380
And so, I think the idea is that
what takes place in one system,

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:47.490
it is entangled with another,
separate, across the universe,

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:52.440
perhaps, they have a reciprocal
effect upon one another,

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.910
a change that happens in
one shows up in the other.

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:59.100
That's pretty weird.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:04.280
But, I'm using the term
metaphorically here to try

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:13.470
and put some kind of
intellectual framework on how

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:17.120
to understand these intertextual
relationships amongst these

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.510
various authors that
we're seeing that show

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.800
up in the Rambler
and the Dictionary.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:26.760
So, in my idea, a quantum
system is equivalent to a text,

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.240
so you have two texts and you
take something from one text

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.540
and move it into the other,

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:34.300
it affects both of
them reciprocally.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:38.790
In the case of the
motto to Rambler 2

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:41.790
and Pope's Windsor-Forest lines
we see a reciprocal relationship

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:46.440
in which the reading of
one influences our reading

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.160
of the other and vice versa.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.880
So we see in the motto
of Johnson's recognition

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:56.570
of an intertextual influence
by Statius upon Pope as well

00:25:56.570 --> 00:26:00.960
as the intricate cross-hashings
of all the other authors

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.760
that we have identified.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:06.220
And this is not in the paper,
but I should pause to say here;

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:13.320
it's not incidental that Pope
would be interested in Statius.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:17.780
He was very much interested in
Statius and translated portions

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:22.010
of Statius and talked about
him in conversation and I think

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:26.760
that Statius, of course,
is a Silver Age poet coming

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.700
in the footsteps of
Virgil, Horace, and Ovid,

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:34.570
and somewhat overwhelmed
by that.

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.150
In Johnson's account,
clearly Statius doesn't come

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:43.090
out very happy in the
comparison, but you know,

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:47.530
Dryden and Pope are
considered Augustans,

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:50.450
referring to the Augustans,
you know, of the Golden Age.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:53.340
But in another sense,
they are also belated.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:57.290
They are also coming after what
Dryden called the giants before

00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:00.940
the flood; Shakespeare
and Milton.

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.650
So, I think Pope recognized

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:08.010
in Statius a predicament
very similar to his own

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:11.220
where he had these
looming masters and,

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.520
you know, what do you do next?

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:18.090
He wanted to -- he was going
to write an epic, he never did.

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:24.460
The Dunciad was the best he
could come up with, Dryden, too.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:30.560
I think he was going to write
one on King Arthur, but anyway.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.340
Looking at these little
sites here, I think,

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:37.550
expands into the larger insights
that are, from my perspective

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:40.540
at least, worth looking at.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:44.970
So there -- another
quotation from the first page

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:48.870
of the handout, a motto is
from Derrida, Dissemination,

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:51.990
and he says, "Each
grafted text continues

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:54.270
to radiate back toward the site

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:58.600
of its removal transforming
that, too,

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.860
as it affects the
new territory."

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.600
And again you have
this reciprocity

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.910
where you have two
literary sites

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:09.940
that are mutually
interpenetrating one another

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:13.310
in the way that I
understand entanglement,

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:16.040
the concept, to work.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.340
So --

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.460
So we're invited to
consider the important

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.520
of Pope's relationships
with Statius,

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.660
which I just talked about,
and Dryden, his great master,

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:34.750
as symbolic mentors in both
the construction of his career

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:38.830
and the crafting of his --
specific crafting of his verse.

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:41.980
And, likewise, we read
Johnson differently as well,

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:46.260
Rambler 2's motto reverberates
not only throughout the essay

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.130
but auto textually across
Johnson's Oove [phonetic]

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:51.500
as we've seen The
Dictionary, Adventurer,

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.790
Lives of the Poets, et cetera.

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:57.030
In Rambler 2, the Pawing
Coursers connote Johnson's

00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:01.540
enthusiasm for his periodical
essay, notice it's number two,

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.270
he's just getting started.

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:05.950
As he stands at the threshold

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:09.890
of its inception making quote
unquote, "A new entrance

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:13.720
into the -- ," my next three
quotes are all from Rambler 2,

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.840
making quote, "A new entrance

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.490
into the lettered
world," unquote.

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:21.570
This threshold is Janus-like;
however for it looks back

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:25.630
to earlier writers and prepares
the reader for the quotations

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:27.170
and allusions to come.

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:31.890
In this essay, Horace is
quoted twice after the motto,

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:36.020
Epitias and Cervantes.

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:39.130
If, as Johnson informs
us, "the natural flights

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:41.620
of the human mind are not
from pleasure to pleasure,

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.630
but from hope to
hope," which is one

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:48.150
of the great Johnson quotations,
"His practice requires

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:51.590
that the creative endeavors of
the present and the expectations

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:54.110
of the future must be thoroughly
grounded in the wisdom

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:57.870
of the past within the cultural
heritage of ancient Greece

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:03.580
and Rome as well as the European
renaissance, as in Cervantes.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:06.870
This, I think is the ultimate
meaning of his famous remark

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:09.340
from the last paragraph
of the essay,

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.980
"Men more frequently required
to be reminded than informed."

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:18.230
That is to say Johnson's entire
Rambler collection can be

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:21.450
profitably read as a
majestic and sweeping effort

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:24.470
to collect -- to coin or
use Arnold's phrase --

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:27.390
the best that has been thought
and written from antiquity

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:30.000
to the early 18th
century and presented

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.440
as a monumental compendium
to his contemporary audience

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.070
and also to posterity, to us,

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:39.530
those few of us who
still read him.

00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:43.890
And I think these reflections

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:47.030
that I'm offering you
give us some insight

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:49.710
into understanding better
a really famous passage

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:55.180
by T.S. Eliot I'm sure you're
all familiar with, "No poet --

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.020
," and this is on your
handout, too, I think, "No poet,

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:01.630
no artist of any art has
complete meaning alone.

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.920
What happens when a new
work of art is created is

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.780
that something happens
simultaneously to all the works

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.000
of art which preceded it.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.440
The existing monuments form an
ideal order among themselves

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.420
which is modified by the
introduction of the new,

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:20.800
the really new, work
of art among them.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:25.020
The existing order is complete
before the new work arrives.

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:28.190
For order to persist after
the supervention of novelty,

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:30.890
the whole existing
order must be,

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:33.060
if ever so slightly, altered.

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.440
And so, the relations,
proportions,

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.010
and values of each work of art
to the whole are readjusted

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:41.260
in this conformity between
the new and the old."

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:45.180
And that's from tradition
and individual talent.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:47.170
That's a very well-known quote,

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:49.580
but perhaps a less well-known
one from the German critic,

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:52.120
Herman Meyer, the paratactical

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:56.290
and intertactical
intertanglements we are

00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:58.800
observing encourage us to
read text in this new way.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.350
Not as self-contained, isolated,
monads, but rather as points

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:05.720
of articulation within larger
networks of interconnection

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.380
and dynamic interaction.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.320
As Herman Meyer has observed,

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.770
"In general it might be
maintained that the charm

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:16.130
of the quotation emanates
from a unique tension

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:19.030
between assimilation
and dissimilation:

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:21.680
it links itself closely
with its new environment,

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.340
but at the same time
detaches from it,

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:26.620
thus permitting another
world to radiate

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.460
into the self-contained
world of the novel.

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.560
You know, he's talking primarily
about the European novel.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:38.490
And Meyer's radiation
is in itself entangled

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:44.720
with Derrida's remark that the
grafted text radiates back.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.120
The two comments operate
reciprocally, moving from text

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:52.190
to intertext, intertext to
text, in a revolving oscillation

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:55.690
that both exemplifies and
illuminates the creation

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:57.400
of intertextual meaning.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:02.820
If taken in its totality,
which is impossible

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.470
for the mortal mind,

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:07.750
the entanglements radiating
amongst all the text

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:13.170
in literary history constitute
a vast and vibrant universe,

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:18.110
an intertextual totality,
which such paratext

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:21.620
as the Rambler motto and
a Dictionary quotation,

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.730
offer brief, if tantalizing,

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:30.560
glimpses into a sub specie
aeternitatis universe.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.930
This is purely speculative
on my part,

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:35.500
but something I do believe in.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:40.150
So, the next question you
might ask is, was Johnson aware

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:43.260
of this intertextual field
that I'm suggesting here?

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:46.660
And I tried to talk about and
discuss over the past 10 years

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:54.170
or so, that Johnson possessed
an acutely intertextual mind,

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:55.470
sensibility.

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:57.020
I think it's indisputable.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:00.020
He does it all the time.

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:02.100
However, he would
not, I don't think,

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:07.250
sign onto this totality
that I'm postulating.

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:08.910
He wouldn't recognize
the concept quite

00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:10.640
in the same ways I do.

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:14.590
So, in a qualified sense, yes,
I think he would acknowledge

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:19.340
that there's a real
validity in terms

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:25.030
of reading him intertextually,
but not as sweepingly as I do.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:30.280
For example, here's a little
paragraph in the preface

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.460
to The Dictionary, which
is on your handout.

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.210
"I have sometimes,
though rarely,

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:38.190
yielded to the temptation
of exhibiting a genealogy

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:42.040
of sentiments, by showing how
one author copied the thoughts

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:47.490
and diction of another," and
in my work, I've found that --

00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:51.080
I find that -- this adverb
"rarely" is an understatement.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.690
Seems to me he's
doing it all the time.

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:56.630
Not in every Dictionary
entry, for sure,

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:59.780
I mean it is a lexicographical
[phonetic] work,

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:04.370
but he is interested in this
and he is doing it a lot.

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:07.970
So, let me conclude this talk
by looking at two examples

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:10.480
of genealogies from
The Dictionary.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:18.100
We'll look at two entries;
dispeople/dispeopler and whistle

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:23.800
and we've got a first edition
of The Dictionary over there.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.280
The Smithsonian was
supposed to have it on loan,

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:32.030
but we have it here, and,
well I turned it to whistle,

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:35.120
but somebody obviously has been
flipping through the pages,

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:40.150
but if you want to look
at dispeople/dispeopler

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:44.910
and whistle, they're over there.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:50.510
Augustan poet, John Gay
dedicated his poem Rural Sports

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:56.370
to his recently acquired
friend, Alexander Pope, in 1713.

00:35:56.370 --> 00:36:00.160
The title page in his
1720 version commemorates

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.460
the friendship.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:08.300
This is just the title page of
the works, not the poem itself.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:13.120
Rural Sports was originally
published in January 1713

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:17.190
and was republished in
revised form later that year.

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:21.730
Gay read Pope's manuscript,
the 1712 manuscript

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:24.370
of Windsor-Forest, he
read a den manuscript

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:26.910
and he adopted elements,

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:30.800
intertextually extracted
elements and used it

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.280
to craft his own verse.

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:39.550
And The Dictionary shows
us what he's up to.

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:44.620
So, this is
dispeople/dispeopler.

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:52.880
I won't read the
words out to you.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.990
Because of grammatical
necessity,

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:57.470
one involving the
verb, the other a noun,

00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:01.380
Johnson separates the two
passages and yet he manages

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:07.530
to put them directly together on
the page so that the resemblance

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:11.270
between them becomes
rather obvious.

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:15.340
Neither Gay nor Pope's
20th century editors

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.930
in the critical editions of Gay

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:23.010
or Pope noted this
borrowing, this comparison.

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:27.970
Guess they should have
read Johnson's Dictionary.

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:31.850
Gay's allusion to Pope is
at, for the latter verses,

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:35.940
denominate tyrant to despoil
the landscape in human cities.

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:41.550
Gay's pike is analog to the
ancient kings as a passage

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:46.300
from Walton's complete Angler
makes clear, "The loose

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:49.590
or pike is the tyrant
of the fresh waters."

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:54.950
Johnson quotes this in his
Dictionary under pickerel weed.

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:58.760
But the two entries also
suggest a back wood extension

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.790
of the genealogy immediately
preceding the Pope quotation

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:07.210
and the dispeople entry we
find, "His heart exalts him

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:13.010
in the harm already done so have
its dispeopled Heaven, Milton.

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:16.870
That, of course, is from
Paradise Lost, book seven,

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:21.480
describing the original and
type of the tyrant, Satan.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.280
So not only did Johnson discern
the connection between Pope

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.210
and Gay, he provides an
intertext that operates

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:29.780
as the common source for both.

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:33.030
It is thus evident
that used in a way

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:36.730
that carefully examines the
authorities that it exhibits,

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:40.470
The Dictionary enables us to
make discoveries of influence

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:45.050
that enhances our
apprehension of the richness

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:48.400
and intertextual density
of these passages.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:54.580
And speaking of Milton I'll look
at one more, the whistle entry.

00:38:54.580 --> 00:39:01.780
And there we find, again,
Milton and Gay aligned,

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:03.940
"While the plowman near
at hand, whistles o'er

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:06.170
for the land," Milton.

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:09.330
"The plowman leaves the task
of day and, trudging homeward,

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:12.490
whistles on the way," Gay.

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:14.650
The similarity between Allegro

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:18.810
and Rural Sports indicate a
direct influence, apparently one

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:23.160
that caught Johnson's eye and
should also catch ours as well.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.310
The two whistling plowmen
and the context of a walk

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:29.560
on a spring-like day found
in the quotation suggest

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:33.060
that Gay takes Milton
as his intertext.

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:35.120
That both couplets are
immediately followed

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:39.040
by dairy scenes,
Milton's milkmaid blithe

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.450
and Gay's strokings

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:44.940
of the damsel's hand strongly
support this identification,

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:46.950
so the Dictionary entry

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:51.450
for whistles also suggest
the importance of Milton

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:53.000
as one of Gay's precursors.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.980
And again, I don't want to
pick on these poor editors,

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:59.550
but this is not found
in the Oxford edition --

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:03.540
Event and Dearing's
edition of Gay.

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:08.430
So in conclusion, this
presentation recommends

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:11.700
that Johnson's Dictionary
may be understood to operate

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:14.300
as a versatile instrument
in the toolbox

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:18.430
of literary criticism,
literary scholarship.

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:22.830
A repository of literary
creative, in its own right,

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:26.290
quite apart from its more
obvious lexicographical

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:32.140
functions and it also urges this
talk that paratextual elements

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:35.540
such as quotations,
mottos, allusions,

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:37.180
and the intertextual network

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:41.050
in which they cohere be
taken more seriously as sites

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:46.960
of literary and critical
activity and power.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.090
My work suggests that Johnson
deploys these connections

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:51.410
in his writings and ways

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:54.460
that demonstrate his
intertextual mastery

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.090
of the resting tradition
as well as his creative use

00:40:57.090 --> 00:41:01.670
of this tradition to
offer new contributions.

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:04.340
Perhaps in a way that
T.S. Eliot would recognize

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:06.810
and approve had he
deigned to burrow

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:11.250
with the mole-like
tenacity that I pursue.

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:14.830
But this is, too, if I may
be permitted my own allusion,

00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:17.560
to compare small
things to great.

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.510
Thank you.

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:27.230
[ Applause ]

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:30.790
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Shevlin: We have
time for questions now.

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:38.070
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: [Inaudible]
Pope quotation from dispeople.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:42.650
You have Paradise Lost for
Milton, but then you have Pope

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:45.020
and then you have
Rural Sports with Gay.

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.320
What was the --

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.620
&gt;&gt; Anthony Lee: It's
from Windsor-Forest.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.920
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Oh, it
is Windsor-Forest.

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.170
&gt;&gt; Anthony Lee: So that would
be an example of Gay looking

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:53.700
at the manuscript and
incorporating it --

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:55.210
the 1712 manuscript --

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:58.590
and incorporating it
into his own poem.

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:01.680
Was that not clear
on the handout?

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.690
Sorry about that.

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:05.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: But, I
mean, aside from that,

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:11.210
[inaudible] because there's this
you know common kind of motif

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:14.540
of the tyrant, there,
too, right?

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:22.570
You know, the king, likened
to Satan in Paradise Lost.

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:26.400
I mean, Johnson didn't
have any reservations

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:33.100
about representing the
king in that sort of light.

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:37.520
&gt;&gt; Johnson was once asked about
tyranny, the tyranny of kings,

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:41.780
and he said, "Well, if the
kings go too far the people will

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:44.750
up rise and cut his head off."

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:50.090
So, Johnson has a reputation,
a stereotypical reputation,

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:57.030
although some justification, in
being a high bound conservative,

00:42:57.030 --> 00:43:01.150
but -- and I'm not an
expert on his politics --

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:05.150
but I think a conservative
today and a conservative

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:08.140
in the 18th century are
two quite different things

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:13.880
and his attitudes towards
politics are more refreshingly

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:17.130
modern than are given
credit for.

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:18.970
He didn't like George
III, of course,

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:23.400
this was before George III,
this was under George II.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:28.200
He didn't like George II either.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:34.240
And he thought that George
III was ill-educated.

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:37.940
Lord Boot, who was his tutor,

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.280
Johnson thought he
did a terrible job.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:44.720
That didn't keep Johnson from
supporting the ministries

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:52.720
under George III's reign
in the 1760s and 1770s

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.590
because he did write the
four political tracts:

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:59.660
Taxation No Tyranny, Thoughts
on the Falkland Islands,

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:04.320
The Patriot, False Alarm,
in support of the ministry.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:08.670
And there may have been
some expectation that he do

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:12.210
that because of the pension
that he was awarded in 1762,

00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:14.640
although that was
denied officially.

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:20.980
But privately, he was a
great theoretical advocate

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:26.020
of the political
stability and authority,

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:30.790
particular after the English
civil war, you know which,

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:36.640
there were visible remains of
the conflict, the destruction,

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:42.200
in Staffordshire where
he was born and grew up.

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:45.460
And he would have
feared that more

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:46.760
than anything else, you know.

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.820
So, political stability
and the insurer

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:56.190
of that being a strong
monarchy, was important to him,

00:44:56.190 --> 00:45:00.040
but he was no improver
of tyrants.

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:07.740
I don't know if that touches
upon what you were asking, but,

00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:09.890
yeah, the political
context is kind of curious.

00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:14.270
It is something that -- it
gave me pause for thought

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:18.730
when I was thinking
about this presentation.

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:22.090
But, clearly he doesn't
have any qualms

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:25.890
about doing it in
his Dictionary.

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:33.990
&gt;&gt; Anthony Lee: Yes?

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:37.840
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Shevlin:
Couple of things.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:42.480
This idea of intertextuality,

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:47.570
of course overlaps
with the [inaudible].

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:52.590
It also, I was thinking
how T.S. Eliot was quoted

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:58.120
and everything else and it
reminded me of Charlotte Bronte

00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:01.170
who expresses something very
similar when she's speaking

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:06.320
about there comes a time when
an author's work is no longer

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.620
his own.

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:09.090
And she's very much talking

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:12.910
about the reworking
and the revamping.

00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:16.400
And when she and Reeves
went on to write [inaudible]

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:25.820
and was taken from Bronte and
was rather fearful of her kind

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.830
of chutzpah in going to take

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:34.300
from Bronte really meditates
all this idea of borrowing.

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:38.900
In terms of your
presentation and this idea

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:41.070
of intertextuality, too,

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:43.670
we're seeing not just
an intertextuality

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:48.360
with these authors at the time,
but among Johnson's impetus

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.960
in thinking for his
own projects.

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:54.920
In other words, it makes
perfect seen that he's --

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:59.070
after kind of thinking this
way and winking and working

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:02.730
with these quotes -- that he's
going to extract that and create

00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:06.450
that innovativeness
for the Dictionary.

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:12.210
It just -- so, his work
itself is intertextual,

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:14.940
which is what you were saying.

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:16.790
&gt;&gt; Anthony Lee: That's a good
way to look at the introduction

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:18.320
of authorities into
the Dictionary.

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.640
I hadn't quite thought of
it in that respect before,

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:24.190
but you're suggesting that
his interest in genealogies

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:28.580
of sentiment and influence may
have prompted the very notion.

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:30.630
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Shevlin: This
is the way I'm going

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:33.480
to construct these words.

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:36.660
Something about, I'm thinking
of Lives of the Poets.

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:41.340
What do you think his
attitude is towards Pope,

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:52.480
Lives of the Poets, and I'm
thinking of life of the Pope.

00:47:52.480 --> 00:48:02.410
There's this strange moment in
Pope -- to me it's strange --

00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:09.660
the Lives of the
Poets, when Pope has

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:14.940
to that carriage accident.

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:17.800
Johnson's describing it.

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:24.760
And Johnson almost kind of,
texturally, there's a moment

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:32.820
of kind of textural violence
almost with the way on the page

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:35.700
where Pope falls
from his carriage,

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:38.790
he has this carriage accident.

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:41.920
And the way that
Johnson talks about this

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:45.400
and almost interrupts himself
in the telling of Pope's --

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.780
do you know what
I'm speaking about?

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:51.510
It's been a long time since I've
read that, but I'm wondering,

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:55.530
I always thought it
seemed almost like --

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:58.570
and I don't do psychoanalytic
reads --

00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:03.600
but almost suppressed
animosity somewhat towards Pope.

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:07.010
I mean, Pope flies out of
this carriage [inaudible]

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:09.670
and in the middle of explaining,
Pope, and he has Pope,

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:13.440
which he has exacted him,
he's giving his life story,

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:20.220
so he's not manufacturing, but
it's the framework of this.

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:24.180
I have to look at -- I was like,
wishing I had really looked

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:28.920
at this because I knew you were
going to be talking about Pope

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:31.140
and Johnson, but I don't.

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:34.910
&gt;&gt; Anthony Lee: Well, Johnson
expressed a lot of animosity,

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:38.550
non-suppressed, towards many of
the people that he wrote about.

00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:41.500
In the Lives of the
Poets in particular,

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.900
but Pope is a special
case because --

00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:46.990
and I talk about this in a
chapter in Dead Masters --

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:48.460
I think Pope, it's either Pope
or Dryden, but let's say Pope,

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:49.760
was Johnson's greatest
symbolic mentor.

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:51.250
When Johnson came
to London in 1737 he

00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:52.550
and David Garrett took
turns riding a horse

00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:53.850
from Litchfield to London.

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:55.150
Of course, Garrett became
famous almost overnight

00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:56.450
and Johnson was very, had very
great animosity towards him

00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:57.750
because of that.

00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:59.050
But, in 1737 when he came
to London, Pope was god.

00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:00.350
You know, Pope was -- Swift
was big, too, but Swift was

00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:02.290
over in Dublin, but Pope
was the literary tyrant.

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:07.410
And Johnson became that and
he became that, in part,

00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:14.140
by imitating Pope and, in part,
by competing against Pope.

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:18.270
You know? And so, he, Pope
wrote these, you know, epistles

00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:22.340
and Horatian imitations
based upon Horace.

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:24.780
Well, Johnson did
similar things,

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:27.510
but did it with Juvenile
instead of the Vanity

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:29.710
of Human Wishes in London.

00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:35.630
So he was kind of following
in a Pope trek or trail,

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:38.720
but he'd swerved and
he did it differently.

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:44.800
And, you know, his
descriptions of Pope, at times,

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:49.850
in The Life of Pope are almost
-- you know, we live in the age

00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:56.820
of TMZ or these places that
flash people's private lives,

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:58.120
I mean it's everywhere --

00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:00.800
but, Johnson was one of the
first people to do that.

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:05.000
He exposed that Pope
had to, basically,

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.080
sit on telephone books
to sit at the table

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:12.460
to look tall enough to eat.

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:20.690
I mean, he had very nakedly
-- I don't want to say brutal,

00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:24.750
but it certainly took
him down a few notches.

00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:29.180
And you could say that's
part of the dynamic

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:34.560
of being a symbolic
protégé to Pope is that --

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:38.280
but, I think those energies
were stronger in the '30s

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:42.240
and the '40s than they
were in the 1770s and '80s

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.610
when he's writing The Life.

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:47.660
Well, he published The Life
of the Poets in 1781, but,

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:51.610
I think the other explanation
is Johnson's adherence

00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:53.290
to the truth.

00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:59.080
You know? He wanted, not
necessarily to expose people,

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:04.970
but to be truthful about them,
and unflinchingly truthful.

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:08.680
And Boswell followed in
his master's footsteps

00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.120
and took it to the next level.

00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:12.450
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Shevlin: I do
know the whole tanner of Life

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:15.470
of Pope is rather --
but it's interesting

00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:18.400
because what you're suggesting
with all of this intertextuality

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:23.090
because not just that
imitation being flowered,

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:26.550
but imitation being
authoritative and controlled

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:32.290
over -- so because if you look
at the elegant meaning, too,

00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:36.770
you're going to change -- you're
not controlling the meaning,

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:39.210
you're going to change
every text interacting,

00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:41.460
so you can't think,
once you read one text

00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:43.420
and you're familiar
with the other text

00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:46.160
and reading the other text and
speaking to it you can't think

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.560
of it in the same way.

00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:49.040
That's right.

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:56.170
&gt;&gt; And you could say that taking
these allusions and quotations

00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:58.980
and incorporating them
into one's own work,

00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:05.270
you're taking their voice and
using it for your own purposes.

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:08.180
And not necessarily in a way

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:10.190
that honors the original
intention,

00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:14.650
if that even is normal
or matters.

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:15.950
Someone else?

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:20.030
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, I had -- I
just wanted to elaborate on that

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.300
because I talk more about
18th century English poetry,

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:28.060
but I am interested in the whole
question of literary allusion

00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:29.380
and [inaudible] and I found it
very fascinating, like you said,

00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:30.680
in the beginning, that the work

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:31.980
of the Dictionary
is much longer.

00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:34.440
And so it has this feature,
which to me reminded

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:37.350
of professional than
of common laws.

00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:39.610
To which, to me, is actually
the Dictionary reading

00:53:39.610 --> 00:53:43.010
of being related to the work
of him keeping a journal

00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:48.690
of quotations, so that at the
same time we saw him using

00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:53.140
that for compiling
the Dictionary,

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:55.670
which becomes a published book,

00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:59.270
and the issue was quite a
supreme successor to the OED,

00:53:59.270 --> 00:54:01.010
but at the same time,
clearly, using this --

00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:02.310
whatever description you
want to use -- , [inaudible]

00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:05.450
it collects, or a different
version of a collection

00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:09.180
that [inaudible] with quotations
and then using it for your work.

00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:13.390
I mean, you just had this
exchange about this modern idea

00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:16.630
of paratext and allusion.

00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:20.090
I mean you could make the
argument [inaudible] antiquity

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:24.110
in the Middle Ages people had
the idea of keeping a journal

00:54:24.110 --> 00:54:27.480
by reading and then
using what you read

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:29.080
for your own production,

00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:32.250
is basically the
underpinning of our rest

00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:38.400
of understanding of education.

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.810
And it also works
outside the Western world,

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:43.640
but that's a different
kind of worlds to go into.

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:44.940
So, I'm not quite sure
whether we actually have this

00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:46.250
[inaudible] take on something
that was well-established

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:47.810
that we wanted to show
that I have [inaudible],

00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:51.190
but I have my homework.

00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:54.960
By basically playing, but by
also misquoting or that sort

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:57.910
of thing where I'll use a
quotation expecting those

00:54:57.910 --> 00:55:01.640
who are in the know to realize
that, for instance, [inaudible].

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:02.940
I mean what you had
at the beginning

00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:05.480
of your presentation
was begun to, you know,

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:08.760
did people realize that,
actually, he had changed Pope

00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:11.240
when he put it as
another in there.

00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:14.960
Is that to sound [inaudible]
have literature circulating

00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:17.850
in a circle of people that
-- everybody knows everybody

00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:21.550
and everybody reads the same
books and everybody knows when,

00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:23.670
I guess, [inaudible] and those

00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:26.390
who don't get it,
they don't matter.

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:29.830
&gt;&gt; Anthony Lee: Yeah, it's
not like that anymore.

00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:31.130
You raise a lot of good points.

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:36.390
I think Johnson -- I
think there's two points

00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:38.530
to be made here about the
Dictionary and the Rambler --

00:55:38.530 --> 00:55:41.420
Johnson was a great
advocate for keeping journals

00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:45.590
and he kept journals throughout
his life and he advised Boswell

00:55:45.590 --> 00:55:47.610
to do it, Hester Therell.

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:51.680
Unfortunately, before he
died, shortly before he died,

00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:55.920
he created a bonfire and
destroyed most of them.

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:59.100
Because Sir John Hawkins took
one of them, took it home,

00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:00.400
copied some stuff out of it

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:01.700
and brought it back
and he found out.

00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:06.200
So, right before he died, so he
knew that he needed to get rid

00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:10.090
of things that he didn't
want to be exposed about.

00:56:10.090 --> 00:56:15.200
But he did keep something
called the Adversaria,

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:19.450
I think that's a Latin
term, and it's a collection

00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:22.510
of little sketches
of ideas that he used

00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:27.220
for his periodical essays for
the Adventurer and the Rambler

00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:30.200
and only a few fragments
of these survive;

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:33.900
two of them in Boswell's
life and two of them

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:35.200
in the Hawkins' life --

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:36.880
two separate ones
-- so we have four.

00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:42.750
And so, they show, incidentally,
one of them is for Adventurer 45

00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:47.830
and the one for Rambler
196 shows

00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:51.850
that he has the name Horace and
he used Horace for the motto.

00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:56.140
So he did use this as a kind of
a commonplace book in, you know,

00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:57.970
that tradition, but as far

00:56:57.970 --> 00:57:01.410
as I know he didn't keep a
commonplace book throughout his

00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:05.190
life and it's not clear
that he used this Adversaria

00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:06.490
for every essay.

00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:08.600
I mean, he had an
encyclopedic memory,

00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.890
so he could draw upon
things, you know,

00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:12.510
like Mozart composed
his symphonies

00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:15.390
in his head before
he wrote them down.

00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:18.550
Johnson did the same thing with
The Vanity of Human Wishes,

00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:20.910
but the Dictionary
was a different story.

00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:23.290
He actually went
through and read books

00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:26.840
and underlined passages
and put little notes

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:30.820
and then had his anbuancies
[phonetic] scribble those down

00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:32.590
and then they put them
in the Dictionary.

00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:37.620
So I think we can say
with fair certainty

00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:40.620
that the Dictionary
quotations were not taken

00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:45.880
from a private journal or a
commonplace book, but were more

00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:50.810
from his reading, but reading
directly towards the Dictionary.

00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:52.970
And you raised a number of
other interesting points,

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:57.650
but I think someone
else had their hand up?

00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:59.670
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Shevlin: When
does intertextuality

00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:01.830
become plagiarism?

00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:06.230
&gt;&gt; Anthony Lee: When does
it become plagiarism?

00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:08.520
Well, it's interesting, that's
not something that people talked

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:12.100
about -- going out on dangerous
ground here, generalizing

00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:15.040
about an area that's
not my province --

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:19.030
but in the Renaissance people
didn't know Shakespeare got most

00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:25.530
of his plots from North,
Plutarc's North or Ovid or,

00:58:25.530 --> 00:58:30.280
you know -- and nobody
seemed to care.

00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.630
It's not until the 18th
century that the idea

00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:36.420
of plagiarism becomes
a sensitive one,

00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:42.830
and that's when the
idea of authority

00:58:42.830 --> 00:58:45.060
over originality
also starts to pop

00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:47.540
up with Edward Young's
conjectures

00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:52.470
on original composition,
what was that, 1750s?

00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:53.770
Well, Johnson read
that and he said,

00:58:53.770 --> 00:58:57.950
well there's nothing original in
that book, we knew that already.

00:58:57.950 --> 00:59:02.040
But that's often cited as a
precursor of romantic thinking,

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:07.620
which supposedly
postulates individual genius

00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:10.230
and true literature as emanating

00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:12.150
from a divine soul
communing with itself.

00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:16.130
Of course, Wordsworth was
just as much of a craftsman,

00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:21.340
and Coleridge, as Pope and
Johnson were, they just,

00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:23.740
they did a better
job of hiding it, so.

00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:26.290
That's a really good
question, you know,

00:59:26.290 --> 00:59:29.860
it would require another talk
to unpack it, if not more.

00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:33.050
I know books have been
published on that,

00:59:33.050 --> 00:59:35.310
plagiarism in the Romantic
Period, in particular.

00:59:35.310 --> 00:59:37.160
Eric probably knows
what they are.

00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:39.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, I think
Coleridge was the great victim

00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:40.660
of that kind of charge.

00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:43.940
&gt;&gt; Anthony Lee: In biography and
literary, yeah, because of his

00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:49.320
over commitment to
deadlines he couldn't meet.

00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:54.190
Yeah, but that's almost sort
of a tragic story, there,

00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:57.050
but he did it in a way
that made it so obvious

00:59:57.050 --> 00:59:58.540
that he would get caught.

00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:00.220
It's like -- but we're
kind of straying from --

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:03.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Seventh
edition [inaudible] traces

01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:11.030
from antiquity to the
present day the idea

01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:16.070
that human creativity can be
original and you need the idea

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:22.040
of human creativity being
original [inaudible].

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:25.840
That actually gives you the idea

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:31.660
of his individual mind
[inaudible] it's not just

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:32.960
me [inaudible].

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.540
I'm not sure about
the English edition.

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:35.840
I know about [inaudible]

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:41.120
so the idea is 1750s
as a breaking point.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.940
&gt;&gt; Anthony Lee: 1750.

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:49.430
Well, Johnson wrote Rambler
143 in 1751 or '52 and it's

01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:56.610
on plagiarism and he talks about
the issue of what we're talking

01:00:56.610 --> 01:01:00.060
about here -- intertextuality
and plagiarism --

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:10.990
and he comes to the conclusion
that if you borrow a sentiment,

01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:16.800
but appropriate it in such a
way that you make it your own,

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.780
then that's a creative act.

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:24.900
It's not the highest
creative act because he looked

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:28.520
down on imitation very much.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:31.130
He thought all imitation
was poor.

01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:33.430
He praised Milton.

01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:37.170
He would have been the
greatest poet of all time,

01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:39.910
except he came after Homer.

01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:42.820
[Laughter]

01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:46.150
Speaker 2:

01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:50.750
&gt;&gt; To me, [inaudible]
actions have already created.

01:01:50.750 --> 01:02:01.030
I mean, that's related to the
discussion you have [inaudible].

01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:03.490
I mean, sort of these
[inaudible] how we get

01:02:03.490 --> 01:02:06.840
around that.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:08.770
&gt;&gt; Anthony Lee: In the
preface to The Fables,

01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:11.200
Dryden has a quotation
about Ben Johnson

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.080
that I don't remember
the exact words,

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:17.340
but he said Ben Johnson steals
so -- he's like a monarch.

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:19.160
He steals so well,
he makes it his own.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:22.930
[Laughter] You mentioned
classical literature,

01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:24.490
if you look at Virgil --

01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:28.210
where do most of his
things come from but Homer?

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:32.450
He -- if there had been no
Homer, there would be no Virgil.

01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:34.160
At least not in the
form that we have it.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:36.770
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I mean,
that's the idea.

01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:38.070
That's the idea.

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:43.100
[Inaudible] Why did the classics
survive the Middle Ages?

01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:47.080
Because you had [inaudible]
in order to be educated

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.870
and you sort of make
it your own.

01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:52.900
So, the question
of how do you go

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:58.570
around that is exactly
the reason we come back

01:02:58.570 --> 01:03:00.900
to [inaudible] because
you actually need

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:07.930
to make sure [inaudible]
depending on how literal.

01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:09.230
[Laughter]

01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:10.530
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: A different
point of view,

01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:13.500
[inaudible] I think there's a
problem with intertextuality.

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:16.790
I've been reading Austen
the last couple of weeks

01:03:16.790 --> 01:03:20.720
and writing a publication
on persuasion.

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:26.420
And, in persuasion, what she
does is she [inaudible] she

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:28.860
never quotes it, but she
moves to it in such a way

01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:31.390
that if you knew the
sonnet, you know what it is.

01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:34.830
And the whole idea is that
in this sonnet [inaudible] is

01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:36.130
always very depressed

01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:38.230
and melancholy [inaudible]
there's going

01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:40.220
to be no renewal of her joy.

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:43.820
And she says why can we not
have any renewal of joy?

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:47.070
[inaudible] I can't
have any renewal of joy.

01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:51.530
But then, the next paragraph
you hear about the farmer

01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:54.010
who doesn't care
about [inaudible]

01:03:54.010 --> 01:03:56.740
and he's making the past.

01:03:56.740 --> 01:04:00.480
Now, at that particular one, we
see her rewriting [inaudible]

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.750
and keeping her because
the novel is

01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:09.320
in general very dark [inaudible]
also a cripple like [inaudible].

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.340
She also can't seem
to get any money

01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:12.640
because she can't go to court.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:13.940
[Inaudible].

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:18.210
[Inaudible] you know how far you
can go and how far you can't.

01:04:18.210 --> 01:04:21.380
She says there are thousands
of poetical descriptions

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:24.270
of depression or
melancholy, but she points

01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:26.320
out just the [inaudible] one.

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:29.850
Now, if you go to
Mansfield Park,

01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:32.290
there she actually
quotes the line.

01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:34.930
She quotes a line from
Isaac Browne about tobacco.

01:04:34.930 --> 01:04:39.860
And she her character, Mary
Crawford, quoting this line.

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:42.710
Well, how are you going
to interpret that?

01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:47.220
What Claudia Johnson does
[inaudible] is say the line

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:50.530
of Isaac Browne comes
[inaudible]

01:04:50.530 --> 01:04:54.630
and Austen did not read the
poem in its original context.

01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:58.440
She only meant to refer to
Isaac Browne in the [inaudible].

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:02.600
But if you know Isaac
Browne, you as a smart reader,

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:05.620
realize it's a rewrite
of the poet.

01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:10.800
Now, [laughter], with Mansfield
Park, we see it as a rewrite

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:13.650
of Pope and you think
she's alluding to Pope.

01:05:13.650 --> 01:05:16.490
You come to one interpretation
[inaudible] which is much darker

01:05:16.490 --> 01:05:21.740
and much deeper and much broader
[inaudible] this book is.

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:25.570
If you say, oh no, [inaudible]
and she just wants us

01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:28.720
to see Mary Crawford as
this superficial person

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.130
who is trying --

01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:33.520
you get a very different,
you know, there's a question

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:38.790
of how far back -- and
this is an old question

01:05:38.790 --> 01:05:42.210
because this comes
from my readings

01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:44.950
of Richardson years ago.

01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:48.300
Richardson has all these
quotes throughout [inaudible]

01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:51.110
and they're deep and
tragic and they come

01:05:51.110 --> 01:05:52.650
from all these tragedies.

01:05:52.650 --> 01:05:58.860
Well, the unhappy fact
[inaudible] is almost everyone

01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:02.240
comes to [inaudible] right.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.620
So, it's a question
of how far back --

01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:09.050
this is kind of a
serious question,

01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:13.860
how far back we can peel
[inaudible] understand of it.

01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:16.380
I think Austen in the persuasion
knows what she is doing,

01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:19.350
that she knows she is
rewriting it so clear.

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:21.570
I think she knows she's using
Isaac Browne [inaudible]

01:06:21.570 --> 01:06:26.790
but what she means by that and
how we [inaudible] we don't want

01:06:26.790 --> 01:06:29.550
to start to have [inaudible] you
can have everything [inaudible]

01:06:29.550 --> 01:06:31.710
and the work never stops.

01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:36.060
So, there's a real problem of
how far the author may need

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:41.790
to peel intertextuality and then
how much it brings into the --

01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:43.090
bring it into the work.

01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:44.910
What are we going to bring in?

01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:47.990
Are we going to bring
in just Charles Smith?

01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:49.520
Are we going to bring in Byron?

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:50.820
Because after all Byron
[inaudible] melancholy later

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:52.390
in the book there is another
character who quotes Byron.

01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:58.540
No. [Inaudible] a real crux
of how a reader should go

01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:04.260
about dealing with these
intertextual books.

01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:06.210
&gt;&gt; Anthony Lee: Well, I
think what you're left

01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:07.960
with ultimately is the text.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:11.170
How do you know what the
author's intention is?

01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:14.580
And, so, you just have to
be like Detective Somerset

01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:18.010
and gather your clues together
and make a strong case for --

01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:20.260
I mean, I would ask
which line in Pope

01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:22.310
and who was Pope
alluding to perhaps.

01:07:22.310 --> 01:07:23.610
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: That's right.

01:07:23.610 --> 01:07:25.990
The reason that people tend not

01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:28.350
to go back beyond
the Isaac Browne,

01:07:28.350 --> 01:07:31.130
that's why I said to myself -

01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:35.100
This is a new edition
[inaudible] I said

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:37.070
to myself [inaudible]

01:07:37.070 --> 01:07:40.270
why didn't the person
quote Pope?

01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:42.980
Well, because she is quoting
Claudia Johnson [inaudible].

01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:48.380
So, I go back to Claudia
Johnson and I see that she,

01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:52.090
very deliberately,
quotes [inaudible].

01:07:52.090 --> 01:07:56.900
Before her, Chapman did.

01:07:56.900 --> 01:08:00.750
Now, Chapman [inaudible].

01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:04.050
There's a real crux of how
you're going to read the book,

01:08:04.050 --> 01:08:05.820
how you're going to regard it
[inaudible] is very important,

01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:08.710
but the problem is in
trying to understand

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:10.300
where it ends and
where it begins.

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:13.880
You see the same thing in films.

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.180
Films are intertextual
[inaudible]

01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:17.420
and how far that can go.

01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:19.820
&gt;&gt; These notes are part
of the current text.

01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:25.070
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Well,
yes, they're all

01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:29.620
in current text, that's right.

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:31.860
And, originally, of course,

01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:37.780
you just had Isaac Browne
[inaudible] you have Sylvia

01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:39.080
Johnson [inaudible].

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.380
[Laughter]

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:41.680
&gt;&gt; Anthony Lee: That
reminds me of something

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:42.980
that this young lady mentioned.

01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:50.060
Johnson's edition of
Shakespeare, 1765,

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:55.720
he takes notes from earlier
commentators from [inaudible],

01:08:55.720 --> 01:09:00.310
from Pope, Warburton,
and he incorporates them

01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:03.440
into his notes with
his own comment.

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.100
So, you have this kind of
heteroglossia [phonetic]

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:09.190
of the voices that
are at the margins

01:09:09.190 --> 01:09:11.600
of his Shakespeare edition,

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:16.090
these dialogical exchanges
amongst different critics.

01:09:16.090 --> 01:09:18.050
And sometimes he'll
comment and say, you know,

01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:20.960
enough, like, this is it.

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:23.110
I said I'll tell you what it is.

01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:27.200
But, more often than not,
he just lets the reader sort

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:30.220
of fend for herself
or himself and try

01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:34.200
to decide who is right here.

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:38.740
And that's another form
of intertextuality.

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:43.390
In my reading of Johnson,
that's not entirely dissimilar

01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:46.900
to the use of authorities
in the Dictionary.

01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:49.780
They are there and
the reader is invited

01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:51.240
to do something with them.

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:54.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: At some point
[inaudible] is there a text

01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:58.960
in the house and you
need to decide what it is

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:03.660
that you have there is
all I'm really saying.

01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:07.030
Another example I had
recently where another,

01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:08.330
a new dispute [inaudible]

01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:14.510
and the act was trying
to remember it.

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:17.680
But a new recent
[inaudible] genuine

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:22.580
and we should take
them seriously

01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:29.350
and we should read them
[inaudible] other versions

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:33.740
of Hamlet.

01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:39.310
So there comes a point where
you have to say, well no,

01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:42.110
[inaudible] another
area of [inaudible].

01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:45.340
Austen likes to hide her tracks.

01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:48.250
That's one of the reasons you
have a hard time is she doesn't

01:10:48.250 --> 01:10:52.050
want you to know all the
time who she's quoting.

01:10:52.050 --> 01:10:55.940
&gt;&gt; Anthony Lee: I understand
your urge and information

01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:59.240
and trying to arrive at
some sense of stability.

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:03.210
Eventually, if you're going
to write a paper, or a chapter

01:11:03.210 --> 01:11:07.010
on something, you can't go
into this infinite regress.

01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:09.500
I mean, you have to
decide what to include

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.020
and what not to include.

01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:16.100
But that infinite regress is
exactly what I was suggesting is

01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:22.600
the truth of it behind the
realm of the text that we have.

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:27.740
There is this universe
that I imagine possibly

01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:31.900
and I think that's equally
exciting as well as trying

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:35.040
to provide some stable notion.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.340
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: That's
what I was thinking.

01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:39.850
This is Johnson who quotes
Shakespeare [inaudible] there is

01:11:39.850 --> 01:11:48.130
a textual corruption
[inaudible] and somebody came

01:11:48.130 --> 01:11:53.410
up with the idea it means
just green tables [inaudible]

01:11:53.410 --> 01:12:00.000
suddenly he's talking
about green tables

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.620
and was it Warburton or somebody
said [inaudible] it just fits.

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:09.820
So now we have this stable text.

01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:11.590
[Laughter]

01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:13.310
&gt;&gt; Anthony Lee: [Inaudible]
There's another question.

01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:14.610
I will say this.

01:12:14.610 --> 01:12:18.400
If you go back and look at
Edmond Malone and Johnson

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.940
and George Stevens,
and Warburton,

01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:24.550
and look at their notes and
how they're arguing commas

01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:27.600
and various things and
you look at a modern text,

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:33.060
say Bevington's edition and
it seems like it is stable.

01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:34.360
But it's not.

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:38.420
It's not. That's an illusion
of the fixity of the print

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:39.980
on the text makes you think.

01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:42.620
If you're an undergraduate,
this is what it is.

01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:45.800
Not necessarily.

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: This
makes me think

01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:52.670
that the perceptive
student who is accused

01:12:52.670 --> 01:12:56.720
of plagiarism might use
as a defense [laughter].

01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:02.040
You only have to go back not
even very far [inaudible]

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:06.910
At what point do you -

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:11.580
&gt;&gt; Anthony Lee: I've
seen that happen.

01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:19.420
Students from Africa, I've
seen them defend plagiarism

01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:23.300
by saying that's how everything
is sort of a common --

01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:26.800
they don't use these terms,
but a common oral discourse,

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.650
people circulating stories.

01:13:29.650 --> 01:13:36.930
There is no proprietary
right on who is said

01:13:36.930 --> 01:13:39.170
to own this or own that.

01:13:39.170 --> 01:13:46.310
I don't know how
disingenuous that is,

01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:50.110
but I've seen it in students.

01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:52.630
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Shevlin: Well,
I think it would be hard.

01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:55.120
I think, culturally,
there are various --

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:57.240
I don't know if anyone's --

01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:03.430
I've had presentations when
I was a graduate student.

01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:06.620
I was doing work in the
writing center about Russia.

01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:11.540
The Soviet Union actually
wanting a lack of originality

01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:14.040
and wanted this reproduction
of texts

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:17.150
and that students were
inclined to do that just the way

01:14:17.150 --> 01:14:21.220
that students from
China would sometimes --

01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:24.180
they could not put their
thesis or argument up front.

01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:28.370
They would take pages to get
to because it was impolite

01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:30.810
to comes -- so, it is
different cultural,

01:14:30.810 --> 01:14:34.750
but what I was thinking
with regular, you know,

01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:38.420
with another paper, I
think this is illegal.

01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:40.470
I mean, with American
students writing,

01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:42.230
and the idea of plagiarism.

01:14:42.230 --> 01:14:45.290
A perceptive student that tried

01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:47.960
to do something would
have created a work

01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:55.030
that did just what Austen did
and made it his or her own.

01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:57.090
I think it's very --

01:14:57.090 --> 01:15:00.650
I don't think that
that's a problem

01:15:00.650 --> 01:15:04.790
because I think even we
look at it today as the use

01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:07.980
of how we were using
something to create a new work.

01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:13.480
Because, I mean, that's just one
aspect besides the moral right

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:15.210
if you offend.

01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:18.480
But in terms of legal.

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:26.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [Inaudible] that
I came as a graduate student

01:15:26.190 --> 01:15:35.750
to the US, I found slightly
shocking [inaudible] I thought

01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:41.410
that was common sense.

01:15:41.410 --> 01:15:44.510
[inaudible] legal needed to be
mentioned in writing [inaudible]

01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:46.830
you don't have in
European societies,

01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:50.870
at least continental ones.

01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:53.200
You know, you don't have to
go as far as China or Africa

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:56.290
in order to sort of come up with
[inaudible] circumstances there.

01:15:56.290 --> 01:16:00.410
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I mean,
just talking absolutely.

01:16:00.410 --> 01:16:04.670
But I'm saying [inaudible]

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:09.730
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Baron:
Any more questions?

01:16:09.730 --> 01:16:12.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Perhaps we
could bring the whole subject

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:18.540
of intertextuality back to
stages [inaudible] and quote one

01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:25.130
of his most famous lines
[inaudible] and goes like this.

01:16:25.130 --> 01:16:33.510
[Inaudible] what's left to
us is to remember [laughter].

01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:41.050
[ Applause ]

01:16:41.050 --> 01:16:42.350
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Baron:
I couldn't help

01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:45.180
but be thinking imitation
is the sincerest form

01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:48.070
of flattery, trite
as that may be.

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:52.440
Thank you very much
for that interesting,

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.070
stimulating talk and discussion.

01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:56.730
I hope you'll take
some time to look

01:16:56.730 --> 01:17:00.550
at what the rare book folks
have brought out for us here

01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:03.790
and then, if you'd like to
join us for drinks and dinner,

01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:08.520
we'd be delighted to
have you come along.

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:12.380
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of The Library of Congress.
