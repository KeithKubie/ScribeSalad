1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,660
Now, here's, here's another one.

2
00:00:01,661 --> 00:00:06,661
So when I retired from the navy and got
out and started the consulting business

3
00:00:07,451 --> 00:00:12,451
working in one of my risk averse friends
that was staying in the military for,

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,050
it's it's welfare program,
right? It's a, it's a paycheck,

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,900
right? And he, the guy wasn't, you
know, he wasn't all fired up anymore,

6
00:00:22,901 --> 00:00:25,650
but he was in and so he had a
mortgage to pay and kids defeats.

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,200
So he's just staying in and he kind of
looked at me when I was getting out and I

8
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:30,700
said, yeah man, I got bills to pay too,

9
00:00:30,701 --> 00:00:34,210
but I'm going to go and get
after it somehow. And he said,

10
00:00:34,211 --> 00:00:36,190
what are you going to do if it, you know,

11
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:38,170
if the business doesn't work
and you end up in a, you know,

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,660
you can come back in and I'm, what,
what, what are you going to do?

13
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:43,570
You won't be able to get back and
blah, blah blah blah. And I said, Bro,

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,910
worst case scenario, everything goes to
hell. Guess what I'm going to be doing?

15
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,630
I have an RV, I will be
in my RV with my family.

16
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:56,740
We'll be driving up and down the coast
of California raiding Jujitsu schools and

17
00:00:56,741 --> 00:01:00,070
training and I'll be surfing and it's
all good and it won't cost me barely

18
00:01:00,071 --> 00:01:01,840
anything to do that. My retirement
will cover to be good to go.

19
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,210
You got a back up plan like that. Let me,

20
00:01:07,211 --> 00:01:11,320
let me rephrase that. If you
needed a backup plan like that

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,920
[inaudible] what would it be? This is,

22
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,060
this is one of my favorite topics. Uh,

23
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,090
so I would say that I have an infinite
number of backup plans and the way I

24
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:28,641
think about that is by doing
what I call fear setting.

25
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:33,750
So much like you just
said, looking at my goals,

26
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:35,100
the worst things that could happen,

27
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:38,400
the ways I can mitigate that in the
way I could get back to where I am now,

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,620
if all hell struck at once,

29
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,780
helps me to remove the
fear of taking these,

30
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,370
these steps that might paralyze me.
Otherwise. The second part is by say,

31
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,110
practicing fasting, practicing spending
no money for certain periods of time.

32
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,990
I don't fear,

33
00:01:57,991 --> 00:02:02,670
I would say the top handful of things
that tend to stop people from taking what

34
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:03,930
they perceive as risks.

35
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,260
The other very important thing is that
risk has a very specific meaning for me.

36
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,900
And I realized early on that people
talk about risk tolerance, taking risks,

37
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,370
but if they don't define
it clearly it can,

38
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,210
it can end up being paralyzing
and how nebulous it is. So for me,

39
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,620
risk is very simple.

40
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:29,700
It is the likelihood of an
irreversible negative outcome.

41
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,080
That's it. So most things I do, even
though people look at it, they say,

42
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,110
oh my God, this guy's in vec
investing in speculative startups.

43
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:41,730
When it's just one guy in an
idea, man, he's a risk taker.

44
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,720
I don't view myself that way at
all. I view myself as if anything,

45
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:49,770
someone who's very, has taken a lot of
time to get good at mitigating risk.

46
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,150
I'm a risk mitigator. Uh,
and in the case of say,

47
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:55,140
speculative investing,

48
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,740
I am only using money that
I can comfortably to lose.

49
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,960
And for me, backup plan,
similar to yourself.

50
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,440
Sheena, throw my dog in an RV, get some,

51
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,940
get some instant oatmeal sleeping
bag. Yosemite's right in my backyard.

52
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,670
I don't know how to go find some
dirt bag climbers and hang out there.

53
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,970
Good to go. Yeah, go hang out with
my parents. Get to see more of them.

54
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,620
Go for a run in the woods. Yeah.

55
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,720
While I'm trying to figure
out the next step I ate.

56
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,460
Then you had that attitude when you were
taking more legitimate risks. I mean,

57
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:31,240
right now, obviously you're,
you're pretty good to go and, but,

58
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,340
but in the beginning when you moved
out to the west coast, you had,

59
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,500
you had to have this similar attitude
of, cause I know I did that, that,

60
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:42,460
that attitude for me freed me. Like, oh,
worst case scenario, I lose everything.

61
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:46,900
Cool. I still have my RV. It's paid
for. Yeah, we're good. Yeah, totally.

62
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,930
I had that added more surfboards and
any other human should ever have and not

63
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:56,430
knives and surfboards. We rolled deep. I,

64
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,500
I think I had that realization early on.

65
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,890
And of course when I first graduated
from school, went out to the west coast,

66
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,900
I did not have a lot of money.

67
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:08,380
I remember when I came out to California
for the first time for a job interview,

68
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,670
I couldn't afford a hotel.

69
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,760
I stayed at the fair techs
kickboxing gym on the second floor,

70
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:16,540
sleeping on a bunk bed with a tie
instructor sleeping above me and washed my

71
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:21,210
clothes in the sink. You
Go. And I was happy. I mean,

72
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,090
Eh, I was fully content. I didn't
feel like I was missing anything.

73
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,820
And uh, uh, but let's not kid ourselves.
I mean, when I first moved out,

74
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:33,970
it was 1999 this is at
the peak of the bubble.

75
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,040
Rental prices are out of control and I
was making 40 grand a year pretax and

76
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,600
yeah, and my, my office, my desk
was in the fire exit. I mean,

77
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,630
they was completely
illegal. I was, I had to,

78
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,090
I had a, a pretty slick setup,
but it was very low budget. And,

79
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:56,520
uh,

80
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,240
but really what I think freed me
on some level is realizing in this,

81
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,630
hopefully this doesn't sound
perkish or arrogant or whatever,

82
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:09,580
but no matter what difficulties
might be, follow me,

83
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:12,910
whatever, uh, unemployment
might come my way.

84
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,700
There are people with fewer resources,

85
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:20,500
with less education who have
figured it out before and survived.

86
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,830
So if dozens or hundreds or thousands
of millions of people have figured this

87
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,330
out, I'm going to come out
the other end, it'd be fine.

88
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,810
And so that was very reassuring to me.
