00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.879
Prince Bohemond the Third, King Louis the
Second of France, and the Byzantine Emperor

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:08.920
Michael The Second all had stutters so pronounced,
that they were each referred to as “The

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.920
Stammerer”.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:17.690
So, even if you have a stutter, you could
be an emperor one day.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.510
Hey there stuttering stallions, Jules here
for DNews.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.810
A stutter is a type of speech disorder, when
your speech is involuntarily broken up by

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.820
repetitive sounds, or blocks where you can’t
quite say the sounds you want to.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.349
More than 70 million people worldwide are
believed to be stutterers.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.130
Some develop a stutter in childhood, and it
goes away.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.750
Others can develop it later in life.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.700
Boys get it more often than girls, and they’re
more likely to have it persist into adulthood

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.700
as well.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.559
For a long time, it was believed that the
disorder was psychosomatic, meaning that it

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.640
wasn’t related to a physical cause, but
rather, a mental block, like stress..

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.710
Well it turns out, that’s not quite true.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.590
A new study published in the medical journal
Human Brain Mapping looked at 62 people with

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.200
and without stutters, focusing on blood flow
in an area of the brain called “the Broca’s

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.670
area”, which is located in the frontal lobe.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.600
They found that in people with stutters, there
was less blood flow in this region, and blood

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.200
flow in the brain is related to neural activity.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.000
The more severe the stutter, the less blood
flow in the Broca.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.630
So, what is so important about this part of
the brain that it causes stuttering?

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.740
Well, the Broca’s area is associated with
speech formation, alongside another part of

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.520
the brain called the Wernicke's area, in the
temporal lobe.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.369
They are part of the “neural language loop”,
and are both necessary to produce clear and

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.679
concise speech.

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:31.220
The Wernicke’s area is the part where you
choose which words you want to say and in

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.220
which order.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.950
It’s like a behind the scenes blueprint
or a storyboard for your speech.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.390
This information is then fed into the Broca’s
area which produces those words out loud,

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.740
like a word factory.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.819
For stutterers, their Wenicke’s area is
able to put together the sentences, while

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:48.439
the Broca’s area struggles to produce it.

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.700
The worst part of this is that in society,
people with stutters are often thought to

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.229
be dumber, simply because they can’t get
the words out, when in reality, they are no

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.950
less intelligent or eloquent than their non-stuttering
counterparts.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.170
Another study, recently published in JAMA
Psychiatry looked at the brains of 94 stuttering

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.469
and non-stuttering children and adults.

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.129
They found that the baseline brain activity
— the way the neurons fired signals — was

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.219
different for stutterers in the regions of
the brain associated with the regulation of

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:15.620
speech production, attention, and emotion.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.569
So, the root causes of stuttering could be
differences in brain circuits and blood flow.

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.760
But stress and anxiety can also take a toll,
making stuttering worse, because the parts

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.849
of your brain associated with attention and
language processing interact with the parts

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.159
of your brain that regulate emotion.

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.769
Stuttering is a complicated condition, without
any easy fixes.

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.290
Those who suffer from it may be able to curb
the tendency with the help of a speech therapist,

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.200
and for others, like children, it may go away
on its own.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.550
But these new developments certainly help
point to the parts of the brain in question,

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.160
and may help scientists develop new solutions.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.459
Have you noticed that when you record your
voice and hear it back, it always sounds awful?

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.610
Why do we hate the sound of our own voices?

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.719
You can find out why in this video right here.

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.550
And do you have any other language processing
questions?
