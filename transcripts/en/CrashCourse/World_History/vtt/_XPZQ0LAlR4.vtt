Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
World History, and today we’re gonna talk

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.620
about World War I. The so-called, Great War?

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.960
World War I wasn’t the most destructive
war, or the first total war, and it certainly

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.030
wasn’t - despite its billing - the war to
end all wars. But it was the war to change

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.780
all wars. World War I changed our outlook,
it normalized cynicism and irony, which, I

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.880
think you’ll agree, are kind of dominant lenses for
describing our world today. Basically, I’d argue

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.960
that World War I helped make possible everything from
The Simpsons to intentionally unattractive mustaches.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.000
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! are you referring to
me?

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.490
Oh, Me From the Past, you’re an embarrassment
to our family. Also to all our other selves.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:46.590
[theme music]

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.519
Most people think of World War I as a tragedy
because it didn’t need to happen and didn’t

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.589
really accomplish much, except for creating
social and economic conditions that made World

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.600
War II possible. So when we talk about the causes of
the war, inevitably, we’re also assigning blame.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.159
The immediate cause was, of course, the assassination
in Sarajevo of the Austrian Archduke Franz

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.190
Ferdinand on June 28, 1914, by a Bosnian Serb
nationalist named Gavrilo Princip. Quick aside:

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.620
It’s worth noting that the first big war
of the 20th century began with an act of terrorism.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.480
So Franz Ferdinand wasn’t particularly well-liked
by his uncle, the Emperor Franz Joseph - now

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.720
that is a mustache! But even so, the assassination
led Austria to issue an ultimatum to Serbia,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.970
whereupon Serbia accepted some, but not all,
of Austria’s demands, leading Austria to

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.990
declare war against Serbia. And then Russia,
due to its alliance with the Serbs, then mobilized

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.770
its army; Germany, because it had an alliance
with Austria, told Russia to stop mobilizing,

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.280
which Russia failed to do, so then Germany
mobilized its own army, declared war on Russia,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.180
cemented an alliance with the Ottomans, and then
declared war on France, because, you know, France.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.660
Germany’s War plan, the Schlieffen Plan,
required that it invade France in the most

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.260
expedient way possible, which as you can see
is via Belgium, And Great Britain was a friend

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.580
of Belgium - I mean, as much as anyone can be a friend
of Belgium - and so they declared war on Germany.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.700
So by August 4th, all the major powers of
Europe are at war with each other. By the

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.150
end of the month, Japan, honoring its alliance
with Britain, would be at war with Germany

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.939
and Austria as well. When all was said and
done, counting colonies and spheres of influence,

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:16.209
the world map would eventually look like this.
You’ll never guess who wins.

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.239
So there were many opportunities NOT to mobilize
and declare war, none of which were taken.

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.989
Some blame the web of alliances itself, which
is what Woodrow Wilson tried to fix with the

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.400
League of Nations. Some blame Russia, the
first big country to mobilize. Some blame

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.969
Germany for the inflexibility of the Schlieffen
Plan. Leninists claim war grew out of imperialism

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:35.530
and was fueled by capitalist rivalries; and
others claim it was a war between Germany’s

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.409
radical modernism and Britain’s traditional
conservatism.

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.849
But if I had to assign blame, I’d go with
the alliance system and the cultural belief

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.590
that war was, in general, good for nations.
War helped define who was "them" and who was

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.469
"us", and doing that strengthened the idea
of us. And before World War I, war was perceived

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.069
to be necessary and often even glorious.

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.249
The trench warfare on the Western Front is
most famous for its brutal futility - Great

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:04.200
Britain and France on one side, Germany on
the other, with no man’s land between. World

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.989
War I was a writer’s war, and there’s
a lot of metaphorical resonance in living

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.159
men digging holes where they would in time
die. The lines of trenches on the Western

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.930
Front covered only about 400 miles as the
crow flies, but because of the endless zigzagging,

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.879
the trenches themselves may have run as much
as 25,000 miles.

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.769
But the stalemate of trench warfare wasn’t
seen on every front. Especially at the beginning

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.590
of the war, there was a lot of offensive movement,
especially in the initial German strikes,

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.709
especially on the Eastern Front, the Germans
were pretty successful against the Russians,

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.650
who had a large but pretty hapless army. Also,
for those blessed few of you who sat through

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.859
all of Lawrence of Arabia, you’ll remember
that T. E. Lawrence’s exploits took place

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.829
in the context of World War I, with the British
battling the Ottomans.

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.409
This brings up an important point: World War
I featured combatants from around the world

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:51.859
- Britain’s army, especially, included soldiers
from India, Africa, Australia, New Zealand,

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.760
and Canada, who was just happy to be invited.
Africans served with the French, and for a

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.360
lot of these people, their experiences helped
build nationalist movements when survivors

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.780
returned home after the war.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.430
That’s about as close as we get to a silver
lining. The war itself was incredibly destructive.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.620
Over 15 million people were killed and over
20 million wounded. In France, 13.3% of the

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.260
male population between the age of 15 and
49 died in the war. The war also saw a lot

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.329
of civilians die, especially in the Ottoman
Empire where more than 2 million of the 3

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.530
million people killed were non-combatants.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.530
But like so many other wars, World War I’s
most efficient killer was disease. Stupid

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.120
disease, always hijacking history. Dysentery,
typhus, and cholera were rampant, and otherwise

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.430
minor injuries would prove fatal when gangrene
set in. I mean, 25% of arm wounds among German

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.229
soldiers were fatal. And that’s not even
to mention the famous influenza epidemic that

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.020
broke out toward the end of the war, which
killed three times as many people as the war itself.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.560
The main reason the war was so deadly was
the combination of new technology and outdated

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.840
tactics. While we may think about tanks, airplanes
and poison gas, all of which made their debut

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.650
in the First World War, the two most devastating
technologies were American: machine guns and

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.500
barbed wire. Attempting to march in lines
towards an enemy’s trench, soldiers of both

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.080
sides were mowed down by machine gun fire.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.300
According to one German machine gunner at
the battle of the Somme in 1916, “The [British]

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.490
officers went in front. I noticed one of them
walking calmly, carrying a walking stick.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.250
When we started firing we just had to load
and reload. They went down in their hundreds.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.199
You didn’t have to aim, we just fired into
them.” At the Somme, the British lost 60,000

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.449
men in the first day of fighting. Remember
the old colonialist verse, “Whatever happens

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:35.020
/ we have got / the maxim gun / and they have
not”? Yeah, well, now everybody had machine guns.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.520
One of the things we try to remember here
at Crash Course is that people both make history

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.889
and are made by it. World War I brings this
fact into stark relief because we know so

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.479
much about the soldiers who fought in it,
and how they wrote about the war really changed

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.569
our relationship with systemic violence.

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.180
For most soldiers, there was nothing glamorous
or heroic about this war. For the British,

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.240
for example, the trenches were two things
above all: wet and smelly. The dampness came

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.780
from the fact that the British trenches were
in the wettest part of Flanders. The smell

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.340
was mainly decomposing flesh. Nothing glorious
about that.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.120
On the upside, soldiers were at least rarely
hungry, and there was a lot of food from home,

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.610
which is worth underscoring, because it reminds
us that home wasn’t very far away. Even

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.349
for the British, at their closest the front
was only 70 miles from England. They could

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:22.270
read newspapers from London one day later
than Londoners could.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.620
While going “over the top” - Stan, no
puns in this episode! - Right, while going

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.050
“over the top” of the trench to cross
no-man’s land and attack the enemy trench

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.120
is what lights our romantic imagination, most
soldiers’ lives were dominated by the fear

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.280
of shelling. According to a journal published
by French soldiers: “There’s nothing more

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.539
horrible in war than being shelled. It’s
a form of torture that the soldier can’t

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:47.349
see the end of. Suddenly he’s afraid of
being buried alive... The man stays put in

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:51.780
his hole, helplessly waiting for, hoping for,
a miracle.”

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.439
Although soldiers then, as now, lived under
conditions it's difficult to imagine, there

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:58.819
was more than even the threat of death to
distress them. According to German officer

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:04.110
Ernst Jünger, it was not “danger, however
extreme … that depresses the spirit of men,

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.659
so much as over-fatigue and wretched conditions.”
And for most soldiers, especially the British

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:12.860
and French, the pay for their efforts was
pitiful. So why did they even keep fighting?

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.439
Duty, nationalism, loyalty to comrades, and
fear of being shot for desertion all played a role.

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:22.360
But so did alcohol. As one British medical
officer said: “Had it not been for the rum

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.590
ration, I do not think we should have won
the war.” Ernst Jünger also remarked on

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.990
the propensity of soldiers to drink their
troubles away: “Though ten out of twelve

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.449
had fallen, still the last two, as sure as
death, were to be found on the first evening

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:37.289
of rest over the bottle drinking a silent
health to their dead ‘companions’ ”.

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:45.930
Oh, it’s time for the open letter? Whew!
An open letter to alcohol. I wonder what’s

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.199
in today’s secret compartment.

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:54.360
Oh, shocking, it’s a golf club. And an actual
disco golf ball made by a crash course fan!

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:59.599
Dear Alcohol - oh, that’s...
Like disease, you’ve been a key figure in

00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:03.710
human history, despite not actually being
a person, and for millennia, you’ve played

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:07.820
an important role in war, often helping soldiers
do their duty, often distracting them from it.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:13.039
But here’s the thing, alcohol, in my experience,
which is extensive, if you need to be drunk

00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:17.780
to do something, you should maybe not do the
thing. Unless of course, the thing is golf.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.430
Best wishes, John Green.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:24.759
So what did we take away from the so-called Great
War? Well, not much. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:29.439
The Treaty of Versailles, which ended World
War I, fixed the blame for the war on Germany,

00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:33.750
which proved ruinous to the German economy
and destructive to its political institutions.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:38.339
And unless you’re really nostalgic for totalitarian
communism, you’ve gotta say that World War

00:08:38.339 --> 00:08:42.829
I was also a disaster for Russia, because
it facilitated the rise of the Bolsheviks.

00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:46.790
The Russian Revolution had two phases. In
the first phase, called the February Revolution,

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:50.639
because get this, it occurred in February,
army mutinies and civil unrest forced the

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:55.559
overthrow of the Romanov dynasty which had
been in power in Russia since, like, forever,

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.340
to use a proper historian term.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.459
The monarchy was replaced by a provisional
government led (eventually) by Alexander Kerensky,

00:09:01.459 --> 00:09:05.880
which made the terrible decision to keep Russia
in the war, which led to the October Revolution,

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:10.610
so called because it happened in October,
in which Vladimir Lenin and his Bolsheviks

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:16.250
took over, famously promising the Russian
people “peace, bread, and land.” To which

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:20.680
the Russian people responded, “Hey, you
just named of our three favorite things.”

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.250
Lenin’s first big achievement was signing
a separate peace with Germany and getting

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:28.310
Russia out of the war, which was helpful to
him since he needed to fight a civil war that

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:32.180
wouldn’t end until 1922. This might’ve
helped Germany, too, except the US entered

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.860
the war on the side of the British and the
French.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:38.820
Which led to another outcome of the war: increased
geopolitical influence for the U.S. The U.S.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.690
was already becoming a major economic power,
and being able to avoid the destruction and

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:47.260
loss of manpower associated with World War
I certainly didn’t hurt. The war helped

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.399
catapult the U.S. from being a debtor nation
to a creditor one, and Wilson’s leading

00:09:51.399 --> 00:09:54.800
role in the negotiations at Versailles – even
though he actually didn’t get what he wanted

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.060
– made America a big player on the world
stage for the first time. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:03.040
So just so we don’t get completely Eurocentric,
another major outcome of the war was the end

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.730
of the Ottoman Empire and the emergence of
the nation-state of Turkey. The rest of the

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:10.720
world saw some change too, but not much for
the better. In Africa, Britain took Germany’s

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.920
colonies, and even though Indians fought and
died in a higher percentage than Americans

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.060
in World War I, India didn’t gain any real
autonomy.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.060
All these terrible outcomes led to a general
sense of disappointment in literary circles,

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:26.670
And this feeling of pointlessness and cynicism
was expressed by the writers of the “lost

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:30.750
generation.” It was a war full of loss:
Millions of people were lost. Traditional

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:36.380
ideals of war’s nobility and heroism were
lost as well: I mean, what is heroism when

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.060
you’re just sitting in a trench, waiting
to be blown up?

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:43.880
And after World War I, war might be necessary,
but it would never again be glorious. We see

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.600
this shift in the writing and art that emerged
from the Great War as artists transitioned

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.449
from romanticism to modernism. Think of Hemingway’s
The Sun Also Rises, which is about a men rendered

00:10:52.449 --> 00:10:57.550
not noble but impotent by war. This dark,
cruel irony here - you go to war to become

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:03.519
a man and war takes away the organ often called
“your manhood” - that defined Hemingway’s

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:05.930
worldview. And it also defines ours.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.889
Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.

The show is written by my high school history

00:11:16.769 --> 00:11:20.149
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself, and our graphics
team is Thought Bubble.

Last week’s phrase of the week was "unless
you are the Mongols" (we brought it back for

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.600
you), if you’d like to suggest future phrases
of the week, or guess at this week’s, you can

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.380
do so in comments, where you can also ask questions
that will be answered by our team of historians.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:34.400
Thanks for watching Crash Course, and, as we
say in my hometown, Don’t Forget To Be Awesome.
