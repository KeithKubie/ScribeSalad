00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:07.030
The idea that one is in many ways an extremely
difficult person to be in a relationship with

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:13.470
may sound rather improbable and even at points
offensive. Yet fully understanding and readily

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.800
and graciously admitting to this possibility
might be the surest way of making sure one

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.710
is an endurable proposition over the long-term.
There are few people more deeply insufferable

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.739
than those who don’t, at regular intervals,
suspect they might be so. We are, all of us,

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.730
invariably, hugely tricky propositions. We
don’t need to know anyone in particular

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.360
to know this about everyone. We have all – in
some way or another – been inadequately

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.649
parented, we have a panoply of unfortunate
psychological traits, we are beset by bad

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.230
habits, we are anxious, jealous, ill-tempered
and vain. We are bringing an awesome amount

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.510
of trouble into someone else’s life by agreeing
to be their partner. We tend to be shielded

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.289
from this unwelcome news prior to a big relationship
through a mixture of sentimentality and neglect.

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:12.509
Our parents loved us too much to tell us;
our friends don’t want to get bogged down

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.819
in detailed critiques of our personalities;
a pleasant occasional meal is all they want

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:23.770
from us. And our exes were too keen to escape
from us to offer up a helpfully detailed critique

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.710
of our personalities. They simply told us
they needed a little more space – or needed

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.870
to take a long trip to India. Furthermore,
when we’re on our own, we just don’t notice

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.270
how annoying we might well be in the eyes
of others. Perhaps we were in a sulk for the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.319
whole of a Sunday, but no-one was there to
be driven crazy by our self-pity and our passive

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:49.229
fury. We may have tendencies to use our work
as an escape from intimacy, but so long as

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.539
we are not permanently with someone, we can
pass off our eccentric hours without comment.

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.389
Our peculiar eating habits won’t be real
until there is another person across the table

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:05.179
to register our challenging chewing sounds
and ingredient combinations. Eventually, a

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.810
partner will call us out on these traits.
It feels like a horrible personal attack which

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.910
a nicer person would not put us through. But
it is no such thing. It is an inevitable response

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.689
to our failings – which anyone would need
eventually to bring up. Our partner is not

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:26.780
really doing anything odd. They are merely
holding up a mirror. Everyone, seen close

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.849
up, has an appalling amount wrong with their
character. It’s not us – it’s the human

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.670
condition. The specifics vary hugely, of course;
people are nightmarish in different ways.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.269
But the basic point is to share. Whatever
we think or feel about ourselves, we will

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.960
be revealed as sorely defective upon close-up,
prolonged inspection. Sadly, it’s not that

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.720
our partner is being too critical or unusually
demanding. They are the bearer of an inevitable

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.800
news: that we are a nightmare.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.360
Being asked to acknowledge ones flaws isn't a request to admit somthing very strange.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.960
What would be strange would be to think that one was without major defects.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:16.640
Of course we have some delightfull qualities as well, but it does mean that we are unavoidably going to be very hard for another person to live around.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.480
We need therefore to ask ourselves In as candid a manner as as we can manage what

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.760
specifically might be slightly crazey or desperate or undeveloped in our characters.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.840
Maturity involves having quite a detailed answer to the following question, "How are you difficult to live with."

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.280
A presumption of ones own innocence is at the heart of self rightousness and cruelty.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.280
Because our minds may go blank at this point and remember

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.520
only our tender and beautiful sides, we can
lean on a set of prompts

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.280
For example when i'm annoyed I have a tendency to...

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.960
When I feel hurt I...

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.760
Around money I can be a bit difficult because...

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.520
I guess I worry really quite a lot about ...

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.240
I suppose I might be a bit of a handful around sex because...

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.080
The point of prompting greater awareness of our questionable patterns of behavour isn't to feel guilty

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:26.240
or ashamed about them.  Just to see how easily they can be confusing, disturbing and annoying to another person.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:36.080
We need before we commit ourselves to a relationships to get fully aquainted with all the ways in which we are going to be a serious challange to live around.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:52.640
Our Relationships Reboot cards inspire conversations that can help to re-kindle love between you and your partner.
