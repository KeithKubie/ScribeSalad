Hello
Hello, this is Adam Smith calling from Nobelprize.org,

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.390
the website of the Nobel Prize in Stockholm.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.040
Oh, hello.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.849
Congratulations on the award of the Nobel
Prize.

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.119
Thanks, thank you very much.

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:17.880
I'm just totally thrilled.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.150
Well, first of all, you're in Brazil I gather?

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.150
That's right, I'm at a conference.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.990
How did you hear the news of the award?

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.810
I heard the news when my wife called me at
about 7am this morning, Brazil time, because

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.220
she'd been called by the Associated Press,
and so that's how I heard.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.480
What was your first reaction on hearing from
her that you'd been awarded the prize?

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:48.489
Ah, well I was just incredibly excited and
thrilled, and of course your heart races,

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.530
and you say "Oh, can this be?

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.550
Can this be?"&nbsp;

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.610
My life .. [unclear] .. has been recognised,
I'm incredibly fortunate.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:02.840
And so I had that feeling of "Oh, what do
I do now?" because you have to decide am I

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.979
going to this meeting, do I have to get on
a plane and fly to California.

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.520
So there's lots of things that all of sudden
change when you get such exciting news and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.969
I'm incredibly happy about the recognition
of the field, especially of all the workers

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:25.929
and all the scientists at many places around
the world who have contributed to the effort.

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:29.710
Are you going to change your programme for
the day or are you just going to go to the

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.929
conference as usual?&nbsp;

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:32.950
&nbsp;
I can't go to the meeting right now.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.500
It's much better to talk to people like you
and try to explain what's so exciting about

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.500
this development.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.919
Really a great pleasure to speak to you, thank
you very much.

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:42.919
Thank you.

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:43.919
Have a good day.

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:44.919
Bye bye.

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.920
Bye.
