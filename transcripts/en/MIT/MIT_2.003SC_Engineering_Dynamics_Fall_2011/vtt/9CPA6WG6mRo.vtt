00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:24.990
PROFESSOR: Well let's see
if we can't get started.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.250
Everyone I trust can
hear me adequately.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.220
Welcome back.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.990
It's Tuesday.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.020
For those of you who are not
in my recitation section,

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.520
I'm Dave Gossard, and I'll
be your lecturer for the day.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.680
Professor Vandiver
is out of town.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.060
It looks like some of
you may be as well.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.575
We probably could have held this
at the gate at Logan Airport

00:00:55.575 --> 00:00:57.940
and done a little better.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.990
But be that as it
may, glad you came.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.030
This should be fun.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.412
Today we have a new topic
and a demonstration,

00:01:08.412 --> 00:01:11.230
a real physical system.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.890
So unless there are any
outstanding questions?

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.690
Anybody have any
questions or complaints

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.356
to address to Vicente?

00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:23.348
No.

00:01:23.348 --> 00:01:28.920
All right, hearing none let's
go ahead and get started then.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.990
Today the topic is multiple
degree of freedom systems.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.810
Now to date, with a
couple of exceptions,

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.240
all of the systems
that you've dealt with

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.360
had a single degree of freedom,
either a linear displacement

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.550
x or an angular
displacement theta.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.160
You know the concept
of equations of motion,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.420
or I should say the
equation of motion

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:06.750
and the notion of undamped
natural frequency.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.920
Well, today we're going to
generalize, if you will,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.640
to systems that have not one
but multiple degrees of freedom

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.030
and see how those
notions generalize.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.260
In particular, as
you might expect,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.750
the system that has
multiple degrees of freedom

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.460
has multiple natural
frequencies, also

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.000
known as eigenvalues as we
will explain here shortly.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.390
Multiple degrees
of freedom systems

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.200
have a new property,
a new characteristic

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.670
you haven't seen before.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.850
And that's what this
lecture is all about,

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.350
is to illustrate that to
you and demonstrate it.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.880
It's the notion
of natural modes,

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.590
also called eigenvectors.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.710
And then the general response
to initial conditions.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.370
So that is the plan for the day.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.220
And we'll start with this.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.290
This is kind of a
classic textbook

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.910
case, two springs, two masses.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.730
A straightforward extrapolation
of what you've done before.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.040
You've got a spring K1,
mass M1, spring K2, mass M2.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:40.420
And the displacements
are indicated

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:47.370
as shown there, X1 and X2.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.800
I want to hasten to point out
that the displacements we speak

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:01.890
of here are defined with respect
to the static equilibrium

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:02.520
position.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.560
This is a notion that Professor
Vandiver went over at least

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.140
once.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.020
And for those of you who've
forgotten it or weren't there

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.519
that day, I have for you a
reference, essentially reprised

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.530
that notion over there.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.215
So in the meantime,
let me press on.

00:04:27.215 --> 00:04:31.320
If you have any questions, we
can go back and cover that.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:41.760
But assuming you agree, let
me simply say you've got

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.915
two springs, two masses.

00:04:43.915 --> 00:04:46.720
The typical way we've
taught you to do

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.520
it is if you're
going to generate

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.270
the equations of motion
by the direct method,

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.890
you generate two free
body diagrams, the sum

00:04:53.890 --> 00:05:00.140
forces in the x direction
for each of the masses,

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.210
get f equals MA and
you'd get these.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.360
Conversely, you could
also do it by Legrange.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.690
You could generate
the expression

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.460
for the kinetic energy,
for the potential energy,

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.960
for the Legrangian, do this
Lagrange equation business,

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.050
and you'd get the same thing.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.310
But either way you do it,
what comes out the other side

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.830
looks like this.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:32.830
And it's not a bad exercise
for you to offline convince

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.610
yourself that this is right.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.930
Not right now, but in
the comfort and leisure

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:40.820
of another time.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.540
So there you have it.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.940
That's what the two equations
of motion would look like.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:09.740
Again, either by the direct
method or by Legrange,

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.850
you end up in the same
place, so to speak.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:29.730
And now for today, we haven't
asked you to do this much,

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.740
but let me simply say
the weapon of choice

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.230
for multiple degrees
of freedom system,

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.790
because there's a certain
repetitive quality to it,

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.240
matrix notation is preferred.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:51.450
In these equations over
here, written in matrix form

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:52.550
would look like this.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.410
And that looks like this.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.490
There's two matrices,
and let me hasten

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:57.490
to point out that this is
exactly this and nothing more.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.240
There's no magic, no
additional derivation.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.580
This is simply a restructuring,
and reorganization

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.810
of these equations.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.550
And this may seem
foreign to those

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:13.760
of you who have not had any
or very much linear algebra.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.150
Do not be dismayed.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.920
It is not a difficult
thing to learn.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:24.210
As you probably know, a matrix
multiplies by a vector--

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.290
or multiplying a
vector by a matrix--

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.660
is done with two hands.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:35.990
The first item for example
is M1 X1 dot plus 0.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:39.549
That gives you this
term right here.

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:44.630
Over here you get
X1 times K1 plus K2.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.530
That's this one.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:52.690
And here you have minus
K2 X2, that's that term.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:57.370
So matrix notation,
this becomes that.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:57.920
No problem.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.230
It's like a model train set.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.410
It's great.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.020
Everyone should
have one of these.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:24.230
All right, so what I would
like to do for our example here

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:39.240
is because we're going
to be doing some algebra,

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.895
for the express purpose of
simplifying the algebra let

00:09:43.895 --> 00:09:51.330
me consider a special case
where the masses are identical.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:56.040
And we can simply call
them M. And similarly,

00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:02.800
the springs are identical,
and we'll simply call them K.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:08.026
At that point, these
equations become simplified.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:41.610
That's just M, that's
just M. So this

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.330
is the problem we're
going to-- we're

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.680
going to tackle this problem
first, because as I say,

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.750
it simplifies the algebra.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:54.400
Now here is-- this
is not an assumption.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:11:07.800
This is a-- I would call
this more a mechanism

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.315
to get this job done here.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:23.222
Harmonic motion is
one where we assume

00:11:23.222 --> 00:11:41.300
that the masses oscillate
at the same frequency.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:28.490
So what this looks like is this.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:34.260
What we're basically saying
is that X1 is actually

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:43.330
equal-- X1 has
amplitude A-- whoa.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.930
I'm being attacked here
by the second board.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.340
Basically, the situation
here is that we're

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:05.590
assuming that both
of these masses

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:10.360
move-- I wouldn't call
it exactly together.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.149
They're not in
complete synchrony,

00:13:14.149 --> 00:13:15.440
as you'll see here in a moment.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.580
But what they are
is they're going

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.870
through a sinusoidal motion.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:25.880
And it is an oscillation
at the same frequency.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:31.260
Both of them are oscillating
at the same frequency.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.760
However, they differ
in their magnitudes.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.260
They are not the same magnitude.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:48.900
But that assumption right
there allows us to say this.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:19.500
If we differentiate those
twice, we get the following.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.920
That comes back out.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.331
Douglas, where's
that minus sign come?

00:14:37.331 --> 00:14:39.330
Can you-- first of all,
can everybody read that?

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.163
Can you guys read that
in the back row here?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.850
For example, this says that X1
double dot, if x1 is A1 cosine,

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:55.440
then X1 double dot
is A1 cosine preceded

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.080
by a minus omega squared.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.164
Where does that come from?

00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:01.579
AUDIENCE: The minus sign came
from when you differentiated

00:15:01.579 --> 00:15:02.850
the cosine in the first one.

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:03.720
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.040
And the cosine returns.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.160
And that's what you get.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.950
Well, here is, shall we say,
the heart of the matter.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:17.650
When you substitute
this into this--

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:27.970
let me call this-- I'll try not
to get too obsessive over this.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:33.590
But these are our
equations of motion.

00:15:33.590 --> 00:16:22.760
So when we-- you
get this, equals 0.

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:26.330
Excuse me.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.580
Many people, I think,
simply put a big 0 there,

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.565
but I'll do it properly.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.280
It's two zeros, if you will.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:55.480
And forgive me for
writing this out,

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.430
but I would like you
to be able to do this

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:04.930
by yourself, to recreate
this after the fact.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:09.784
This becomes-- dividing
and collecting terms.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:49.360
OK, anybody unclear about
how this is obtained?

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:49.860
Yes, ma'am.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.248
Emma.

00:17:51.248 --> 00:17:53.372
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the previous one.

00:17:53.372 --> 00:17:53.844
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:17:53.844 --> 00:17:55.969
AUDIENCE: If the second
term on the left hand side,

00:17:55.969 --> 00:17:58.559
should it also be
multiplied by A1 A2?

00:17:58.559 --> 00:17:59.600
PROFESSOR: Yes it should.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.720
Thank you very much.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.570
Oh, hang on.

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:09.496
Yes, thank you,
that's exactly right.

00:18:09.496 --> 00:18:10.412
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.780
PROFESSOR: Hang on a second.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:20.580
We're fighting the boards here.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.330
Let's see, one thing at a time.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:34.640
We've got A1, A2 cosine
[INAUDIBLE] minus phi equals.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.880
Now Emma, does that
take care of you?

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.380
Yeah?

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.020
And you said, Vicente?

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.270
AUDIENCE: Diagonal terms--
shouldn't there be a minus?

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.269
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry,
that's absolutely correct.

00:18:46.556 --> 00:18:47.055
Wonderful.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.446
So there we have it.

00:18:56.446 --> 00:18:57.720
Any other questions?

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.760
I hope I got it right.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.447
Yes sir.

00:19:00.447 --> 00:19:01.530
AUDIENCE: Are they plus K?

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:02.954
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry?

00:19:02.954 --> 00:19:04.190
AUDIENCE: Are they plus K?

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.150
PROFESSOR: Plus K?

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.800
No.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.510
They're minus.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.295
Yeah, why is that?

00:19:11.295 --> 00:19:12.610
Everybody see that?

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:23.590
This is a straight-- there's
less here than meets the eye.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:29.420
There's a straight segregation
collecting of terms.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:34.990
The minus got added to the
elements of the mass matrix,

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:36.990
but not to the K metrics.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:41.880
The K metrics goes
shows through as is.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:48.960
Now, the question on the
floor is what we do with this?

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.820
Can everybody appreciate
that-- get out

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:56.580
of the spring mass
business and look at this

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.760
from a math point of view?

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.050
Does everyone
appreciate that this

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:06.060
is a set of linear equations?

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:09.850
There's the old AX
equal B kind of thing.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:21.860
And if you recall, to solve,
what we're basically going

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.150
to do is solve for A1 and A2.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:26.830
That's the game
we're playing here.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:39.290
And if you recall from your math
course, the determinant of this

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.680
has got to equal 0.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.950
So let me simply repeat it here.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:21:06.940
The determinant of
has got to equal 0.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.370
And you recall, the determinant
is for at least the two

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:12.340
by two you can do it
by hand more or less.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:17.075
It's the cross products
with appropriate sign.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:29.390
And I'm sparing you
some algebra here,

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:33.150
but trust me when you do
this, this is what you get.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:52.780
M squared omega 4 minus
3KM omega squared, plus K2.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.760
That's it right here.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:22:02.040
This little guy-- oh, all right.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.690
I can't do that anymore.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:04.670
I know, it's this one.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:27.213
That is called the
characteristic equation.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.660
So here's the first answer.

00:23:10.162 --> 00:23:12.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
should that be K squared?

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:12.995
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry.

00:23:12.995 --> 00:23:15.520
That's a typo.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:20.697
That's simply K.

00:23:20.697 --> 00:23:22.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] K squared?

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:23.571
PROFESSOR: Or it's
K squared, rather.

00:23:23.571 --> 00:23:24.710
Sorry.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:25.210
Thank you.

00:23:32.473 --> 00:23:34.437
AUDIENCE: I think
in the above line,

00:23:34.437 --> 00:23:38.717
the determinant-- the upper
left-- should had a 2K.

00:23:38.717 --> 00:23:40.300
PROFESSOR: Oh, this
is 2K, absolutely.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:45.950
All right, 2K.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.550
Good enough?

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:50.250
All right, thank you.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:52.070
So let's send this to the top.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:24:05.070
So the roots of
the characteristic

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:06.846
are the natural frequencies.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.717
Let's do this this way.

00:24:58.247 --> 00:24:59.080
Did I do that right?

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.020
Yeah, plus or minus.

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:05.450
So the situation is that when
you apply the quadratic formula

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:10.040
to that characteristic equation
to find the values of omega

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.440
for which that
equation is satisfied,

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.970
those omegas that come out
are the natural frequencies.

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:20.540
They are the quantities we seek.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:26.160
And what that yields, as you
can see from the plus or minus

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.056
here, there are two of them.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.810
I'll write the whole
thing out here.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:58.880
And these are numerically.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.630
OK, everybody see that?

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:22.100
So here are our two
natural frequencies.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:26.485
Here's the first one-- excuse
me, that's not right either.

00:26:40.115 --> 00:26:40.865
That's the square.

00:26:54.540 --> 00:27:02.540
OK So these are our natural
frequencies, once again

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:06.940
for this special case
where the masses are equal

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.800
and the springs are equal.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.530
Anybody recognize
that number, 0.618,

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.920
for all you fuss budgets?

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:18.760
Ring any bells?

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.880
Any number freaks here?

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.960
No?

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.490
I heard it.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:26.370
That's it.

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:28.640
Exactly, nice job.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.000
The golden mean,
the golden ratio.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.870
Also, let me simply
say if there are--

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:40.670
as far as the number
of things-- if there

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:44.240
are n degrees of freedom.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.800
There are n natural frequencies.

00:27:59.569 --> 00:28:02.230
What else?

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:03.230
So that's that.

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:26.043
So now it's time to get to this
notion of the natural modes.

00:28:38.177 --> 00:28:40.010
Let me say, we've got
to go all the way back

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:41.250
to this set over here.

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:45.510
If you take the first row
of this matrix equation--

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:53.160
that's the first of the
equations of motion--

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:57.120
and you make that assumption of
the harmonic motion in there.

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.680
Does everybody see that?

00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:01.200
What we've done is we've
taken basically the first row

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.440
of that expression
right up there

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:08.620
and formed the amplitude
ratio A1 over A2.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:11.350
What we're doing is
we've found the omegas.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.500
You remember, just
review the bidding.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.670
Our original
assumption was harmonic

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:20.370
motion, that is to say
all the displacements are

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:24.720
moving in synchrony as it were.

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.060
The same sinusoidal
frequency, we've

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:31.310
just found what
frequencies those are.

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:34.450
There are two of them,
and they're right there.

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:38.710
Now we're after these guys.

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:41.960
Now we're after the
relative magnitudes

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:46.270
or the relative
amplitudes of A1 and A2.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:52.020
And we from one of the
equations isolated one of those.

00:30:52.020 --> 00:31:01.170
And let me just say, if
you plug these back in,

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:42.450
plug in the first one, you'll
get oddly enough 1.618,

00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:44.250
These amplitude ratios.

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:11.400
Are the so-called natural modes.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:16.060
And I think you can appreciate
that this is the first one,

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.855
and this is the second one.

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:31.300
Any questions so far?

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:32.680
Wonderful.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:33.370
Hearing none.

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:35.497
Yes ma'am, Sara?

00:32:35.497 --> 00:32:36.372
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:43.610
PROFESSOR: You see
this amplitude ratio.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:45.170
You saw how we got that.

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:48.450
You see that the right hand side
has got system parameter, Ks

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:50.380
and Ms, and stuff like that.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:54.530
But this is the ringer, omega.

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:58.090
This amplitude ratio
is expressed in part

00:32:58.090 --> 00:32:59.930
in terms of omega.

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:04.050
So what omega-- there's no
ambiguity as to Ks and Ms,

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:05.890
but what omega?

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:09.640
Well the answer is, when
we plug in this one,

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.040
you get this answer.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.530
When you plug-in this
one, you get this answer.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:19.060
So while we're at it-- Sara,
want to hazard a guess?

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:21.730
How many natural mode
do you think we've got?

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:22.420
Yeah, exactly.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:34.970
So you're going to
have one of these

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:36.970
for each degree of freedom.

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:45.420
Let me just point out a
couple of elements here,

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:48.070
and then I'll show you a
demonstration because we

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:49.295
have to have some fun today.

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:58.900
These are point of informations.

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:06.460
They're ratios, not
absolute magnitudes.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.219
That's number one.

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:16.770
The second is-- I already told
you, they got the same number.

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:24.699
OK, each natural
mode is associated

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:38.330
with a particular
natural frequency.

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:39.710
This one goes with that one.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:42.800
This one goes with that one.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:54.780
And once again, they're
associated with-- yeah,

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:56.139
let me say that.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.000
I need another board.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.490
Let's just go over here.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:37:13.900
So in a sense--
this is decouple.

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:40.106
Decouple essentially into
independent subsystems.

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:53.020
So in general, what the system's
response looks like is--

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:55.870
I'm talking about the
one in front of us here.

00:38:55.870 --> 00:39:03.100
This special case, where the
masses and springs are equal.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.175
I think there's a
minus sign in here.

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:27.932
Does this come up?

00:39:27.932 --> 00:39:28.432
Wonderful.

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:07.798
That's it.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.360
Does everybody see that?

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.070
Yes, sir.

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:17.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.892
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry?

00:40:18.892 --> 00:40:21.720
AUDIENCE: What does it say
under that first bullet point?

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:22.390
PROFESSOR: Here?

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:23.110
AUDIENCE: These
describe the situation.

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:24.734
PROFESSOR: These
describe the situation

00:40:24.734 --> 00:40:29.340
in which the entire
system is oscillating at.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.880
It's the second bullet here.

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:38.650
Thank you.

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:44.860
AUDIENCE: At what?

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.026
PROFESSOR: At one frequency.

00:40:48.947 --> 00:40:51.030
Sorry, I'm just getting a
little tired of writing.

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:10.670
So, any other questions,
problems, complaints?

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:11.655
All right.

00:41:11.655 --> 00:41:11.980
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:13.032
PROFESSOR: Yes, sir.

00:41:13.032 --> 00:41:13.907
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:21.580
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.450
Then, let's see.

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:26.100
Then there's a
mistake right here.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:28.370
Thank you.

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:32.060
Yeah, because that's
the way it came out.

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:40.030
When you plug omega 2
having this value into here,

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:42.455
the amplitude ratio
comes out minus.

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:47.216
Fair enough?

00:41:49.739 --> 00:41:51.030
It threw me there for a minute.

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:56.000
I thought you were going to say,
why is the minus sign is there,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:05.860
rather than you could have
had minus 1.618 and plus 1.

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:10.740
And the answer is no reason,
because these are ratios.

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:11.903
Yeah, Kaitlin?

00:42:11.903 --> 00:42:15.525
AUDIENCE: But shouldn't-- when
we go back and look at what you

00:42:15.525 --> 00:42:18.665
wrote down, it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:18.665 --> 00:42:21.580
I don't understand
how that [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.055
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry, say again?

00:42:23.055 --> 00:42:24.030
AUDIENCE: Never mind.

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:24.821
PROFESSOR: Find it?

00:42:24.821 --> 00:42:28.580
Yeah, they're ratios, It's
just as simple as that.

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:32.080
So you multiply them by any
number and it still works.

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:35.750
I'll actually show
you here in a second.

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:38.020
At least, I believe
that's the case.

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.510
We'll just see here in a second.

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:40.580
OK, questions?

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:42.130
Comments?

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:43.850
All right.

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:45.760
Now is the time.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:50.370
Could I bring up
the side board here?

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:56.180
Let me show you--
anybody here taken 2086?

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:56.680
Wonderful.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:57.640
I've got one person?

00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:58.680
Great.

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:03.597
Anyway, I believe in 2086,
don't they teach you MATLAB?

00:43:03.597 --> 00:43:04.930
Isn't that the weapon of choice?

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:09.202
OK, that's the program
I'm using here, MATLAB.

00:43:09.202 --> 00:43:10.910
For those of you who
haven't seen it yet,

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:13.052
it is definitely a mixed bag.

00:43:13.052 --> 00:43:14.510
I don't know how
you feel about it.

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:17.840
It's very-- yeah--
it's very powerful.

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.720
It stands for Matrix Laboratory.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.490
It was written, I don't
know, 20, 30 years ago here,

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:27.770
I believe, at MIT by people who
were into matrices, into matrix

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:28.310
algebra.

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:31.310
And it's kind of
command line oriented.

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:33.550
The good news,
it's very powerful.

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:35.890
Whatever you want to do,
you can do in MATLAB.

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:39.820
The bad news is, the
user interface stinks.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:41.840
The language is very
difficult to learn.

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.880
It's even harder to remember.

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.550
So with that
rousing endorsement,

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:53.430
let me show you
what we've got here.

00:43:53.430 --> 00:44:01.550
This is a program I've-- is
that font readable by you guys?

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:02.540
No?

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:03.323
No?

00:44:03.323 --> 00:44:05.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.512
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry?

00:44:07.512 --> 00:44:10.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:11.060
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:16.015
Well, I believe I can--
here we go, fonts.

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:21.410
Upping the fonts is
kind of a mixed bag,

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:28.330
because you get bigger
letters but they're.

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:31.430
OK, how's that?

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:34.230
So here's the situation.

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:35.700
This is a MATLAB program.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:39.240
And I'll explain to you
what it does as we go.

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:42.060
Let me see if my little
cursor-- my cursor's here,

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:43.080
but I can't see it.

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.490
All right, here's the
system parameters.

00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:47.940
Once again, we're doing
a simple spring mass--

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:52.240
this simplified spring mass
system, exactly the one

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:55.040
we've done here.

00:44:55.040 --> 00:45:02.120
When I wrote it, you'll see I
generalized it to do this guy.

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.780
So we got M1 and M2, K1 and K2.

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:09.400
But if you'll notice, you see
here their values are equal.

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.560
We've got the mass
at one kilogram each.

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:17.240
And we've got 10 newtons per
meter on each of the springs.

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:20.090
Everybody appreciate that
this system's numbers

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:25.690
that we're putting in here
match our case here, K over M?

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:26.540
OK.

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:28.990
And you can see
here, we've defined--

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:31.390
and again, let me
just say I'm not

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:34.365
trying to sell you on MATLAB.

00:45:34.365 --> 00:45:36.240
I don't want to leave
you with the impression

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.835
that we expect you to be
able to instantly become

00:45:39.835 --> 00:45:41.260
a user of MATLAB.

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:47.580
This is simply to illustrate
the point of the lecture here.

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:50.110
Here is the M,
the system matrix.

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:51.910
There's the K matrix.

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:57.850
And I'll show you the eigenvalue
and eigenvector thing later.

00:45:57.850 --> 00:45:59.867
But let me-- take
my word for it.

00:45:59.867 --> 00:46:00.450
See this here?

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:08.910
Ode45 is a cryptic allusion
to the Runge-Kutta algorithm,

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:16.040
fourth order Runge-Kutta that
is the workhorse for integrating

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:18.380
differential equations.

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:21.000
And so let me just run this.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.690
And what I've got here
is, here's the point

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:27.375
I wanted you to get
here, because I'll

00:46:27.375 --> 00:46:29.800
bet you can't see
that cursor either.

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:32.410
Yes, anyway, see
this right here?

00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:37.342
tspan is the time scale and
the time step, defined up here.

00:46:37.342 --> 00:46:39.300
But these are basically
the initial conditions.

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:40.260
See it here?

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:44.260
X1, X1 dot, X2, X2 dot.

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.390
So here's the first one.

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:49.770
This is a 0.618 is for the X1.

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:53.720
And 1 is for X2.

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:55.880
Everybody appreciate that?

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:57.245
Got it?

00:46:57.245 --> 00:46:57.745
OK.

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:04.060
If these are the initial
conditions, what I've done,

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:07.260
I have artfully chosen
the initial conditions

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:10.575
to have the same ratio.

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:16.590
What do you expect
is going to happen?

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:18.940
When I turn this thing--
I've got a simulation here.

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:20.700
I'm going to run this,
and you're actually

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:22.177
going to see it.

00:47:22.177 --> 00:47:23.760
What do you think
you're going to see?

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:29.880
It's a two spring,
two mass system.

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:32.620
What I've done is I've
displaced the two masses.

00:47:36.805 --> 00:47:38.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:39.770
PROFESSOR: They'll certainly
have an amplitude, because I'm

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:40.910
putting it in there.

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:43.780
That's the initial condition.

00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:49.255
The question is, what frequency
you think they'll oscillate at?

00:47:49.255 --> 00:47:50.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:51.177
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:47:51.177 --> 00:47:53.037
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:53.037 --> 00:47:54.620
PROFESSOR: Each of
them will oscillate

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:56.420
with the same frequency,
for sure, but what

00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:57.670
do you think it's going to be?

00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:59.060
AUDIENCE: That one.

00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:01.080
PROFESSOR: It's
going to be that one.

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:03.550
So off we go.

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:09.705
So let us hope that yours
truly's program worked.

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:17.540
Here we go.

00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:19.860
Oh, look at that.

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:21.940
[INAUDIBLE], please
interpret that for me.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:24.700
What do you see there?

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:25.770
Hang on a second.

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:27.980
Let me blow it up
so you can see it.

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:30.470
Ooh, isn't that pretty?

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:38.483
And I believe the blue is
X1 and the green is X2.

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:43.994
See?

00:48:43.994 --> 00:48:44.660
Everybody agree?

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:46.680
Everyone appreciate
what's going on?

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:51.440
You pull them both at
slightly different--

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:57.080
you basically used
the first natural mode

00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.680
as the initial condition.

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.189
And sure enough, they
oscillate together.

00:49:01.189 --> 00:49:02.730
They oscillate at
the same frequency.

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:06.030
They oscillate at
that frequency.

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:08.490
Let me just see--
I just want to make

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:11.740
sure we get the full
value out of this thing.

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:14.210
Well, of course you
can't see it anymore

00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:17.139
because our numbers are so big.

00:49:17.139 --> 00:49:17.930
Well, that's great.

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:21.760
Anyway, take my word for
it at-- oh, here it is.

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:27.150
The period for the first
natural frequency-- or I

00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:35.900
guess it's the second--
it should be like 1.2.

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:36.880
Or is it 3?

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:40.520
Yeah, I'm sorry,
the period is 3.2.

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:42.005
And sure enough, there it is.

00:49:42.005 --> 00:49:45.291
It's about 3.

00:49:45.291 --> 00:49:45.790
3.2.

00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:47.380
Fabulous.

00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:48.590
Everybody got it?

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:51.570
OK, now watch closely.

00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:52.855
Let me see if I can do this.

00:49:52.855 --> 00:49:55.210
This requires a little
dexterity, which

00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:58.770
is always a short supply here.

00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:01.000
I have to hit this and this.

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:08.720
Make sense?

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.190
That's what it
actually looks like.

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:15.360
They're both oscillating at
the same natural frequency,

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.300
going up and down together.

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:20.310
But they have
different amplitudes.

00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:23.280
So one's bigger than the other.

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.920
So that's what it looks like.

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:26.000
Questions?

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.590
Christina, you good?

00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:30.480
Clear enough?

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:32.190
Wonderful.

00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:38.800
So let's go to our program.

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:46.730
And instead of that set
of initial conditions,

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:48.725
we'll do the other.

00:50:48.725 --> 00:50:49.600
Read them to us here.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.170
What are the initial
conditions here?

00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:57.110
AUDIENCE: It's 1.618.

00:50:57.110 --> 00:50:58.940
PROFESSOR: That's
right, it's this guy.

00:50:58.940 --> 00:50:59.731
AUDIENCE: That guy.

00:50:59.731 --> 00:51:02.360
PROFESSOR: It's this guy.

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.020
It's this ratio.

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:06.730
So I basically
arbitrarily chose, is it

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:07.585
the negative first?

00:51:07.585 --> 00:51:08.084
No.

00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:14.870
I chose that one
over there, 1.618.

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:17.350
And then a minus 1
for the second one.

00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:18.310
Fair enough?

00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:19.560
OK, there it goes.

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.880
We've got to save it
and make sure we got it.

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:26.440
So again, you got a clue
what's going to happen here?

00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:32.260
Here we go.

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:32.760
Boom.

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:36.720
Look at that.

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:39.400
What's going on there?

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:42.260
Yikes.

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:43.400
Explain me.

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:44.870
Is that good, bad, indifferent?

00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:45.500
Is it right?

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:46.562
Wrong?

00:51:46.562 --> 00:51:47.978
AUDIENCE: The way
the system acts,

00:51:47.978 --> 00:51:49.350
it has a higher frequency.

00:51:49.350 --> 00:51:51.080
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:51.640
Two things.

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.520
One is, they're out of phase.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:54.680
They're doing this.

00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:56.490
One's going this
way, and the other's

00:51:56.490 --> 00:51:58.780
going the other at
different amplitudes

00:51:58.780 --> 00:51:59.920
but the same frequency.

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:03.091
But the frequency in question
is higher than the previous.

00:52:03.091 --> 00:52:04.590
AUDIENCE: Why are
they out of phase?

00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:05.465
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry?

00:52:05.465 --> 00:52:07.420
AUDIENCE: Why are they
opposite of each other?

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:09.794
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE], why
are they opposite each other?

00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:15.630
Because we made them that way.

00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:19.545
We said, that's the
initial condition.

00:52:19.545 --> 00:52:20.420
Does that make sense?

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:24.330
That minus sign does.

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:31.370
One starts out,
and one starts in.

00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:32.659
And they do that.

00:52:32.659 --> 00:52:33.200
Clear enough?

00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:39.110
Now what's going to happen
if we plain just choose

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:42.470
any old initial condition?

00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:44.470
These were special.

00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:47.620
We worked like a dog
to compute these,

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:52.410
so that the system would
decouple in that way.

00:52:52.410 --> 00:53:01.640
So what if we-- now
let me put that back.

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:04.290
Now look at this one.

00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:05.450
All right, look at that.

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:10.263
Read that to me.

00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:14.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:15.216
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:53:15.216 --> 00:53:19.320
So that says the initial
condition for the first mass

00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:21.940
is 1 and whatever that is.

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:23.780
One whatever that is.

00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:26.450
The second masses'
initial condition is half

00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:28.150
that in the same direction.

00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:29.199
Both positive.

00:53:29.199 --> 00:53:30.990
So Christina, they're
going to go together.

00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:37.170
But [INAUDIBLE],
at what frequency?

00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:40.450
Any idea what it's
going to look like?

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:43.140
If you do, you're a
better man than I,

00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:48.410
because what you're going
to see here is that.

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:51.040
It's this thing right here.

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:54.210
It's that expression
right there.

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:57.140
And here's what it looks like.

00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:04.570
Did I stop the--
oh, wait a minute.

00:54:04.570 --> 00:54:07.786
Did I ever show you that before?

00:54:07.786 --> 00:54:09.410
I think I forgot to
show you the other.

00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:10.720
Anyway, not to worry.

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:14.130
Hang on a second.

00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:16.162
I've got to stop this guy.

00:54:16.162 --> 00:54:18.560
First I have to find my finger.

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:23.050
There it goes.

00:54:23.050 --> 00:54:24.930
That's the previous case.

00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:29.140
When they're out of phase,
different magnitudes,

00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:30.660
going in opposite directions.

00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:34.060
And you can see, they're
going at a higher frequency

00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:35.620
than before.

00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:36.230
Make sense?

00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:45.100
So now we are-- just to
refresh your memory--

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:48.410
now we're going for the
third case, in which there's

00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:49.150
nothing special.

00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:54.650
We just picked a couple
of initial conditions

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:57.960
out of a hat.

00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:59.800
And here we go.

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.698
Oops, I think not.

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:10.070
I think that's
the previous case.

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:12.210
So let's go here.

00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:15.230
This is another wonderful
thing about MATLAB

00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:19.890
is nothing happens
until you save it.

00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:24.435
So we were just running
the previous case.

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:28.130
Nasty.

00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:28.900
Look at this.

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:33.765
All right, can
everybody see that?

00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:40.310
If you can interpret this,
you're smarter than I am.

00:55:40.310 --> 00:55:46.710
But what this is, this is simply
this expression over here.

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:49.640
It's this expression
for just some arbitrary

00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:50.680
initial condition.

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:53.240
Do you see that that
behavior though?

00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:55.780
Each of them, they're
going together kind of,

00:55:55.780 --> 00:56:00.954
but they-- anyway, watch this.

00:56:00.954 --> 00:56:02.870
Here's what the simulation
of that looks like.

00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:18.820
What the heck is that?

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:20.330
Well anyway, the
point of the story

00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:23.210
is that multiple
degrees of freedom

00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:27.305
system in general's response
can be arbitrarily complicated.

00:56:27.305 --> 00:56:28.680
It's not arbitrarily
complicated,

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:31.090
but pretty complicated.

00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:34.960
You'll get, in general if it's
an nth order system, if you

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:37.490
don't know anything
about the worst case,

00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:40.700
you'll see four
frequencies in there.

00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:44.810
And they're all mixed together
in some mystical way that's

00:56:44.810 --> 00:56:46.270
unknown to you.

00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:47.130
Fair enough?

00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:54.040
And it's only when you reach the
natural modes that you actually

00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:58.500
find out what is going on here.

00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:03.570
Well now I have to turn
your attention to this guy.

00:57:03.570 --> 00:57:11.710
This is made by Professor
Vandiver's machinist,

00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:15.000
a perfect example of
a second order system.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.170
And I bring it to
your attention here

00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:20.380
for two-- at the end of the
day what we're going to do

00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:25.000
is I'm going to demonstrate
exactly what I just

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.580
did for the textbook
case, the textbook system.

00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:33.240
I want to demonstrate exactly
the same thing for this guy,

00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:35.920
only this is a real system.

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.180
Very nice.

00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:39.060
We have a steel rod.

00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:40.810
It must be a half
inch in diameter.

00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:43.360
The whole thing
weighs several pounds.

00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:48.715
These sliding masses are right
circular cylinders with a hole

00:57:48.715 --> 00:57:49.590
drilled through them.

00:57:49.590 --> 00:57:54.002
It's ever so slightly
larger than these here.

00:57:54.002 --> 00:57:55.210
They're of different lengths.

00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:56.210
They're made of brass.

00:57:56.210 --> 00:58:00.010
They're serious masses.

00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:02.350
And the springs,
which extend from here

00:58:02.350 --> 00:58:07.815
to here, and from here to
here are wound on a lathe,

00:58:07.815 --> 00:58:09.930
and attached, and so forth.

00:58:09.930 --> 00:58:10.960
Pretty, no?

00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:16.100
Now look right off the bat.

00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:18.685
Did you see how
that thing operates?

00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:33.270
Would you agree you have some
complicated behavior here?

00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:40.290
Now also would you agree
that this is it like that?

00:58:40.290 --> 00:58:42.820
Everybody see that?

00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:45.410
Before we go too far, this
is a mixed message here.

00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:51.120
[INAUDIBLE], is this
exactly like that?

00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:56.665
In what way is it
similar to that?

00:58:56.665 --> 00:58:57.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:05.070
PROFESSOR: Well, what is clear
is that you've got two springs

00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:07.310
and you've got two masses.

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:10.044
About that there is
very little argument.

00:59:10.044 --> 00:59:10.960
AUDIENCE: It's damped.

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:11.990
PROFESSOR: It's damped.

00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:13.410
Can everybody see that?

00:59:13.410 --> 00:59:15.870
How does [INAUDIBLE]
know that it's damped?

00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:20.260
How's he know it's damped?

00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:23.972
I mean, that's just a wild
guess on his part, but.

00:59:23.972 --> 00:59:25.950
AUDIENCE: You can hear
it, and it slows down.

00:59:25.950 --> 00:59:27.010
And it slows down.

00:59:27.010 --> 00:59:33.170
This is the most important
part is that it stops.

00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:37.984
Eventually if you come back
in a minute or two, it's done.

00:59:37.984 --> 00:59:39.400
PROFESSOR: All
right, [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:40.220
You're on a roll.

00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:42.060
There's definitely
damping there.

00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:44.669
What kind of damping?

00:59:44.669 --> 00:59:45.927
AUDIENCE: Friction.

00:59:45.927 --> 00:59:47.010
PROFESSOR: Friction, yeah.

00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:51.890
Does that have another
name that you can think of?

00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:54.670
It's definitely friction.

00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:57.070
What it's not is
viscous friction.

00:59:57.070 --> 01:00:04.040
What it is not is a damper or
a dashpot which we've shown you

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:13.220
before with the ideal expression
that generate a force that

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:17.670
opposes the-- generation of an
opposing force that's linearly

01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:19.930
proportional to the velocity.

01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:21.610
What's going on
here, do you think?

01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:27.880
What kind of damping
do you think?

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:29.680
It's called Coulomb.

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:31.390
This is called Coulomb damping.

01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:33.110
And this is a digression.

01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:37.760
Now we're on the part where this
is really-- everything that's

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.090
on the board is what I
wanted you to really come

01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:41.990
away from today with.

01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:44.375
So now we're out
kind of in the, I

01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:47.380
would call it the
winging it area

01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:53.750
right here, because this
is the part where I simply

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:54.970
had fun with the demo.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.920
This is viscous.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.160
And this has got the
symbol-- well anyway,

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:09.450
this is what it looks like.

01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:12.570
And this is the
force of the damper.

01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:13.440
We'll call it B.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.640
And this is the velocity.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.025
And this is for constant
of proportionality B.

01:01:20.025 --> 01:01:25.880
And it has this little
symbol, like that.

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:31.140
And when equations of motion
are solved that contain that,

01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:32.765
the response looks like this.

01:01:48.310 --> 01:02:05.950
What we're talking about
here, the force put out

01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:11.460
is a constant.

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:14.500
That just comes
from the sliding.

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:18.590
And what it generates are
distinctly non-linear equations

01:02:18.590 --> 01:02:19.930
of motion.

01:02:19.930 --> 01:02:24.020
And what you get here is you
get this kind of behavior.

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:30.250
If you really looked
at it, what you'll see

01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:33.860
is there's definitely
damping for large motions

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:38.260
when the inertial forces and
so forth are large compared

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:40.290
to the friction forces.

01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:44.460
It'll look a lot like
conventional viscous damping.

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:47.000
It's just that when
motions get really small,

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.630
and the forces get down there
to on the order of this,

01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:56.320
all a sudden you'll see on
one cycle it'll just stop.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:01.260
And were you up here
where you could see,

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:04.150
or if we had a closeup of this--
you can't see it, but just

01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:06.770
watch this thing stop.

01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:07.300
Right there.

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:08.370
Do you see that?

01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:10.870
That's a little hard for you
to see from there, but watch.

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:17.595
Anyway, were you up
here, you'd see this.

01:03:17.595 --> 01:03:20.430
That's what we're looking at.

01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:23.370
Well here we go.

01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:24.920
I need some help here.

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:29.760
Who's in a volunteering
frame of mind?

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.580
Amy, all right.

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:34.160
I appreciate the help here.

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.420
Here's what I want to do.

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:38.990
We just blew out some
wonderful theory.

01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:42.410
All this is just
solid as a rock.

01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:43.656
Yes, sir.

01:03:43.656 --> 01:03:45.833
AUDIENCE: For the Coulomb
friction, is that a linear

01:03:45.833 --> 01:03:46.332
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:03:46.332 --> 01:03:47.230
Or is it still exponential?

01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:48.240
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry?

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.250
Oh, no.

01:03:51.850 --> 01:03:54.510
If I'm not mistaken, I
didn't really look this up,

01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:56.960
but I believe it's linear.

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.857
I'd have to-- take that
with a grain of salt,

01:03:58.857 --> 01:03:59.940
but I believe it's linear.

01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:05.830
Yes, Amy, here's the situation.

01:04:05.830 --> 01:04:07.650
We have all this
marvelous theory.

01:04:07.650 --> 01:04:13.810
My goal is to-- and we have this
fabulous demo apparatus, though

01:04:13.810 --> 01:04:15.680
inherited.

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:19.430
And what I'd like to do-- oh,
and we have computational means

01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:21.560
to.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.310
And in fact, we just went
through the exercise.

01:04:24.310 --> 01:04:26.480
We already know those
same equations that

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.340
work for this work for this.

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:30.270
Those are general.

01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:33.570
However, it's not my
piece of apparatus.

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:39.980
And well, here's the deal,
what are the Ms and Ks.

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:46.910
What are the values of-- I need
M1, K1, M2, K2 to put into the.

01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:48.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:50.560
PROFESSOR: Yeah, Yeah.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.641
That's what I'd like
to do is I'd like to.

01:04:52.641 --> 01:04:54.182
AUDIENCE: Do I have
to just determine

01:04:54.182 --> 01:04:55.160
the it by looking at it?

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.201
PROFESSOR: Oh no, no, no.

01:04:56.201 --> 01:04:56.940
No, no.

01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:59.530
AUDIENCE: I'm not that good.

01:04:59.530 --> 01:05:01.060
PROFESSOR: You're my assistant.

01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:03.170
I guess the question
is, how would

01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:05.930
you-- and I've got
to tell you, that's

01:05:05.930 --> 01:05:07.250
the math part of a program.

01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:09.640
Now we're in the engineering
part of the program,

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:12.930
because somebody gave you
a real live demo apparatus.

01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:16.600
Works like crazy, or appears to.

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.610
And I'd love to take
advantage of it,

01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:20.680
but I don't know
any of the numbers.

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:22.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:24.720
PROFESSOR: No.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:27.561
That's the constraint
I'm operating on.

01:05:27.561 --> 01:05:28.560
It doesn't belong to me.

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:30.200
I mean, I could take it apart.

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.580
That's an absolutely
appropriate thing to do.

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:34.020
I would have liked to.

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.430
It would be easier if you could.

01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:38.690
You just go, take a
screwdriver to it.

01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:42.630
Here, put this on there
and pull this out.

01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:45.950
I didn't have the luxury
of any of that, so what's

01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:49.050
your next best suggestion?

01:05:49.050 --> 01:05:51.270
Nice suggestion, but no cigar.

01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:52.325
I'm sorry?

01:05:52.325 --> 01:05:54.491
AUDIENCE: Take it apart
anyway, put it back together

01:05:54.491 --> 01:05:55.812
before the person notices.

01:05:55.812 --> 01:05:56.170
PROFESSOR: Well yeah.

01:05:56.170 --> 01:05:56.930
Yeah, no.

01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:57.600
That's fudging.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:00.890
Yeah, they notice.

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:03.860
Have you ever taken
apart anything made

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:07.210
in modern manufacturing method?

01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:10.120
Oh, it's good because you
can't put them back together.

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.240
They're assembled by machine.

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:15.780
And once upon a time you
could disassemble one

01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:19.270
and reassemble things
without detection.

01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:21.560
But anymore, once
you take them apart,

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.380
it's wicked hard to
get them back together.

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:25.080
OK, the floor is open.

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:26.954
I need another suggestion.

01:06:26.954 --> 01:06:30.670
What are you going to do?

01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:33.316
AUDIENCE: Do you need to
know the exact K and M,

01:06:33.316 --> 01:06:35.040
or do you just
[INAUDIBLE] another ratio?

01:06:36.892 --> 01:06:38.350
PROFESSOR: I thought
you were going

01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:42.970
to-- I need to know M or
K. I need to know them all.

01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:45.280
AUDIENCE: Do you know
the density of the--

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.030
PROFESSOR: I was going
to say, but I don't

01:06:47.030 --> 01:06:49.800
need to know anything exactly.

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:53.280
All I need to know is as good a
guess as you can come up with.

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:54.689
It's all an estimate.

01:06:54.689 --> 01:06:57.034
AUDIENCE: If you know the
density of the material,

01:06:57.034 --> 01:06:59.379
you can easily work
up [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:59.379 --> 01:07:01.730
I'm assuming you're
about [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:04.300
PROFESSOR: Oh
absolutely, absolutely.

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:05.708
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:05.708 --> 01:07:06.583
PROFESSOR: Wonderful.

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:11.880
Absolutely.

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:14.990
She hit the jackpot,
rang the magic buzzer.

01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:17.970
That's exactly what I did.

01:07:17.970 --> 01:07:21.050
Here's a little crummy sketch.

01:07:21.050 --> 01:07:23.770
Oh wait, you can't see that.

01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:27.122
Anyway, these are right circular
cylinders with holes in them.

01:07:27.122 --> 01:07:28.830
And they've got
measurements beside them.

01:07:28.830 --> 01:07:31.190
I can tell you, this
is 75 millimeters.

01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:34.520
This is 35 millimeters.

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:40.360
This one is 37 millimeters long.

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:41.970
So I did that.

01:07:41.970 --> 01:07:42.650
That's great.

01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:44.800
That's an excellent suggestion.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:53.910
And after I did exactly that,
I won't write out the formula.

01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:56.220
You know area, and
volume, and all of that.

01:07:59.992 --> 01:08:01.615
Let me get you the
right order here.

01:08:05.970 --> 01:08:25.859
M1 is 0.2929, and M2 is 0.5938.

01:08:25.859 --> 01:08:27.359
Everybody got that?

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:31.180
This was obtained by taking
a ruler to these things,

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:34.580
taking diameters, lengths,
and diameters of holes,

01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:39.682
multiply them times the density
of brass taken out of the book.

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:42.069
Do you believe that?

01:08:42.069 --> 01:08:43.766
Do you believe that number?

01:08:49.479 --> 01:08:51.279
Well, you're a trusting soul.

01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:52.399
I don't.

01:08:52.399 --> 01:08:55.790
To me, I believe that number.

01:08:55.790 --> 01:08:58.010
This was done with a ruler.

01:08:58.010 --> 01:09:00.800
The little millimeter thingies.

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:06.510
So I just say, don't fall in
the trap of false precision.

01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:08.069
OK Amy, you're on a roll.

01:09:08.069 --> 01:09:10.220
We've got the masses.

01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:11.413
What now?

01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:13.310
AUDIENCE: Free body diagram.

01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:14.854
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
we got all that.

01:09:14.854 --> 01:09:16.187
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you've got that.

01:09:16.187 --> 01:09:18.869
But then what you can
do for the spring,

01:09:18.869 --> 01:09:21.781
the forces of the
spring when static.

01:09:21.781 --> 01:09:22.364
Don't move it.

01:09:22.364 --> 01:09:24.854
Don't move it.

01:09:24.854 --> 01:09:26.850
So take the top mast.

01:09:26.850 --> 01:09:28.505
It's not moving,
which means that you

01:09:28.505 --> 01:09:30.880
know that the force going
upwards-- which is the spring--

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:36.280
is equal to the force going
downward, which is [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:38.670
So you can measure
the displacement

01:09:38.670 --> 01:09:41.892
from the start of the spring
to the bottom of the spring.

01:09:41.892 --> 01:09:44.160
Do you know the natural
length of the spring?

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.899
PROFESSOR: No Anyway,
what I was going to say

01:09:46.899 --> 01:09:49.160
is, excellent idea.

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.149
Can't do it.

01:09:51.149 --> 01:09:54.640
But what Amy was
basically saying is,

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.700
you know the masses now.

01:09:56.700 --> 01:10:01.220
Why not simply take
from that expression

01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:05.252
right there, MH over K, right?

01:10:05.252 --> 01:10:06.460
What's the problem with that?

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:07.001
How about it?

01:10:07.001 --> 01:10:10.562
Devin, how come I can't do that?

01:10:10.562 --> 01:10:12.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:15.645
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I really don't
know the no load position.

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.610
Is that it, Amy?

01:10:20.610 --> 01:10:23.430
Right there?

01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:23.930
Maybe.

01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:31.460
Devin, you're the one
that suggested it.

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:35.630
Are those the no load
positions of the masses?

01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:37.060
And if not, why not?

01:10:39.670 --> 01:10:41.590
I did mean to give
you a clue there.

01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:42.300
Yeah, Nick?

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:44.550
AUDIENCE: It can't be because
there's static friction.

01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:47.220
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:52.090
So Nick, you brought it up.

01:10:52.090 --> 01:10:53.005
What's that number?

01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:59.400
You don't know that either.

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.040
No.

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.250
Like I said, Amy, nice idea.

01:11:03.250 --> 01:11:06.050
No cigar.

01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:06.710
What else?

01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:08.980
We're running out of time?

01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:10.790
Here we go, Douglas.

01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:13.039
AUDIENCE: Could you
displace each mast a certain

01:11:13.039 --> 01:11:14.622
[INAUDIBLE], and
then measure the time

01:11:14.622 --> 01:11:17.790
it takes for them to stop
and get the damping ratio?

01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:19.200
PROFESSOR: Hit
the damping ratio.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:21.990
Well, I'll tell you what--
you want to say that again?

01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:26.340
He said displace one or
both count oscillations

01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:27.650
and get the damping ratio.

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:28.340
Nick?

01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:30.840
AUDIENCE: Do we have anything
like a force gauge or a spring

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:31.339
scale?

01:11:31.339 --> 01:11:34.060
PROFESSOR: No.

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:36.790
This is my living room
I'm talking-- or my study.

01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:40.896
Anyway, Douglas said-- I
forgot what you said now.

01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:41.770
He said-- oh, I know.

01:11:41.770 --> 01:11:44.490
You said, displace it and
count the oscillations.

01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:46.550
Get the damping ratio.

01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:51.250
First off, the damping ratio is
no help, even if we did get it.

01:11:51.250 --> 01:11:55.420
And the only formula for
which we've ever given you--

01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:57.060
the only formula
we've ever given

01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:00.480
you to do that with pertains
to this kind of friction, which

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.950
is not present.

01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:03.720
No cigar.

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:05.970
Nick says, how
about force gauge?

01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:09.000
Now, don't have it.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:13.988
PROFESSOR: Yeah, we are.

01:12:13.988 --> 01:12:16.844
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
displace the other one

01:12:16.844 --> 01:12:18.010
and then find the frequency.

01:12:18.010 --> 01:12:20.130
PROFESSOR: Oh, what's your name?

01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:21.360
Sean?

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:22.223
Or John?

01:12:22.223 --> 01:12:23.682
AUDIENCE: Sean.

01:12:23.682 --> 01:12:24.890
PROFESSOR: Say that out loud.

01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:28.148
Say it loud enough that
Devin can hear you.

01:12:28.148 --> 01:12:29.964
AUDIENCE: You hold
the first mass,

01:12:29.964 --> 01:12:31.780
and then you displace
the second one.

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:32.571
PROFESSOR: Hang on.

01:12:32.571 --> 01:12:36.210
He says, hold the first mass
like this set screw right here.

01:12:39.130 --> 01:12:40.070
And?

01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:43.830
AUDIENCE: And then displace
the other one then.

01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:45.345
PROFESSOR: Like that?

01:12:45.345 --> 01:12:47.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:51.390
PROFESSOR: Actually,
to answer your question

01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:55.720
Nick, the only instrument
I have is a clock.

01:13:00.502 --> 01:13:01.210
Hang on a second.

01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:05.890
Here it is.

01:13:05.890 --> 01:13:07.880
Of course, this is the
big task is finding it.

01:13:11.338 --> 01:13:12.254
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:24.877 --> 01:13:27.210
PROFESSOR: Count to 10,
remember like Vandiver told you.

01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:29.770
Skip 1, 1, 2, 3, count to 10.

01:13:29.770 --> 01:13:31.250
Stop.

01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:34.190
Excellent, excellent, excellent.

01:13:34.190 --> 01:13:42.730
When you do that,
that's the second one.

01:13:42.730 --> 01:13:47.770
I did that and right
here, right here it's TP.

01:13:47.770 --> 01:13:53.275
The period of 10 of them--
and then I divide to get 1--

01:13:53.275 --> 01:14:00.680
is 0.83 seconds.

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:03.394
What does that tell you, Sean?

01:14:03.394 --> 01:14:04.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:13.020
PROFESSOR: Well
actually, these two--

01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:14.590
you can get the frequency.

01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:24.220
But what this does, because
this gives you the frequency,

01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:28.653
you know in general
that-- in particular, you

01:14:28.653 --> 01:14:31.610
know that this second natural
frequency, which is just

01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:35.360
associated with this single
spring and a mass here.

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:36.930
It's just this guy.

01:14:36.930 --> 01:14:38.280
It's not both of them.

01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:45.190
Anyway, this turns out
to-- I didn't graph that.

01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:50.860
That's square root of
K over M. Trust me,

01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:53.610
you can put those two
together, and you get

01:14:53.610 --> 01:15:04.490
K2 is equal to-- newton meters.

01:15:04.490 --> 01:15:07.590
This is exactly what you said.

01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:08.870
Freeze the first mass.

01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:11.410
Displace the second.

01:15:11.410 --> 01:15:12.830
Measure the period.

01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:24.530
You get the natural frequency
for basically K2 over M2.

01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:26.495
So you got K2 out of it.

01:15:26.495 --> 01:15:27.577
Yeah, Douglas?

01:15:27.577 --> 01:15:30.118
AUDIENCE: So how come it gives
you just the natural frequency

01:15:30.118 --> 01:15:32.510
and a damp natural frequency?

01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:34.910
PROFESSOR: Oh no.

01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:36.020
It absolutely is.

01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:39.900
It's all damped, no
question about it.

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:41.670
But again, what
we're doing is we're

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:44.660
going close enough, right?

01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:46.910
Because I have nothing.

01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:49.220
So even the damped
natural frequency

01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:51.640
is better than nothing.

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:53.385
All right, so Amy back to you.

01:15:53.385 --> 01:15:55.230
You're back in business.

01:15:55.230 --> 01:15:56.220
What now?

01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:59.690
So now we've got M2 and K2.

01:16:04.715 --> 01:16:05.840
AUDIENCE: You just need K1.

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:06.190
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:16:06.190 --> 01:16:06.970
Now we need K1.

01:16:06.970 --> 01:16:08.979
What do we do now?

01:16:08.979 --> 01:16:11.104
AUDIENCE: We want to do
the same thing that we just

01:16:11.104 --> 01:16:12.992
did for K2. [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:17.300
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:21.040
Well, not quite.

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:23.170
Let's see, now I'm going
to turn loose-- now we're

01:16:23.170 --> 01:16:26.439
back to our original system.

01:16:26.439 --> 01:16:27.480
It doesn't hurt anything.

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:30.750
It's just ugly to look at.

01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:32.800
Now what?

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:35.715
Sean, do that trick again.

01:16:38.445 --> 01:16:40.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:42.065
PROFESSOR: Push this one up?

01:16:42.065 --> 01:16:42.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:47.644 --> 01:16:49.240
PROFESSOR: I don't think so.

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:50.407
Yeah, Nick.

01:16:50.407 --> 01:16:51.990
AUDIENCE: So just
fix the second mass.

01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:53.355
PROFESSOR: Fix the second mass.

01:16:53.355 --> 01:16:54.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:05.010
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you
see this frequency here?

01:17:05.010 --> 01:17:07.230
I'm going to overrule Chandler.

01:17:07.230 --> 01:17:12.470
I'm going to say, this is the
natural frequency of that's

01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:16.570
mass and these two springs.

01:17:16.570 --> 01:17:17.880
Do that same trick again.

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:20.290
You get the equivalent
spring rate,

01:17:20.290 --> 01:17:23.130
subtract the second from it,
and you get the other one.

01:17:23.130 --> 01:17:24.880
Devin, is that what
you were going to say?

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:27.020
Wonderful.

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:29.420
That is exactly what I did.

01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:32.310
And you get out
of it, you get K1

01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:40.480
is equal to 50.45
newton per meter.

01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:44.350
In the interest of time, I'm
going to short circuit this.

01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:48.740
I took exactly
these parameters, I

01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:54.870
put them into that same
computer program we had before,

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:58.736
and what came out-- I have
to have a place to put it.

01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:03.000
Ah, wonderful.

01:18:08.507 --> 01:18:09.590
And now I have to find it.

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:19.890
Here we go.

01:18:19.890 --> 01:18:23.147
Here are the two modes.

01:18:23.147 --> 01:18:24.605
Actually, let me
put it right here.

01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:34.115
For this system, because
here's the first one.

01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:43.358
And here's the second one.

01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:54.980
0.9760 and minus 0.2177.

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.410
Everybody appreciate that?

01:18:56.410 --> 01:18:59.610
This is by the same
computational procedure

01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:02.240
we spoke of earlier.

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:09.110
And sparing no expense,
we have here a, made fresh

01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:15.680
from my basement, a custom
made initial condition setting

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:22.430
device, which I can hopefully
avoid killing myself with.

01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:24.760
OK here's what we have.

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:29.990
So I guess I didn't
show you this first.

01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:31.820
If you can see it,
what we have marked

01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:33.630
is the reference position.

01:19:33.630 --> 01:19:36.010
That's the rest position
that we couldn't

01:19:36.010 --> 01:19:38.320
find by laying it down.

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:45.350
Or excuse me, this is the
static equilibrium position

01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:47.850
of mass number one,
static equilibrium

01:19:47.850 --> 01:19:49.550
position of mass number two.

01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:52.330
Mode one or there.

01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:54.390
What they said over there, 0.4.

01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:57.160
And .97 is down here.

01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.990
Mode two is over here.

01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:03.770
So Devin, while I'm
doing this, tell me

01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:05.830
how am I going to
know if this is right

01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:09.080
or if this is all just bogus?

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:14.594
What observable's going to
tell me that I got it right?

01:20:14.594 --> 01:20:15.469
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:22.495
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry, speak up.

01:20:22.495 --> 01:20:23.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:25.342
PROFESSOR: How about it, Nick?

01:20:25.342 --> 01:20:26.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:28.100
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:32.070
And you ought to be able to
see it from where you are.

01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:36.310
Can you appreciate that
they're not at the moment?

01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:41.660
All right, now hang on.

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:44.320
Here comes mode number one.

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:47.890
This takes two hands to do it.

01:20:47.890 --> 01:20:50.248
All right, you ready?

01:20:53.170 --> 01:20:54.184
This is mode number one.

01:20:54.184 --> 01:20:55.350
Again, it's a those numbers.

01:21:07.739 --> 01:21:08.280
How about it?

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.320
Can you see it?

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.730
Very good.

01:21:12.730 --> 01:21:14.500
How about the other?

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:21.987
And so here, this is number two.

01:21:21.987 --> 01:21:23.570
And this is a little
more complicated,

01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:28.656
because the other one has
to be done from the bottom.

01:21:28.656 --> 01:21:29.470
Hang on a second.

01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:36.860
Now this one we're doing
is we're deflecting--

01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:39.370
this one is positive downward.

01:21:39.370 --> 01:21:44.210
So X1 is down, but
X2 is negative.

01:21:44.210 --> 01:21:46.710
So it's displaced upward a bit.

01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:48.790
Are you ready?

01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:52.594
Nick, what do you
expect to see this time?

01:21:52.594 --> 01:21:55.184
AUDIENCE: The frequency
should be higher

01:21:55.184 --> 01:21:56.850
and they'll move in
opposite directions.

01:21:56.850 --> 01:22:00.090
PROFESSOR: That's the key.

01:22:00.090 --> 01:22:02.650
Once again, they're going to
move with the same frequency,

01:22:02.650 --> 01:22:04.910
albeit in different directions.

01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:09.010
But that new frequency is
going to be higher than before.

01:22:09.010 --> 01:22:11.308
And sure enough, stand back.

01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:21.500
So there you go.

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:23.440
What did that tell us?

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:26.520
That told us that
the first order

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:30.410
we got the system parameters
identified correctly

01:22:30.410 --> 01:22:33.220
and the theory holds up.

01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:33.890
Questions?

01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:35.880
Comments?

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:37.740
Complaints?

01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:38.696
Devin?

01:22:38.696 --> 01:22:39.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:22:39.690 --> 01:22:40.620
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry?

01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:42.880
AUDIENCE: What was the
second set of conditions?

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:45.750
PROFESSOR: The second
set of initial conditions

01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:48.180
were right here.

01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:57.120
This is the second mode,
X1, 0.97, X2, minus 0.2.

01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:01.330
OK, have a great
Thanksgiving holiday.
