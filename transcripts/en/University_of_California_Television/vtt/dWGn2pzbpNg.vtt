00:00:00.103 --> 00:00:01.028
(whooshing)

00:00:01.028 --> 00:00:05.778
(clicking)
(light music)

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.053
- Our next is speaker Finn Gratton.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.810
And Finn is a somatic
psychotherapist in private practice

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.910
in Santa Cruz and Mountain
View in California.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.960
Finn's clinical and educational work

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.840
are focused on the
intersections of trauma,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.010
neurodiversity, somatic therapy,

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.810
sexual and gender minorities.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.030
They identify as non-binary, transgender,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.400
and as neuroqueer.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.785
Please give your attention now to Finn.

00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:46.702
(crowd applauding)

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.680
- All right, thank you.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.380
I mostly present to kind
of trans conferences,

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.360
and it's a really wonderful opportunity

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.330
to be at this conference.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.360
I've learned a lot.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.180
I now know why they have that big sign

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.708
on my dental providers that says

00:01:10.708 --> 00:01:12.510
don't ever put that little sucky thing

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.540
in Finn's mouth (laughs)

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.770
because I flail and knock everybody away.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.250
So I think it's like, I get
new people that said you knew

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.603
and it's like this whole
big page in the front.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.110
Okay.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.050
So I know we're at the place,

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.000
we're at the 2:30 place in the conference

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.340
and I'm hoping we can,

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.613
which is the symposium
which is like, whoa.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.660
So if you need to move around
or sit back or come and go,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.170
I really want to, as
somebody who has those needs,

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.403
I really want to encourage you to do that.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.400
I identify as transgender, as non-binary,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.750
and I also identify as autistic.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.563
I didn't go to anyone to
get those identifications.

00:02:01.424 --> 00:02:04.341
(crowd applauding)

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.390
There's a peace that comes
with being transgender

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.593
that is just about ubiquitous,
that is imposter syndrome,

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.900
that all your life until you
kind of found your way to it,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.900
you were not seen as who
you are from infancy on.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.000
And then as a trans non-binary person,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.500
I am still not seen for who I am.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.033
I come out every day multiple times.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.910
As an autistic person
who can kind of present

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.800
and communicate in some way,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.610
I'm often told either
I don't seem autistic

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.950
or I'm doing really well.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.273
None of these help,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.410
so what I've decided to do more and more,

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.060
because I am getting older and
there's just no time like now

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.060
is to present in a way in
line with how I am inside.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.790
It's scary to do that,

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.730
there's a prescribed way
to give a presentation,

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.543
I did it, I made a PowerPoint,

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.260
and I will do the PowerPoint
because it's helpful

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.410
and it's a bridge between
my mind and yours,

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.240
yet to do only that is
kind of giving you only

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.630
kind of half of the story.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.860
You'll get it, but not get the insides,

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.853
so I'm gonna try to do both.

00:03:37.942 --> 00:03:40.110
I'm also like, go to poetry things,

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.420
and when I get stuck,

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.180
everybody starts snapping their fingers,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.430
so if someone is out there doing that,

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.820
because at slams, and you
just come up with stuff,

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.600
and sometimes it's not there,
everybody's like you got it,

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.003
so I'll take that.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.040
By speaking and moving in a way

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.690
that's kind of considered
appropriate or expected or assumed

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.093
I end up leaving out what I
think I really want you to know.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.117
I want to share about the
work I do with clients,

00:04:15.117 --> 00:04:20.117
the work in my community, and
I wrote a few notes about this

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.620
when I talk about these things,
I have a lot of feelings.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.940
Yesterday I was in session
with a pretty new client

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.940
I've seen about four times,
about 16, trans, autistic,

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.540
my clientele is mostly,

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.270
includes several people who
are regional center people,

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.660
but they're mostly in that space

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.763
that receives not nearly enough services

00:04:45.763 --> 00:04:50.763
but it still considered
kind of low support needs.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.310
Many of them aren't diagnosed
or identified as autistic

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.153
until I see them at 20 or 30 or 40 or 50.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.150
About, I'd say about
half my clients are trans

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.500
and half autistic, but
there's such a huge overlap,

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.500
I have a few outside,

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.800
I have some CP clients and some others.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.803
They range from about eight
years old to about 60.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.773
So what I was saying, this
client came to me and they said,

00:05:21.847 --> 00:05:23.520
"I have these enormous feelings",

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.207
they have enormous anxiety, rumination,

00:05:26.207 --> 00:05:27.357
"And they're so big,

00:05:27.357 --> 00:05:29.610
"and they're just about
something I saw or felt",

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.640
and everybody's taught in various
ways to try to reduce that

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.180
and then they just said,
"It's not working."

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.180
And the thing I told her
is that those will help,

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.200
you can bleed it off some,

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.410
but one thing that's gonna
help and it's gonna take years

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.173
is just kind of get big
enough to hold much bigger,

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.680
and that's what I'm gonna do now.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.330
So this is the feeling of
what is coming through now,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.750
and I just, usually, I
have somebody I know,

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.193
so I'm just gonna count on
you being people I know.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.490
This is the feeling, and
it's been a hard week

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.020
'cause I had clients in crisis
too, so there was less sleep

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.870
so you know what that does to
being able to be resilient,

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.770
of being here and wishing
to share this experience

00:06:16.946 --> 00:06:21.665
and being appreciative of who
you are here doing this work.

00:06:21.665 --> 00:06:23.100
My singing has no words,

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.720
my thoughts come without words,

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.823
and then I have to make the
words, which takes longer.

00:06:30.761 --> 00:06:33.178
(vocalizing)

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.640
Oh, this is so important to me,

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.283
it's so important to my clients.

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:44.386
(vocalizing)

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.580
I really wish that you hear
it with a great openness

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.833
and also a forgiveness for the
places that I stumble over.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:21.830
One thing that's so important
is to not have any assumptions

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.010
about the person next to you
and the person who walks in,

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.860
even to the point of you don't
know what their gender is.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.280
You may think you know what the gender is

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.750
of the person in front of
you or to the side of you,

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:39.120
but if they haven't told
you, you may not know,

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.373
and you may not know their gender history.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:49.220
I am going to begin this
part, and there's a button.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.670
I am going to also allow my body to move

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.500
'cause I did an interview
for Gender Spectrum,

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.340
there was a video tape thing,

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.171
and I watched, I went, "Oh no,
there's like this happening."

00:08:01.171 --> 00:08:03.590
(crowd laughing)

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.283
- I'm just trying to find that button.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.364
- This is what my friends live with.

00:08:08.364 --> 00:08:09.821
- [Man] Under the table.

00:08:09.821 --> 00:08:10.654
- Under the table?

00:08:10.654 --> 00:08:11.760
Oh, your paper

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.750
was hiding the button.
- Got it.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.193
- Okay.
- Thank you, sorry.

00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:19.433
The harms of living with or near me.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.040
Okay, I have lots to disclose,

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.754
but nothing about financial things.

00:08:25.754 --> 00:08:29.754
(crowd laughing and applauding)

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.640
Somebody had a sign up over
the men's bathroom at least

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.330
that said gender-neutral, and
I felt much more comfortable

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.930
going in it this morning before it was,

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:42.879
fell down and got taken down later.

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:45.710
That's one thing I have to to
disclose, it was much easier.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.810
It's hard every time I go into a bathroom.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.900
I only look neurotypical.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.850
I don't know if I even do that anymore.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.313
That was the singing part.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.150
That's getting bigger, it's the only thing

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.950
that's really, really worked for me.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.660
Here's some definitions.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:11.420
Because I am in the community,
it's really important to me,

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.640
both as a trans person,
as a neuroqueer person

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.640
to use language that feels
appropriate and honoring.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:25.310
So I'm gonna go through
some of the language I use.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.190
You notice I don't use the word disorder,

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:31.800
I don't use spectrum even,
unless we can talk about

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.670
what my daughter calls not the
line, but the infinite plane.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:39.597
It's like a circle, and my
kids are a little bit like me

00:09:39.597 --> 00:09:40.437
and a little not,

00:09:40.437 --> 00:09:43.257
"But not a circle, mom,
it's an infinite plane."

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.940
Neurodiversity, so that's all of us.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.210
We have a big range of
neurotypes in this room,

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:56.210
and our cognitive sensory
process changes over time.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.260
Neurotypical, I don't know
where you want to draw the line

00:10:04.518 --> 00:10:05.910
but you can draw a line.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.850
Some people would do it
at a standard deviation

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.550
off of something, but there's
so many things to count.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:17.943
I don't use the word normal,
so it's neurotypical.

00:10:20.355 --> 00:10:22.900
Neurodivergent is anybody falls on

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.800
the other side of that line
or wants to identify that way.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:32.990
Autistic is one way somebody
can be neurodivergent,

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.100
and it's the way I'll talk about the most

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.557
because it's the most at least awareness

00:10:38.557 --> 00:10:42.360
of transgender identities,

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.470
or gender non-conforming identities

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:46.683
are in the autistic community.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:49.833
And disabled.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.600
Autistic people may or may not
consider themself disabled,

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.520
they may consider themselves
disabled in some areas

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.280
and not in others, they may
consider themselves disabled

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.680
because of the environment they're in,

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.543
not particularly about who they are.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.850
And I love that I found this online,

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:13.730
I wear a lot of T-shirts when I change

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:17.703
in the gym locker room, so
that people know who I am.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.940
And this one I found,

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.960
it has the colors for the trans flag

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.403
in the neuroqueer sign.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.740
Okay, some gender definitions.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.700
I think I was asked because this was

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.703
perhaps not a group that
knew as much about gender,

00:11:35.703 --> 00:11:37.620
so just to run through some things.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:42.040
So transgender is anyone
whose self-identification

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.960
doesn't match the sex they
were assigned at birth,

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.593
designated at birth by
their parents, physician.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:56.570
Cisgender is anyone whose
identity matches that.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:00.570
So there's, again, just
as with neurotypical

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:04.447
and neurodivergent, not normal folks,

00:12:04.447 --> 00:12:07.573
they are cisgender, or cis for short.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:12.250
Non-binary means you don't identify

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.983
on either end of the binary,
not male, not female.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:20.340
And there are many, many
non-binary identities

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.530
so if you have somebody
come in and say they are

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:25.773
multi-gender, genderqueer,

00:12:27.558 --> 00:12:30.483
agender, which is a fairly big one,

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:37.500
those are all considered
part of the non-binary group.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.363
There are more non-binary folks,

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.340
autistic people contribute
more to the non-binary group

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.543
and the agender group.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.870
And gender non-conforming
doesn't exactly count

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.150
as transgender but fits within
the whole community in a way.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:02.150
Transgender is an identity,

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:03.980
while gender non-conforming may be the way

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.630
you express yourself,
or your gender roles.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:11.790
Cross-dressers are
people who identify with

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.813
the sex they were assigned
at birth, and who,

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.840
part of their life and their
experience is to cross-dress

00:13:21.207 --> 00:13:24.223
whether they do that
publicly or privately.

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.460
This is the whole big
transgender umbrella,

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.990
and there are many, many names.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:32.880
The language changes frequently,

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.350
so it's just super important
to ask your clients,

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.703
ask your patients what names they use,

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:44.091
and sometimes we get, we want
to be cool and know the words

00:13:44.091 --> 00:13:49.091
but they change, and
some aren't used anymore

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.283
and considered just not right for people.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:57.760
Okay, so gender dysphoria is a diagnosis.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.260
It's in the DSM and
it's the diagnosis that

00:14:05.282 --> 00:14:07.390
it's a conflict between the
gender assigned at birth

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.583
and internally felt gender identity.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:13.150
It doesn't include gender non-conforming

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.033
identity and behavior,
that's gender expression.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.540
It's associated with distress

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.063
and possibly some functioning problems.

00:14:24.504 --> 00:14:26.160
And it's currently a diagnosable condition

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.223
for youth and adults.

00:14:29.017 --> 00:14:31.950
This diagnosis changes I think

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.937
with every edition of the DSM.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:39.420
Before it was gender identity disorder,

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.130
they took the disorder out of it because

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.480
there is a strong argument
that it's not a disorder

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.833
but it's the experience of dysphoria.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.740
So it's currently
diagnosable and it's also,

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:59.440
the diagnosis is needed for most medical

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.790
and social transition steps.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.383
So hormones, surgeries and
also legal gender change.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:11.210
So therapists and physicians
become gatekeepers

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.653
to people's gender identity.

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.320
I'm gonna go through
some of the criteria and

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:27.630
it's different for adolescents
and adults versus children.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:28.790
For adolescents and adults,

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.853
you only need two of the
criteria, and for six months.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.160
And I'm just gonna click through
them and drink some water

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.413
and let you read them.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:41.513
I'm glad you're appreciating
my presentation style.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:02.720
So notice they use the word other gender,

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.600
and that has been a nice change,

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.050
rather than opposite gender,

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:10.313
so that includes those
non-binary people like me.

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.760
And for a long time, people would go into

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.530
a psychologist office
and physician offices

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:21.810
and perform a gender so
that they could get their,

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:22.860
whatever they needed.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.220
And how they performed
that gender was dress, act,

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.547
do whatever they had,

00:16:28.547 --> 00:16:31.330
and the opposite of their assigned gender

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.730
that didn't necessarily
match who they were,

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:37.060
even if they were binary,
even if there's a trans woman

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.040
who doesn't really want to wear a dress,

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.390
that's not the kind of
trans woman they are,

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.270
they would do some things for
the doctor's office at least

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:46.250
to do that.

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:49.710
Also for a long time, many
feigned heterosexuality

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.910
when there's probably only a
third of trans people I think,

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:55.963
from the last study I read,
about a third are heterosexual.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:02.690
The rest is a whole mix of
lesbian, gay, pansexual,

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.603
and queer, and asexual.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.223
Gender dysphoria in children,

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.330
you need six criteria for six months,

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:15.893
and they're quite different.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.580
I'm sorry about the tiny print,

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.370
I'm gonna read this time 'cause of that.

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:22.830
I'm worried about the plastic cup,

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:25.130
'cause I knock over
things, but I'm gonna try.

00:17:27.791 --> 00:17:31.130
Can somebody come and pick
it up while I'm talking?

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:33.180
A strong desire to be of the other gender

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.653
or an insistence that
one is the other gender.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.890
A strong preference for wearing clothes

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.590
typical of the opposite gender.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.590
A strong preference for cross-gender roles

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.311
and make-believe play.

00:17:45.311 --> 00:17:48.050
A strong preference for
toys, games or activities

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:51.673
stereotypically used or
engaged in by the other gender.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:54.820
I wish they said another gender.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.870
A strong preference for
playmates of the other gender.

00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.970
A strong rejection of
toys, games and activities

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:01.410
typical of one's assigned gender.

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.960
A strong dislike of one's sexual anatomy.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.530
A strong desire for the
physical sex characteristics

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:08.743
that match one's experienced gender.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.640
Okay, I'm gonna come right back to that,

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.260
but just think about that and think

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.810
what problems would these
diagnostic criteria pose

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:20.790
to assessing neurodivergent children?

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:22.263
Or any children really?

00:18:22.263 --> 00:18:25.373
Just want to let you look.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.503
And many of you work with children.

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:34.980
Is this something where,
I know it's a big group,

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.730
but can anybody just
mention something they see

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.560
as might be an issue?

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.393
Yeah?

00:18:41.393 --> 00:18:43.030
- [Crowd Member] I sometimes
see kids who don't like

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:47.347
any of their anatomy covered
by a bathing suit ever,

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.600
at all, for any reason.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.777
And some folks don't like wearing pants.

00:18:54.777 --> 00:18:58.140
Is that a gender problem, or
is that a sensory problem?

00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:58.973
- Right.

00:18:58.973 --> 00:19:01.220
- [Crowd Member] Is it a
sensory integration problem

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.087
with somebody wearing a bathing suit,

00:19:03.087 --> 00:19:04.580
or is it a gender problem?

00:19:06.305 --> 00:19:09.827
And you think like, pants
on neuro or atypical folks

00:19:09.827 --> 00:19:11.523
have fancies like, at all.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.213
- Right--

00:19:16.213 --> 00:19:18.940
- [Crowd Member] Or they can
go up tell me, but until then--

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.716
- We don't know, yeah.

00:19:20.716 --> 00:19:23.010
- [Crowd Member] Children
with both parents

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:26.353
of the same gender are playing house,

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.830
and they may be limiting roles.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:32.663
- Right.

00:19:32.663 --> 00:19:35.126
(crowd member talking quietly)

00:19:35.126 --> 00:19:38.110
Uh huh, excellent example.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.980
Yeah.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.140
- [Crowd Member] I'm thinking too that,

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.720
I've had kids learn a lot by
how people react to things.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.870
And so, what I saw was
the fact they're all,

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:49.700
these custom things were little,

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.964
they were all thinking
about things like that.

00:19:52.964 --> 00:19:53.797
We didn't say anything about it,

00:19:53.797 --> 00:19:56.220
but that some people give subtle,

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.513
non-verbal input like that,
and it doesn't seem right.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.380
And then if you don't pick up on that,

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.362
maybe you don't get to
socialize with them.

00:20:05.362 --> 00:20:08.580
- Right, so you may not pick up on it too,

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.140
and you also might not be interested

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.010
in the feedback you're getting.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.247
It's like, "I want to wear this."

00:20:15.483 --> 00:20:18.433
And that feedback having less weight.

00:20:22.212 --> 00:20:24.070
And I guess that's a piece I'd like to say

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:27.250
a little bit about because
often, in my speaking with

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.010
many of my clients, since
people in the community,

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:36.130
this kind of idea that not
be able to read social cues

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:40.510
isn't the whole story, and
another big piece of the story is

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:45.387
we see what people are wanting
but it either doesn't seem

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:50.510
interesting to us or

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:55.510
it doesn't fit with principles
of fairness or inclusiveness

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:56.880
or something that they have

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.425
that's a principle that's stronger,

00:20:59.425 --> 00:21:03.730
it's not always that
they're not reading it,

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:07.223
it may also be, it doesn't really engage.

00:21:10.968 --> 00:21:11.801
Okay.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.993
Transgender among autistic people.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:20.523
I had some fun way to do this,

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:25.347
and that is, okay, transgender,

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:30.363
so the autistic community,

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:36.530
somewhere about 1% in this country.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:39.570
It's kind of 0.5 to 2%,
depending on which country

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.870
you're getting your statistics from.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:45.230
So I did this fun little,
probably little bit geeky thing

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:48.330
to find out the distribution
of last names by first letters

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:53.330
of the last name, and that
is about the number of people

00:21:56.390 --> 00:22:00.280
whose last name starts with Z.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.343
Does anybody here last name start with Z?

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.580
Arms up, do we have any Zs?

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.937
We're missing too small a sample size.

00:22:08.937 --> 00:22:11.520
(crowd laughing)
Okay.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.633
Well, if it was, it would be
one or two people in here.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:20.960
Now, the population of those
people who are transgender

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:27.787
would be somewhere around
five to 10%, so 5% would be

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:38.680
people whose names
start with W, X, Y or Z.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.433
Any of you, hands up?

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.360
Okay, so kind of look
around, that's the crew.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:48.187
So if you're all, of autistic people,

00:22:49.101 --> 00:22:52.100
those people with their
hands up, that might be it.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:56.503
Okay, now I want to add the letter R.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.610
So letter Rs, add yourself.

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:01.730
If you really need to stand up like I do,

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:04.393
you can stand up, but stick
it up and look around.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.460
So if you're serving autistic community,

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:11.210
you're guessing one and 20, one in 10

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:12.733
are likely transgender.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:18.123
Onward, that little button.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.970
There are concerns about
the screening tools

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:24.603
and the methods used on this.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.040
The most research that's being done

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.520
is trying to nail down these percentages,

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.050
there's only two studies.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:36.630
Here's the big problem, they
both rely upon one question

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:38.760
in the child behavior checklist

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.287
that's filled out by
their parents that says,

00:23:40.287 --> 00:23:44.207
"Do you wish to be the other sex?"

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.170
This leaves out tons.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:51.050
It leaves out all the things
the kid hasn't told the parent,

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:53.410
it leaves out all the
denial the parent has,

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:56.210
it leaves out all the non-binary people,

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:58.420
it leaves out that the kid
might not have the language

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.963
or the understanding to
say something like that.

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.570
This is a little different, and it's,

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.290
there are more studies in this autism

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:09.280
among the transgender population.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:14.090
So anybody here want to stand up?

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.923
We'll see.

00:24:15.999 --> 00:24:19.170
I like to stand up for a change, but okay,

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.480
autistic in the general,

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.930
so transgender people, less than autistic,

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:27.210
about 0.7% maybe, though that's increasing

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:28.793
amongst younger people.

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:33.483
Letter I, anybody name start
with the letter I, last name?

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.610
Stand up please if so.

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:37.640
We got one?

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.150
Okay, too small.
(crowd laughing)

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:42.910
Okay, this might change it though.

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:46.060
The highest bunch, the highest

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:50.870
level that we've gotten in the survey,

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:53.770
the highest prevalence is
if everybody whose name

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:58.524
starts with U, V, W, X, Y, Z, M or C,

00:24:58.524 --> 00:25:00.040
raise their hands.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.190
That would be the autistic folks

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:03.890
amongst the transgender community.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.010
So that's a lot more, huh?

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:13.490
That's why the trans
providers are really up on,

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:17.310
we need help because they
didn't have any training

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:18.640
in working with autistic people

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.440
and they are identifying
them right and left.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.193
And many of them aren't identified.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.060
I know I'm talking more about what I call

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.580
lower support needs, autistic people,

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.540
and I'd like to really, I
think a lot of this applies

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.170
but there's differences
we need to think about in

00:25:37.806 --> 00:25:42.413
helping people communicate
their gender to us.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.635
When I get the questions about
why are so many autistic,

00:25:54.635 --> 00:25:57.250
why are so many trans people autistic,

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.840
I have them come back with,

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.089
how come so few neurotypical
people are transgender?

00:26:03.089 --> 00:26:06.373
(crowd laughing)
What's up with that?

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.313
And why are so few
cisgender people autistic?

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.900
And you think it's the
same research question,

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:16.850
but it's not quite.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:23.510
This is Lydia X. Z. Brown, who's
just a phenomenal educator,

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:27.877
activist, writer, autistic, non-binary,

00:26:27.877 --> 00:26:31.160
just put out a book which is so great,

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.830
an edited anthology called
"The Weight of Our Dreams"

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:37.083
about racialized autism.

00:26:39.592 --> 00:26:41.867
And they say, "I've
started referring to myself

00:26:41.867 --> 00:26:45.737
"as gendervague, a specifically
neurodivergent experience

00:26:45.737 --> 00:26:47.807
"of trans/gender identity.

00:26:47.807 --> 00:26:50.947
"For many of us, gender holds
little intrinsic meaning.

00:26:50.947 --> 00:26:53.717
"Being autistic doesn't
cause my gender identity,

00:26:53.717 --> 00:26:56.787
"but it is inextricably
related to how I understand

00:26:56.787 --> 00:26:58.347
"and experience gender."

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.853
So now we know.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.313
We're here, what do we do?

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:15.340
So the first I have is to
shift your expectations.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.070
You have met transgender people

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.713
if you don't think you have
met transgender people.

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:25.413
So just for a little thought experiment,

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.480
you may know the person
sitting next to you,

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.690
so that didn't count, pick
somebody you don't know

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:33.520
that's nearby you.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.170
And you don't even have to talk to them,

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:40.143
just notice what you've
assumed about their gender.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:49.733
We all do it, I do it,
and I try to not do it.

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:55.723
And so how did you make that assumption?

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:01.573
Is there any way that
you know you're right?

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.507
Anybody out there laughing
like, "How would I?"

00:28:14.814 --> 00:28:19.210
I frequently have issues
going into either bathroom

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:21.418
or locker room and often,

00:28:21.418 --> 00:28:23.657
the polite way people say it to me is,

00:28:23.657 --> 00:28:25.567
"Am I in the wrong bathroom?"

00:28:25.567 --> 00:28:28.840
(crowd laughing)

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:29.760
So they're looking at me

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.773
and they're trying to figure it out.

00:28:34.466 --> 00:28:39.466
Or maybe you got into the wrong
one and you just don't know

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.930
unless someone tells you what their gender

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:44.573
or their gender history is.

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:47.570
For some people transition,

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:52.420
depending on when they
transition, and also their,

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:55.270
the direction of the
transition and their genetics,

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:57.690
you won't know, you just won't know,

00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:59.330
unless you know them personally.

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:03.630
Other people, you make guesses
based upon kind of markers

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:07.070
that we have in our head
about what is male or female?

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:12.020
This is kind of the bane of
the existence of trans folks

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:15.003
and particularly, the
adolescents I work with,

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:21.630
one because they want to
be seen as who they are,

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:24.520
not that they, not for
their transgender history,

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.080
but just for the gender
identity that they have,

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.223
and two because it's scary.

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:32.570
There is danger of violence,

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.120
there's bullying, there's
threatening, it's a huge,

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.363
the minority stress is really large.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:44.330
When I look up transgender,
just do a Google search,

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:46.403
half of them are bathroom pictures.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.863
Okay, button.

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:54.913
So, practice not assuming.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.440
Ask everyone their pronouns.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.780
Thank you Galen for asking

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.623
all the presenters their pronouns.

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:06.900
And that may feel kind of awkward

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.350
when you think you know
someone is cisgender, binary,

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.810
and you think you have it figured out

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:13.630
by the way they're
dressing and everything,

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:15.700
and it may make that
other person look at you

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:16.957
kind of strangely, like,

00:30:16.957 --> 00:30:18.890
"Why are you asking me my pronoun?"

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:20.810
But it gives you a little chance

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:23.260
to do a little bit of
education with that person.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.270
And that may help for the next trans

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:28.280
or non-binary person they meet.

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.400
You don't know someone's
gender until they tell you,

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.373
and they have to feel safe to tell you.

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:37.970
Question all the gender
roles that make you

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.263
make those assumptions.

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:48.530
So the first is just
shift, and shift is huge.

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:50.240
We talk about it, but it's a big thing

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.360
to walk down the street,
practice it when you leave,

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.177
when you go to your car, walk and just go,

00:30:54.177 --> 00:30:56.697
"I don't know with everybody
who comes in the office,

00:30:56.697 --> 00:30:57.837
"I don't know."

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:03.103
That makes it so much safer
for the folks I work with.

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:07.580
It changes your first questions,

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:10.620
it changes your intake form,

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.920
it changes what you
train your office staff

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.875
to say to someone when they come in,

00:31:15.875 --> 00:31:19.363
it knocks down the stress level a lot.

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:24.400
Next is be prepared, and I
put up this because I know

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.964
what people remember, but a few years ago,

00:31:26.964 --> 00:31:28.350
somebody made a donation

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:29.992
to The Western Washington Girl Scouts,

00:31:29.992 --> 00:31:34.570
and it was $100,000, but
only if they didn't accept

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:36.253
any trans girls.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.530
And they were prepared, they
didn't think about it long,

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:44.230
they immediately said no,

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:47.591
and they put up a GoFundMe
or Indiegogo thing,

00:31:47.591 --> 00:31:51.600
and this was it, to raise
$100,000 for every girl,

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.320
so they were prepared.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.740
They had already done some training,

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.302
some people in their group.

00:31:58.302 --> 00:31:59.990
Another way to be prepared

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:02.470
is read autistic blogs and material,

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.493
read things written by people who are.

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:10.630
Same thing, read trans
blogs and materials,

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:12.053
and if you go on Tumblr,

00:32:13.015 --> 00:32:17.120
all you have to do is type autism, trans,

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.083
and you'll get a whole
bunch of people talking.

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.030
Develop relationships, join consult teams

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:26.850
with trans providers.

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:30.120
And have resources ready for
clients and their families.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.680
Make your workplace gender inclusive.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:37.680
That includes your intake
forms, your website,

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:42.520
the pronouns you use when
talking about anybody,

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.883
and your bathrooms.

00:32:55.499 --> 00:32:59.332
The important thing is
to make the first move.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.260
It's up to them.

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:04.880
It's up to your clients to
tell you whatever they want

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.620
to tell you about their
private experience,

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:10.620
but we're all looking for signs that

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:12.270
our providers are trans-friendly.

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:17.570
They look for signs on the website

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:19.193
before ever entering the thing.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.480
And we're looking for
signs around the room,

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.830
and we're looking for those basic things,

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:27.173
like asking pronouns.

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:30.713
Here are some great first moves.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.480
Have images and materials
that make it clear

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.673
that you understand trans issues.

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:49.730
Even if your client or
patient has a legal name,

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.967
you may ask them, "What
name do you like to use?"

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.530
If you have a population of any kind,

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:06.130
but particularly autistic,
but I think it's anybody,

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:08.290
just letting them know
that it's really common

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:10.720
for people to be
transgender and non-binary.

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:13.270
It's particularly common
in the autistic community.

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.800
If you're working with children,

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.200
or with people who are just
being supported along the way,

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:27.173
or the children of your trans parents,

00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:35.800
there's some work to do
around normalizing transgender

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:40.180
and non-conforming identities
and behaviors and expressions.

00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:42.270
Making a safe space with
parents and guardians

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:46.440
to go through their own trans
issues, their own fears,

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.800
their feelings of loss,

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.923
that they lost the gender
child they thought they had.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.100
That may be in addition
to if they had loss around

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:01.173
their child's disabilities, the neurotype.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.320
Make that a space that's
safe for the parents,

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.940
but also safe for the child,

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.263
meaning the child shouldn't be in there.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:15.830
Support individuals in
communicating their experiences,

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:17.113
needs and desires.

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.430
I think in the rest of this conference,

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:25.290
there's just been so many
good examples of how to assist

00:35:27.806 --> 00:35:30.847
with pictures, with creating stories

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:38.100
and sharing materials that will help you

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.420
talk about this other person's experience

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.737
in a way that they can, that
they can jump on and say,

00:35:43.737 --> 00:35:45.167
"Oh, that's kind of like me,

00:35:45.167 --> 00:35:46.967
"but that part's not like me."

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.823
And then there's work to do
on educating around options.

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:57.460
Working as a provider who serves

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.450
developmentally disabled,

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:04.083
intellectually and
developmentally disabled people,

00:36:06.264 --> 00:36:09.400
neurodivergent people, you've
got a lot to do already.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.550
There's a whole lot of
different people to talk to,

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:14.633
it's not the simplest population.

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:17.530
Serving trans people
is a lot like that too,

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:20.190
you need to talk with endocrinologists,

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:25.190
you need to talk with parents a lot more,

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:29.160
you need to talk with
education providers a lot too,

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.300
so it's a very collaborative work,

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:34.000
and you're also talking with
a lot of other providers.

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:37.110
And there are resources.

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:40.840
So in the book you got,
there's a couple pages

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.513
of really great resources
to share with people.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.123
And I touched on this,

00:36:49.123 --> 00:36:51.253
there's a lot of teamwork involved.

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:57.090
I usually have psychiatrists,

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:58.610
parents if they're involved,

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:01.370
school people, primary care people,

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:02.880
and gender care specialists,

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:06.510
and maybe some support group
or somebody who's helping them

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:08.253
get their legal forms going.

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:16.330
In the group that you work
with, you may be the person

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:17.627
who knows, even if you think,

00:37:17.627 --> 00:37:19.680
"I just went to a few presentations",

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:23.760
you may know more about transgender issues

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.260
than anybody else in the room.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.543
It just may happen.

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:29.980
I thought there would be a lot more people

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.090
who knew a lot about this when I started,

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:35.300
'cause this was second or
third profession for me,

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:36.443
and they weren't.

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:41.050
There's a huge cost for not
responding to gender dysphoria.

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:45.090
There's a huge suicidality rate

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:47.940
and huge depression and anxiety.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:51.240
That's on top of whatever
else they're experiencing

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.430
as autistic or

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:59.150
intellectually developmentally
disabled people.

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:04.150
So, it's really important to
take your role as educator

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:09.063
to the other people on the team seriously.

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:13.050
There isn't a lot of time to
waste with adolescents often,

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:14.720
they're in panic.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.003
They usually hit puberty
and go into panic.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:24.560
And I don't think I need to say this,

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:28.060
this is the most
client-centered civil rights

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:30.750
kind of group I've been in to present,

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:33.320
advocate is a big part of the job.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.740
I may actually get a Twitter account.

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:36.805
I am one of those autistic people.

00:38:36.805 --> 00:38:37.930
(crowd laughing)

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:39.560
I don't even have Facebook,

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:41.683
I didn't do Myspace, I'm pretty old,

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.303
and it scares me walking into Costco.

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:51.470
Set aside the transition script.

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:56.183
This is Eddie Redmayne doing
trans woman in The Danish Girl.

00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:59.090
Set aside the man in a woman's body,

00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:00.260
the woman in the man's body,

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.760
set aside there's clothing
and hair and choices that fit,

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.210
there's normative gender expression,

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:06.850
set aside that a name
and gender marker change

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:09.370
has to accompany every trans identity,

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:11.850
set aside the expectation
that they participate

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:13.480
in support groups or events,

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.503
that's overwhelming for most of us,

00:39:16.503 --> 00:39:18.923
and it's just people
with their challenges.

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:24.920
So physically, I work with all
my clients who are going to

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:33.351
do hormones or hormone
blockers or surgeries

00:39:33.351 --> 00:39:36.540
to work with their physical sensitivities.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:40.400
They usually are hypersensitive
and scared of getting shots.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.800
Physical exams are nightmares.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:47.800
I'm so glad Dora and
Clarissa are presenting,

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.570
I've used their healthcare toolkit

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:52.460
since it came out I think.

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:55.100
As soon as I found it on
Autism Women's Network,

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.640
it's just really, really helpful,

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.190
so you'll hear more about that.

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:02.960
Walk them through what's going to happen.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:05.640
That means you may need to
talk with the endocrinologist

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:09.300
or people to be able to
anticipate and tell them more

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.363
and draw the pictures or map
it out, what's gonna happen.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:17.207
And I've run into parents who have said,

00:40:17.207 --> 00:40:19.797
"My kid's not really, I don't
think they're really into it

00:40:19.797 --> 00:40:21.547
"because they're not really working on

00:40:21.547 --> 00:40:24.300
"getting their papers in for
their name and gender change."

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:27.223
They have trouble with their
papers with everything.

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:32.130
And so,

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:36.360
there's just work making phone
calls in the office with them

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:39.313
to the next step, doing
the kind of social work.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.280
Crisis care, part of
why I'm like this today

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:46.283
is I've had crisis this
week, which is not uncommon.

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:51.010
Adolescents show up for
the first meeting in crisis

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:52.483
or high urgency usually.

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:56.080
It's not the story of the five
year old if you know who knew

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.270
or the three year old, there sometimes is,

00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:00.220
but usually with my autistic clients,

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:04.390
it's somewhere around 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:09.080
That happens with cisgender
neurotypical people,

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:11.512
I mean, transgender
neurotypical people too

00:41:11.512 --> 00:41:14.997
because puberty kind of goes,
"Oh my God, I was ignoring it

00:41:14.997 --> 00:41:18.950
"and now I can't", but they're in panic

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:20.540
and it needs to change right away.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.640
They got online, they talked with friends,

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.940
they found out what could happen,

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.220
they told their parents
they need it to happen now,

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:31.220
and now they're starting
to really get panic attacks

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:34.730
more than they got before,
really depressed, isolate.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:36.713
You need to assess for suicidality.

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:42.970
And often you need to
work hard to speed up,

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:44.560
which things means doing,

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.390
really getting the parents on board

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:48.120
faster than they want to be.

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.710
You may need to spend more time assessing.

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:52.220
It's sometimes harder to assess

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.763
because you may not be
able to communicate.

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:57.900
Every autistic person,

00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:59.820
every neurodivergent person is different,

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.750
and even if I am, I don't necessarily know

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:04.760
how to communicate and
understand what they're

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.410
trying to tell me always
and it takes me longer.

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:10.480
I usually, if I can do it, I
schedule another session sooner

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.280
rather than wait 'til the next one,

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.343
because they are panicking.

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:20.890
And it's not uncommon to have to

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:23.880
really look at hospitalization
and residential work,

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.347
and this is where I had
this word help appeal.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:33.254
Help, it's horrible!

00:42:33.254 --> 00:42:38.254
They, whether teen or
young adult or older adult,

00:42:38.912 --> 00:42:41.060
they will not go because nobody

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.507
can handle their sensitivities in the 5150

00:42:45.336 --> 00:42:48.280
and they freak out and the
police do something to them

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:51.330
and no, they will not go
because they don't understand,

00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:55.140
and then, it's the hardest thing

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:58.910
and there are very few
residential care programs

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:01.230
that understand trans or autistic.

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:05.420
And I've been pulling
kids back after treatment,

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:10.260
after a hospitalization, and
I want to be able to feel

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:12.170
like I can safely send somebody somewhere,

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:14.560
it makes it a very difficult
place for me as a clinician.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.190
So if anybody here is a
physician to talk with me

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:19.010
about what we can do
about hospitalizations

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:21.933
or residential treatment, I'd love that.

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:28.293
And here are the questions I always get,

00:43:29.493 --> 00:43:32.003
and it's my last slide.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:37.314
Good, because it says two
minutes and 24 seconds.

00:43:37.314 --> 00:43:41.820
(crowd cheering and applauding)

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.633
Is it an obsession?

00:43:46.588 --> 00:43:49.460
So a lot of the first studies,

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.110
not studies, they weren't studies at all,

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:52.823
there were people saying,

00:43:53.837 --> 00:43:55.980
"There's this much higher percentage of

00:43:57.847 --> 00:43:59.067
"people saying they're transgender

00:43:59.067 --> 00:44:03.500
"among our autistic
clients and that can't be",

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.100
because it's just, when
you look at something

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.490
and it's more than it should be,

00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:10.347
they tend to take those extra and say,

00:44:10.347 --> 00:44:13.793
"That's because they're",
whatever the other thing they are.

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:17.877
And so they think, "What could it be?

00:44:17.877 --> 00:44:19.887
"Well, they're really obsessed

00:44:19.887 --> 00:44:21.620
"about their transgender identity."

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:25.290
Well, if you've known
somebody in transition,

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:29.820
we all get obsessed about
our transgender transition.

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:32.993
It becomes a big, big thing in your head.

00:44:34.291 --> 00:44:36.063
And also of obsessions,

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:41.070
if you were gonna obsess
on something, it's a very,

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:43.093
there are much easier things to do.

00:44:43.994 --> 00:44:47.450
(crowd laughing)

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:50.093
This one has tons of risk
and pain and difficulty.

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:55.380
You may need to talk about,
you may need to talk longer,

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:57.400
like if they're obsessed
about a particular character

00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.960
somebody said they're
dressing up as and everything,

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.740
then you need to find out
whether they're dressing up

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.640
as that person because that
person in that character

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.290
has given them permission
to dress this way

00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:08.060
and nobody else has,

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:11.690
or whether they just love that character

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:13.310
and want to dress just
like that character,

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:15.290
but you can find that out by spending time

00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:16.853
and exploring that with them.

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:21.410
Is it sensory seeking behavior?

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:24.397
Because you like shiny,
I've seen this printed,

00:45:24.397 --> 00:45:26.880
and it infuriates me but it,

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.410
the shiny fabric and everything explains

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:33.793
the autistic transwomen, but
not the autistic transmen.

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:39.870
So that, I'm shooting
these down kind of fast,

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:41.743
the sensory seeking one especially.

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:45.090
Are they able to make this
decision with everybody,

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:48.410
or their developmental specialist?

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:51.370
With everybody, you need to take the time

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:54.253
to have the communication
to really understand.

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:02.830
I'm out of time on that one, that's me,

00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:04.700
I am writing a book on this,

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.910
it's probably about a year and a half out.

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:09.753
So that's my little,

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:12.050
you can find me, it's in the thing.

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:16.207
Thank you very much for--
