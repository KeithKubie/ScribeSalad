00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.890
Now you know who are your competitors,
but

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.970
what are your competitive advantages and
disadvantages?

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.030
Think about your values and
be honest with yourself about it, so

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.360
you are aware of where
you stand against others.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.600
Analyze your competitive advantages and
disadvantages.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.810
An advantage is gained by a company
when it can provide the same value as

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.200
its competitors but at a lower price.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.660
Or I can charge higher prices,
by providing greater value for

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.270
differentiation.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.410
Competitive advantage results
from matching core strengths

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.340
to the opportunities.
