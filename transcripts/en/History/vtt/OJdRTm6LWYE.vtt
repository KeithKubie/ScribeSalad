00:00:02.252 --> 00:00:03.670
NARRATOR: This treasure
hunter found the lost

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.840
gold of World War II,
and this greedy dictator

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.050
stole it from him.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.262
Throughout World War II, the
Japanese military amassed

00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:14.514
a fortune in looted gold.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:17.308
A Japanese general,
Tomoyuki Yamashita,

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:20.645
hid the treasure throughout the
Philippines in a complex system

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:22.313
of underground tunnels.

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:25.275
The commission finds you
guilty as charged and sentences

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:28.027
you to death by hanging.

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:31.906
NARRATOR: Yamashita was
executed for war crimes in 1946

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:35.285
and took the location of
the immense bounty with him.

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.912
Some claimed the CIA found it.

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:41.291
Others insisted it
was still out there.

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:44.586
Rogelio Roxas, a former
Filipino soldier,

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:46.713
dedicated his life to
finding the treasure.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:50.759
And in 1971, he
allegedly succeeded.

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:53.470
Roxas said he found a tunnel
full of World War II era

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.681
rifles, bayonets,
radios, and a skeleton

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:59.309
wearing a Japanese army uniform.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.522
He also found a 10 foot
thick concrete wall.

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:06.733
He blasted through
it and uncovered

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.861
a 2000-pound solid
gold statue of Buddha

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:13.865
surrounded by crates of gold
bars worth an untold amount.

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:18.036
And it was still only a fraction
of what Yamashita had hidden.

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:20.747
Ferdinand Marcos, the
wealth-crazed dictator

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:23.333
of the Philippines,
learned of the discovery.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.210
When Roxas returned
with the treasure,

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.796
Marcos ordered his men
to raid Roxas's home,

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:29.839
where part of the
treasure was hidden.

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:32.258
They stole the
Buddha, the gold bars,

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:35.428
even the piggy bank
of Roxas's children.

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:37.472
Roxas was later
beaten and tortured

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:40.016
for the locations of
the remaining treasure

00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:42.268
but divulged nothing.

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:46.439
Marcos and his wife Imelda
fled to Hawaii in 1986.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.943
In 1988, Roxas sued the former
dictator over the stolen

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.778
treasure in Hawaiian court.

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.696
Before he was
supposed to testify,

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:56.825
Roxas died under
what many considered

00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:59.410
suspicious circumstances.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.913
But the trial went on.

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:06.251
In 1992, Imelda Marcos admitted
much of her husband's wealth

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:09.504
was built on Yamashita's gold.

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:13.550
And in 1996, a jury awarded
the Rogelio Roxas estate

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.595
and his investors $22
billion, the largest award in

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:19.764
judicial history at the time.

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:21.850
The court record clearly
stated that Roxas

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.977
found a portion of
the Yamashita treasure

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.354
and that Marcos stole it.

00:02:26.354 --> 00:02:28.273
To this day, treasure
hunters are still

00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:29.983
risking their lives
to find the rest

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:32.569
of World War II's lost gold.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.070
A piece of a grenade.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.865
General Yamashita's trying
to take us out of here.
