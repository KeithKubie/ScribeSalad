00:00:01.203 --> 00:00:02.090
(letters whoosh)

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.920
- [Narrator] This
program is a presentation

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.133
of UCTV for educational
and noncommercial use only.

00:00:11.082 --> 00:00:14.165
(mellow synth music)

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.077
- Good afternoon, my name is Ellen Gobler

00:00:46.077 --> 00:00:49.340
and I manage the graduate
council lectures.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.970
Thank you so much for joining us today.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.100
It is now my pleasure to
introduce Marjorie Shapiro,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.230
professor of physics and past chair

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.593
of the physics department.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.000
- So I'm very pleased
to be able to introduce

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.950
to you today for his
second lecture of the week

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.980
Professor Leon Lederman, a physicist,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.280
Nobel laureate, former
director of Fermilab,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.300
educator and author.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.640
I'm not gonna give you
a long biography of Leon

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.590
because his talk today
is really gonna talk

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.190
about his life and he
can tell you about it

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.700
much better than I can,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.040
but I did wanna say that I first met him

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.490
when I went to Fermilab as
a post-doc in the 1980s,

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.370
and it says something
about Leon, first of all,

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.360
that I always called him Leon,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.110
even though I was a peon of a post-doc

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.350
and he was the director
of Fermilab at the time.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.330
And second of all, that I
always felt very comfortable

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.163
talking to him.

00:01:46.163 --> 00:01:47.540
He was somebody who used to eat

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.856
in the cafeteria every day,

00:01:48.856 --> 00:01:50.020
and if you had a question about physics,

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.440
you could just plop down next to him

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.980
and ask him a question and
he would talk for hours.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.690
He loved talking about physics,

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.900
and he really felt

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.050
that it was an important part of Fermilab

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.820
that everyone feel that they
were part of the community.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.610
So, as I said, the lecture
today is really going to

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.950
be about how Leon went from
his start as a physicist

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.090
through all of his great discoveries,

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.090
but as somebody who saw those
discoveries both in the past,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.160
because some of his largest
discoveries had happened

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.870
when I was still a young student,

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.130
but also saw them come
to fruition later on,

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.070
I just wanted to make sure it was clear

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.400
to those of you who aren't
scientists in the audience

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.870
what a pivotal role he's played
in the history of our field.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.400
The era where Leon was
doing most of his science

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.880
was an extremely important one.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.440
It was one where we went from having

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.700
almost no understanding
of what we now believe

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.440
are the fundamental particles,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.860
to where we have a picture, that,

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.280
although it isn't complete,
allows us a framework

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.030
for really describing what
happens on a subatomic scale,

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.970
hopefully, all the way
up to very high energies

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.180
and to what could happen
in the early universe.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.950
And Leon played an important
role in the discovery

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.640
of several pieces of that.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.900
The thing he won the Nobel Prize for,

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.500
the discovery of the muon neutrino,

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.900
was one of the things that told us

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.320
that matter had many copies of itself,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.100
that there was more than one family

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.660
or generation of particles,

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.590
and then later on he showed
us the same thing was true

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.720
for the quarks as well as for the leptons,

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.450
as being the person who led the team

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.090
to discover the bottom quark.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.170
He also played a very important role

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.140
in making sure the appropriate facilities

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.170
existed to do that science.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.130
He was instrumental in not
only discovering the neutrino,

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.780
but in understanding how to
produce beams of neutrinos.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.720
And when he was director of Fermilab,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.050
he was there during the construction phase

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.440
and the initial operations
of the Tevatron,

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.310
that proton-anti-proton collider

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.550
that's been the highest energy accelerator

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.850
for the past 20 years
and will continue to be

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.010
until the turn on of the LHC,

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.790
hopefully at the end of this year.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.230
So, which that let me welcome Leon

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.650
and I hope you all enjoy the talk.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.060
And and the end, we will
have times for questions,

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.981
but I'll step down now.

00:04:00.981 --> 00:04:03.981
(audience applauds)

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.760
- Are there any questions?
(audience laughs)

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.233
I hope there'll be questions.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.260
Let me be comfortable here

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.593
and hope you all are comfortable, too.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.020
So, I'm gonna ramble, and I hope

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.200
somewhere in this I will
talk about physics and

00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:41.463
my experience in physics.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.330
But let me begin with a story.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.330
I was a graduate student
at Columbia University.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.643
That's somewhere in New York.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.140
And we got a telephone call
from a friend in Princeton

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.363
asking whether we would
like to meet Einstein.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.920
And we said yes, a friend and I,

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.480
thought this was a joke.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.070
You know, could we possibly meet Einstein?

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.530
Is that doable?

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.230
And our Princeton friend
said, oh yeah, yeah,

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.940
he goes to lunch everyday,

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.440
and if you sit on a certain bench,

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.260
I'll show you where,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.460
he'll pass by and maybe, you know,

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.920
he'll feel like chatting with you.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.300
So, we drove down to
Princeton and found a bench

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.903
and were told to sit here and wait for the

00:05:43.286 --> 00:05:46.050
greatest physicist to pass by.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.610
And sure enough, after a
little while there he came

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.810
with his research assistant, I think,

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.810
and there he was with his
baggy pants and sweatshirt

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.873
and sandals, I guess.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.240
And as they came close to us,

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.507
we heard his assistant say,

00:06:05.507 --> 00:06:08.087
"Would you like to meet
some students, professor?"

00:06:08.087 --> 00:06:10.170
"Yah," he said, "Yah."

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.283
That meant yes.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.240
So, we (coughs)

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.240
sort of jumped up, and he
stopped with my friend first,

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.840
and said, "What are you doing?"

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.740
That's German for, what are you doing?

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.970
And my friend said, "I'm doing
a thesis on quantum theory."

00:06:33.137 --> 00:06:35.922
"Ach," said Einstein,
"you're wasting your time."

00:06:35.922 --> 00:06:37.120
(audience laughs)

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.360
And I felt a little better,
because I'm an experimentalist,

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.920
so I was doing experiments.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.377
I told him, I'm working on
the properties of pions.

00:06:46.377 --> 00:06:49.217
"Ach," he said, "pions, pions.

00:06:49.217 --> 00:06:51.507
"We don't understand the electron.

00:06:51.507 --> 00:06:54.140
"Why do you waste time with pions?

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.297
(audience laughs)

00:06:55.297 --> 00:06:57.453
"Okay, boys, goodbye!" he said.

00:06:57.453 --> 00:06:58.510
(audience laughs)

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:59.730
And he walked off.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.650
He had disposed of two brilliant,

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.614
handsome graduate students in 30 seconds.

00:07:06.614 --> 00:07:09.250
(audience laughs)

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.220
but we didn't care.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.520
We had exchanged words

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.210
with the greatest physicist of our time.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.313
So, we were really very happy.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.640
It was quite an experience to have that,

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.850
and I don't know if
anybody here's old enough

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.670
to have met Einstein.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.370
Bruno, did you meet Einstein?

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.203
You see, okay.

00:07:32.203 --> 00:07:33.290
So, I'm unique.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.410
I've talked to Einstein. (chuckles)

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.853
It was quite an experience.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.800
Being a graduate student, this was,

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.210
I had spent some three years helping a guy

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.460
by the name of Eisenhower

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.243
with some problem he had in Europe,

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.325
and it was called World War II. (chuckles)

00:08:06.325 --> 00:08:11.007
And so I had, and then
as soon as I was able to

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.950
manage being discharged from the military,

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:21.950
I rushed to Columbia and
registered as a graduate student

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:27.940
and started to study physics again.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.910
And I think that was probably
the worst year of my life,

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.180
because I had forgotten how to study

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:38.180
and has spent three years doing
totally irrelevant things.

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.950
And all of a sudden,
I was back to studying

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:43.400
and had forgotten how study.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.904
I'd forgotten that physics was fun,

00:08:47.904 --> 00:08:50.970
and I was having a terrible time,

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.420
and several times considered,

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.010
maybe I'm doing the wrong thing, you know,

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:02.010
working on trying to get an
advanced degree in physics

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.527
when I didn't really know much about it.

00:09:05.527 --> 00:09:07.120
I'd forgotten.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:12.120
And that was a very, very
hard experience for me,

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.613
and then something funny happened.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:19.840
I had

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.400
been given a small room
where I could begin

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.950
to think about apparatus and think about

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.323
doing some research.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.513
The chairman of the department

00:09:34.513 --> 00:09:38.580
was one of the founders of
American physics, Isidor Rabi.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.970
He had told me that this room

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.513
would be the place where
I would do some research.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.593
I

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.330
had been away from that
room for a couple of weeks

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:59.023
working on preparing for a major exam,

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.470
and came back

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.100
and entered the room,

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.600
and there was a janitor mopping the floor,

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.763
and singing obviously some Italian song.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.670
And as soon as I came in,

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.320
he sort of used his mop
as a kind of a rifle.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.480
He held it and he announced

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.750
very loudly presumably his name.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:25.970
It was Bernardini.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.550
And I said yes, that's
very good, but be careful.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.510
That mop is wet and the
wires there have electricity

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:34.200
and you're gonna cause short circuits.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.713
And he looked at me blankly.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.030
Didn't understand a word I was saying

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.650
his English was not so good.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:45.990
But later I came out of the room

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.270
and decided to wait until the janitor

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.410
was finished with his mopping.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.760
And Mister Rabi was actually in the hall,

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.087
and I said, "I see you have a new janitor,

00:10:55.087 --> 00:10:56.990
"doesn't speak any English."

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.150
He said, "You mean the guy in the room?"

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.717
I said, "Yes."

00:11:00.717 --> 00:11:03.587
"Oh," he said, "that's
not a janitor, dope.

00:11:03.587 --> 00:11:08.167
"that's Gilberto Bernardini,
a famous cosmic ray physicist.

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:11.087
"And I hired him here
so that he may be able

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.606
"to get you through your PhD degree."

00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:15.556
(audience laughs)
"Oh my god," I said.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.500
So, I rushed back in to repair my damage

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.543
and start to communicate
with this guy, Bernardini.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.960
And it was hard, because
his English, you know.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.210
He used, I remember, he'd
come in in the morning

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.750
and he'd say, "Good night, everybody."

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.260
(audience laughs)

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.343
He was very friendly.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.240
But he was very funny.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.292
I watched him.

00:11:42.292 --> 00:11:46.680
I realized that he was a famous scientist.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.420
He had very curious

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:50.203
activities.

00:11:50.203 --> 00:11:53.490
He would enter a room and
push the light switch,

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:55.640
and the lights would go on.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.952
And he'd look at the lights and say,

00:11:57.952 --> 00:12:00.460
(speaks foreign language)
(audience laughs)

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:01.653
Now, that's Italian.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:05.290
And I think it means fantastic.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.808
And then he'd turn the lights
off, turn 'em on again.

00:12:08.808 --> 00:12:10.420
(speaks foreign language)

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.900
Turn 'em off, turn 'em on again.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.820
He kept doing this, you know.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:14.653
What, what?

00:12:14.653 --> 00:12:19.070
Well, he seemed to think
it's just fantastic

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:22.090
that you can push a button
and the lights go on.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.800
Come to think of it, it is kind of

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.170
wondrous that you push a
button and the lights go on.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.800
And you know that you could figure out

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.400
that to push the button
and some circuit closes

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.290
and 100 miles away a motor
drives some electricity

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:40.990
and eventually the lights go on.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:44.483
But it was, for him,

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.370
what I call a sense of wonder.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.153
You push the button,
the lights would go on.

00:12:50.153 --> 00:12:51.450
(speaks foreign language)

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:52.560
And that's what he had.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.160
Everything he did,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.373
he seemed to take a certain
amount of amazement.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:03.420
So, we started to communicate,
and his English improved.

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.303
My Italian didn't get any better.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:10.203
It was zero to begin with, it still is.

00:13:12.733 --> 00:13:14.260
But he was

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:19.010
someone who took a great deal of joy.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:20.350
And then the first thing he did

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:24.460
is he wanted to find out
what was in this laboratory,

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:28.150
and the thing that I showed
him that was my despair,

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:32.300
I built something called a cloud chamber.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.210
What was a cloud chamber?

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:37.300
Well, it's a box about
12 inches in diameter,

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.410
maybe six inches deep,

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:44.410
and it's filled with some nitrogen gas

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:47.463
and some alcohol vapor of some kind.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:52.710
The notion was that if
you pushed a button,

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.340
the bottom of the chamber would collapse

00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:01.340
and the temperature of
the chamber would change,

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.490
and you were supposed to
see tracks of particles.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.833
And all I got was white smoke.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.890
I tried and tried, and,
you know, it was a failure.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:13.270
One of my many failures

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.210
was I couldn't get this cloud chamber

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.143
to do anything but white smoke.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.910
And Bernardini looked at the chamber,

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.566
and he says, "What's that?"

00:14:22.566 --> 00:14:24.910
and it was a wire going into the chamber.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:28.030
And I said, "That's my
radioactive source."

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:29.877
Gilberto said, "Take it out."

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.907
I said, "But that gives me the tracks.

00:14:32.907 --> 00:14:34.260
"That's radioactivity."

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.890
He says, "Take it out, take it out!"

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.210
So, I took it out.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:41.910
Tracks, beautiful tracks.

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:44.360
My radioactive source was about 10 curies

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.687
of something terrible,
ultra radioactive stuff

00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:51.203
that was killing the chamber, so.

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:53.833
We learn.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:56.550
What else did we?

00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:01.440
Oh, then he showed me how to
make a kind of Geiger counter.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.960
So, we did some machining.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.820
He told me how to use
the tools of machinery,

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:13.520
and string a wire through the
middle of this copper tube,

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:18.500
then there was little insulators
and the wire came out,

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.780
and eventually we had
the whole thing working,

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.593
connected to an oscilloscope,

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:28.250
and we were watching the oscilloscope.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.080
And all of a sudden, on the oscilloscope,

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.100
there's a sweep, and then
there was little bumps,

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.107
and Bernardini went crazy.

00:15:38.107 --> 00:15:40.360
"It's counting!" he said, "It's counting!"

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.390
He started screaming,

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.580
and he was much shorter than I was,

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.750
and probably half my weight.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:47.740
He picked me up and started
dancing around the room.

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.710
It's counting, it's counting!

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:51.320
This is a phenomena he must have seen

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.290
hundreds of times as a
cosmic ray scientist,

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:57.330
but he never got used to notion

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:01.670
that we were actually observing particles

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.360
that came from millions
and millions of miles away,

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.330
and came to the 10th floor
of the Pupin Physics Building

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:12.130
at Columbia University and
said, (speaks foreign language)!

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:13.954
That's what he said.
(audience laughs)

00:16:13.954 --> 00:16:16.333
It's saying (speaks
foreign language) to us!

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.760
It was kind of, again, a
phenomenon that he must have seen

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.160
I don't know how many times,

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:25.320
but never

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:28.323
got used to it.

00:16:28.323 --> 00:16:29.640
He had this

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:33.000
sense of wonder

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.470
that you can actually observe this object

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.020
that came from so far away.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:38.853
And that's what he would say.

00:16:38.853 --> 00:16:40.697
"It's come to say (speaks
foreign language) to us,

00:16:40.697 --> 00:16:44.027
"10th floor, Pupin, Columbia University!"

00:16:45.196 --> 00:16:47.120
It was the beginning of a

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:54.770
return, to me, of the fun of physics.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:55.970
Because that's what it was.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.293
For him, it was a joy,

00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:00.780
and I kept learning from him

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.167
how to also enjoy the physics.

00:17:04.167 --> 00:17:08.720
And little by little that was

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:16.430
something that restored my
enjoyment, first of all,

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.063
because he was a lot of fun.

00:17:19.409 --> 00:17:24.150
And he put on a lot of, he
was a good actor in many ways.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:28.550
And I think he was doing a
lot of this for my benefit,

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.733
but it was certainly a learning process.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:40.290
I think I was very lucky
to have that experience

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:43.510
because I needed that kind of restoration

00:17:45.414 --> 00:17:46.923
of enjoyment and fun.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.460
The thing though that was most impressive

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:57.330
was this sense of wonder about the world.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.300
He never got used to it.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.033
Press a switch and the
light goes on, fantastic.

00:18:03.033 --> 00:18:05.333
(speaks foreign language),
I should say it right.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.370
At one point, I remember

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.810
he warned me

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:20.650
that sometimes, as when you're in physics,

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:25.320
you're going to see something
that nobody ever saw before.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.600
He sort of warned me about the

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:36.830
joy of doing science and
discovering something

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:38.603
that no one has ever seen before.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:44.220
And that was certainly a major

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:46.873
effect.

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:51.970
And so, I thought I'd tell
you this story because it's

00:18:55.846 --> 00:19:00.670
illuminating to find out,
had it been someone else,

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:03.040
maybe a more conventional kind of guy,

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.440
who might have also been a good teacher,

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.930
that might have helped, too.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:11.930
But having this gentleman
be so enthusiastic

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.333
and

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.120
so sharp in his enjoyment of science

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:25.120
was, I think, crucial to my
experience and my career.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:35.720
Some years later, now at
Columbia, I was a professor.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.840
I was doing research.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.853
I had my own graduate students.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:46.920
And what he warned me of happened.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.770
It was three o'clock in the morning.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.720
I don't know why these things happen

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.720
at three o'clock in the morning.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:57.357
I was doing an experiment without him,

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:03.600
in the fields of Illinois,
and I was checking apparatus.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.590
The graduate students hand gone to sleep,

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:09.740
and I was looking at the equipment,

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.340
and began to study some of the output

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:16.090
from one of the computers, and
it looked very funny to me.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:19.100
Something unusual was happening.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:23.220
And then out came what was something

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.453
we had been waiting for,
a spectacular track,

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:32.930
proving the existence
of muon type neutrino.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.520
Which, nevermind what that is,

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.100
but it was something we possibly expected,

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.540
and there it was.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.003
And all of the sudden it was,

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.050
it made you breathless.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:48.770
Palms started sweating, you were nervous.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.270
Something was happening in this apparatus

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.920
that was spectacularly beautiful

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.173
and it's implications were very deep.

00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:01.370
It would make headlines
all over the world.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:04.530
And it became hard to breathe.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.400
I tested things, I checked.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.150
Everything I looked at just confirmed

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:11.470
that at four AM

00:21:14.736 --> 00:21:19.736
(chuckles) in a cold winter
day in the fields of Illinois,

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:25.320
I had good evidence of discovery.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:30.100
I actually located Bernardini.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.330
He was in fact visiting
in New York at the time,

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.430
and I had a telephone number.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:36.860
And so I called him.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.360
I told him what I had seen.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.750
Well, by this time many years later,

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:44.350
his (speaks foreign
language) had disappeared

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:46.320
and it was Americanized.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.140
And when I told him what I had found

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.924
out came, "Holy shit, no kidding!"

00:21:50.924 --> 00:21:53.757
(audience laughs)

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:57.743
So.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:05.460
That was a magical experience, certainly.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:14.780
Some years later, my wife
Ellen, who's sitting out there,

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.793
and I were in Sweden.

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:23.470
Gilberto had come, too, to help
me receive the Nobel Prize.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.210
Gilberto's (speaks foreign
language) was ubiquitous.

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:31.010
He was very excited by this.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:35.737
And I said to Ellen, "Did you
ever in your wildest dreams

00:22:35.737 --> 00:22:37.707
"imagine that we would be in Sweden,

00:22:37.707 --> 00:22:40.150
"dining with the king and queen?"

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:42.240
And Ellen, very skeptical as usual,

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.917
said, "You were never
in my wildest dreams."

00:22:44.917 --> 00:22:47.750
(audience laughs)

00:22:51.394 --> 00:22:53.602
(laughs) That's the way it goes.

00:22:53.602 --> 00:22:55.890
(audience laughs)

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:57.970
Okay, well.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:59.133
What can I tell you?

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.570
Physics, the joy of doing physics

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:06.380
once you get to the
knack, and you're lucky.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.540
Luck is a very important issue.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.790
If anybody tells you, what does it take?

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.050
Luck would be probably
one of the first things

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:15.363
you would op for.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:27.460
And, that's also the other
thing, is your surroundings.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:31.403
And being at Columbia University
was a fantastic experience.

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:38.670
There was a sense of
vitality to the thing.

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:41.560
Times were appropriate.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:45.620
Discoveries were on the horizon,

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.020
and new apparatus was available.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:51.650
If I compare those lucky times

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:56.650
to the poorer opportunities we have today,

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:58.780
certainly because of

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:05.540
the economic crisis
and the difficulties of

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:10.260
pursuing experiments at high cost

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.890
and complicated

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.340
apparatus and so on,

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.533
we were very lucky in those days.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:26.730
The big problem today is to
try to maintain, restore,

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:30.010
and improve the opportunities
for young people

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.780
to have the kind of experiences I had

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.283
in my graduate school days at Columbia.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:41.033
What else can I tell you?

00:24:43.927 --> 00:24:47.687
A major thing, I do want
to say a few things about

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.070
opportunities.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:53.310
One of the things that I got interested in

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:57.293
and talked a lot about
yesterday was science education.

00:24:58.597 --> 00:25:00.350
But what I didn't talk about is

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:04.860
a school

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:10.480
that I had the good luck and
maybe a little bit of wisdom

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.650
in starting in Illinois.

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:16.603
It's called the Illinois
Math and Science Academy.

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:21.520
As a director of the Fermi Laboratory,

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.590
I was interested in
students and in education,

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:28.740
and we had a lot of
opportunities to invite students

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:31.610
to come into the laboratory.

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:32.930
And they could take courses.

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:35.630
There was Saturday
morning physics courses,

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:40.500
and out of that a
procession of young students

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.590
that would come into the laboratory.

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.630
And that inspired me because I realized

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:48.513
that the average schools,

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:51.143
in

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.730
Chicago area and Illinois,

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:57.850
were not exceptionally

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.970
good at teaching young people.

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:07.970
And so I got involved in
this thing and organized

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:13.460
something called the Illinois
Math and Science Academy,

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:17.373
abbreviated IMSA, I-M-S-A.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:21.323
It was a special school.

00:26:22.633 --> 00:26:24.480
I had to see the governor of Illinois.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.110
This was one of these governors

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:27.912
who happens not to be in jail.

00:26:27.912 --> 00:26:29.090
(audience laughs)

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:33.160
It's unusual for Illinois,
but this was an okay governor.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.330
And he was intrigued by the notion

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:39.170
of creating a special school in Illinois.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.010
I told him about the, I mean,

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:45.050
he knew about the famous
Bronx High School of Science,

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:47.740
and I said, we need a Bronx
High School of Science

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.743
out here on the prairie of Illinois.

00:26:52.142 --> 00:26:57.142
He authorized the existence
of a special school

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.500
for gifted young people

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:05.550
in which the school itself
would also be a place

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:06.770
where students could live in.

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:09.960
It was a residential public school

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.570
that would carry students

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:15.210
through the last three
years of high school.

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:18.203
And that opened in 1986,

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:24.320
and first graduating class was in 1989.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.310
So, it's a little over 20 years now

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:30.970
producing some of the most brilliant

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:33.633
students.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.170
These were all restricted

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:39.460
to the state of Illinois by the law,

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.950
but it was a fantastic experience,

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:47.860
especially since in the last month or two

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.460
the INTEL foundation, which,

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.550
INTEL is a huge electronics company

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:56.860
and they

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:00.253
spend a lot of money education,

00:28:02.409 --> 00:28:03.703
on science education.

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:09.830
They organized

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:12.720
a study of schools.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.530
And we were very happy
to learn not too long ago

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:19.540
that the Illinois Math Science Academy

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:24.540
was given what's called an
INTEL Star Innovator award

00:28:24.616 --> 00:28:29.270
as the best science high
school in the nation.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:33.030
They had tested some 700 schools

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:36.090
for us to win this particular award,

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:41.090
which was certainly gratifying.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:46.620
Some of our graduates by now have had

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:50.450
huge careers

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:58.240
in science, but not only in
science, but all subjects.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.320
But the notion of

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:04.450
giftedness and taking care of this

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:10.130
idea that young students who have a gift

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:14.400
should be encouraged in
the best possible way

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:19.150
was something that I believed
in and still believe in.

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:23.300
And the Illinois Math Science
Academy is a fantastic school.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.790
If you're ever discouraged

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:26.400
or feel

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:32.660
that you need to cheer up or so on,

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.670
I invite you to come and visit the school.

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:39.190
It's about 30 miles west of Chicago,

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:42.320
very close to the Fermilab,

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.800
which you're also invited to visit

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:49.800
but the school itself has this
fantastic group of students

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:55.890
that are increasingly making
their way in the world.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.910
Of course, this is a high school,

00:29:58.910 --> 00:29:59.743
but the

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:05.200
push they get towards higher education

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.263
is enormous and gratifying.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:13.840
And every time I feel I
need more encouragement,

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:18.160
I go to the school, and I sit
and chat with the students.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.563
We now have 4,000 graduates
that will graduate.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:24.550
Something like

00:30:27.342 --> 00:30:29.283
200 or 300 students a year.

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.960
They go to universities everywhere.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.200
I'm sure there are many of our
students here at California.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:43.340
But to take special care of giftedness

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:44.980
is an important thing.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.810
It's not the only thing you
want to do in education,

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:49.830
but it is an important issue

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:53.750
because these are the students
that will become the doctors

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:55.480
and the

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.920
wise people that will

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:05.486
sustain our society in times to come.

00:31:05.486 --> 00:31:08.050
Illinois Math Science Academy

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:15.280
has projects, and one
of the projects we had

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:20.280
was for each of these students
to pick a famous scientist

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:24.830
and write a biography of the scientist.

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:27.510
Now, it's interesting that
when you challenge them

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:30.650
to name a famous scientist,

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:34.370
and I say, nobody present company.

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:37.217
Just pick the name of a famous scientist.

00:31:37.217 --> 00:31:38.450
And they were silent.

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:41.490
They didn't know any names of scientists.

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:42.400
So, I said, okay,

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.413
well, you have subjects you like.

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:48.203
Look up the subject and find a scientist

00:31:48.203 --> 00:31:50.630
that is active in that subject.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:53.870
And eventually they did.

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:56.310
That was one of our interesting projects,

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:59.003
because they then,

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:03.830
there were 15 students and
they picked 15 scientists,

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:07.450
and I told,

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:12.450
they then did research on
what the scientist had done.

00:32:12.732 --> 00:32:16.950
At some point, I said, you have
to interview the scientist.

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:18.253
Well, how do we do that?

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:23.610
So, I called up a lady by
the name of Claudia Dreifus

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:25.680
who writes for the New York Times

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:30.060
and she writes an article periodically,

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:34.373
a biography of some living scientist.

00:32:35.479 --> 00:32:39.890
So, she came and very kindly
gave these kids a lecture

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:41.360
on how you interview a scientist.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.300
What do you ask?

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.830
How do you ask questions?

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:46.520
How do you keep the conversation going?

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.120
And as a net result,
each of these students

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.500
wrote an essay.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.600
I warned the scientist that they picked,

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.800
the ones I could reach on the telephone.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.370
You may get a funny telephone call

00:32:57.370 --> 00:32:58.710
from a high school student.

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:02.410
Please be kind, he's
gonna write a biography.

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:05.130
And eventually, (chuckles)
that's what happened.

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:09.020
They wrote biographies
and I put them together

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.270
and called a publisher I knew.

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:12.730
And he said oh, he'd be delighted.

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:14.440
So, there's a book called

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:22.260
Structure of, oh, I
forgot the exact title.

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:25.900
But it had to do with
famous American scientist.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.121
And each of these kids is
now an author of a book.

00:33:29.121 --> 00:33:32.830
The book has these delightful
stories of the scientists.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.330
The kids emphasized, of course,

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:38.400
the high school experience
of the famous scientists.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.620
I think you must know some of them here.

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:42.583
Charlie Townes is in the book.

00:33:45.025 --> 00:33:46.290
And these students wrote

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:52.170
a really lively story of these scientists.

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:56.363
That was one of the
projects these students had.

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:01.290
So, again,

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:04.690
I wouldn't mind answering any questions

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:08.640
or listening to better stories

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:11.963
on experiences of various kinds.

00:34:15.910 --> 00:34:18.963
- [Audience Member] Einstein
has say that David Bohm,

00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:22.520
David Bohm is his intellectual successor.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.353
- Yes.

00:34:23.353 --> 00:34:24.525
- [Audience Member] So, what do you think

00:34:24.525 --> 00:34:26.445
about David Bohm's quantum theory?

00:34:26.445 --> 00:34:28.460
- (laughs) David Bohm.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:29.507
Well, uh.

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:34.430
He's a very interesting guy, but I don't,

00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:37.030
I mean, I think if you want
to learn quantum theory,

00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:39.370
there are probably

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:41.493
better

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.743
educational books on quantum theory now.

00:34:45.687 --> 00:34:49.500
And he is, I think his book is rather old,

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:50.870
and I don't remember,

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:53.410
I can't really tell you if it
was one of the better books.

00:34:53.410 --> 00:34:55.170
But by now you can find

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:59.590
some really good quantum
mechanics books available

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:02.190
that are more modern, more up to date.

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:04.003
David Bohm was an interesting guy.

00:35:05.337 --> 00:35:07.140
But that's a complicated story

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.870
of his problems and so on.

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:13.960
I think he was,

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:18.470
actually, when he was
real political troubles,

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:21.523
many of us were very sympathetic
to his point of view.

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:26.670
- [Audience Member] Hi, I'm Sherry Shee

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:29.670
from The Exploratorium,
a museum in San Francisco

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:33.010
that was founded by Frank
Oppenheimer back in 1969.

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:34.362
And I was wondering,

00:35:34.362 --> 00:35:36.020
did you visit museums when you were a kid,

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.150
and did you know the Oppenheimer brothers,

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:40.106
and if you can tell us
some stories about that?

00:35:40.106 --> 00:35:42.871
- (chuckles) Museums, yes.

00:35:42.871 --> 00:35:45.060
I always lived in New York City,

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:48.400
and we had a plethora of museums,

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.940
and I liked to go to museums,

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:54.123
especially the Museum of Science
and Industry in Manhattan.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.350
I certainly went to the museums.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:00.897
Now, you asked about Oppenheimer.

00:36:00.897 --> 00:36:05.897
I knew both Frank
Oppenheimer and, what's the,

00:36:08.557 --> 00:36:10.970
(chuckles) Robert Oppenheimer.

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:13.900
That was part of our life.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:17.683
It was a political problem.

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:24.190
The story of Oppenheimer
is well documented.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:26.283
There are several books on the subject.

00:36:29.311 --> 00:36:33.543
He was, of course, a heroic
figure in World War II

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:38.943
having led the research which
led to the nuclear bomb.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:44.653
Then he was, I think, dumped on by,

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.920
because he was

00:36:50.068 --> 00:36:51.683
a free thinker and,

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:58.074
although he made a huge contribution

00:36:58.074 --> 00:37:01.383
to the war effort in World War II,

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:05.980
he was unpopular in the military

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:10.980
and they eventually, for reasons
which are very complicated,

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:18.860
his efforts

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:23.070
to help the United States
were thwarted by people

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:26.963
who felt politically he was
not correct enough for them,

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.610
so he retired to Princeton

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:36.610
where he was director for the
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:41.140
But his scientific
career was sort of ended

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:44.403
by a dramatic experience
he had politically.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.903
- [Audience Member] Leon, I'd
wondered whether you'd talk

00:37:49.903 --> 00:37:52.210
just a little bit about your experiences

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:55.200
in the end of 1956

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:59.943
when violation of parody was discovered.

00:38:00.851 --> 00:38:03.703
- Ah, '56, parody, parody, yes.

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:08.123
I'm gonna (chuckles) try
to remember what happened.

00:38:14.295 --> 00:38:15.212
I'm really,

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:21.510
drawing a kind of blank as
to the sequence of events

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:25.134
which led to--

00:38:25.134 --> 00:38:27.460
- [Audience Member] Let
me ask more specifically,

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.620
when did you hear about
Madame Wu's result,

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:33.080
and when did you start
doing experiments yourself?

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:33.913
- Thank you.
- What did you know

00:38:33.913 --> 00:38:35.290
about other people who were
racing to get the results

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:36.766
at the same time?

00:38:36.766 --> 00:38:40.040
- We had the benefit at Columbia

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.580
of having Tsung-Dao Lee,

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:45.520
who was a professor of
physics at Columbia,

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.140
and he was one of the authors

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:52.621
along with Frank Yank of the notion

00:38:52.621 --> 00:38:56.580
that one of the

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:59.733
basic laws of physics,

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:05.580
which we all believe in,
conservation of parody,

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:09.310
might not be actually a valid

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:12.853
idea.

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:19.940
And there was evidence,
if I remember right,

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:24.840
from various experiments
to indicate that perhaps

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:27.800
one of these basic, sacred laws of physics

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.920
we all thought was certainly valid

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.400
might in fact

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.033
not be valid.

00:39:37.802 --> 00:39:42.070
And they gave us, they actually proposed

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:43.520
a series of experiments

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:47.480
that might test the
validity of this notion.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:51.960
One of the dramatic consequence of this

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.700
has to do with mirror symmetry,

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.800
that if you look in a mirror,

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.990
let's say one wall of
this room is a mirror,

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:02.130
and all you guys are doing experiments,

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:03.570
and the guys in the mirror

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:05.990
are of course doing the same experiments,

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:07.203
the question is,

00:40:09.698 --> 00:40:12.530
is the symmetry such that

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:18.720
both the mirror experimentalists

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:22.563
and the real experimentalists
get the same results?

00:40:23.778 --> 00:40:26.767
And 99% of physicists or more would say,

00:40:26.767 --> 00:40:28.817
"Of course, they must get the same results

00:40:28.817 --> 00:40:30.897
"because that's just the mirror image

00:40:30.897 --> 00:40:33.050
"of what's going on here."

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:36.910
But much to everybody's surprise

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:41.683
and to the wisdom of Lee and Yang,

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.393
they

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:48.180
decided that perhaps the
symmetry was not perfect,

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:51.570
that there was violation
of mirror symmetry,

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:53.060
and that the mirror world

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:56.750
was not precisely the same as our world.

00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:59.870
And they made that part of their

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.260
paper

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.290
which gave rise to the notion of,

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:09.050
well, can we check this experimentally?

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:14.050
And of course the story was
that when experimenters,

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:19.010
now full of doubt about the
validity of mirror symmetry

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:22.240
and went at it and made tests,

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.440
we found out that the symmetry

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.430
between the world and the
mirror world was not perfect.

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:29.610
That was a major discovery,

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:32.830
because for 50 years or so,

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:35.457
people believed that the mirror world

00:41:35.457 --> 00:41:37.933
and the real world were identical.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.330
How can it be different?

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:44.330
But it turned out that it was known

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:48.040
as the mirror symmetry was broken.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.660
It was not a correct symmetry,

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:52.610
and that made a big
change in our philosophy

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:54.123
of how particles behave.

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:57.453
That was very exciting.

00:41:58.610 --> 00:41:59.950
Every once in a while

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:04.010
you get epochs of great
excitement in physics

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:07.950
where you're rushing to do an experiment

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:11.650
and you're not sure you know
what the results will be.

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:15.710
And it's the greatest joy
when in fact it turns out

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:19.270
that the kind of results you expected

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:21.760
don't turn out to be the correct results

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.460
but something totally
different takes place.

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:27.350
And that's what happened
during the parody days.

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:31.280
We discovered by careful experiments

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.970
that the mirror world and the real world

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:35.040
are actually different.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.323
There are differences.

00:42:37.316 --> 00:42:41.870
And that was a period of great excitement.

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:44.540
Now, we're used to it and we understand

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:47.100
the violation of mirror symmetry.

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:47.933
Yeah?

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:50.680
- [Audience Member] Professor Lederman,

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:54.410
do you remember, what were you doing--

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:56.450
- Make a little space
between you and microphone.

00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:58.100
- [Audience Member] What were you doing

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:00.380
when the Nobel Prize committee

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:04.440
notify that you have one the Nobel Prize?

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.315
And what's your first,
what's your feeling,

00:43:07.315 --> 00:43:08.915
when the first time?

00:43:08.915 --> 00:43:11.880
- Let me say, winning the Nobel Prize

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:13.842
is something I recommend very highly.

00:43:13.842 --> 00:43:15.450
(audience laughs)

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:17.423
It really is a lot of fun.

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:20.003
This,

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:25.900
probably as usual, it
happens late at night.

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:27.253
You get a telephone call.

00:43:28.263 --> 00:43:31.970
I think in this particular
case or one very much like it,

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:33.280
my wife had the phone

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:36.860
and we sort of suspected
there would be an award.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:38.540
It was rumored and so on.

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:42.697
And she got the telephone
call and she said to me,

00:43:42.697 --> 00:43:44.307
"We can't go to Sweden

00:43:44.307 --> 00:43:46.754
"because I have a dinner date that night."

00:43:46.754 --> 00:43:47.587
(audience laughs)

00:43:47.587 --> 00:43:48.750
And she handed me the phone.

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:53.750
And she was kidding, of course. (laughs)

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:57.140
So, I recommend winning
a prize very highly.

00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:58.390
It's a great thing to do.

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.330
- [Audience Member] I
was actually a student

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:04.870
of yours at Columbia.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:05.980
- You were?
- Yes.

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:07.455
- Oh, yeah, you sat in the third row.

00:44:07.455 --> 00:44:08.288
- [Audience Member] You gave me an A-plus

00:44:08.288 --> 00:44:10.677
in physics in 19-- (laughs)

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:17.570
And was an undergraduate
and graduate student

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:19.603
during most of those yeah.

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:22.993
I got my PhD with Charlie Townes.

00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:29.640
It was amazing to me, and
people have remarked on that,

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:34.640
that almost every professor I
had who won the Nobel Prize,

00:44:35.191 --> 00:44:39.393
and I was wondering if you
had, when you were there,

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:43.470
had a sense of this being
some sort of golden age,

00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:46.410
the other people being--
(Leon laughs)

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:50.030
- Well, as a graduate student at Columbia,

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:51.590
we had a button made

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.443
which we wore occasionally called Not Yet.

00:44:56.443 --> 00:44:58.460
(audience laughs)
And that's because

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:01.890
the faculty at Columbia were
loaded with Nobel Prizes.

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:04.810
There was Rabi, there was Townes.

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:06.373
There was Willis Lamb.

00:45:07.882 --> 00:45:10.573
It was just this star-studded faculty.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:13.840
So, the graduate students would, you know,

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.440
feel a little bit awkward about this,

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.307
so we got this nice button

00:45:16.307 --> 00:45:18.770
that said Not Yet, which
(audience laughs)

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:21.950
was a sense of wild optimism (laughs)

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:24.003
that something good would happen to you.

00:45:24.003 --> 00:45:26.590
- [Audience Member] I
think, two experiences.

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:29.620
First of all, I had a lab on
the 10th floor of Pupin, also.

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:30.453
- Oh, yeah.

00:45:30.453 --> 00:45:32.683
- [Audience Member] But
I remember one morning,

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:35.910
doing experiments, staying up at night

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:37.760
and coming down the elevator,

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:41.670
and I was in the elevator with

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:45.410
Lee and Kusch and Rabi, actually.

00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:46.590
- Three Nobel laureates.

00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:48.940
- [Audience Member] Yeah, I could resist.

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:50.470
The only time I had that much chutzpah.

00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:51.457
I couldn't resist saying,

00:45:51.457 --> 00:45:53.957
"Do you guys realize I'm the
only person in this elevator

00:45:53.957 --> 00:45:55.928
"who doesn't have a Nobel Prize?"

00:45:55.928 --> 00:45:57.310
(audience laughs)

00:45:57.310 --> 00:45:59.633
Gutsy thing for a graduate student to say.

00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:01.960
- Well, it was a great department

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.430
and having those people around was

00:46:06.343 --> 00:46:08.363
a fantastic experience.

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:14.320
And even somewhat lesser creatures

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:17.320
like the Bernardini story

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:20.157
who would always say
(speaks foreign language)!

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:25.000
What you learned there was a
sense of wonder in physics,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.600
that you learn something,
and it's just beautiful.

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:33.130
That, in fact, was a comment made to me

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:38.910
some time ago by my senator in Illinois,

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:41.830
who's now the president
of the United States.

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:46.140
We had a conversation on physics.

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:48.023
He seemed to know a lot about it.

00:46:49.396 --> 00:46:50.910
And what he said to me was amazing to me.

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:54.790
He said, the thing about
science, and especially physics,

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:58.210
he says, is when you
guys make a discovery,

00:46:58.210 --> 00:47:01.120
it turns out to be beautiful.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:04.300
Now, that was a surprise,

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:08.440
because to say something
in physics is beautiful

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.520
is something that
physicists say all the time,

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:13.350
but not when outsiders
are listening, you know?

00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:16.180
You don't want to be bragging (laughs)

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:18.330
about the fact that the
subject was beautiful.

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:21.220
But here was a layperson, in a sense,

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:25.370
who recognized the beauty of science.

00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:28.490
So, I'm very happy about
having him in the White House

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:32.460
to care, hopefully at some point

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.870
supporting the increases

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:41.440
that he really understands
we need in research

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:45.270
and education, which is
what we're all devoted to.

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:47.410
- [Audience Member] I
have to say, I remember,

00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:51.520
among all the professors, that
you really communicated that.

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:54.230
I think this was the,

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:55.240
I don't know there was some sort of

00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:58.486
honors physics for smart freshman and--

00:47:58.486 --> 00:47:59.820
(audience laughs)

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:00.653
Like sophomores.

00:48:01.806 --> 00:48:03.230
And I think the last semester

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:05.810
was optics and atomic
physics or something.

00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:06.643
(Leon laughs)

00:48:06.643 --> 00:48:07.690
Maybe that was the most beautiful

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:10.170
of the subjects, I don't know.
- Right.

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:11.110
There's a guy behind you.

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:13.728
He's bigger, and I would
get out of his way.

00:48:13.728 --> 00:48:16.100
(Leon laughs)
(audience members laugh)

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:17.330
- [Audience Member] Professor, what

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:19.970
in current physics research

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:22.410
do you find particularly exciting?

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:24.340
- Now?
- Yes.

00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:25.173
- Oh, gosh.

00:48:25.173 --> 00:48:29.513
Well, I think it's very clear
to me that what, there's,

00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:35.903
we're in an epoch, I think,
of incredible discovery.

00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:38.890
You can take a deep breath

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:42.030
and sort of sense discovery in the air.

00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:45.843
Part of this discovery
comes from astrophysics.

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:48.960
You know, there's a new subject

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:51.056
called particle astrophysics.

00:48:51.056 --> 00:48:55.270
Particles are the smallest thing
we know about in our world,

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:58.035
and the astrophysics are the large things

00:48:58.035 --> 00:49:03.035
that have to do with
galaxies and stars and so on.

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:07.060
These two subjects are sort
of joined by phenomenon

00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:10.483
that bridge both subjects.

00:49:10.483 --> 00:49:14.650
So, this is a very exciting time

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:17.550
and what will cap the excitement

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:20.150
will be the new machine
that's under construction,

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:24.473
hopefully will start working
within the next months

00:49:28.937 --> 00:49:30.223
in Switzerland in Geneva.

00:49:31.290 --> 00:49:35.050
The large hadron collider, it's called.

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:36.090
That's going to

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:39.540
be like a new telescope, you know.

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:41.000
Galileo, you know,

00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:44.397
made a telescope and looked up

00:49:44.397 --> 00:49:46.950
and discovered the moons of
Jupiter and so many things,

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:51.290
in fact, started scientific astronomy,

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:55.520
and this new machine that's
under construction in Europe,

00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:57.971
which is now participating,

00:49:57.971 --> 00:50:02.760
so all the major nations
are participating in this,

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:07.160
will certainly give us new phenomenon

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:11.780
and will help us understand
many of the puzzles

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:14.563
that are bothering us right now

00:50:14.563 --> 00:50:17.540
that have to do with astrophysics

00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:21.600
and dark energy and
dark matter phenomenon.

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.610
We're in an exciting time.

00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:27.100
I wish that economically we would

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:31.140
overcome our present difficulties

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:35.170
and begin to really

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:42.380
accelerate the kind of research

00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:45.750
that will reveal what's going on.

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:47.090
Yeah.

00:50:47.090 --> 00:50:48.830
- [Audience Member] Leon,
when you were a kid,

00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:51.395
was there some experience or--
- I'm still a kid!

00:50:51.395 --> 00:50:53.750
(audience laughs)
- That's right.

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:55.410
But that started you down the path

00:50:55.410 --> 00:50:58.623
to become a physicist instead
of, say, a Wall Street wizard?

00:50:59.514 --> 00:51:01.560
- I tried Wall Street! (laughs)

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:02.520
I didn't work.

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:04.820
Why did I get into physics?

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:06.298
Actually, in the beginning,

00:51:06.298 --> 00:51:09.940
in high school and early college,

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:11.513
I was a chemistry major.

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:16.690
But little by little I turned to physics

00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:20.100
because chemistry was complicated
and physics was simple.

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:22.040
(chuckles) So I thought.

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:22.873
And

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:26.670
the physicists in the area

00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:29.360
were more dynamic, if you like,

00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:32.670
and physics had a great attraction

00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:35.600
because in some ways, it was very simple.

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:39.690
You dealt with a particle,
two particles, and so on.

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:41.653
Chemistry was very complicated.

00:51:41.653 --> 00:51:43.180
There are all kinds of molecules

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:45.290
sticking out in all directions,

00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:50.230
so I thought physics had a kind of appeal

00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:54.980
because ultimately it
looked for the simplicity

00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:56.870
and try to make the most

00:51:56.870 --> 00:52:00.460
of understanding the
world that we live in.

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:03.900
So, I think that was, for
me, a very good choice,

00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:06.040
is to stay with physics.

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:11.040
Now, some of my best friends
talk to chemists. (laughs)

00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:16.140
- [Audience Member] When you think back

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:18.920
to the history of mankind,

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:20.590
can you mention two or three inventions

00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:23.320
that were most beneficial?

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:25.110
- Inventions?

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:28.730
Well, inventions sort of
implies something that's useful

00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:31.823
like, I don't know, automobile invention.

00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:35.142
That's a good question.

00:52:35.142 --> 00:52:37.870
If I can think of discoveries, I think,

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:39.963
that's a better word than inventions.

00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:42.663
And clearly,

00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:49.780
the fact that we can
understand so much of the world

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:53.260
in which we live is already a discovery.

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.280
I think that's important to know.

00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:59.490
We can understand, we can predict

00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:03.540
Haley's comet will appear 2061

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:06.560
at three o'clock in the
afternoon on Thursday,

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:08.950
and pretty much we can get it right.

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:11.950
So, we know a lot about
the world in which we live.

00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:13.582
But there are a lot of things

00:53:13.582 --> 00:53:15.860
about the world in which we
live that we don't understand,

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:18.110
and the challenge of understanding those

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:20.283
is very great and important.

00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:26.222
We have lots of problems facing us,

00:53:26.222 --> 00:53:30.370
environmental problems and social problems

00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:32.443
and economic problems.

00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:37.520
But understanding the world, I think,

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:39.810
and understanding the
world in which we live

00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:41.770
in a thorough and deep way

00:53:41.770 --> 00:53:44.800
is one of the major tasks we have.

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:49.800
And this is something mankind
has been concerned with

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:52.460
for a long time, and it's still there,

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:56.650
that we do have so many things
that we need to understand

00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:58.513
better than we do now.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.610
- Okay, with that I'd like
to thank Leon for his talk

00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:05.263
and thank all of you for coming.

00:54:06.256 --> 00:54:09.256
(audience applauds)

00:54:12.222 --> 00:54:15.389
(gentle synth music)
