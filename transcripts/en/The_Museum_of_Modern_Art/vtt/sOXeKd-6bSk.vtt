00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.124
Thomas: Here we are.

00:00:12.124 --> 00:00:16.003
There is Jack Smith's picture,
stained glass windows.

00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:19.216
Over there, there's angels up there.

00:00:19.216 --> 00:00:21.064
A lot of things.

00:00:21.064 --> 00:00:23.979
The angels are from Charmin toilet paper.

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:25.514
Cut their little faces out

00:00:25.514 --> 00:00:27.431
and made them into little angels.

00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:30.853
There they are, little cherubs.

00:00:30.853 --> 00:00:33.808
This was actually once a bedroom,

00:00:33.808 --> 00:00:37.191
but as art supplies built
up, built up, there they are.

00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:38.886
Art supplies stacked everywhere.

00:00:38.886 --> 00:00:47.201
These boxes have become a
panorama very much like the Andes.

00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:50.080
As we see, as we move through,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.249
sort of like a mountain rage
that's about to have an avalanche.

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:57.671
Here we have an angel head.

00:00:57.671 --> 00:00:59.754
That's the wings.

00:00:59.754 --> 00:01:00.628
That's the head.

00:01:00.628 --> 00:01:02.545
See, there's the angel.

00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:06.962
But, [unintelligible] are
done, they look like that.

00:01:06.962 --> 00:01:10.559
So it'll look more like
a stained glass window.

00:01:10.559 --> 00:01:15.874
This room, I used to use
as a total work space.

00:01:15.874 --> 00:01:19.358
Eventually, it's filled
up with art supplies,

00:01:19.358 --> 00:01:21.737
which are endless.

00:01:21.737 --> 00:01:24.533
If you try to picture this
room with nothing in it.

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.408
That's how it was when
I first moved in here.

00:01:26.408 --> 00:01:29.409
That's when I was making the
parts for the iconastasis,

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.333
which is now in the Peter Ludwig
Museum in Aachen, Germany.

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:34.834
What's interesting about the iconostasis,

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:37.117
is it could not fit into this room,

00:01:37.117 --> 00:01:39.200
because it's too big for this room.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.092
The iconostasis was made
out of wood, by a carpenter.

00:01:44.092 --> 00:01:48.805
Then, the separate parts had
to be made here, individual.

00:01:48.805 --> 00:01:50.723
The separate parts are a lot
smaller than the whole thing,

00:01:50.723 --> 00:01:52.692
so I made each of the parts.

00:01:52.692 --> 00:01:55.276
The materials in the iconostasis,

00:01:55.276 --> 00:01:57.442
as with most of the art I make,

00:01:57.442 --> 00:02:00.398
are basically household materials.

00:02:00.398 --> 00:02:04.155
Generally, I don't use many art materials.

00:02:04.155 --> 00:02:08.188
I might use a little acrylic
paint or gesso once in a while.

00:02:08.188 --> 00:02:12.100
Okay, yes, the writing is very important.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.625
Taste is everything.

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:16.083
That doesn't mean good taste either.

00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:18.766
Any taste can rise to the level of art.

00:02:18.766 --> 00:02:24.841
Good taste is the last
refuge of the unimaginative.

00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:27.341
This is the room where the sacramentality

00:02:27.341 --> 00:02:34.336
of art is realized in the
fullness of it's concretization.

00:02:34.336 --> 00:02:39.727
Like, there on that very piece
of wood, the mensa, the altar.

00:02:39.727 --> 00:02:41.482
That's where the art happens.

00:02:41.482 --> 00:02:43.191
That's the major altar.

00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:48.781
The minor altar is another piece
of wood that lays somewhere.

00:02:48.781 --> 00:02:52.285
Here is where I make art.

00:02:52.285 --> 00:02:54.913
This is beloved my roommate.

00:02:54.913 --> 00:02:59.832
It's a Bart Simpson doll
and it's an actual skull.

00:02:59.832 --> 00:03:02.619
Very memento mori.

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:04.505
Kind of like sobering.

00:03:04.505 --> 00:03:05.786
(sound of breaking bone)

00:03:05.786 --> 00:03:10.136
Oh! (laughs) (sound of breaking bone)

00:03:10.136 --> 00:03:13.514
Sometimes it hits home, what it really is.

00:03:13.514 --> 00:03:16.766
Then, I feel like Mary Magdalene.

00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:19.726
She always holds those
skulls in the paintings.
