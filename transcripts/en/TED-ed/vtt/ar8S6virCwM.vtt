00:00:08.022 --> 00:00:12.766
It’s 427 BCE and the worst internal 
conflict ever to occur

00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:16.416
in the ancient Greek world 
is in its fourth year.

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:18.620
The Peloponnesian War is being fought

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:24.226
between the city-states of Athens and
Sparta, as well as their allies.

00:00:24.226 --> 00:00:28.721
The Athenians can’t match the formidable 
Spartan army on land.

00:00:28.721 --> 00:00:30.701
So they’ve abandoned the countryside

00:00:30.701 --> 00:00:34.606
and moved inside the walls surrounding 
their city and port,

00:00:34.606 --> 00:00:40.266
now provisioned by a superior fleet 
and extensive maritime empire.

00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.397
The cramped conditions have taken a toll

00:00:42.397 --> 00:00:46.096
and a recent plague wiped out 
a third of the population.

00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:48.436
But city life goes on.

00:00:48.436 --> 00:00:53.026
Archias and Dexileia live 
in the center of Athens.

00:00:53.026 --> 00:00:54.958
As a painter of high-class pottery,

00:00:54.958 --> 00:01:00.652
Archias is relatively well-off and takes 
great interest in the city’s affairs.

00:01:00.652 --> 00:01:07.216
Dexileia, on the other hand, can't
participate in politics or own property.

00:01:07.216 --> 00:01:10.866
The couple are grateful to the gods that 
three of their four children,

00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.646
a son and two daughters,

00:01:12.646 --> 00:01:15.537
have survived past infancy.

00:01:15.537 --> 00:01:18.765
Many parents see daughters as a liability

00:01:18.765 --> 00:01:21.744
since they require dowries 
to find husbands.

00:01:21.744 --> 00:01:24.055
But Archias is confident that his wealth

00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:28.687
will allow him to make good matches
for them without going bankrupt.

00:01:28.687 --> 00:01:31.986
Like many Athenians, 
the family owns slaves.

00:01:31.986 --> 00:01:35.587
Originally from Thrace,
they were captured in war.

00:01:35.587 --> 00:01:39.746
Thratta does most of the housework 
and helps raise the children.

00:01:39.746 --> 00:01:41.671
Philon is a paidagôgos,

00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:45.888
who supervises the son’s education, 
teaching him reading and writing.

00:01:45.888 --> 00:01:49.715
Archias is up early because there’s 
a meeting of the Ekklêsia,

00:01:49.715 --> 00:01:51.346
the assembly of citizens,

00:01:51.346 --> 00:01:53.637
taking place at dawn.

00:01:53.637 --> 00:01:55.816
Before setting out, he burns incense

00:01:55.816 --> 00:01:59.577
and pours a libation at the small shrine 
in the courtyard

00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:02.136
on behalf of his entire household.

00:02:02.136 --> 00:02:06.976
Dexileia will remain at home all day, 
teaching her daughters domestic skills.

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:11.516
Later, she’ll retire to the inner 
courtyard for some fresh air.

00:02:11.516 --> 00:02:13.786
When Archias arrives at the agora,

00:02:13.786 --> 00:02:16.166
the civic and commercial heart 
of the city,

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:19.556
he finds the square swarming 
with his fellow citizens,

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:24.316
native-born adult males who 
have completed military training.

00:02:24.316 --> 00:02:27.997
Attached to the central monument is 
a noticeboard with the meeting’s agenda.

00:02:27.997 --> 00:02:30.726
Today, there’s only one item 
of discussion:

00:02:30.726 --> 00:02:33.215
what to do with the people of Mytilene,

00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:35.055
a city on the island of Lesbos

00:02:35.055 --> 00:02:39.505
where a revolt against Athenian rule 
has just been put down.

00:02:39.505 --> 00:02:44.357
The meeting takes place on a hill west 
of the acropolis known as the Pnyx.

00:02:44.357 --> 00:02:46.216
The word means “tightly packed,"

00:02:46.216 --> 00:02:51.105
and the crowd of 5,000 citizens 
makes it clear why.

00:02:51.105 --> 00:02:55.416
The heralds purify the hill by sprinkling 
its boundary with pig’s blood

00:02:55.416 --> 00:02:57.697
and call for order.

00:02:57.697 --> 00:03:00.506
As everyone sits on benches 
facing the platform,

00:03:00.506 --> 00:03:03.387
the presiding officer opens the meeting 
with the words:

00:03:03.387 --> 00:03:05.556
“Tis agoreuein bouleutai?”

00:03:05.556 --> 00:03:08.527
“Who wishes to address the assembly?”

00:03:08.527 --> 00:03:15.075
One by one, citizens speak, some advising 
mercy, others bent on vengeance.

00:03:15.075 --> 00:03:18.737
A motion is proposed to execute 
all the Mytileneans

00:03:18.737 --> 00:03:20.465
and enslave their women and children

00:03:20.465 --> 00:03:24.705
because they betrayed their Athenian 
allies during a time of war.

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:29.246
A majority raises their right hands 
in favor.

00:03:29.246 --> 00:03:34.326
Once the meeting’s over, Archias heads 
back to the agora to buy food and wine.

00:03:34.326 --> 00:03:37.026
Hundreds have gathered there 
to discuss the results,

00:03:37.026 --> 00:03:39.737
many unhappy with the decision.

00:03:39.737 --> 00:03:43.457
When Archias returns home, 
he tells Dexileia about the debate.

00:03:43.457 --> 00:03:46.387
She thinks that killing the innocent 
as well as the guilty

00:03:46.387 --> 00:03:48.398
is harsh and counterproductive,

00:03:48.398 --> 00:03:50.346
and tells him as much.

00:03:50.346 --> 00:03:54.626
Around dusk, Archias goes to 
a friend’s house for a symposium.

00:03:54.626 --> 00:03:58.687
The nine men drink wine and
discuss the meeting well into the night.

00:03:58.687 --> 00:04:05.073
Archias shares his wife’s opinion urging 
mercy, and his friends eventually agree.

00:04:05.073 --> 00:04:08.126
Before dawn, something 
unprecedented happens.

00:04:08.126 --> 00:04:10.527
Heralds circulate throughout Athens

00:04:10.527 --> 00:04:14.015
announcing the council 
has called another meeting.

00:04:14.015 --> 00:04:16.186
The second debate is equally heated,

00:04:16.186 --> 00:04:19.915
but a new resolution, 
to execute only the leaders of the revolt,

00:04:19.915 --> 00:04:22.012
narrowly passes.

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:23.350
Yet there’s a problem –

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.112
a ship with orders to carry out 
the first resolution

00:04:26.112 --> 00:04:28.278
was dispatched the previous day.

00:04:28.278 --> 00:04:33.146
And so another ship quickly sets sail 
to countermand the order –

00:04:33.146 --> 00:04:36.166
a race of democracy against time.
