00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.475
When's lunch?

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:43.810
(cheering)

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.182
It's just Amy.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.317
I thought you were
a Girl Scout.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.286
Thanks.

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:54.654
Going sailing?

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:55.822
(laughing)

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:59.325
Actually, I'm about to go
take care of some business.

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:01.428
(laughing)

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.398
I'm terrified.

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:07.834
I think Ralphie's
cheating on me.

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:10.503
With what,
a doughnut hole?

00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:12.605
(slight laughter)

00:01:12.638 --> 00:01:14.607
(cheering)

00:01:16.408 --> 00:01:19.579
(whooping and whistling)

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:25.251
Don't you knock?

00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:26.586
We don't knock.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.387
The postman
always rings twice.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.256
(laughing)

00:01:33.592 --> 00:01:35.194
You look
very nice, Amy.

00:01:35.227 --> 00:01:36.295
I like your haircut.

00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:38.231
(audience "ooooh"ing)

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.866
Aren't you just supposed
to deliver the mail

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.301
and not pickup lines?

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:43.469
Come on.

00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:44.637
When are you going
to let me take you out?

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.738
Huh?

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:47.874
(cheering and clapping)

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:51.144
Your breath's already
doing it from there.

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:53.679
(a few laughs)

00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:55.348
(cheering)

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.150
Candy!

00:01:57.183 --> 00:02:01.254 line:85%
Hey!

00:01:57.183 --> 00:02:01.254
(whooping)

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:04.824
Anybody see Candy?

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:07.193
Ralphie, every day
of his life.

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:09.762
Hey, uh, ease up
on the fat jokes.

00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:10.897
That's my
scripted line.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.732
You're blowing
this.

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:13.900
Hey, are
those new jeans?

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:15.234
I like 'em.

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:16.502
Oh, yeah...
Thanks.

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:17.770
Is there a mirror
in your pocket,

00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:19.772
because I sure can
see myself in 'em.

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:22.842
(one man clears throat)

00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:25.811
'Cause that would mean that
we would have had sex.

00:02:25.844 --> 00:02:27.180
(man)
We heard you.

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:29.382
(Bonnie)
No one is even
listening to me.

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:32.418
I think Ralphie's
seeing someone else.

00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:35.888
(laughing)

00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:38.224
Well, we know it's
not his feet.

00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:39.625
(man)
No.

00:02:39.658 --> 00:02:40.793
What the (bleep) is
going on today?

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:43.462
(hooting, toilet flushing)

00:02:43.495 --> 00:02:47.900
Hey, everybody, I just took a
huge dump 'cause I'm so fat.

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:49.569
(loud laughing)

00:02:54.473 --> 00:02:56.275
Ralphie, you're
not that fat.

00:02:56.308 --> 00:02:58.377
For a sperm whale.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.879
(groaning)

00:02:59.912 --> 00:03:01.647
Why?
Why?

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.517
No, every joke is that he's
so fat and you guys love it.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.419 line:85%
(booing)

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.419
No, no, (bleep) you.

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:07.453
What-- no.

00:03:07.486 --> 00:03:08.688
This show is
not funny.

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:09.889
It's disgusting.

00:03:09.922 --> 00:03:12.959
It's a horrible depiction
of an Indian man, first of all.

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:14.393
When is lunch?

00:03:14.426 --> 00:03:15.661
(uproarious laughter)

00:03:15.694 --> 00:03:16.662
No.

00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:18.231
You're all
(bleep) sheep.

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:19.966
These jokes aren't
funny.

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.768
You're just used to the
rhythms and laughing at them!

00:03:22.801 --> 00:03:23.970 line:85%
No!

00:03:22.801 --> 00:03:23.970
(crowd chanting)

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:25.771
Where are you
taking me?

00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:30.776
(cheering and clapping)

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:33.613
(screaming, gun fires)

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:34.914
Amy?

00:03:34.947 --> 00:03:36.582
You look
different.

00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:40.386
Yeah, you know,
I feel different.

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:41.954
(laughing)

00:03:41.987 --> 00:03:44.390
Honey, I've
got terrible news.

00:03:44.423 --> 00:03:46.626 line:78%
(gasping)

00:03:44.423 --> 00:03:46.626
Are you
cheating on me?

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.728
No, the toilet's
broken.

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:50.930
(laughing)

00:03:50.963 --> 00:03:55.001
I was so scared,
jinga-binga-boom.

00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:58.437 line:83%
You got nothing to
bow-wawow-wowow.

00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:58.437
(laughing)

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.373
Dubba-lubba-dubba-chowm-chowm.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:02.408
(laughing)

00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:03.776
La-la-la-lala-la.

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:05.311
(silence)

00:04:05.344 --> 00:04:06.946
Hey,
badda-boom-bop-boom.

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:08.914
(laughing)

00:04:08.947 --> 00:04:10.416
When's lunch?

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:14.620
(cheering, music playing)

00:04:14.653 --> 00:04:17.390
(cheering grows louder)

00:04:19.758 --> 00:04:21.224
(machine winding down)
