00:00:08.245 --> 00:00:13.226
Is it a flying comma,
or a quotation mark chopped in half?

00:00:13.226 --> 00:00:17.885
Either way, you may already be well-versed
in how to use the apostrophe,

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:20.705
but here's a quick refresher on its usage.

00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:23.792
The apostrophe can be used in three ways:

00:00:23.792 --> 00:00:25.550
to mark possession,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.965
to mark contraction,

00:00:27.965 --> 00:00:31.173
to mark the plural of single letters.

00:00:31.173 --> 00:00:35.292
Most of the time, if you see an apostrophe
hovering helpfully near a word,

00:00:35.292 --> 00:00:38.605
it's trying to mark possession 
or contraction.

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:42.552
First, let's look at how the apostrophe
marks possession.

00:00:42.552 --> 00:00:45.666
As you can see, the placement
of this punctuation mark

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:49.298
can really change 
the meaning of a sentence.

00:00:49.298 --> 00:00:52.768
"Those robots in 
the sand are my sister's."

00:00:52.768 --> 00:00:56.596
"Those robots in 
the sand are my sisters.'"

00:00:56.596 --> 00:01:00.799
"Those robots in the sand are my sisters."

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.586
When showing possession, the apostrophe
belongs next to the noun

00:01:04.586 --> 00:01:07.028
that owns or possesses something.

00:01:07.028 --> 00:01:09.986
The noun can be singular or plural.

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:12.172
Proper nouns work, too.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:16.230
So if Lucy needs to get her robots
under control before they cause mayhem,

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.355
those dangerous creatures 
would be "Lucy's robots."

00:01:20.355 --> 00:01:22.451
But what if Lucy was Lucas?

00:01:22.451 --> 00:01:26.788
Would we write "Lucas' robots"
or "Lucas's robots"?

00:01:26.788 --> 00:01:30.744
And what if Lucas gave his robots
to the Robinsons family?

00:01:30.744 --> 00:01:35.425
Would it be "The Robinsons' robots,"
or "The Robinsons's robots"?

00:01:35.425 --> 00:01:40.117
The truth is, even grammar nerds
disagree on the right thing to do.

00:01:40.117 --> 00:01:46.062
The use of 's after a proper noun
ending in s is a style issue,

00:01:46.062 --> 00:01:48.540
not a hard and fast grammar rule.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.015
It's a conundrum 
without a simple answer.

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:54.640
Professional writers solve this problem
by learning what's considered correct

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.401
for a publication, and doing that.

00:01:57.401 --> 00:01:59.690
The important thing is to pick one style

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.311
and stick with it 
throughout a piece of writing.

00:02:03.311 --> 00:02:04.219
One more wrinkle.

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.938
Certain pronouns already 
have possession built in

00:02:07.938 --> 00:02:10.132
and don't need an apostrophe.

00:02:10.132 --> 00:02:14.780
Remembering that will help you avoid one
of the trickiest snags in English grammar:

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.087
its vs. it's.

00:02:17.087 --> 00:02:22.940
"It's" only take an apostrophe when it's
a contraction for "it is" or "it has."

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.835
If you can replace "it's" with 
one of those two phrases,

00:02:25.835 --> 00:02:27.946
use the apostrophe.

00:02:27.946 --> 00:02:30.619
If you're showing possession, 
leave it out.

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:33.960
Otherwise, contractions 
are pretty straightforward.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.588
The apostrophe stands in 
for missing letters,

00:02:36.588 --> 00:02:40.418
and lets common phrases 
squash into a single word.

00:02:40.418 --> 00:02:43.336
In rare cases, you can have 
a double contraction,

00:02:43.336 --> 00:02:46.354
though those generally 
aren't accepted in writing,

00:02:46.354 --> 00:02:48.853
with the exception of dialogue.

00:02:48.853 --> 00:02:52.175
So it's possessive, 
it's often followed by s's,

00:02:52.175 --> 00:02:56.187
and it's sometimes tricky 
when it comes to its usage.

00:02:56.187 --> 00:02:58.203
It's the apostrophe.
