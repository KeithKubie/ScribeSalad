00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.850
JASON SILVA: As we continue
to see our world being utterly

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.850
transformed by
accelerating technologies,

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.040
extending our capacities to
exercise our will in the world,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.060
one of the questions
that keeps coming up

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.370
is, so what is
the future of sex?

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.560
If you think of
communication technologies

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.060
as expressing a desire
for inter-subjectivity,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.780
a desire for telepathy,
a desire to become one

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.020
through an act of
communication as consummation.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.520
Right?

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.809
To share subjectivities
with one another.

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.350
This is expressed by technology,
and this is connected again,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.800
to the idea of sex.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.945
To lose yourself
and find yourself,

00:00:46.945 --> 00:00:49.920
when dissolving the ego in
the hands of somebody else.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.870
The orgasm, as ultimate
little death, but also

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.050
resurrection, right?

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.190
To become more
than whole, right?

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.360
To literally have
all of your desires

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.990
abolished by the plenitude
of their satisfaction,

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.364
as Roland Barthes writes about.

00:01:03.364 --> 00:01:04.280
So what is the future?

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.110
Virtual reality, environments
that stimulate all your nerve

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.050
endings and your sexy
sensors in your body?

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.050
Pornography that
arrests your capacity

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.250
to lose yourself in fantasy,
but maybe plot and execution

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.550
akin to an art film?

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.360
Maybe we'll create settings that
are romantic, so it's not just

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.070
the sex act, but the sex context
that will be packaged and sold

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.174
to us in manufactured
dreamscapes that

00:01:32.174 --> 00:01:34.090
are better than any movie
you've ever watched,

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.131
better than any romantic
comedy you've ever seen.

00:01:36.131 --> 00:01:38.521
To lose yourself in "Breakfast
at Tiffany's," for this

00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:39.520
to be the future of sex.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.260
The future of sex is real
virtualities, virtual realities

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.900
in which we can lose ourselves,
in which our wildest dreams

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.500
and desires can be expressed
in a kaleidoscopic ecstasy.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.580
A multi-colored frenzy
of orgasms and mindgasms.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.780
And man, it's going to transform
sexuality in ways we cannot

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.310
even fathom.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.210
Rubbing our bodies
up against each other

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.560
in the desire for
the sublime is going

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.660
to be merely seen as
a faint memory, right?

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.540
Back in the days, when
we had to do that.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.080
I think what's next will
go way beyond, amplifying.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.680
Just yeah, amplifying
our capacity

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.480
to satiate our desires.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.430
