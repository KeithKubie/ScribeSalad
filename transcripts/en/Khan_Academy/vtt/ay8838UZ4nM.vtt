00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.730
In the last presentation, I
hopefully gave you a little

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.290
bit of an intuition of
what a derivative is.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.920
It's really just a way to
find the slope at a given

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.100
point along the curve.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.210
Now we'll actually apply
it to some functions.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.200
So let's say I had
the function f of x.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.150
f of x is equal to x squared.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.325
And I want to know what is
the slope of this curve.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.220
What is the slope at x is equal
to-- let's say at x equals 3.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.520
What is the slope of x?

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.720
Let's draw out what I'm asking.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.300
Coordinate axis.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.310
x-coordinate, that's
the y-coordinate.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.260
And then if I were to draw--
let me pick a different color.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.690
So we want to say what is the
slope when x is equal to 3.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.590
This is x equals 3.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.240
And of course when x equals
3, f of x is equal to 9.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.010
We know that, right?

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.000
So what we do is we take a
point, maybe a little bit

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.120
further along the curve.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.880
Let's say this point
right here is 3 plus h.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.780
And I keep it abstract as h
because as you know we're

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.720
going to take the limit
as h approaches 0.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.230
And at this point
right here is what?

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.390
It's 3 plus h squared, right?

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.000
Because the function is f of
x is equal to x squared.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:08.700
So this point right here is
3 plus h, 3 plus h squared.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.909
Because we just take the 3 plus
h and put it into x squared

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:12.360
and we get 3 plus h squared.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.000
And this point here
is of course 3, 9.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.340
What we want to do is we
want to find the slope

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.540
between these two point.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.310
I really have to
find a better tool.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.890
This one keeps freezing, I
think it's too CPU intensive.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:29.500
But anyway.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.480
So we want to find the slope
between these two points.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.500
So what's the slope? so it's a
change in y, so it's 3 plus h

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:50.240
squared minus this y minus
9 over the change in x.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:03:03.000
Well that's 3 plus h minus 3.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.780
So if we simplify this top
part or we multiply it out,

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.720
what's 3 plus h squared?

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:19.260
That's 9 plus 6h plus h
squared, and then get the minus

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.520
9, and all of that is over--
well this 3 and this minus

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.730
3 cancel out, so all
you're left is with h.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.890
And even if we simplify
this, this 9 minus

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.892
9, they cancel out.

00:03:34.892 --> 00:03:37.005
So let me go up here.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:49.210
We're left with-- this pen
keeps freezing-- it's 6h

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.040
plus h squared over h.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.500
And now we would simplify this,
right, because we can divide

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.160
the top and the bottom, that
numerator and the

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.260
denominator by h.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:05.200
And you get 6 plus h squared.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.230
So that's the slope
between these two points.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.240
It's 6 plus h squared.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.980
So if we want to find the
instantaneous slope at the

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.560
point x equals 3, f of x is
equal to 9, or the point 3,9,

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.450
we just have to find the limit
as h approaches 0 here.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:27.670
So we'll just take the
limit as h approaches 0.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.240
Well this is an easy
limit problem, right?

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.620
What's the limit of 6 plus h
squared as h approaches 0?

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.340
Well it equals 6.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.300
So we now know that the
slope of this curve at the

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.970
point x equals 3 is 6.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.600
So if you actually did a
traditional rise over run,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.390
the slope, this change in
y over change in x is 6.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.830
So we have the instantaneous
slope at exactly the

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.140
point x is equal to 3.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.070
So that's useful.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.960
You know if this was a graph of
someone's position, we would

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.570
then know kind of the
instantaneous velocity, which

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:09.820
is-- well I won't go into that.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.710
I'll do a separate
module on physics.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.620
But this was useful, but
let's see if we can do more

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.440
generalized version where we
don't have to know ahead of

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.550
time what point we want
to find the slope at.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.290
If we can get a generalized
formula for the slope at any

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.870
point along the graph f of
x is equal to x squared.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.140
So let me clear this.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:42.470
So we're going to stick with f
of x is equal to x squared.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.180
And we know that the slope at
any point of this is just going

00:05:46.180 --> 00:06:03.050
to be the limit as h approaches
0 of f of x plus h

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.530
minus f of access.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.650
All of that over h.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.590
This part right here, this is
just the slope formula that

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.080
you learned years ago.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.610
It's just change in
y over change in x.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.450
And all we're doing is we're
seeing what happens as the

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.860
change in x gets smaller and
smaller and smaller as it

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:24.860
actually approaches 0.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.090
And that's why we can get
the instantaneous change at

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.250
that point in the curve.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.610
So let's apply this
definition of a derivative

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.490
to this function.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.040
And actually if you want to
know the notation, I think

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.190
this is the notation
Lagrange came up with.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.950
This is equal to f prime of x.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.210
Don't take my word
on it on Lagrange.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.970
You might want to look
it up on Wikipedia.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.250
But this [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.980
derivative of f of
x is f prime of x.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.630
Let's apply it to x squared.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:59.490
So we're going to say the
limit as h approaches

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.790
0 of f of x plus h.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:08.210
Well, f of x plus h is
just-- this pen driving me

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:13.580
crazy-- x plus h squared.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.690
I just took the x plus h
and put it into f of x.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:24.730
Minus f of x--well that's
just x squared-- over h.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:30.490
And this is equal to the
limit as h approaches 0.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.240
Just multiply this out of.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:43.710
x squared plus 2xh plus h
squared minus x squared--

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.350
running out of space--
all of that over h.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.310
Let's simplify this.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.160
This x squared cancels out
with this minus x squared.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.260
And then we can divide the
numerator and the denominator

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:07.005
by h, and we're left with the
limit as h approaches 0.

00:08:07.005 --> 00:08:14.180
Numerator and denominator
by h of 2x plus h.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.470
Well this is easy.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.520
This goes to 0, this
is just equal to 2x.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.640
So there we have it.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.520
The limit as h approaches
0 is equal to 2x.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.650
And this is equal to f prime of
x, so the derivative of f of

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:32.415
x, which is the denoted by f
prime of x is equal to 2x.

00:08:32.415 --> 00:08:33.660
Well what does it tell us?

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.270
What have we done
for ourselves?

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.930
Well now I can give you any
point along the curve.

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:43.464
Let's say we want to know the
slope at the point 16, right.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:51.200
When at the point 16,256.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.870
That's a point along f
of x equals x squared.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.870
It's just 16 and
then 16 squared.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.250
What's the slope at that point?

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.746
Well we now know the
slope is 2 times 16.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.340
So the slope is equal to 32.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.545
Whatever the x value is you
just put into this f prime of

00:09:12.545 --> 00:09:15.750
x function or the derivative
function, and you'll get

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.060
the slope at that point.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.270
I think that's pretty neat and
I'll show you how in future

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:22.100
presentations how we can
apply this to physics and

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.090
optimization problems and a
whole other set of things.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.290
And I'm also going to show you
how to find the derivatives for

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:28.180
a whole set of other functions.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.030
I'll see in the
next presentation.
