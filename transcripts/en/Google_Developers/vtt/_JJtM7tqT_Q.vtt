00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:07.107
So, what we're going to
do now, is we're going to

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:10.410
write a simple application,
that gives gifts to our friends.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.045
And the first thing that we're
going to need to do then,

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:14.047
if we're going to give gifts to
our friends, is we need to

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:15.448
know who our friends are.

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:17.951
So we're going to use the
Social API, to load our list

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.986
of friends, onto the page.

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:22.088
And we're going to begin,
by writing a

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:24.391
"registerOnLoadHandler"
function, that calls a

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:28.161
function "init", which calls a
function "loadFriends,"

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.830
to load our list of friends.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.166
Within the "loadFriends"
function, we create a new

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:36.236
OpenSocial data request,
add into it requests for the

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:39.506
"viewer" and "viewerFriends"
information, and send the

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:41.841
request to the OpenSocial API.

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:43.676
Where it then calls
"onLoadFriends" once the

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:45.545
data has been returned.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.048
The "onLoadFriends" function
does most of the work.

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:50.717
It pulls out information on the
"viewer" and the "viewerFriends"

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:54.821
from the data object, pushes that
list of friends into a list,

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.990
and then displays
the list onto the page.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.326
Finally, we make some small
changes to the gadget XML file,

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:03.063
to allow us to insert the list of
friends into the page.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.565
Now you can see our gadget
in action listing our friends.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.068
For more information on what I
did, and more information on the

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:11.404
Social API, check out the tutorial on
code.google.com under

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.004
the Open Social section.
