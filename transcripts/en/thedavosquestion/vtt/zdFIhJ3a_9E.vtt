00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
&gt;&gt; Anita's question is definitely the right
question to ask. I have to say frankly it's

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.460
incredibly impressive that The Girl Effect
topic is one of the main topic on the Davos

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.900
agenda this year, especially considering the
incredibly challenging financial crisis that

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.159
we're working through so to have this on the
main agenda, on the Davos agenda, in frankly

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:31.599
one of the most popular sessions here amidst
this period of time, is important. Because

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.140
here we are amidst the world's top business
and political leaders all listening and understanding

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.700
better how important it is for us to focus
on supporting adolescent girls in developing

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.270
countries around the world, all 600 million
of them, who really frankly need that support

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.520
from all of us. They happen to be one of the
most neglected, unsupported, at risk parts

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.460
of the global population and our ability to
support them can actually create the most

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.830
impact I think in terms of specific parts
of the population around the world. Helping

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.500
them realize their potential will really help
us as a world population reach our potential.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.420
Thank you.
