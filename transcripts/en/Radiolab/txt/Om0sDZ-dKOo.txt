Speaker 1:          00:00          Wait. Do you want to do, do we should run that just at a classic intro? Sure. Hey, I'm Jad and I'm Robert. This is the radio lab podcast. Yes. The podcast. And, uh, I gotta be honest. I have no idea what we're about to do. This is a,

Speaker 2:          00:15          hello. What's this?

Speaker 1:          00:19          Are we in a boat? No, but we're going to be, Eh, this actually story actually starts in a supermarket. Why did you give me the boat? Was a tease. Yes. That's a tease. That's what a classic. So give me some supermarket, then I'll give you some supermarket.

Speaker 2:          00:33          So

Speaker 1:          00:36          that's hat Walter. See, I asked pat a few weeks ago to hi Pat, by the way. Yes. Pat Walters, regular person here. That is one of our producers. I said, I want him to look for stories about old lobsters. Why? Well, I'm not going to tell you that right now, but you'll see later on, why come I give me a hint? No, I'm not gonna give you a hint, but he found a lady. You could just, uh, introduce yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:57          Do you want me to say whatever you wanna say? Okay. Hi, I'm Bonnie Hasan, I'm a registered nurse and, um,

Speaker 1:          01:05          and Bonnie told us a pretty crazy story.

Speaker 3:          01:07          Did just tell you briefly, uh, what happened was I had just gone to work grocery store

Speaker 1:          01:12          just to just any old day. It wasn't okay.

Speaker 3:          01:15          Tenille Day, nothing special about that day.

Speaker 1:          01:16          And where's this and where's this just

Speaker 3:          01:18          all right. Where I live, little McMurray, Pennsylvania. We about 15 miles south of Pittsburgh. And uh,

Speaker 1:          01:25          the year Jed? Yes. Is 19, 1990 19 August of 1990.

Speaker 3:          01:30          So I was looking around, you know, admiring the new seafood department and I noticed this tank, the lobster tank and a, there were only two lobsters in the tank. One, she says it was really small, but the other one, this huge behemoth

Speaker 1:          01:48          that

Speaker 3:          01:48          well, it's just so massive. How big is big in this case? He like from the tip of my finger to my elbow. Oh, that's big.

Speaker 1:          01:58          Yeah. So she sees this big lobster and she's like, that tank is way too small. She thought the lobster looked cramped. Yeah. So she goes over to the guy behind the seafood counter and she's like, [inaudible],

Speaker 3:          02:10          what are you going to do with this? Take a lobster. And uh, he kind of just let me know that it was a promotional for the new seafood.

Speaker 1:          02:19          Oh, I think it was just this big lobster that would get sent around to different supermarkets when they wanted to attract attention.

Speaker 3:          02:24          Oh, I just made a few more inquiries and worked my way up to the store manager and he referred me to the vice president of the chain and straight away. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Because if they didn't, they couldn't answer my question. I probably was a little bit of a pain. Right. Like what are you going to do with them?

Speaker 1:          02:42          [inaudible] this is the moment where the manager at the store decides, okay, we have a complaining lady. I think I can solve the problem. He makes her an offer.

Speaker 3:          02:51          The bottom line was that I could have him, if I could arrange for him to return,

Speaker 1:          02:59          she could have him, if she could somehow get him back to Maine for Nate. I don't know why. I guess all lobsters are from Maine. He thought so that's the author

Speaker 3:          03:07          like, okay, how do I do that?

Speaker 1:          03:12          That's a good question. Is this Eh, in usual experience? I mean, at least this is one case, this, this actually has a long history of, uh, people rescuing large lobsters. That's true of course. And he's the author of, what is it, the secret life of lobsters. Yeah, the secret life of lobsters. Some people may remember the story of Mary Tyler Moore. No. In 1994, Mary Tyler Moore developed a crush on a large lobster 12 pounder who is named Mr. Grant. He was named spikes in Malibu, California in a restaurant called Gladstone's. She put up $1,000 for the right to rescue him. Wow. Hundred dollars. And then rush limbo heard about this and he called the restaurant and offered $2,000 for the right to eat spike. Well, so what did the restaurant do? They refused, refused. Uh, and there's been other cases since then. Trevor told us that he's actually read about dozens of these lobster rescue stories, but our lobster story is the original lobster story. And he very first, I don't want to make the claim forever for sure, but I'm just saying to stay. If you googled it, this is your opening lobster. All right, so it's still 1990. Yeah. Bonnie having now left the supermarket. She's at home thinking now.

Speaker 3:          04:26          I really, I didn't know what to do

Speaker 1:          04:28          and she doesn't have the laughter yet. She has no lobster yet.

Speaker 3:          04:30          That was when I started calling some of the local animal organizations, animal rescue league, the ASP ca this locally trying to see if there was anybody else there they could help. They really wasn't there. They're more into mammals.

Speaker 1:          04:44          I probably never even heard of such a thing.

Speaker 3:          04:47          He basically told me forget it.

Speaker 1:          04:49          So what are we talking weeks of research here are seven hours. Really?

Speaker 3:          04:52          Oh I was on the phone for hours, but I had the time and it was kind of fun project for her. Yeah, it's a project. Yeah. Cause then I called the Cousteau society because I wasn't never the Cousteau society. And um, they suggest that I call our local newspaper article appeared Saturday morning paper. Oh really? Did I have it right here. It was in crustacean station.

Speaker 1:          05:16          Cruzen like Cruz.

Speaker 3:          05:17          Yeah. Not Cruising, but Cruzen. C. R U. I. S. I. N. K. Presentation. Mick Murray, woman talks supermarket into releasing large lobster. I really didn't talk with him. I'm just quoting now. Yes. It's a long story. It began Friday morning when Mrs Hasan enter the Dyanavel supermarket here and this store is newly opened seafood section. She encountered Nick Nick.

Speaker 1:          05:40          Oh, the lobster has a name. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          05:42          Yeah. It clearly, the king of crustaceans was lounging in a large circular saltwater tank along with several lesser lobsters. They must've done something in the way nick moved, spoke to Mrs Hasan, so she spoke to several giant Eagle employees. This is hasten who described herself as environmentally active. Told them she thought nick might be happier back home and name. Then on someone's where? I really didn't say that. Don't worry. Mrs Hasan was told it was a professional lobster. 70 years old.

Speaker 1:          06:12          70 years old. Yeah. Well, we don't actually know. There's no way to technically age a lobster. Perfectly. Estimates are from 50 to a hundred years for those big suckers. Wow.

Speaker 3:          06:21          I'm not an invite. I didn't say that. I'm not an environmental crazy. I eat lobster, but I think they're over harvested. Nick must be set free. I didn't say that either. I see you pounded him, your sister? Yeah, Nick, they tell me I could have nick if I promise to take him to the ocean is Hazen has no money for such a trip, like a destitute. Anyway, I guess that's what appeared then in this state. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          06:55          and that could have been the end of it.

Speaker 3:          06:59          Saturday morning we got an early phone call and there was this woman on the other end of the line.

Speaker 1:          07:04          I'm Tony Leone.

Speaker 3:          07:05          Angie was saying she was in town for my dad's funeral and yeah, she was returning that afternoon tonight.

Speaker 1:          07:12          No. Yeah, to Maine, Portland, Maine. So I figured I'll just bring him back with me and about, well why would you leave and think to do something like that? Cause he was a massive lobster in a teeny weeny tank that literally he could barely move in. Now there's one other thing I remember she was back in Pittsburgh for her dad's funeral. So is this in any way an Omaj to your dad? Oh my God. He loved lobster. He absolutely loved to eat lobster. To eat lobster. Yeah. He would eat them like crazy, but he also loved it. His oldest daughter would do things that none of his other kids would ever do. Yup. He would know that I would do something like that. He would expect me to do something like that. So anyway, Tony and Bonnie, they're on the phone at first. Finding is actually a little suspicious.

Speaker 3:          07:54          Hello? Are you sure you're not just saying that to eat them? Because I mean no.

Speaker 1:          07:58          And I said no, I wouldn't eat anything that's big. He's, you know, he's too old.

Speaker 3:          08:01          I wish she reassured me and she sounded very nice. So we agreed to meet at Jiminy. Yeah. Yes, that's correct. Now I'm getting my daughter, my youngest daughter, oh, they to hurry up and dressed. They got to go to giant Eagle and the woman met us at the store. She had a two o'clock flight or that she was there with the manager and I didn't know they was going to be a photographer there from the local PBS station in Pittsburgh Anyway. How many bought the biggest styrofoam cooler she could find,

Speaker 1:          08:31          which really is still was a little too small for him. We got him in there, taped it up as best we could

Speaker 3:          08:38          put them in a van and way they would.

Speaker 1:          08:41          When we got to the airport, we get up to the reservation desk, handed him to the stewardess and she put him in a chair in first class. What kind of like, wait a second. We ran coach this last year. Is that from that first? No. The plane then touches down in Portland, Maine where the wildlife police are waiting again. Is anyone able to determine what everyone here seems to have assumed that this lobster comes from Maine? No fact that it probably wasn't caught here. Why'd you say that in Maine? You can't catch big lobsters like that. That's illegal because the big lobsters are the ones that make more babies. Oh. They have size limits that they have on their lobsters. So you are bringing a lobster then to a venue that you reasonably suspect is a foreign place. A foreign country. Wow. But he could make friends. So the next morning the harbor patrol called and said, do you want to go with us? We're going to put him in the water. So we jumped on their boat at a newspaper reporter. Went out in the boat with them that morning too.

Speaker 3:          09:45          Okay, tell me, this is from Maine. Read it to us. Yes. After 1:00 PM as the marine patrol boat locked in 30 feet of water, Tony Leon carefully dropped him dick over this side. She washed in the sink and the choppy frog. Shrouded waters, then grin. I'm glad he made it

Speaker 1:          10:11          at night. It is nice. But here's the real deep question here. When we look at our fellow creatures, we decide, well who can we? Who Do we want to protect? We include some groups and we exclude others. It seems almost entirely arbitrary. For example, why would someone save this lobster? Yeah, I mean a lot of stories not cuddly by any stretch of the imagination. Certainly not soft. I mean, was it, was it its beauty? Well, I actually think that, uh, that lobsters are very attractive. Really. You mean, do you always think that? I have always thought, you know, they're a lobster is like, it's, it's um, how can I say this appropriately for radio? Uh, they're muscular and curvaceous at the same time. You're like Popeye arms, those claws, and then there's that nice curving tail. And I just think that lack of a hunky mass lobster calendar, lobsters, I'm not thousand eight. I'm not talking about that on the radio. That's just weird of you. That can't be the reason why people keep saving lobster. No, no, I know. So what is it? I think that, uh, it has partly to do with our obsession with longevity when it's, when it's one that, that big and that old, suddenly the rules are changed. Here is, here is a creature, you know, that has made it through all the tests of life and it deserves our respect. Now.

Speaker 3:          11:42          He was, he was unique. He was special. And I just felt that, um, didn't deserve to be in that tank as his age. Everything kind of converged at that moment. I am asking my way. I can explain it. It just kind of went with it.

Speaker 2:          12:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          12:20          the story about lobsters. Thank you, pat. I thought of dropping patty into the cushion along with nick, but when I had him upside down, I realized he was kind of attractive in his own right and as if you could pick me up.
