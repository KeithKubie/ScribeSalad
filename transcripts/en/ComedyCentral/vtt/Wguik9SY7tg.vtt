00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.336
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen, the 45th

00:00:03.369 --> 00:00:05.905
and final president
of the United States.

00:00:05.938 --> 00:00:08.007
-(cheers and applause)
-(camera shutters clicking)

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.109
Yes, it's very sad.

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:12.178
It's very sad.

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:13.946
Very sad.

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:16.749
Well, you knew
what you signed up for,

00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:18.818
but thank you for your service.

00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:21.487
-Okay. Bye, Melania.
-(laughter)

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.423
Mr. President,
how do you respond

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:25.525
to the judges rejecting
yet another travel ban?

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:27.360
I reject their rejection.

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:29.328
It's total fake news.

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:31.164
But, sir, people are calling it
your biggest public failure.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.499
<i> You're</i> the biggest
public failure!

00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:36.469
I decide
how big my failures are.

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:38.337
And they're the biggest.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.007
Wait. That's not what I meant.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.408
-Sir, what are you even
accomplishing? -Come on.

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:43.743
-You can't stay mad about...
-(overlapping chatter) -No.

00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:45.645
-(overlapping chatter)
-No. Time... freeze!

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:46.813
(horn plays note)

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:48.848
Sometimes I get so frustrated

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:52.385
that I don't know what to do,
so I just freeze time.

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:55.521
I mean, these reporters
are so mean to me.

00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:58.224
Why can't they be like
my<i> Fox &amp; Friends?</i>

00:00:58.257 --> 00:01:01.794
Like Steve Doocy and Brian Doocy
and Lady Doody,

00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:04.263
and the other idiots
who say what I tell them?

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:06.899
Easy, Donald. You're the king.

00:01:06.932 --> 00:01:08.868
-Time, unfreeze.
-(horn plays note)

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:10.169
-Mr. President?
-...inappropriate, sir.

00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:12.305
-...the question, sir.
-Sir, how do you respond

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:14.240
to Senator McCain's implication
that you're in bed

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:15.975
with half-baked,
spurious nationalism?

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:18.845
I<i> don't</i> respond!
McCain is<i> not</i> my friend!

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:21.114
And you know
who else isn't my friend?

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:26.419
NFL Players, military widows,
Hawaiian judges, Hawaiian pizza,

00:01:26.452 --> 00:01:29.322
everyone in The White House,
that "Me Too" hashtag,

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:31.090
and you people!

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:32.758
Uh, yeah,
we're not your friends.

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:34.994
Yeah, I said it first.
You're not my friends!

00:01:35.027 --> 00:01:36.896
-(indistinct, overlapping
chatter) -Time... freeze!

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.097
(horn plays note)

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.099
But I want them to be.

00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:43.569
And that's why
tonight's theme is "friends."

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:47.573
They're supposed to make me feel
big and strong and big,

00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:50.810
while I make them feel small
and dumb and small!

00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:52.912
That's what friends are.

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:55.114
They're there to serve<i> me.</i>

00:01:55.147 --> 00:01:58.184
This is my castle,
and I'm the queen.

00:01:58.217 --> 00:02:00.052
Oh, I mean the king.

00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:01.454
-Time, unfreeze.
-(horn plays note)

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:03.856
-(indistinct chatter)
-Seriously, sir.

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:06.993
You never talk
about the good things I do good.

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:09.662
I made the stock market
a very big number.

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:11.764
I made jobs that people have.

00:02:11.797 --> 00:02:14.000
Big jobs. Steve Jobs.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:16.969
But he's dead,
but that's not my fault.

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:19.805
That happened during Obama,
and he didn't even call!

00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:21.374
(laughter)

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:22.808
What are you talking about?

00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:25.645
What<i> am</i> I talking about?

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:27.880
I don't like the way
I feel right now.

00:02:27.913 --> 00:02:29.949
They made me feel bad
about myself,

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:32.285
so I'm gonna make them pay.

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:34.987
I'll make them pay big time,
believe me.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.756
Um, we can hear you.

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:39.592
Goddamn it, I forgot
to do the time thing!

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:41.594
Whatever.
I'm the king.

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:43.429
-You're the president!
-You're the president!

00:02:43.462 --> 00:02:46.332
Can you believe it?
Let's roll!
