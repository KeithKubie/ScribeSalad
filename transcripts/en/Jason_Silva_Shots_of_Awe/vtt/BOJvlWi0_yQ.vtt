00:00:03.716 --> 00:00:05.590
This episode of "Shots
of Awe" is brought you

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.980
by the Toyota Prius.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.060
Let's lead the way.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.910
In biology when
there's a mutation,

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.670
and that mutation is
expressed in the organism,

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.010
and it turns out to
improve that organisms

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.360
capacities to survive.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.730
Then that ends up
being a good idea.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.120
That organism will
replicate more widely

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.950
than others and that
idea will spread.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.210
That's biological evolution.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.040
Now with cultural evolution,
we went from trading

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.240
in genes that were
good ideas to trading

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.820
in memes that hopefully
are good ideas.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.070
We've also empowered
individuals all over the world

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.460
to disseminate their means
at the speed of light.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.970
This makes us
crucial players now

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.050
in what's going to
happen in the future.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.740
Like we are now the
number one replicators

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.690
of ideas that can
transform the world.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.630
And we've usurped
biological evolution

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:08.960
with this cultural evolution.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.490
The membrane of mind that
has overcome the planet

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.660
is one in which ideas are
literalized through technology,

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.870
through transformation,
through all the things

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.890
that mankind has done
as a force of geology.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.694
So ideas matter.

00:01:20.694 --> 00:01:22.110
So what are the
ideas that are you

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.568
are going to spread
into the world?

00:01:23.568 --> 00:01:25.440
What are you going
to pay forward?

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.660
What is the possibility?

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.660
What are the good vibes?

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.440
What are the grand
visions that you

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.300
are going to utter
into the ethersphere,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.336
into the mindsphere?

00:01:33.336 --> 00:01:34.710
And this something
that all of us

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.800
should be thinking about
every single time we

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.240
tweet or share or
post or publish.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.030
We're co-writing
the future story.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.300
We decide what happens.
