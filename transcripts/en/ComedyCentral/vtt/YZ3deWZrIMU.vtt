 (upbeat music)

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:06.973
 - Abbi, can you repeat from
 "Just look at me go," so I can

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:08.441 size:88% position:44%
 see this...

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:10.943 align:start position:0% line:0%
- Alana and I are directing
for the first time this season,

00:00:10.976 --> 00:00:11.911 size:88% position:44%
  two episodes each.

00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:13.379
 It's been really cool.

00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:17.850 align:start position:0% line:0%
- [Ilana] Oh, my god, dude,
directing has been fucking dope.

00:00:17.883 --> 00:00:20.019 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
- You let me know if
you need anything, okay?

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:20.853 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 - Thanks, love you.

00:00:20.886 --> 00:00:22.389 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  - Good luck, dude.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.461 size:84% position:42%
  - Watch me go, pretend I
  just left, and go for it.

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:32.165
 So then maybe we'll
 get in Mike's shot,
 it's like right from

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:35.935
me to you, and get that
whole thing in 'oner'.

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:37.570 size:88% position:44%
 - Okay, here we go.

00:00:39.538 --> 00:00:40.673 size:84% position:42%
  (camera clicking)

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:41.541 size:88% position:44%
  Goddamnit!

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:48.081
 So when Ilana write an episode
 together, we split up acts.

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:50.383 align:start position:0%
 It's like we're always trying
 to make the other person

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:52.718 align:start position:0%
 laugh, and when we come
 back, it's like (laughs) see!

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:54.887 align:start size:88% position:13%
And so directing, we
did not direct together.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.689
 We each directed two
 episodes separately.

00:00:56.722 --> 00:01:01.327
But my time in the edit,
before it got to Ilana,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.362
I felt it was the same feeling.

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:07.433 size:84% position:42%
  It was exciting to get to
  fully develop my vision,

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:11.104
 and to finish it up, and get
 to show it to Ilana in the

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:12.371 size:88% position:44%
 next phase.

00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:13.973 size:84% position:42% line:0%
  - So you two have
  the same thermos.

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:15.608 line:0%
- Oh, wow, that's neat.

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:17.176 line:0%
- [Woman] Same wheely cart, too.

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:18.010 line:0%
 - Oh.

00:01:18.043 --> 00:01:19.445 line:0%
- Soul sisters! (laughs)

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:21.414 size:88% position:44%
  - Scene 11, take
  one, and the mark.

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:23.449 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Abbi] It was a really
long day at the Met.

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:24.917
 I was in every single
 scene and directing.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.154 align:start position:0%
 So we have second team, which
 is like stand-ins for us,

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:30.756 align:start position:0%
 so we can set-up the shot,
 see how we like how it looks,

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.291 align:start size:88% position:13%
and then we like how the
action's going to go,

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:34.060
 and then we jump in,

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:37.830
 and while you're in the scene,
 you have to be in the scene

00:01:37.863 --> 00:01:41.033 align:start position:0%
as an actor, but also conscious
of the whole scene as a

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:42.568 size:84% position:42%
  director.

00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:44.670 size:88% position:44%
 It's another layer on top
 of what we've already done,

00:01:44.703 --> 00:01:48.875 align:start position:0%
and it's been really satisfying
for me, in a new way.

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:54.113 align:start position:0%
 - Hey, Margo, can you watch
 my stuff for a second?

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:55.581
I've got money to spend.

00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:57.517 align:start position:0%
 Money is a mind-control
 technique that quantifies the

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.786 size:88% position:44%
 progress of the patriarchy!

00:02:00.986 --> 00:02:02.021
 Yeah, I'll watch your stuff.

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:02.855
- Okay, thanks!

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:03.723
- Yeah.

00:02:06.258 --> 00:02:10.196 align:start position:0%
 - Hello, hello, hello, Beverly
 Baumgarten, we're here!

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.430
 - Hi, there!

00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:13.099
- [Ilana] My first day
of directing, I directed

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:14.300
 Fran Drescher.

00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:18.104 align:start position:0%
  And Susie Essman, and
  Eliot Glazer, my brother.

00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:19.639
It was a dream.

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:22.175 size:88% position:44%
  In the morning, I was like
  (squeals) girl squealing.

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:24.710 align:start position:0%
  That was like really easy,
  the typical coverage.

00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:27.780
 I could simultaneously be in
 it acting, and feeling what

00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:29.782
was funniest, and which
were the best takes.

00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:33.019 align:start position:0%
 Then we got to this shot that
 was "That 70s Show" style,

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:37.957 align:start size:88% position:13%
 360 smoking thing, my
 camera-man's monitor
 was on the floor,

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.260
 so I was watching the scene as
 though I was behind, and then

00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:44.197 align:start position:0%
 once it swiveled to me, I was
 in the scene, that tripped

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.698
me out.

00:02:45.731 --> 00:02:47.767
 But otherwise, I don't find
 it that hard, because it feels

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.270 align:start size:88% position:13%
like we're directing
when we're in it anyway.

00:02:51.303 --> 00:02:53.739 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I think that's
 great. We got it all.

00:02:53.772 --> 00:02:55.241
Because we've been with
our crew for so long,

00:02:55.274 --> 00:02:58.211 align:start position:0%
they can make certain decisions
and have a short hand.

00:02:58.244 --> 00:02:59.946 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
 Our DP, Chris Teague,
 he's incredible.

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.148 align:start position:0% line:0%
  When we were shot-listing,
  for a few times,

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:05.218 align:start position:0% line:0%
  I would have to get up
  and be in the scene to see

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:08.654
 where I would picture
 a camera coming over.

00:03:08.687 --> 00:03:10.623 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm like, "Pan this way,
and then you see it."

00:03:10.656 --> 00:03:12.758
 And he was like, "No, first
 we should see it, and then pan

00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:14.093
 that way? Maybe you're right."

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:15.127 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I'm like, "No,
 maybe you're right."

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.562
 And then we go back-and-forth.

00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:18.364 align:start position:0%
And I'm like, "I think I'm
'Justin Birding' it because I'm

00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:20.233
usually in front of the camera."

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.467
 I'm loving it.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.336 size:88% position:44%
 It's as though this
 final puzzle piece

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.071
is clicking in, for me.

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:29.275
 It takes out a layer of work
 that is: explaining shit to

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.246 align:start size:88% position:13%
 the director, telling
 them where we...

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:34.447 size:88% position:44%
 Oh, my god!

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.781 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Okay, just real quick,
 pan... (smooching)

00:03:35.814 --> 00:03:38.684
Hello! Catcalling dogs! (laughs)

00:03:38.717 --> 00:03:40.152 size:88% position:44%
  It just cuts all that out.

00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:42.655 align:start position:0%
 So it's actually kind of
 easier, in a way, to direct.

00:03:42.688 --> 00:03:44.156
 It really is.

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:46.426 size:88% position:44%
 It's easier to direct your
 own show, in a way, for us.
