- They've got
everything you need

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:04.604 align:start size:84% position:16%
for your linen closet
at Boll &amp; Branch.

00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:05.772
- Hey Nikki.

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:06.573 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Start over, yeah,
Thomas Lennon?

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:08.041
- Hey Nikki.

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.075 align:start size:97% position:3%
This is tough for me because
I come from a long line

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:11.111
of sheet-selling middlemen.

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:11.945
- Okay.

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.180
(laughter)

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.715
- When I hear,

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:18.184
I love hearing about this
wonderful company and how,

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:19.352
- Yeah, I'm sure you do.

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:20.587 align:start size:84% position:16%
- They've got
these great sheets,

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:23.490
but keep in mind there
are middlemen out there,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.324
- [Andrew] Yeah.

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:25.825
- Mmhmm.

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:27.093
- Who are trying to jack up
the prices on your sheets.

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:29.329
- Well, they need
to find new work.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:30.997
- Oh my god, this attitude,

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:33.867 align:start size:84% position:16%
I feel is pervasive
in America now.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.068
(laughter)

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:36.336 align:start size:88% position:13%
We used to be a country
of middle people.

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:37.170
(laughter)

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.405
Not just men.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.273 align:start size:84% position:16%
- We've got two
middles across the,

00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:41.941
(laughter)

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:42.776
- [Thomas] Hi Nikki.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.310
- Partition from us.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.779
Andrew Collin's here, Mike
Recine is here, and now.

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:47.580
- I don't have time to
meet everybody, guys.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.949

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.353 line:0%

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:56.222 line:0%
You know him from Reno 911.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:59.959
He is now the author of
the young adult book,

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.630
Ronan Boyle and the
Bridge of Riddles.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.464
- We can say hit.

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:05.298
- Hit.

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:06.132
- We can say hit.

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:07.067
- Hit book.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.168
I cannot believe,

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:09.102
- Right now.

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:10.070
- You wrote a children's book.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.970
- I know, right?

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.805
Who does that?

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:12.639
- You.

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:13.873 line:0%

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:14.808 line:0%

what is going on, man?

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:15.742 line:0%

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:16.709 line:0%
- [Nikki] You are so prolific.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:17.977
- Take a day off, guy, I know.

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:19.212
- You also have a
series, Teachers,

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:20.713
on TV Land every
Tuesday at ten pm.

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:22.715
This guy is everywhere.

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:26.219 align:start size:97% position:3%
Thomas Lennon, one of the
funniest people that exists.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.053
- Mmhmm, oh thanks, Nikki.

00:01:27.053 --> 00:01:27.887
It's nice to see you.

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:29.089
Last time I saw you...

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:29.889 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I can't believe
I'm friends with you.

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:31.157
- I know, it's weird.

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:32.425
Last time I saw you we
were together on like,

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:33.359
one of those game shows
that you have to sit at

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.394
for like nine hours straight.

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:35.628
- So many hours.

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:37.130
- And it seems like
it's gonna be fun,

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.831
and you're like, and they
throw a ton of money at you

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:39.099
(laughter)

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.400
and I'm like, this
is gonna be great!

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.901
And like, hey, meet
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:44.037 align:start size:97% position:3%
And then Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
doesn't say shit to you,

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:45.505
all day and it's really weird.

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:46.773
- Nothing, not a word.

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:47.607
- Was he mad at me?

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:48.441
What happened?

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.442
- We talked and yeah.

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:50.610
- He was mad at me.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.678
Because it was like...

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:53.113
- It was you.

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:55.715 align:start size:97% position:3%
- It was just like Kareem's
vibe was so chilly.

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:56.983
- It was not...

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:58.218
- I thought we were
gonna goof around.

00:01:58.218 --> 00:02:00.353 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Listen, that taping
hasn't aired yet.

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:01.721 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Right, right,
right, we did a...

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:03.990 align:start size:88% position:13%
- That day was a
little bit like trying.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.191
We did a game show.

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:06.159 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yes, you, me,
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.093
(laughter)

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:08.261
- Who else was on it?

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:10.463 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
and Vivica Fox.

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:11.731 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yes, that's
right, that's right.

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:12.866
- And then you and me.

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.334
The classic foursome.

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:16.603
- Oh my god, gettin'
the gang back together.

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:17.537
(laughter)

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:18.972
Everyone wanted it.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.473 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And then, right before
we're shooting the game show,

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:21.608
the set caught on fire.

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:23.009
- Oh yes!

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:24.344 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So, like nothing happened
for like five hours.

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:27.514
- And then there was a
weird beeping going on,

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:29.349
in my trailer, that you came...

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.583
- I came and fixed your trailer.

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:31.818
- Yeah, I was just ...

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:32.986 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Which is kind of how
porno movies start.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:33.820
(laughter)

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.588
- Like, hey Nikki.

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.724
- That was so nice of you,

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:39.125 align:start size:84% position:16%
I just remember
being in my trailer,

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:42.562 align:start size:94% position:6%
there's this like
piercing beeping going on.

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:43.496
- Yeah, I'm a mid-Western guy.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.031
- I was just meditating,

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:47.033
I guess I'm just gonna
have to deal with this,

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:48.368
and then Thomas came in.

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:49.469
- It was a carbon
monoxide warning.

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:50.436
(laughter)

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:51.404
- I was just slowing dying.

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:52.906
- And the great thing is,

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:54.440 align:start size:97% position:3%
I came in and I turned off
the thing that was warning you

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.976
assuming that you would just
fall down dead at some point.

00:02:56.976 --> 00:02:57.844
(laughter)

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:59.345
- It was so fun.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:01.381 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I either saved your life
or quietly killed you.

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:03.016
- You do a lot of those
shows though, right?

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:05.084
Like, I've done a lot
of those game shows.

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:05.985
Enough.

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:06.920
- Enough.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.454
- That you look at the run,

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:10.790
I didn't know who was gonna
be there until I got there,

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.126
and I was hoping for a
good cast, like a fun.

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:14.761
- God, I thought I
was gonna pal around

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:16.062
with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:17.564
- Did you?

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:18.932
- I was like, what if he and
I get a Vespa with a sidecar.

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:20.200
(laughter)

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.869
We're gonna have some
times, me and Kareem.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.671
Then he came in and
be like, hm, hello.

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:26.339 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I just helped him
with his marker a lot.

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:29.909
- And he was so serious when
it came to playing the game.

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:30.843
- [Nikki] Oh.

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:32.078
- What kind of game was this?

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:33.580 align:start size:88% position:13%
- It's called To Tell
the Truth, or something.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.917
- So yeah, it's three people
telling, two of them are lying

00:03:37.917 --> 00:03:41.321 align:start size:94% position:6%
but they all say, like
I'm an alligator wrangler.

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:42.589
- (together) I'm an
alligator wrangler.

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:45.325
I am an alligator wrangler.

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:47.193
- And then you have to guess,

00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:48.995 align:start position:0%
and then you ask some questions
to figure out who's...

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:50.196
- I think you're all lying.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:50.863 align:start size:88% position:13%
- And they all look like
alligator wranglers.

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:52.131
- They do!

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:53.333
You convince, we were
both bad at the game.

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:54.300 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I was really, really
bad at it, yeah.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.268
- We kept losing.

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:56.302
It's a hard game.

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:57.136
- Yeah.

00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:58.705
- But it was...

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:00.039
- It was fun to hang out with
your for nine hours though.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.840
(laughter)

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.775
- It was so long.

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:04.777
And it was so cold in there.

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:06.613 align:start size:84% position:16%
- But you were also
basically nude,

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:07.847
- Yeah, that's true.

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:08.848
- Which was your,
that was on you.

00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:09.716
- That was on me.

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:11.150
That was on my stylist.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.752 align:start size:97% position:3%
You know sometimes you
just, they don't really know

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:14.787
what the vibe of the show
is, and they dress you...

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:17.957
- You were wearing jeans and
like a tiny bit of duct tape.

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:18.891
(laughter)

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:20.827
- No, I was dressed so slutty.

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:21.761
- Like, it worked, yeah.

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:24.230
- I just, sometimes, I just,

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.366
you know you go into
these styling sessions.

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:28.401
- Hey, it's show business.

00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:29.669
- Exactly.

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:30.970
- Sometimes just go in and win.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:31.938
- Just...

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:34.073
(laughter)

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:35.975
- Well, you know what
happens all the time

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:38.478
with these stylists, is I
go in for these fittings.

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:40.280
- Tell me about it, I
know it's like my life.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.547
(laughter)

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:43.616
- I'll put on a bra and
they're like that's it!

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:44.717
That's the look, oh
my god, I'm dead!

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:47.353
- Honey, bra, duct tape.

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:49.455 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And then I convince myself
that's all I need to wear

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:51.491 align:start size:88% position:13%
is a bra because in
the fitting it looks...

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:52.825
- Twizzlers, bra.

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:54.360
(laughter)

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.029
Glitter, sprinkles.

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:57.630
- And then, oh man, that was...

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.464
- Mist.

00:04:58.464 --> 00:04:59.299
- Cream cheese.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:00.833
- Sierra Mist.

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:03.202
- But I was so excited to
be with you on that show,

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:06.272
because I had worked with
you before on At Midnight.

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:08.308 align:start size:88% position:13%
You were an Executive
Producer on At Midnight.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:09.642
What a fun show that was.

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:10.743
- We competed on that
show I think, and you

00:05:10.743 --> 00:05:11.978
- We did, a couple times.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.080
- I'm sure you beat
me a couple times.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.682
- I think I did but you
were also really good...

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:16.516
- I used to lose
that show a lot.

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:17.350
- At that show, too.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.184
- Not, well...

00:05:18.184 --> 00:05:19.018
- You weren't?

00:05:19.018 --> 00:05:19.852
- I was there a lot.

00:05:19.852 --> 00:05:20.787
- You were there a lot.

00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:21.988
- Which if that counts as good,

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:23.189 align:start size:84% position:16%
I don't know if
that counts as good.

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.990 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I think so, just
participating.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.924
- I participated.

00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:25.858
- You won the participation.

00:05:25.858 --> 00:05:26.526 line:0%
- I got most participation.

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:27.327 line:0%
(laughter)

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:28.561 line:0%
- You were there a lot.

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:30.196
That was such a fun
show, At Midnight,

00:05:30.196 --> 00:05:33.066 align:start position:0%
and that was the first time
that I had worked alongside you,

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:35.468 align:start size:88% position:13%
having been a fan of
yours for so many years,

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:39.205
so it just like blew my mind
that I got to even meet you.

00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:43.209 align:start position:0%
I of course, know you from your
character Lieutenant Dangle

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:46.145
from the Reno 911
series and movie.

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:48.681
- That's an under-rated,

00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:49.882
weirdly, that's an
under-rated movie.

00:05:49.882 --> 00:05:51.517
- It's so funny.

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:53.052
- I know.

00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:54.487
- I went and saw it in the
theaters, Crestwood Mall.

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:55.088 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Boy I thought that
movie was gonna do better.

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:55.922
- Yeah?

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:56.756
- Yeah.

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:58.191
- Tell me about that.

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.425 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You know how every
time, you're like always,

00:05:59.425 --> 00:05:59.959 align:start size:84% position:16%
stylists are always
like, just wear a bra?

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:01.461
- Yeah,

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:02.662
- My life is, I thought that
movie was gonna do better.

00:06:02.662 --> 00:06:06.232
- Yeah, I mean, so what
does that feel like?

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:07.967
Because you've had your
hands in a lot of movies.

00:06:07.967 --> 00:06:11.971
I mean, you've written a lot
of, you write a lot of movies.

00:06:11.971 --> 00:06:13.239 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I've got some
hits and some flops.

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:14.807
- Also, Andrew's a
dog walker, so...

00:06:14.807 --> 00:06:16.075
(laughter)

00:06:16.075 --> 00:06:17.543
- I was, it's been
three weeks, post.

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:18.644
- Yeah.

00:06:18.644 --> 00:06:20.213
- I know how you feel.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:22.081
- What movies have you written?

00:06:22.081 --> 00:06:25.118 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'll go like biggest
hit, biggest flop.

00:06:25.118 --> 00:06:28.054
Biggest hit would be Night at
the Museum with Ben Garant.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:29.222
- Amazing!

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:31.591 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Biggest flop, would
probably be Taxi

00:06:31.591 --> 00:06:33.159
with Queen Latifah
and Jimmy Fallon.

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.193
(laughter)

00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:35.027
- You wrote Taxi?

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:35.962
(laughter)

00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:37.196
I've never even seen Taxi,

00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:38.131
but of course we
all know about it.

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:38.931
- The Pacifier, with Vin Diesel.

00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:40.133
- I mean, this guy.

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:41.667
- Herbie: Fully Loaded.

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:44.937
Hell Baby, um... oh
man, there's a lot.

00:06:46.372 --> 00:06:47.507 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Did anyone, did you guys
know that Thomas Lennon

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:48.741
wrote these movies?

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:49.909 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, thay're
tattooed on my back.

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.477
- No, you don't, his IMDB?

00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:52.412
(laughter)

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:54.647
- [Nikki] Wow, we don't need...

00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:58.818
- My IMDB goes so far,
it's mostly butt crack.

00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:01.254
Everything I did in
the 90s just crack.

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.423 align:start size:88% position:13%
- What does that feel
like, when you feel like

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:04.857
- When something flops?

00:07:04.857 --> 00:07:05.825 align:start size:97% position:3%
- A movie's gonna be,
yeah, when something flops?

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:07.226
When it doesn't go the way...

00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:08.961 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Reno 911 was interesting
'cause it opened,

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:10.463
I think today, it would be,

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:12.031 align:start size:94% position:6%
it made 10 million dollars
or something like that.

00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:13.466
- Yeah.

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:16.002 align:start size:94% position:6%
- And I was like, it
only, it cost $10,000,000.

00:07:16.002 --> 00:07:17.437
- Okay, so that's ...

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.838 align:start position:0%
- Yeah, it was like a moderate,
it ended up making money

00:07:18.838 --> 00:07:20.072
in like video and
stuff like that.

00:07:20.072 --> 00:07:21.741
But we got called, like
you get a call Monday

00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:23.776
from the head of the
studio, and I remember

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:25.311 align:start size:94% position:6%
we got a call from the
head of the studio at Fox.

00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:27.046 align:start size:84% position:16%
And he's like, "Boy,
I really thought

00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:28.281
"this was gonna
do better, guys."

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:29.782
And like, oh yeah, us too.

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:32.118
And he's like, "That's okay,
I mean, we're friends now,

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:33.352
and everything, but ..."

00:07:33.352 --> 00:07:34.387
No, it sucks, it's
like they kinda,

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:36.289
it's like a minor break-up.

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.291
- When do you get
the numbers in?

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.293
Say it's released
on Friday, right.

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:42.728 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Generally they can tell,
they can track a movie,

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:45.031
here's what's weird,
they can track a movie

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:48.601
the Wednesday before
it comes out, kind of.

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:50.570
'Cause for like real
flops that we've had,

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.104
like Taxi, we got a call,

00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:54.941
the producer called us to
say he was leaving town

00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:57.510
the Thursday night before
it was even coming out,

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.846
and he was like, hey
we're all gonna be

00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:01.647
radio-active for a while.

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:03.950 align:start size:97% position:3%
Yeah, and then he like left
the country on his jet.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:04.884
(laughter)

00:08:04.884 --> 00:08:06.018
- But was Taxi a bad movie,

00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:07.186 align:start size:84% position:16%
or people just
didn't really see it?

00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:08.354
- Both, all of the above.

00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:09.856 align:start size:88% position:13%
It was both a bad
movie, that no one saw.

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:10.790
So it's a perfect storm.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:11.624
- That's not your fault though.

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:13.693
- Uh, kind of, kind of.

00:08:13.693 --> 00:08:14.527
- He did write it.

00:08:14.527 --> 00:08:15.728
- Yeah.

00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:17.230
- No, but once you,
but the thing is

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.698
that most people don't know
is that you write a script

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:21.067
and it's no longer yours.

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:22.802
Unless you're a producer on it.

00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:24.403 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well, unless you're
doing like art house movies

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:25.238
that you pay for.

00:08:25.238 --> 00:08:26.439
- Yeah, so.

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:27.373 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
- If you're in
big studio movies,

00:08:27.373 --> 00:08:28.975
they're gonna chime in for sure.

00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:31.844
- Was that a rude awakening
for you, as a screenwriter,

00:08:31.844 --> 00:08:33.846
when your first movie kind
of got out of your hands,

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:35.448 align:start size:84% position:16%
and you were like,
what is happening now?

00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:37.783
- You know what is weird,
the first movie we wrote

00:08:37.783 --> 00:08:41.954 align:start size:97% position:3%
was called, Let's Go To
Prison, based on a book called

00:08:41.954 --> 00:08:44.123
You Are Going To Prison,
that Bob Odenkirk directed.

00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:46.859
And we actually saw a cut
of it that we really loved,

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:50.162
and then the studio took
the movie away from Bob,

00:08:50.162 --> 00:08:52.999
and they're like, and
it was doing okay,

00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:56.102
and they're like, let's make
it really upbeat and cheerful,

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:58.337
so there's like a whole new
ending and the first time

00:08:58.337 --> 00:09:00.506
I saw the movie with
it's new everything

00:09:00.506 --> 00:09:02.074
was in the movie theater.

00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:03.709
And I'd brought like
20 people to see it.

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:07.346
And I was like, this
thing sucks, I'm sorry.

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:08.748 align:start size:84% position:16%
And then we all went
to Buca Di Beppo.

00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:11.517
(laughter)

00:09:11.517 --> 00:09:13.019
- So that can happen.

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:13.953
- All I can say is when
you have a real disaster,

00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:15.221
go to Buca Di Beppo after.

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.689
(laughter)

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:18.224
You're gonna feel better,
get the lemon chicken.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.660
Try to sit in the Pope Room.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.894
(laughter)

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:25.431
It takes the sting
off of epic failure.

00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:28.301
- What is the most obnoxious
thing about this business?

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:30.369
- About the movie business?

00:09:30.369 --> 00:09:32.238
- Yeah, about just, the
business in general.

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:34.006
If there's one thing you
could change about it,

00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:35.241
like is there something that,

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:37.043
have you just like
accepted everything?

00:09:37.043 --> 00:09:37.977
- The big thing I would say is

00:09:37.977 --> 00:09:38.778
just don't take it personally.

00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:39.712
It's not personal.

00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:40.947
- Have you done that at times?

00:09:40.947 --> 00:09:42.415 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh sure, if, as soon
as you can get over

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:43.950 align:start size:97% position:3%
taking everything personally,
Ben and I actually wrote,

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.685 align:start size:94% position:6%
so we have a book out now,
it's not my first book,

00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:48.454
but the first book I
ever wrote was called,

00:09:48.454 --> 00:09:50.022 align:start size:81% position:19%
Writing Movies for
Fun and Profit.

00:09:50.022 --> 00:09:50.957
- That's right!

00:09:50.957 --> 00:09:52.458
- And "Fun and" is crossed out.

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:54.460 align:start size:94% position:6%
So it's actually called
Writing Movies for Profit.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.962
(laughter)

00:09:55.962 --> 00:09:57.363 align:start size:97% position:3%
And the big thing that we
say is once you can get over

00:09:57.363 --> 00:10:00.266
how bad your feelings
are gonna be hurt,

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:03.169
like most of the time, you
can, you'll get through it.

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:07.006 align:start size:88% position:13%
But you gotta get
ready to be like, yeah.

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:08.140
- Pretty...

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.275
- Yeah, it's gonna, yeah.

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:10.209
- It's gonna sting.

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:11.344
- Yeah, it's not for everybody.

00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:12.845
- It isn't.

00:10:12.845 --> 00:10:15.081
But it gets easier, once
you have faced rejection,

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:16.415
and the criticism.

00:10:16.415 --> 00:10:17.817 align:start size:81% position:19%
- This is a big
conversation I had

00:10:17.817 --> 00:10:20.353 align:start size:97% position:3%
with one of my best
friends, Ken Marino, I said,

00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:23.389 align:start size:97% position:3%
you gotta be really careful
as an actor and as a comedian,

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:28.260
that because you're used
to so much disappointment

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.531
that at a certain point
you've gotten so good

00:10:32.531 --> 00:10:35.835
at being numb to it, that
you also don't experience

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:37.870
any happy parts
or the good part.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.105
- Oh yeah!

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:40.339 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You've gotta be really
careful about that,

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:41.907 align:start size:88% position:13%
'cause you'll get so
good at just being like,

00:10:41.907 --> 00:10:45.211 align:start size:84% position:16%
I don't care, I
didn't care anyway.

00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:46.379
You gotta be careful.

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:47.913
- That's a really good point,

00:10:47.913 --> 00:10:51.017
and I read something, I
bought one of those books

00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:53.786
you know that's on the
racks at Hudson News

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:56.489
where it's just like
generic titles like,

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:57.323
- Like how you're
gonna do something?

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:59.125
- Mental Toughness.

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:00.393
- Right.

00:11:00.393 --> 00:11:01.894 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Like it was called
Mental Toughness.

00:11:01.894 --> 00:11:03.396
And it was just a bunch of
different articles about it,

00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:04.864
and one that I read that
really resonated with me,

00:11:04.864 --> 00:11:08.267 align:start size:94% position:6%
is that athletes that
are like, elite athletes,

00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:11.437
when they suffer, so
they have the Olympics

00:11:11.437 --> 00:11:13.639 align:start size:88% position:13%
to look forward to
every four years, right.

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:16.509
And in between that is all
these World Championships,

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:19.478 align:start size:88% position:13%
and World Championships
mean a lot to them.

00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:21.280
Now if they lose at
a World Championship

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.683 align:start size:88% position:13%
and they let that defeat
really get to them,

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:25.718
then they aren't gonna be
ready to start training

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:28.320
for the Olympics which
is still on their plate

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.989 align:start size:84% position:16%
coming up in a
couple years anyway.

00:11:29.989 --> 00:11:34.160
So they've learned to not,
to take a hit and to be like,

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.495
that hurt, that sucked
but not to wallow in it,

00:11:36.495 --> 00:11:38.197 align:start size:88% position:13%
because otherwise you'll
lose out on training

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:40.132
but also they talk a lot about

00:11:40.132 --> 00:11:42.635
how they celebrate their wins.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:48.808
They really go hard and like,
because I think to your point,

00:11:48.808 --> 00:11:51.477
we don't let in the
happiness either.

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:53.012
- Yeah, you gotta,
you can't get so good

00:11:53.012 --> 00:11:55.948
at being numb to stuff that
you don't notice the good.

00:11:55.948 --> 00:11:56.782
- How do you celebrate?

00:11:56.782 --> 00:11:58.250
- I don't really.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.518 align:start position:0%
- How are you going to celebrate
the release of this book,

00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:01.420
Ronan Boyle and the
Bridge of Riddles.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.391
- It's a hit, right
now, it's number one

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:07.827 align:start size:94% position:6%
in Children's Europe Books
on Amazon by the way.

00:12:07.827 --> 00:12:09.061
- Really?

00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:11.664
- I'm crushing the Who
Was Princess Diana book.

00:12:11.664 --> 00:12:13.733
(laughter)

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:15.968
I'm just saying, that's
the number two spot,

00:12:15.968 --> 00:12:17.470
I'm the number one spot.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.238
- In the UK?

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:20.973 align:start size:97% position:3%
- My life long goal was,
there'll be a children's book

00:12:20.973 --> 00:12:22.608
explaining Princess
Diana to children,

00:12:22.608 --> 00:12:25.444
and I will crush
it with my might.

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:30.549
- How are you so good
at so many things?

00:12:30.549 --> 00:12:31.817
How did you write,

00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:33.786
when did you get into
children's literature,

00:12:33.786 --> 00:12:35.554 align:start size:94% position:6%
when did you go, I'm
gonna take a stab at that?

00:12:35.554 --> 00:12:36.922
I mean, you've written movies

00:12:36.922 --> 00:12:38.524
for the same kind of age group.

00:12:38.524 --> 00:12:40.526
- And it's more sort
of like young adult,

00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:42.795 align:start size:88% position:13%
actually, a funny adult
could read it too.

00:12:42.795 --> 00:12:44.029
- Yeah.

00:12:44.029 --> 00:12:48.200
- So, it's really for
like, high school kids,

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.603 align:start size:94% position:6%
who are funny or grownups
who like funny stuff.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:51.403
- Great.

00:12:53.239 --> 00:12:54.306
- And the answer is
I write compulsively,

00:12:54.306 --> 00:12:55.741
so I'm always doing something.

00:12:55.741 --> 00:12:57.009
- You write compulsively?

00:12:57.009 --> 00:12:58.277
- I do, yeah.

00:12:58.277 --> 00:12:59.278
- You wake up every
morning and write,

00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:00.212
or what's your writing...

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:00.913
- Yeah, or I'll write late.

00:13:00.913 --> 00:13:01.847
Yeah, sometimes.

00:13:01.847 --> 00:13:03.349
- And is it therapeutic for you?

00:13:03.349 --> 00:13:06.385 align:start size:94% position:6%
Do you feel like if you
don't, what is the desire?

00:13:06.385 --> 00:13:07.319
- I'll be sad,

00:13:07.319 --> 00:13:08.053
if I don't do it, I'll be sad.

00:13:08.053 --> 00:13:08.888
- Really?

00:13:08.888 --> 00:13:10.422
- Yeah.

00:13:10.422 --> 00:13:11.223
- Has it always been that
way for you with writing?

00:13:11.223 --> 00:13:12.458
- For a long, long time.

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:13.926
As soon as I got in the
state, and I realized

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:15.361
you had to write to like
be in the show and survive,

00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:17.596 align:start size:97% position:3%
it started to become a
little bit of a compulsion.

00:13:17.596 --> 00:13:19.331
- Yeah, well it's worked out.

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:24.236 align:start size:97% position:3%
This is, we're gonna actually
have our resident lisper

00:13:24.236 --> 00:13:26.739 align:start size:84% position:16%
read, Andrew has a
lisp, and we're gonna,

00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:29.875
we picked a very lispy part
of your book for him to read.

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:30.709
- Let's do it.

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:31.544
- Would you mind?

00:13:31.544 --> 00:13:32.978
- No.

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:34.446
- I didn't know
this was... okay.

00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:35.381
- Oh, you didn't know
this was gonna happen,

00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:36.916
but just start.

00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:38.884 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Now, everyone in the book
has Irish accents also,

00:13:38.884 --> 00:13:42.421
so I hope you've
been working on it.

00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:43.455
(laughter)

00:13:43.455 --> 00:13:44.290
- Dar dar dar dar.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.124
- That's it.

00:13:45.124 --> 00:13:45.958
Wait, what was that?

00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:46.792
(laughter)

00:13:46.792 --> 00:13:48.260
- Dar dar dar.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.695
- This is Ronan Boyle and
the Bridge of Riddles.

00:13:49.695 --> 00:13:50.529
- Where am I going?

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:52.498
"Oy, Nobster..."

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:53.399
- Oh dear!

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:54.366
(laughter)

00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:56.302
Oh no, it's going great so far.

00:13:56.302 --> 00:13:57.703
- "Said a scratchy voice,

00:13:57.703 --> 00:14:00.139 align:start size:88% position:13%
"three figures were
squirreling down at me.

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:02.641

I have ever met.

00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:07.847
"Honestly, I have no
idea why his nickname

he's not even that big.

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:23.729
Newbster?

00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:25.231
- How did I not know...

00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:26.465
- If you need someone to read
the Audible version of this.

00:14:26.465 --> 00:14:28.267
- First of all I read
the Audible version,

00:14:28.267 --> 00:14:30.302
but that's because I didn't
know Andrew was available.

00:14:30.302 --> 00:14:31.537
(laughter)

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:32.771
- You coulda got me so cheap.

00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So, next time just
check the avails.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.075 align:start size:94% position:6%
By the way they didn't
pay me much for it either,

00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:37.877
so before... yeah.

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:38.811
- Can I keep reading?

00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:39.645
No, like to myself.

00:14:39.645 --> 00:14:41.113
(laughter)

00:14:41.113 --> 00:14:42.047 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Oh, yourself, yeah,
keep reading to yourself.

00:14:42.047 --> 00:14:42.882
- I'll let you know when I uh...

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:44.116
- That's your copy.

00:14:44.116 --> 00:14:46.051
Ronan Boyle and the
Bridge of Riddles,

00:14:46.051 --> 00:14:48.721
is a new book by Thomas Lennon.

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:51.724
Funny, you said for
high school kids,

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:53.759
and for adults to enjoy equally.

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:57.096
- Yeah, I think, like
Patton gives a quote

00:14:57.096 --> 00:14:58.330 align:start size:81% position:19%
on the back of the
book, which is,

00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.565 align:start size:84% position:16%
Andrew will you read
the Patton quote?

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:00.599
- Andrew, yes, please
read Patton's quote?

00:15:00.599 --> 00:15:03.068
- "Ronan Boyle," which is you,

00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:04.003
- The book, yeah.

00:15:04.003 --> 00:15:06.405
- Or the book, I'm just funning,

00:15:06.405 --> 00:15:07.606

- I mean, St. Patrick's
Day gift, for your kid.

00:15:57.923 --> 00:15:59.124
- Nikki, what was that?

00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:00.059 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Those people
don't read though.

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:01.493
What holiday's coming up?

00:16:01.493 --> 00:16:02.361 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I mean, do you get
St. Patrick's day gifts?

00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:03.195
- Yes!

00:16:03.195 --> 00:16:04.196
Of course you do.

00:16:04.196 --> 00:16:05.764
- Okay, well now you do.

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:10.002
I'm telling you, Thomas
Lennon there's really no,

people I can imagine.

one of my favorites.

I've been a fan for so long,

00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:22.881 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I'm really excited
about your books

00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:24.283
and I'm excited for kids to,

00:16:24.283 --> 00:16:26.685
we need more funny literature

00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:27.886
- Oh, thanks.

00:16:27.886 --> 00:16:30.255 align:start size:84% position:16%
- For young adults,
and this is it.

00:16:30.255 --> 00:16:33.058
Ronan Boyle and the
Bridge of Riddles,

00:16:33.058 --> 00:16:35.327
get it, order it on Amazon,
I'm guessing it's where...

00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:38.197
- Uh yeah, also if you go, if
you get it at Barnes &amp; Noble

00:16:38.197 --> 00:16:40.265 align:start size:88% position:13%
there's a special
edition that comes with

00:16:40.265 --> 00:16:42.167 align:start size:97% position:3%
the trainees manual in the
back, so I would get that one.

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:43.402
- Oh, get that one.

00:16:43.402 --> 00:16:44.770
- But obviously get
it wherever you like.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.940
- And Nikki I had only
one other questions,

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:48.874
which is when is
this gonna be on?

00:16:48.874 --> 00:16:50.676
- Three weeks.

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:51.810
- Three weeks from now?

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.178
Great, cool.

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:55.080
(laughter)

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.315 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Uh wait, do we
have to go to break?

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:57.616
Did I get, do we, good.

00:16:57.616 --> 00:16:58.851
We have more time,
good, I wanna ask.

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:00.853 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Are we gonna drag
those sheet middle-men

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:02.021
through the garbage again.

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:03.989
(laughter)

00:17:03.989 --> 00:17:05.791
- [Thomas] Sheet middle-men.

00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:06.759
- How do you feel
about Warby Parker?

00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:07.659
You hate 'em?

00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:09.128
- The glasses people?

00:17:09.128 --> 00:17:11.497 align:start size:94% position:6%
I used to know people
that would sell, my family

00:17:11.497 --> 00:17:14.233 align:start size:97% position:3%
used to sell expensive
glasses that you didn't want

00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:16.168
in prescriptions that
were not that great,

00:17:16.168 --> 00:17:18.404 align:start size:84% position:16%
so as long as they're
not against that,

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:21.440
I should be fine with
Warby Parker I think.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.976
- I think we should move on,

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:26.078
- In frames and styles
that you do not want.

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:27.946
- Do you like Tom shoes?

00:17:27.946 --> 00:17:30.115 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I'm gonna like
fan-girl out a little bit

00:17:30.115 --> 00:17:32.718 align:start size:97% position:3%
and ask you about your
character Lieutenant Dangle

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:34.353
from Reno 911.

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:35.421
- Yeah, sure.

00:17:36.822 --> 00:17:37.990 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Can we talk about the shorts
and how those came to be?

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.258 align:start size:84% position:16%
- The way the shorts
came to be is,

00:17:39.258 --> 00:17:40.526
I was like, this guy
should have shorts,

00:17:40.526 --> 00:17:42.461
and then the costume
designer brought in

00:17:42.461 --> 00:17:44.229
like a normal pair of khakis,

00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:45.164
and I was like, no no no no no,

00:17:45.164 --> 00:17:45.898
I don't think you understand.

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:47.132
(laughter)

00:17:47.132 --> 00:17:49.701
I was like, I want it
to be like so weird,

00:17:49.701 --> 00:17:52.838 align:start size:84% position:16%
like weird that
you can't look way.

00:17:52.838 --> 00:17:55.174 align:start size:88% position:13%
So I ended up, the only
reason I found out,

00:17:55.174 --> 00:17:57.342
I just went smaller and
smaller and smaller,

00:17:57.342 --> 00:17:58.610
(laughter)

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.312
and then the reason
I found out how big

00:18:00.312 --> 00:18:01.680
they actually are is
because in the movie,

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.416
the Reno 911 movie, you
see me making a pair.

00:18:04.416 --> 00:18:05.918
(laughter)

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:07.419
Like in an emergency, I
make a pair of the pants,

00:18:07.419 --> 00:18:09.221
so they're actually
from the waist band

00:18:09.221 --> 00:18:11.323
to the hem, is 11 inches.

00:18:12.658 --> 00:18:13.592
- Wow.

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:14.793
- So it's a really small short.

00:18:14.793 --> 00:18:15.861
- Really small short.

00:18:15.861 --> 00:18:16.895
Were those uncomfortable?

00:18:16.895 --> 00:18:18.230
- Oh, hurt like hell for years.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:19.231
- Yeah, I bet.

00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:20.399
- Feels horrible.

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start size:84% position:16%
- What would you
wear underneath that?

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.901
Just a pair of briefs?

00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:24.403
- Briefs, regular briefs.

00:18:24.403 --> 00:18:26.705 align:start size:94% position:6%
But sometimes, since we're
gettin' into it, Nikki,

00:18:26.705 --> 00:18:28.841
sometimes they gave
me smooth briefs,

00:18:28.841 --> 00:18:31.577
so you wouldn't get a bunch
of crinkly lines and such.

00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:32.811
- Yeah yeah yeah.

00:18:32.811 --> 00:18:33.645
- You've got stylists,
you know all about this.

00:18:33.645 --> 00:18:35.114
- I know exactly.

00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:36.682
It makes me feel good that
you as a man have experienced

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:40.085
the tightness and
all the stuff that.

00:18:40.085 --> 00:18:41.587
- Yeah.

00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:45.157
- I mean, wearing, I was, I
got to portray Kurt Cobain

00:18:45.157 --> 00:18:47.259 align:start size:84% position:16%
on a show that's
coming out on Netflix,

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:49.628 align:start size:84% position:16%
where I just dressed
like a boy on TV.

00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:52.531
And it was the greatest
time I've ever had on TV.

00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:53.432
- I'm excited to see that.

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:54.266
- Thank you.

00:18:54.266 --> 00:18:55.200
- Yeah.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.635
- It's called Historical Roasts,

00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:58.504 align:start size:94% position:6%
it's where comedians
dress as dead celebrities

00:18:58.504 --> 00:18:59.872
and roast each other in heaven.

00:18:59.872 --> 00:19:00.672
- Oh my god.

00:19:00.672 --> 00:19:01.607
- Yeah, it's good.

00:19:01.607 --> 00:19:02.841
But I didn't know I was gonna,

00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:04.209
I thought I was gonna
play Princess Diana.

00:19:04.209 --> 00:19:05.377 align:start size:94% position:6%
That's what was
originally pitched to me,

00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:06.645 align:start size:84% position:16%
so I got to set being
like, I'm ready.

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:08.080
And they were like,
you're Kurt Cobain.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.449 align:start size:94% position:6%
And it was, I was scared,
because I've never.

00:19:10.449 --> 00:19:11.283
- Who were you roasting with?

00:19:11.283 --> 00:19:13.051
Is Jeff Ross?

00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:15.254
- Jeff Ross, he's
the producer of it.

00:19:15.254 --> 00:19:17.923
- Jeff got me into the
Friars Club, in 1996.

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:19.191
- Really?

00:19:19.191 --> 00:19:21.093
- Oh yeah, I've been a
Friar, since the 90's.

00:19:21.093 --> 00:19:21.927
- Do you go there a lot?

00:19:21.927 --> 00:19:22.761
- I was there on Friday.

00:19:22.761 --> 00:19:23.595
- What?

00:19:23.595 --> 00:19:24.429
- Yeah!

00:19:24.429 --> 00:19:25.264
- What do you do there?

00:19:25.264 --> 00:19:26.098
- Have soup.

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:28.800
(laughter)

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.103 align:start size:97% position:3%
But, like I pay like
thousands of dollars a year

00:19:31.103 --> 00:19:32.471
to get to go there
and have the soup.

00:19:32.471 --> 00:19:33.639
- Okay, yes, so it's.

00:19:33.639 --> 00:19:34.740
- Well worth it.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.842
(laughter)

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:38.777
- What, like literally,
what happens in there?

00:19:38.777 --> 00:19:40.012
- Literally nothing.

00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:41.046 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Nothing, but you did
go there on Friday.

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:42.247
- No, there's a barber shop.

00:19:42.247 --> 00:19:43.882 align:start size:84% position:16%
I do, every time,
because I live in LA,

00:19:43.882 --> 00:19:46.151
but I'm a member of
Friars Club New York,

00:19:46.151 --> 00:19:47.619
so whenever I'm in town
I feel this obligation

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:48.987
like I gotta go to
the Friars Club.

00:19:48.987 --> 00:19:50.322
- But what, you just show up,

00:19:50.322 --> 00:19:51.823
or do you tell them
you're gonna come?

00:19:51.823 --> 00:19:52.624
- No, you tell them you're
coming and make a big deal,

00:19:52.624 --> 00:19:54.092
and they're like...

00:19:54.092 --> 00:19:55.227 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Is there a show that
goes on there every night?

00:19:55.227 --> 00:19:56.495
- No...

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:57.996
- It's just a bunch of
people sitting around.

00:19:57.996 --> 00:19:59.331
- There's soup, there's older,

00:19:59.331 --> 00:20:00.566
do you like older people?

00:20:00.566 --> 00:20:01.400
- Yeah...

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.367
- Do you like soup?

00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:03.902
- Yeah.

00:20:03.902 --> 00:20:05.470
- Do you like, I'm trying to
think of what else is there?

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:06.572
- You got me.

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:09.975 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Pictures, so there's
a lot of pictures

00:20:09.975 --> 00:20:13.745
of like Trump on the wall,
and like Harvey Weinstein,

00:20:13.745 --> 00:20:15.647 align:start size:84% position:16%
so my joke, from
like back in the day,

00:20:15.647 --> 00:20:17.149
- Oh right.

00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:18.617
- So my joke is that we have
more predators on the wall

00:20:18.617 --> 00:20:20.752
at the Friars Club, than at the
National Geographic Society.

00:20:20.752 --> 00:20:23.021
(laughter)

00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:26.725
- Oh yeah, they all
hung out there too.

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:27.659
- Yeah.

00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:29.061
- It's a boy's club right?

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:30.295 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Used to be, they
started talking ladies...

00:20:30.295 --> 00:20:31.430
- Gloria Allred was the
first one to be like,

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.131
Girls deserve to be in here!

00:20:33.131 --> 00:20:34.266
- Right, and then
they were like,

00:20:34.266 --> 00:20:35.567
we don't need to be in here.

00:20:35.567 --> 00:20:36.668 line:0%
- Yeah, just like
soup and old men.

00:20:36.668 --> 00:20:38.637 line:0%
- Soup and farts.

00:20:38.637 --> 00:20:40.072 line:0%
- I feel good.

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:42.107
Yeah, Gloria Allred
was the first person,

00:20:42.107 --> 00:20:44.576 align:start size:94% position:6%
I ran into her at another
place that reminds me

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:47.112 align:start size:97% position:3%
of the Friars Club, I ran
into her at the Magic Castle.

00:20:47.112 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh yeah, old-timey
soupy place.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.049
- Such an old man soup place.

00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:54.453 align:start position:0%
And I saw her, you know she
was also in the Michael Jackson

00:20:54.453 --> 00:20:56.922 align:start size:84% position:16%
documentary, as
she's the one that...

00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:58.190
- I haven't seen it yet.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:59.658 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh yeah, don't wanna
spoil it but, he...

00:20:59.658 --> 00:21:00.525
- He's weird, yeah?

00:21:00.525 --> 00:21:01.927
- Nah.

00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:02.761
- [Nikki] Little weird.

00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:03.595
- No he's cool.

00:21:03.595 --> 00:21:05.197
Eats soup though.

00:21:05.197 --> 00:21:06.632
- Oh, he's totally cool, okay.

00:21:06.632 --> 00:21:11.003 align:start size:97% position:3%
- But uh, no I was, I wanted
to like walk up to her

00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:13.505 align:start size:94% position:6%
and be like thank you
for all you do for women,

00:21:13.505 --> 00:21:16.675
and victims, but she was
having dinner with like,

00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:19.411
her nephew or something and
I didn't want to bother her.

00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:21.313
But my friend was
like, you have to!

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:24.549
And so, he pulled, of course
a man, pulled me over to her

00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:25.817
and was like, she loves you.

00:21:25.817 --> 00:21:27.319 align:start size:88% position:13%
And then she goes,
"here's my card, honey.

00:21:27.319 --> 00:21:28.520
"If you ever need anything."

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.722 align:start size:84% position:16%
And she was like,
what do you do honey,

00:21:30.722 --> 00:21:31.923 align:start size:81% position:19%
kind of getting
it out of the way.

00:21:31.923 --> 00:21:33.425
I was like, I'm a comedian.

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:34.693
She's like, you know you can
go to the Friars Club now,

00:21:34.693 --> 00:21:37.062
because of me, and I
was like, thank you.

00:21:37.062 --> 00:21:37.896
- Thank you.

00:21:37.896 --> 00:21:38.830
(laughter)

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:39.865
- I'm still not in, actually.

00:21:39.865 --> 00:21:41.633
Thomas can you get me in?

00:21:41.633 --> 00:21:42.834
- Oh of course.

00:21:42.834 --> 00:21:43.669
- Really?

00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:44.503
- Yeah, yeah yeah.

00:21:44.503 --> 00:21:46.405
- Okay, yeah, again.

00:21:46.405 --> 00:21:47.339
- This just in, if
it's Warby Parker...

00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:48.407
(laughter)

00:21:48.407 --> 00:21:50.108
- It's not Warby Parker.

00:21:50.108 --> 00:21:51.710

funnier than Thomas Lennon,

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:15.067
and now he is writing
young adult fiction,

00:22:15.067 --> 00:22:19.738
and I'm excited for kids to

00:22:19.738 --> 00:22:21.440
Ronan Boyle and the
Bridge of Riddles.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.776

00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:30.115
- St. Patrick's Day.

00:22:30.115 --> 00:22:31.149
- Oh, that's right,
that's right, again.

00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:32.951
- By the way, my last question,

00:22:32.951 --> 00:22:33.885
when is this gonna be on?

00:22:33.885 --> 00:22:35.287
- Four weeks now.

00:22:35.287 --> 00:22:36.688 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, four weeks,
it just moved.

00:22:36.688 --> 00:22:37.756
- It's getting further away?

00:22:37.756 --> 00:22:38.590
(laughter)

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.424
- Yeah, it's bad.

00:22:39.424 --> 00:22:40.592
- That's really weird.

00:22:40.592 --> 00:22:41.927 align:start size:84% position:16%
We got stacked behind
something else.

00:22:41.927 --> 00:22:42.761
Yikes.

00:22:43.862 --> 00:22:45.130 align:start size:88% position:13%
Are we behind the Jenny
McCarthy show now?

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.099
- [Mike] Didn't wanna tell you.

00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:48.767
- God, I'm so jealous of her.

00:22:48.767 --> 00:22:51.503
She wears sunglasses in
all of her interviews,

00:22:51.503 --> 00:22:54.740 align:start size:84% position:16%
'cause like as a
woman, that's a dream.

00:22:55.974 --> 00:22:56.808
- [Mike] Strong.

00:22:56.808 --> 00:22:58.276
- It's a bold choice.

00:22:58.276 --> 00:23:00.545 align:start position:0%
- As an aging woman, all I
wanna do is cancel out my eyes.

00:23:00.545 --> 00:23:03.315
Thomas Lennon, thank you
so much for being here.

00:23:03.315 --> 00:23:04.282 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Always a pleasure,
you're the best.

00:23:04.282 --> 00:23:05.517
- You're the best.

00:23:05.517 --> 00:23:07.018
Guys, when you're
selling online,

00:23:07.018 --> 00:23:09.321

door quickly can be tough.

00:23:09.321 --> 00:23:11.390
That's why you need

00:23:13.692 --> 00:23:17.062 align:start position:0%

00:23:19.631 --> 00:23:23.101 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Nikki I'm sorry, but my
family's been in the business

00:23:23.101 --> 00:23:25.303
of shipping things from a
bunch of different places

00:23:25.303 --> 00:23:27.639 align:start size:84% position:16%
at a bunch of
inconvenient times,

00:23:27.639 --> 00:23:29.107 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Well, I hate to
tell you this but...

00:23:29.107 --> 00:23:30.609
- On their schedule.

00:23:30.609 --> 00:23:32.010
- Your family needs to look
into a different business,

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.512
because ShipStation is really.

00:23:33.512 --> 00:23:34.913
- It's what we do.

00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:37.416
(swipe sound)

00:23:41.353 --> 00:23:43.555
(laughter)

00:23:43.555 --> 00:23:45.857
- Oh god, do you, what are,

00:23:45.857 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start size:97% position:3%
if that's the disgusting habit
you do like out in public,

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.029
what are you doing in private?

00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:53.999
- Sometimes I'll fart in my
hand, and smell my own hand,

00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:55.267
smell my own fart.

00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:56.668
You ever do that?

00:23:57.869 --> 00:23:59.404
- I honestly think that
you're being serious.

00:23:59.404 --> 00:24:00.439
- I am being serious.

00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:01.440
Why would I lie?

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.041
- Why would you do that?

00:24:03.041 --> 00:24:04.509
- I don't know.

00:24:04.509 --> 00:24:06.645
Sometimes you just want the
smell of your own scent.

00:24:06.645 --> 00:24:09.080
(rock music)

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:14.085 line:0%
- Do you get a lot of
feedback on the show,

00:24:14.085 --> 00:24:16.054 line:0%
about me being mean to you?

00:24:16.054 --> 00:24:17.022 line:0%
- Yeah.

00:24:17.022 --> 00:24:18.223 line:0%
- Do people think I bully you?

00:24:18.223 --> 00:24:19.391
- Uh hmm.

00:24:19.391 --> 00:24:20.659 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So tell me a little
bit about that,

00:24:20.659 --> 00:24:22.093
because you've never
really let me know,

00:24:22.093 --> 00:24:25.464 align:start size:97% position:3%
I've had you say it to
people in front of me, like,

00:24:25.464 --> 00:24:28.600 align:start size:84% position:16%
some people say that
Nikki bullies me.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.068 align:start size:84% position:16%
And that's the first
time I hear it.

00:24:30.068 --> 00:24:34.072
- What about just now,
when you just did that?

00:24:34.072 --> 00:24:36.174
- I don't know what they
could be talking about,

00:24:36.174 --> 00:24:38.543
when, I honestly don't know
what they're talking about

00:24:38.543 --> 00:24:41.046
when, 'cause sometimes
you'll tell me like,

00:24:41.046 --> 00:24:45.217
hey Nikki, so my brother
thinkth that you bully me

00:24:46.618 --> 00:24:48.787
thometimeth, and
you make fun of me.

00:24:48.787 --> 00:24:50.188
- Uh huh.

00:24:50.188 --> 00:24:51.389 align:start size:94% position:6%
- And I don't even
understand what they mean.

00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:52.257 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I think it could
be your voice.

00:24:52.257 --> 00:24:53.825
What you just did.

00:24:53.825 --> 00:24:55.861
Kay, do it again.

00:24:55.861 --> 00:24:57.662
(laughter)

00:24:57.662 --> 00:24:59.331
What was that, oh no.

00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:01.099
- Thathafrath.

00:25:01.099 --> 00:25:02.267
- Yeah, that thing.

00:25:02.267 --> 00:25:03.635
- Well, say the word sassafras,

00:25:03.635 --> 00:25:06.004
and let's see if I'm
really that far off.

00:25:06.004 --> 00:25:08.273 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Pretty sure you're
bullying me now.

00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:09.841
Sassafras.

00:25:09.841 --> 00:25:11.209
- Don't try to be funny.

00:25:11.209 --> 00:25:12.143
- Fine, sassafras.

00:25:12.143 --> 00:25:14.579
(laughs)

00:25:14.579 --> 00:25:15.914
South of France.

00:25:17.315 --> 00:25:20.151
- Say, I had some
sassafras, um...

00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:22.954
- From a succotash.

00:25:22.954 --> 00:25:27.792 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I had some sassafras
and succotash in
the South of France.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.094
Do it.

00:25:29.094 --> 00:25:30.595
- I had some sa - wait.

00:25:30.595 --> 00:25:31.930
Do it again, one more time.

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:33.932
- Let's go have some
sassafras and succotash

00:25:33.932 --> 00:25:35.166
in the South of France.

00:25:35.166 --> 00:25:37.602
- Let's go have some
sassafras and succotash

00:25:37.602 --> 00:25:39.437
in the South of France.

00:25:39.437 --> 00:25:40.906
Not bad.

00:25:40.906 --> 00:25:44.409 align:start size:94% position:6%
- What's the scariest
thing for you on a plane?

00:25:44.409 --> 00:25:46.211
- Um, sitting next to you.

00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:48.446
(laughter)

00:25:49.681 --> 00:25:50.849
- You're not wrong.

00:25:50.849 --> 00:25:52.183
- I'm not right.

00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:57.088
- Wait a second, what do
you hate more than anything

00:25:57.088 --> 00:25:58.757
when you fly, truly?

00:26:01.026 --> 00:26:02.394
Sitting next to me?

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:03.428
Is it really that bad?

00:26:03.428 --> 00:26:04.563
- Turbulance.

00:26:04.563 --> 00:26:05.397
- No what is it?

00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:06.231
- Turbalence.

00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:07.098
- Try to say it right.

00:26:07.098 --> 00:26:08.199
- Turbulance.

00:26:08.199 --> 00:26:09.134
Turbulence.

00:26:11.803 --> 00:26:13.772 align:start size:97% position:3%
Do I have food in my
teeth, is that the problem?

00:26:13.772 --> 00:26:14.873
Turbelence.

00:26:14.873 --> 00:26:16.675
Tur-Bu-Lence.

00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:17.609
- There we go, there we go.

00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:19.544
We got there, we got there.

00:26:19.544 --> 00:26:23.448
What about, if you were in
plane crash and survived,

00:26:23.448 --> 00:26:25.150 align:start size:84% position:16%
what would they
send to come get you

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:27.218
to take you to the hospital?

00:26:27.218 --> 00:26:28.920
After the turbu-lance.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.121
- Oh, an ambulance.

00:26:30.121 --> 00:26:30.956
- Huh?

00:26:30.956 --> 00:26:31.957
- Ambelance.

00:26:33.325 --> 00:26:34.292
- How do you say it?

00:26:34.292 --> 00:26:35.460
- Ambulance.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:36.461
Am-Bu-Lance.

00:26:37.362 --> 00:26:38.763
Ambulance.

00:26:38.763 --> 00:26:39.998
- There you go.

00:26:39.998 --> 00:26:43.201 align:start size:84% position:16%
- See, I mean, you try
so hard with words.

00:26:43.201 --> 00:26:47.839
- What did you say today
that was just so not right.

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:50.542
You said it yesterday, and
you tried to get through,

00:26:50.542 --> 00:26:52.978 align:start size:94% position:6%
and you tried to, oh there
was some word, that...

00:26:52.978 --> 00:26:54.379
- Accessible.

00:26:54.379 --> 00:26:55.213
- Oh god.

00:26:55.213 --> 00:26:57.015
(laughter)

00:26:57.015 --> 00:26:58.650
Oh god, okay, wait a second,

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:01.152
so what do you want your
comedy to be to people?

00:27:01.152 --> 00:27:01.987
- Assessible.

00:27:01.987 --> 00:27:02.821
- What?

00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:04.289
- Assessible.

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:06.524 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You said assessable, so
you want people to be able to

00:27:06.524 --> 00:27:07.359
assess it?

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:08.293
- Uh hmm.

00:27:08.293 --> 00:27:09.160
- And like give notes on it?

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.395
- No, I want them...

00:27:10.395 --> 00:27:11.196
- Or do you want it to
be able to reach people?

00:27:11.196 --> 00:27:12.130
- More relatable.

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.098
- Okay, so what's the word?

00:27:13.098 --> 00:27:14.966
- Assessible.

00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:15.934
Accessible.

00:27:15.934 --> 00:27:16.768
- (together) Accessible.

00:27:16.768 --> 00:27:18.570
- Accessible.

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.171
Spell it?

00:27:20.171 --> 00:27:22.374
- A-C-C-E-S-S-A-B-L-E.

00:27:22.374 --> 00:27:24.943
- I don't know if that's right.

00:27:26.044 --> 00:27:27.812
I think it's an I, at the end.

00:27:27.812 --> 00:27:28.747
- Where?

00:27:28.747 --> 00:27:29.914
- Somewhere.

00:27:29.914 --> 00:27:32.550
(laughs)

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:34.719
Does this count as bullying
just making you say words?

00:27:34.719 --> 00:27:36.221
- No, I think...

00:27:36.221 --> 00:27:39.391
- What could I do to make it
count as bullying, because...

00:27:39.391 --> 00:27:40.925
- Yeah, I think it is bullying.

00:27:40.925 --> 00:27:42.894 align:start size:97% position:3%
I think to the outside
people, I think they don't,

00:27:42.894 --> 00:27:45.230 align:start size:84% position:16%
like my mom, doesn't
appreciate it.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:46.398
- Oh, you're mom doesn't.

00:27:46.398 --> 00:27:47.832
Tell me, tell me!

00:27:47.832 --> 00:27:50.602
So your mom listens,
and she doesn't...

00:27:50.602 --> 00:27:52.637
- No my mom doesn't
like the comments

00:27:52.637 --> 00:27:54.072
that you leave on my Instagram.

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:55.273
- Oh, really?

00:27:55.273 --> 00:27:56.541
- Uh huh.

00:27:56.541 --> 00:27:58.009
- Like which ones really
got her upset the most.

00:27:58.009 --> 00:27:59.744
- Probably the one where
you called her a fat whore.

00:27:59.744 --> 00:28:01.146
- I did not do that!

00:28:01.146 --> 00:28:02.080
- Yeah, you did.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.381
- I DMed you that.

00:28:03.381 --> 00:28:05.150
- Oh that was DM,
yeah that was a DM.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:06.885
(laughs)

00:28:06.885 --> 00:28:08.787
- I did not say
that, by the way.

00:28:08.787 --> 00:28:10.388
So your mom is not a
fan of how I bully you.

00:28:10.388 --> 00:28:12.824
- No, my mom is a
huge fan of yours,

00:28:12.824 --> 00:28:15.060
and she thinks you've
helped me a shit-tonne,

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.596 align:start position:0%
but she also doesn't understand
why you're so mean to me.

00:28:18.596 --> 00:28:20.899
- Doesn't she understand
that that's part of why

00:28:20.899 --> 00:28:23.168 align:start size:88% position:13%
you're successful, is
because I'm mean to you.

00:28:23.168 --> 00:28:25.136
- I don't know if
that's part of it.

00:28:25.136 --> 00:28:26.538 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I don't know
that it is either,

00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:29.340 align:start size:97% position:3%
I think that's what bullies
say, so that they...

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.875 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I think you just
gaslighted me.

00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:31.876
- I did.

00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:32.977
- Yeah.

00:28:32.977 --> 00:28:34.646
- I think you enjoy it.

00:28:34.646 --> 00:28:35.480
- I do.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.115
(laughter)

00:28:37.115 --> 00:28:37.949
Cheers.

00:28:40.251 --> 00:28:42.687
