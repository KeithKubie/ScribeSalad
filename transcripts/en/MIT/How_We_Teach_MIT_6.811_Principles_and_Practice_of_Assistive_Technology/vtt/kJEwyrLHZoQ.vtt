CONNIE HUANG: So this
semester we were working on

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.141
[? Clampe, ?] which is an
iPhone mount for the wheelchair.

00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:13.140
And the kind of special
thing about [? Clampe ?]

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.400
was there are
iPhone mounts, there

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.145
are plenty of
iPhone accessories,

00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:18.603
but the client we
were working with

00:00:18.603 --> 00:00:21.910
had kind of a special range
of abilities and disabilities.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.920
So what we were building
for the wheelchair

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.550
was not only a
mount, but also one

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.710
that could accommodate his range
of motion and his strength.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.320
And it ended up
being something that

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.410
was flexible enough
for him and his needs,

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.070
and still allowed him
the kind of independence

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.130
that he wanted in
every day interaction.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.070
VINEEL CHAKRADHAR: So I've
actually done a bit of work

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.570
in assistive
technology in the past,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.557
and it's always
really interested me.

00:00:48.557 --> 00:00:50.390
I think that working
on assistive technology

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.300
is one of the best things
that an engineer can work on,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.230
both because the problem
is quite interesting,

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.550
and because every engineer
wants to build something

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.076
that helps people and this
is one of the best avenues

00:01:01.076 --> 00:01:02.390
to do that.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.060
NATASHA GUNTHER: OK, so the way
this class was presented to me

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.170
was a course six
class that dealt

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.960
with a client with a
disability, and I was like,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.840
oh, I'm course two, obviously
I have no place there.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.750
But what I was told
was actually that you

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.810
can come from completely
different backgrounds,

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.340
the main concept is that
you have a direct impact

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.160
on someone's life throughout
the course of a semester, which

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.160
is something almost
incomprehensible.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.430
And I think you can only get
a course at MIT as real life

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.126
basis in helping a person.

00:01:37.207 --> 00:01:39.040
VINEEL CHAKRADHAR: So
coming into the class,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.980
I actually didn't even
have enough information

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.230
to build expectation almost.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.000
I just knew that it was going
to be an interesting opportunity

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.200
to work on an actual
applied problem.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.450
And the first few years
that I spent at MIT,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.350
I worked on a lot of
theoretical problems,

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.690
both in like coursework
and things of that sort.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.450
And I thought this would be
a really cool opportunity

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.908
to, like, take my skills and
things that I've learned here,

00:01:58.908 --> 00:02:01.320
and work on a real project
with a real person.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.570
I did learn quite a few things
that were unexpected, actually.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.940
In class, there's--
I don't know,

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.720
you're kind of taught that
the things that are, like,

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.470
most complex are the most
grand in a large sense.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.480
But when you're working
with real people,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.070
you tend to sacrifice
complexity to make things work.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.650
Almost where you might
be in a situation

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.180
where, like, a solution that
takes you a thousand times

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.430
longer to implement might
be marginally better,

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.507
but like in the interest
of time and speed

00:02:29.507 --> 00:02:31.090
and moving the process
forward, you're

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.170
going to go for a
simpler solution.

00:02:36.894 --> 00:02:38.435
The thing I learned
from that process

00:02:38.435 --> 00:02:41.940
is that you constantly
have to modify what it

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.780
is you are actually working on.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.430
Because at the end
of the day, it's

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.100
not so much about being
given a problem statement

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.546
that explicitly lists
everything you have to do,

00:02:50.546 --> 00:02:51.920
but more about
building something

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.190
that your client wants.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.648
And the biggest
thing we learned is

00:02:54.648 --> 00:02:57.440
that those desires
can change over time,

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.450
so it's more
important, not-- it's

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.034
more important, to work on
what the client actually wants,

00:03:02.034 --> 00:03:04.450
and build something that you
think he or she will actually

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.300
use, as opposed to
being fixated on what,

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.402
like, the initial project
proposal was to a sense.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.550
NATASHA GUNTHER: Vineel
touched on this a bit earlier,

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.300
but through a team dynamic
and working in multiple

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.350
vary-- iterations
of our design, we

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.250
found that assumptions are
the most dangerous thing.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.630
And when you're moving
through various iterations,

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.060
a full 180 degrees
pivot is not something

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.300
to be afraid of because that
can save your entire project,

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.320
and we found that
it actually did.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.770
We made a lot of
assumptions initially about

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.630
our client Aaron's
abilities or disabilities,

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.490
and we found we
were compensating

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.610
for a problem he never even had
originally, so we did a pivot

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.260
and created an item
that he would actually

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.635
be able to use and enjoy using.

00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:03.830
Each disability has
so many variations.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.180
Aaron defines his
paraplegia as C5 slash 6.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.120
And there's so many
ranges of paraplegia,

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.580
and he doesn't even fit
within one grade of it,

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.290
so I think that gives
you a little bit

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.540
of an idea of how different
each person's disability can be.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.600
And defining your assistive
technology for just that one

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.274
person is the most
important aspect,

00:04:24.274 --> 00:04:25.440
because they're your client.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.250
But I think on a
grander scale, we

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.310
saw a problem within
assistive technology

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.670
is making it accessible to
as many people as possible

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.690
while still satisfying
that disability.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.851
I'd say that's a great
challenge in assistive tech.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.510
VINEEL CHAKRADHAR:
The blogs gave us

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.740
a lot of context,
because to a large degree

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.780
the posts could
be about anything.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.960
And this was important because
we know that we are engineers,

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.830
and sometimes when you're
working on these problems,

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.540
when you get too deep
into it, you almost

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.681
forget why it is
you're doing this.

00:04:58.681 --> 00:05:00.680
And I guess the biggest
thing that the blogs did

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.670
for me is that after a day spent
in, like, the machine shop,

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.180
or a day spent
brainstorming design ideas,

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.529
you could go to the blog and
just read articles about people

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:11.570
with disabilities, the
struggles that they faced,

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.460
how people are looking to
combat those struggles,

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.751
and it kind of gives you a
renewed sense of motivation.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.640
NATASHA GUNTHER:
I'd say it's very

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.440
important for the
professor to realize

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.510
that we may have no experience
with user centered design.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.820
I know these two did, actually,
but I personally did not.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.170
And when it's about
your client, it's

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.210
a lot less about what design
process you are you used to,

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.360
and a lot more about
what the client wants

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.980
to receive from you at
the end of the semester.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.950
So focusing a lot on client,
not making assumptions,

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.940
and-- I think the professors
did a very good job this course,

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.490
though.
