00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.276
&gt;&gt; And before we get started actually, I'd like to mention that there's

00:00:03.276 --> 00:00:05.124
just, you know, FYI, there's different kinds

00:00:05.124 --> 00:00:06.708
of verbs because what I'm looking for

00:00:06.708 --> 00:00:10.099
is really action verbs. So verb, verbs that clearly express an action that

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.580
can tell me that, you know, what, for example, an item could do, 'kay?

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.820
&gt;&gt; Okay?

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.620
&gt;&gt; Not the verbs that represent, for example, relationships, 'kay?

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.076
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:17.076 --> 00:00:19.080
&gt;&gt; So, and the, there, and the ones

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.020
that I've identified und, underlined here actually, I,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.158
I underlined complete sentences so that you kind of we can look at the verbs in

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:29.150
in context. And the first one is this

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.850
sentence that says that the library may need

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.190
to know or to calculate the items a

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.790
patron has checked out, when they are due, and

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.860
any outstanding overdue fines. So I, I will

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.430
imagine that this is representing a situation in

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.224
which you bring up a patron's record and

00:00:44.224 --> 00:00:46.131
you start looking up this information. Is that [CROSSTALK]

00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:50.970
&gt;&gt; The, the patron often wants to know what they have currently checked out.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:51.044
&gt;&gt; Oh,

00:00:51.044 --> 00:00:51.282
alright.

00:00:51.282 --> 00:00:53.260
&gt;&gt; Or when are their due or how much they're owed or.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.100
&gt;&gt; Oh, in fact, and then now that you mentioned it,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.500
I think you sent me. One of the scenarios you sent

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.400
me had to do with that, right, with the patron coming

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.930
in and asking for this information. So yeah, and it makes

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.025
a lot of sense. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to

00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:10.520
model this by adding this three operations to the patron method.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.410
The first one, I'm going to call, itemsCheckedOut and, basically, it's an

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.520
operation, but you don't need to, you know, understand the implementation

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.820
details, but when you call this operation, it will

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.770
give you back exactly this information, so the items

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.864
that are checked out by that patron. The second

00:01:23.864 --> 00:01:25.965
one, I'm going to call it whenDue. That will tell you

00:01:25.965 --> 00:01:29.080
basically when a, when an item is due. And

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.550
the third one is going to be called the outstandingOverdueFines and,

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.510
you know, as the name says, it's going to tell

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.860
you what are the outstanding overdue fines for that patron.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.300
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.306
&gt;&gt; And as you might notice I mean,

00:01:39.306 --> 00:01:41.843
I, I'm going to separate the, the, the attributes

00:01:41.843 --> 00:01:44.085
from the operations by having a separate kind

00:01:44.085 --> 00:01:46.386
of subrectangle so, in this way, it's clear

00:01:46.386 --> 00:01:48.274
what is attribute and what is, what is

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:51.000
an attribute and what's an, what's an operation.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.420
&gt;&gt; Gotcha.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.540
&gt;&gt; And let me see then. Okay, for the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.040
second one you can see that that patron can check

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.990
out books and audio visual materials. So I guess,

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.880
similarly you, you build kind of the record for a patron.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.150
The patron will give you an item and you will record

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.020
the fact that the patron is kind of checking it out.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.730
&gt;&gt; Right. And is that operation related to this,

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.150
the checked out attribute that we did a minute ago?

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.495
&gt;&gt; It is actually because what will happen then again, you know, if we jump

00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:24.975
ahead a little bit would be that every time you invoke this operation. So I'm

00:02:24.975 --> 00:02:26.810
going to represent this as a checkOut operation

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.896
for the patron. Every time you invoke this,

00:02:28.896 --> 00:02:31.920
you will also have to say something about the item and so we will also

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.700
flip kind of that that, that build information in the, in the, in the item.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.904
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:36.904 --> 00:02:39.680
&gt;&gt; Mm, 'kay? And, and finally, here, I can see that

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.660
a patron can request a book or an audio video item Is

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.240
not currently in. So I guess this is referring to items that

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.980
are already checked out but for which there is interest. Is that?

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.770
&gt;&gt; Right. So, particularly, the popular items the patrons want to get on

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.140
the list so that they get notified when it comes back in and.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.204
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:02:57.204 --> 00:02:57.730
&gt;&gt; And check it out.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.570
&gt;&gt; I see. I see. Okay. Then I'm going to do

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.400
the same thing here. I'm, I'm going to add this method,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.510
which I'm going to call request and I'm going to put it

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.340
here in the list of the methods in the list.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.450
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.810
&gt;&gt; Of operations for the, for the patron, okay?
