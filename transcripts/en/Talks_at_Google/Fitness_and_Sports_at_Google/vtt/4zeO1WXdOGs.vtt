[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.907 --> 00:00:07.740
RON KAUK: I've been
around the sun 60 times.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.550
My friend Kenji Hakuta is
one of our board members.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.620
And in his culture, that
means that I've been reborn.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.840
And I love the way that
sounds, because it kind of

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.874
feels like it.

00:00:19.874 --> 00:00:22.290
It's an exciting time to try
to understand your life story

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.310
and what you can
do to help others.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.740
So that's where I'm at.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.570
But I was fortunate to be
born in Redwood City in 1957.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.369
Ended up going to
school at Carlmont High

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.750
School in Belmont.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.420
Like she was saying, in 1971,
because of the adults that

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.930
had set up a class for us
called mountaineering class,

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.076
that we were gluing on
rocks and wood blocks

00:00:42.076 --> 00:00:43.950
in our multipurpose
room, creating a climbing

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.730
wall in 1971.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.960
That's so interesting
to think about.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.186
And I'm so fortunate those
adults were in that place

00:00:51.186 --> 00:00:52.560
to help a guy like
me that wasn't

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.450
that interested in school.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.004
To sit in a classroom with
a desk and all lined up just

00:00:57.004 --> 00:00:57.920
wasn't working for me.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.794
I was staring out the
window up at the hills,

00:00:59.794 --> 00:01:01.734
going, man, I wish
I was out there.

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:03.900
But fortunately, they had
that mountaineering class.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.910
So we would do these little
activities around the school--

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.800
rappel off the
building and all this.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.740
They also offered us a
20 day backpacking trip.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.370
1972, I think I was going to
be a sophomore that summer.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.659
We went up to northern
Yosemite for 20 days.

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.200
And during that 20
days, they gave us

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.170
three days by ourselves.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.670
They'd be accused of abuse now.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.820
There's no doubt about it.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.560
What are you doing with
those kids out there?

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.950
So for three days, I had my-- an
adult will come over and check

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:29.908
on you once in a while.

00:01:29.908 --> 00:01:31.260
I had my campfire.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.270
Light flickered off the boat,
night stars over your head,

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.720
nobody telling you what to do.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.707
How exciting is that
for a 14-year-old?

00:01:39.707 --> 00:01:41.790
Also during that trip,
they offered rock climbing.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.430
And like I say, it is 1972,
so the word extreme was not

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.250
buzzing in the air.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.890
It was conservatively
approached,

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.570
like the art of
protecting yourself,

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.820
responsible adults setting
up ropes for us kids,

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.740
tying the knot securely.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.457
Just climbing these
little climbs.

00:01:54.457 --> 00:01:56.790
But funny thing that happened
that day was our ex-Marine

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.555
coach that we all
really respected--

00:01:58.555 --> 00:02:01.360
because he had a handle on
all of us, amazingly enough--

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.970
bet anybody a
milkshake if they could

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.160
make this particular climb.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.640
I always tell this story
because it's so significant.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.442
I won that milkshake
off a respected adult

00:02:11.442 --> 00:02:13.650
after 20 days in the mountains,
three days by myself.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.566
And I always said, at
that point a way of life

00:02:15.566 --> 00:02:17.250
was laid out for me.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.100
I could see it clearly,
which is interesting

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.290
because the imagination
of a 14-year-old

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.820
is very powerful if the adults
point you in a good direction.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.290
That's part of it.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.070
So then by 17, it was climbing
El Capitan, but responsibly.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.720
We understood the system of
how to protect ourselves.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.470
So the lessons that
are coming through now

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.390
are so profound that you
need to take everything

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.670
you need in a haul bag-- your
food, your water, your shelter.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.211
And you're up there
for days, and you

00:02:43.211 --> 00:02:47.154
have to respect that environment
of the vertical world.

00:02:47.154 --> 00:02:49.320
You have to have the skills
for survival, basically.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.650
And then you recognize how
important water and food are.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.182
So if you're passing a
water bottle to your partner

00:02:55.182 --> 00:02:56.640
1,000 feet off the
ground, you say,

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.570
make sure you have
a good grip on that.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.150
Can you imagine
the story of water?

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.775
That's something we want to work
on in the future for our kids,

00:03:03.775 --> 00:03:05.720
is have a real
understanding about water.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.095
So these are all
the lessons that

00:03:07.095 --> 00:03:09.860
were coming through it,
all those formidable years

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.380
of teenage--

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.180
to have these
initiations almost.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.680
They're like rites of passage.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.660
They're these
challenges we need.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.040
So much can happen
between 14 and 21.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.050
So much can happen
between those years.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.419
This is the environment
I'm in, right here.

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.460
I always say if you can
see the beauty in nature,

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.876
you'll see the
beauty in yourself.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.140
So here's me at 15
years old, completely

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.630
influenced by guys like
Yvon Chouinard, the founder

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.030
of Patagonia and Royal Robbins.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.640
And what I have
hanging off my shoulder

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.140
there is called hex nuts--

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.820
clean climbing.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.950
So they were promoting
clean climbing at that time

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.201
as we started, because
they were using pitons,

00:03:52.201 --> 00:03:54.450
banging them back and forth
in the rock leaving scars.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.550
So Yvon and guys like
him that cared enough

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.190
started this trend
towards clean climbing.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.030
So I was already getting the
hint on respect for nature.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.180
So I want you to see this
big move I was making here

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.260
up at Lovers' Leap near Tahoe.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.070
Do you see that?

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.530
Let me show you again.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.736
I just stood up on that.

00:04:14.736 --> 00:04:16.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.959
That's a huge move for 15 years
old, going up a 5.9 climb.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.380
But again, it was
so conservative.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.161
We had to place
our gear carefully.

00:04:29.161 --> 00:04:30.660
And this is another
exciting thought

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.690
about how the mind develops--
being responsible for yourself

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.330
and learning the art
of protecting yourself.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.370
So again, things
accelerate pretty quick.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.700
At that age, I think there's so
much intelligence in our senses

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.770
to adapt to what's
in front of us

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.900
when we're shown
that it ended up

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.310
where we did this climb,
Midnight Lightning, in 1978.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.727
In fact, we showed
one of the guys

00:04:51.727 --> 00:04:54.310
that had been around longer than
us where the chalk was going.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.770
He thought we were
just joking him.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:56.686
He said, that's funny.

00:04:56.686 --> 00:05:00.330
You guys put chalk up there
to make me think you did that.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.500
So this climb-- the exciting
thing about this climb,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.700
it's in the center of Camp 4,
the National Historic Register

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.920
climbers' campsite.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.900
And people come from
all over the world

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.610
to make this connection
with that climb.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.270
I've met people from
Japan, Australia, anywhere.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.330
And part of their journey
was to do that climb.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.780
There's another one
called Thriller.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.354
And did this in 1984.

00:05:24.354 --> 00:05:25.770
And this was a
climb that everyone

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.450
was trying to get their hand on
that hold I have right there.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.616
But no one had ever done it.

00:05:29.616 --> 00:05:34.321
And I imagine-- I mean, I
got my hand on that hold.

00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:35.820
And then I thought,
well, that's it.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:36.690
That's the end of the problem.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:37.360
I'll just jump off.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.920
But I said, wait a minute.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.910
Let me check above.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.576
And I was searching
for any little hold,

00:05:40.576 --> 00:05:41.580
and there was some moss.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.680
And I popped the moss off
so there was the tiniest

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.452
little edge there.

00:05:45.452 --> 00:05:46.410
And I jumped back down.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.170
I go, it'll go.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.454
This will be another level
above Midnight Lightning.

00:05:50.454 --> 00:05:51.870
There's something
very significant

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.450
in this symbolic idea of
that little edge being hidden

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.660
under that moss, that it would
take you to the next step,

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.454
to another level up.

00:06:00.454 --> 00:06:01.620
So this was called Thriller.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.330
And this environment that
you're in is so profound.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.560
And that's, again, why I
feel that for human beings,

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.920
we need to be around
nature to know who we are,

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.320
to be inspired about who
we are, and to understand

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.002
our responsibility
to natural laws.

00:06:16.002 --> 00:06:18.210
Because there are natural
laws that govern the world,

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.380
that are higher than human laws.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.540
We need our human laws
to keep ourselves intact.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.910
But if we don't follow
the natural laws,

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:24.660
air gets polluted.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.900
Water gets polluted.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.615
And the future
doesn't look good.

00:06:27.615 --> 00:06:28.740
So this is the environment.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.040
I've been here.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.710
I love that tree right there,
trying to imagine how old it is

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.970
and how it grew
from a little seed.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:35.940
This is on El Capitan.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.440
You might recognize
from the videos,

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.740
that rockfall fell
right behind me.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.725
This is a route
called the Zodiac.

00:06:41.725 --> 00:06:43.350
So that's the east
buttress over there,

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.960
where we just had
that big rockfall.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.650
So again, we recognize
the vulnerability of us.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.150
This was on our first descent
on El Capitan called New Jersey

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.790
Turnpike.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.730
It goes up the east
coast of what they

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.330
call the North American Wall.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.845
What a place to
spend your youth.

00:07:04.845 --> 00:07:06.846
And that's why I'm so
adamant about our kids

00:07:06.846 --> 00:07:09.220
and youthful enthusiasm, the
ones that are walking around

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.761
down the streets
trying to figure out

00:07:10.761 --> 00:07:13.040
what to do with themselves.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.230
So like Yvon Chouinard
said once-- he said,

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.730
"Climbing saved my life."

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.240
That's a profound statement.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.460
Climbing saved our life.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.900
And to reflect on these ages,
this stage of life in my teens,

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.709
to think about being able to do
this route called Astro Man--

00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:30.250
maybe some of you
have heard of that.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.190
It's on the east face
of Washington Column.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.160
And we were primed exactly
perfect for this climb

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.840
to do the first free ascent.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.080
We were coming in at about 511
C, if you know these numbers.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.555
And never fell on it.

00:07:43.555 --> 00:07:45.940
Of course, we're climbing
with ropes and all that.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.970
But to be on this kind
of aesthetic granite

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:54.040
and feel yourself a part
of the flow of that cliff

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.270
is hard to even put
words on, actually.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.990
But I think it does lend itself
to this intimate relationship

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:02.620
with nature that can, again,
inspire the humanness in you,

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.820
the senses in us.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.320
This is how we were
first doing it.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.370
You can see on that picture
there's a cot hanging there.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.554
This is before they
invented the actual porter

00:08:12.554 --> 00:08:14.970
ledge, if you've heard of that,
for sleeping up on El Cap.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.830
That was some Navy bunk that my
friend thought was a great idea

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.410
to bring along to sleep on.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.820
And that used to catch the wind.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.440
You'd be pulling it up
the wall, and the wind

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.773
would be slapping it all around.

00:08:24.773 --> 00:08:26.230
But became kind of dangerous.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.080
Again, from 14, the
20-day backpack trip,

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.600
to when I was 21 years
old, I headed back

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.820
into the mountains of Pakistan.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.130
After learning all the
disciplines of climbing,

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.500
the bouldering, the one-pitch
climbs, the free climbs,

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.554
the artificial aid
climbs on El Capitan,

00:08:43.554 --> 00:08:45.220
going to the Canadian
Rockies, doing ice

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.520
climbing-- all that was
put into this expedition

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.540
to Pakistan in
1979, where we had

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.250
29 porters from the
local area to walk back

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.866
for seven days with us.

00:08:56.866 --> 00:09:00.105
We walked past villages
that were self-sufficient.

00:09:00.105 --> 00:09:02.480
I was trying to convince people
of the good boulders they

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.160
had around.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.050
So our base camp
was at 14,000 feet.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.750
We had a 2,000-foot ice
gully to get to the base

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:16.715
of our 3,000-foot rock climb.

00:09:16.715 --> 00:09:17.590
I always make a joke.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.600
Right now, if some
documentary filmmakers

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.620
came and asked me,
"Ron, we'd like

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.706
to go back and recreate
that and go to that climb

00:09:22.706 --> 00:09:23.830
and make a big documentary.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.020
We'll pay you $5 million
dollars," I'd say,

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.316
no, I'm good.

00:09:27.316 --> 00:09:28.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.340
That's why I have
so much respect

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.734
for youthful enthusiasm.

00:09:31.734 --> 00:09:32.650
There was four of. us.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.000
We had six haul bags.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.430
We melted snow on
ledges for water.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:40.120
We were on the wall for 10
days to get to the summit.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.630
Once you got to the
summit, it was a pinnacle.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.380
And you could stand
there and look around.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.129
You could see up to
K2, the second highest

00:09:47.129 --> 00:09:48.140
mountain in the world.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.056
And the only way down
was the way you came up.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.880
Big adventure and
no rescue possible.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.060
You were so on your own.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.880
There's someone up there.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.980
Uli Biaho, it was called
in the Trango Valley.

00:10:08.202 --> 00:10:10.160
It's funny to even see
yourself standing there.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.390
It's hard to believe
that even happened.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.850
Which led me back to Yosemite.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.440
And like she was saying, I've
been so fortunate in the timing

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.300
to be able to do a
lot of first ascents

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.147
on such aesthetic,
beautiful rock.

00:10:21.147 --> 00:10:23.230
This is in Tuolumne Meadows,
a route called Peace.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.860
So I share some of
the rock climbing,

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.320
because it's been
profound as my teacher,

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.880
as a way to develop
myself and understand

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.399
the experiences,
like I was saying,

00:10:37.399 --> 00:10:38.940
and try to learn
something from them.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:43.170
But ultimately, what it's
gave me is a sense of place.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.590
I feel 100% connected
to Yosemite.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:50.197
In fact, one of my transitions
of time was when I hit 40.

00:10:50.197 --> 00:10:52.030
And there's a few things
that were going on.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:53.780
But the one thing that
was profound for me

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.650
is that I was
coming into Yosemite

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.470
on my motorcycle, a little
Honda 250, just cruising.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.552
And I went past this
thing called Fern Spring.

00:11:00.552 --> 00:11:02.010
And I was coming
around the corner.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.480
It's kind of a
little blind corner,

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.010
but you could see Bridal
Veil Falls with the rainbow.

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:07.280
And I was just looking at it.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.738
And all of a sudden,
I looked down.

00:11:08.738 --> 00:11:11.680
There was a car coming
at me the wrong way.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.080
And I was just like, hoo.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.820
My whole body went
into slow motion.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:15.930
And I had this thought.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:17.570
Get out of the way.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.222
I moved to the side,
because there was

00:11:19.222 --> 00:11:20.430
other cars coming along, too.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:24.800
And I got past the car, but my
leg hit the bumper and broke.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.424
And I rolled past
it and fell over.

00:11:26.424 --> 00:11:28.590
And I was laying there in
the road with a broken leg

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.240
after all those years.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.070
Even 19, went climbing
without a rope when

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.278
you're going to live forever.

00:11:33.278 --> 00:11:35.010
Been through all
these risky things.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:36.099
And here, that happened.

00:11:36.099 --> 00:11:37.890
And the crazy thing
that happened two weeks

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.710
before that is I played a victim
in a first responder course

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.720
exactly like that.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.100
That's just nuts, right?

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.270
I was laying there,
and the paramedics say,

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:46.140
you'll be all right.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.230
I'm like, yeah, yeah,
it's just my leg.

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.563
And I go, man, it's just what
I was saying two weeks ago

00:11:49.563 --> 00:11:51.420
in that first responder class.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.830
How am I supposed to
make sense of that?

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.520
But anyways, it was such
a shock to my system to--

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.280
I don't know if anybody's
broke a bone, but it's intense.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.840
So then I had an
experience after I

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.250
left for six weeks, healing.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:03.930
I had a cast all up my leg.

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:05.029
And I had a walking cast.

00:12:05.029 --> 00:12:06.570
And I happened to
be standing in what

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.540
they called Valley View, where
you can see all of Yosemite

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.160
perfectly with the
river right there.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.700
No one was around,
full moon night.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.622
It was kind of cloudy, so it
accentuated the landscape.

00:12:15.622 --> 00:12:17.830
And I was just looking there,
reflecting and thinking

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.090
about all the years in
Yosemite, all the people

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.816
I've met, climbs I've done,
swimming in the river.

00:12:24.816 --> 00:12:25.690
Just the whole thing.

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.023
I kept looking at that scene
and feeling the experience.

00:12:28.023 --> 00:12:29.280
And I was like, poof.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.170
This crazy profound
thought was I had

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:34.084
no separation from the place.

00:12:34.084 --> 00:12:35.250
I felt completely connected.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:39.434
My eyes started watering in the
sense of I found my way home.

00:12:39.434 --> 00:12:41.100
And I think that's
the potential we have

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.170
when we understand how
to commune with nature.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.020
We feel at home.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.145
And I think we're always
looking for that now.

00:12:47.145 --> 00:12:49.020
And why do 5 million
people come to Yosemite?

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.580
I'm still trying to wrap
my mind around that.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.450
So that's just a little thing
to share there that probably

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.760
got me on the next phase.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:01.410
And not long after, we
started this nonprofit.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.294
And so like I say,
this time, it's

00:13:04.294 --> 00:13:05.460
really fun to help the kids.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.168
Because I say to these
guys all the time,

00:13:07.168 --> 00:13:08.940
you guys really make me think.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.250
You make me consider what's
your future going to be.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.500
This up at Cathedral Lake.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.190
So again, the beauty
is so profound,

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.460
and that water is super cold.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.334
And you wanted to
go up there anyway.

00:13:21.334 --> 00:13:22.000
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.540
- Being in nature
makes me feel like

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:25.490
a real, regular human being.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:28.130
What I mean by that is
by helping others out

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:30.230
of the kindness of
our hearts, not having

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:32.360
to go against anyone,
it makes me feel

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.520
like I'm in a different world.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.730
- I clear my mind from any
personal issues or stress

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.620
and enjoy the beauty
of the earth that has

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.570
been left in its natural state.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:43.820
I feel free, like there's
nothing that can go wrong

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:47.450
and that we belong in
environments like that.

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.664
This last trip we
went to Mirror Lake.

00:13:49.664 --> 00:13:51.080
And on certain
parts of the trail,

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.500
we had to take our shoes off and
walk barefoot through puddles

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.057
and gravel passages.

00:13:56.057 --> 00:13:57.890
It made me think of how
people walked around

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:59.980
about 1,000 years ago.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.380
- It's just great to
be in nature like that.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.947
- It's a good way to clear
your mind and a peaceful place.

00:14:06.947 --> 00:14:07.530
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:11.006
RON KAUK: Those are some of our
youngsters from juvenile hall.

00:14:11.006 --> 00:14:12.255
We do our little circle talks.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.200
And we recorded their voices.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.220
Uh-oh.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.240
I knew that was going to happen.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.440
So we're learning from them.

00:14:27.257 --> 00:14:29.340
And we want them to be
able to express themselves.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.810
And that's what, back
from my rock climbing--

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:32.940
I got to express myself
all those years learning

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.720
to climb a rock.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.560
And so now you can
see with our youth,

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.400
we want them to be able
to use their voice.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.120
And we should all have the
right to use our voice.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.810
That's back to
that communication.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.830
So I feel like when we learn
to commune with nature,

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:51.570
we can learn to communicate,
if you're following me.

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.010
I mean, we are nature.

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:53.610
We are water.

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:55.735
So when I was talking about
watching those sunrises

00:14:55.735 --> 00:14:57.600
by the water, if I just
let the water-- keep

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.849
listening to the water and
keep listening to the water

00:14:59.849 --> 00:15:02.832
and I just use my imagination,
I say, I am water.

00:15:02.832 --> 00:15:04.290
And that should
sound crazy to you,

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.900
because we put water in
this little bottle right now

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.930
and sell it.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.180
I always joke with the people.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.520
I show a movie every Friday and
Saturday night up in Yosemite

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.500
called "Return to Balance:
A Climber's Journey"

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.730
and always bring up
the fact that this

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.140
is one of our high water years.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.970
There was so much
snow and so much

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:19.500
water flowing over
the waterfalls.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.874
How many gallons
per minute could

00:15:20.874 --> 00:15:24.182
have been flowing over those
waterfalls 24 hours a day?

00:15:24.182 --> 00:15:25.890
And yet we go over
and buy a bottle of it

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:29.010
in a plastic bottle
for $4 or $3.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:31.787
I said, what would that water
be worth in 20, 30 years?

00:15:31.787 --> 00:15:32.870
I like to think like that.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:33.720
I just play around.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.030
I want to open this up to
questions, too, at any time,

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.220
if you guys want
to help me along.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.400
Because it's a lot to cover.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.960
It's interesting to try to cover
40 years of rock climbing--

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.140
or 35, 40-- and then 10
years of doing this nonprofit

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.980
and then trying to grasp
the potential that we have

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.400
to make a difference within
the outdoor education realm

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.630
and in the public school
realm and then for all of us

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:07.410
to truly take a deep
look at where we are at.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.050
So these kids, they know where
they're at, some of the guys

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:10.716
that we're with.

00:16:10.716 --> 00:16:12.000
They're locked up.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.190
And so they go
into adult prison.

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:16.524
And it's just an impressive
story to grasp the history.

00:16:16.524 --> 00:16:18.690
Because I say to these guys,
you know, 200 years ago

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:19.820
this prison didn't exist.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.810
None of this was even
happening, not here, anyway.

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:24.060
So you can probably read that.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.880
When I first went to Yosemite,
it felt like I was in heaven.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.100
So I think there's
a lot of potential

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:37.540
to help our youth get some
time instead of do time.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.980
And I think that's
what all of us

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.509
are looking for is
to have more time.

00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:42.550
Because I heard it said--

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.540
I don't know who was saying it.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.640
[INAUDIBLE] or
somebody said there

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.056
was going to be a
point in history

00:16:46.056 --> 00:16:49.090
where we became too busy.

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:52.860
Became too busy to
realize what was going on.

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.105
We hear the ice
caps are melting.

00:16:55.105 --> 00:16:58.120
Our Sierras, the
trees, are all dying.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.700
Millions of trees have
died up in our Sierra.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.420
And I don't say this
to be like doomsday.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.720
I just think it's
all interesting.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.413
How are we affecting things?

00:17:07.413 --> 00:17:09.579
"You're somebody who has
affected my life by letting

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:12.880
me see new things and
realize that nature is

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.280
a beautiful and sacred place."

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.609
We gave him an A-plus for that.

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:22.770
"In nature, I feel like
the weight of my shoulders

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.060
is released.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.710
It feels like a gift."

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:28.950
These are profound statements.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.690
I won't read them all.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.930
So this is our classroom.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.490
"This is our
potential to hopefully

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.920
have a little story
rewrite at this point

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.680
to bring some
compassion, appreciation,

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.140
self-respect, equality.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.320
Everything that was
ever good I think

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.857
you could learn from
watching a river."

00:17:49.857 --> 00:17:50.690
This is kind of fun.

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:53.230
"I look forward to going to
Yosemite with you and hiking.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:56.150
I appreciate you giving
us a different path

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:57.480
and some type of freedom."

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.040
That's one of our Boys
and Girls Club's girls.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.140
Nature is a great playground.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.180
And maybe some of you
have come across that book

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.640
by Richard Loud, "Last
Child in the Woods:

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:13.030
Saving our Children from
Nature Deficit Disorder."

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:14.850
It's a book about that thick--

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:17.850
good to reference.

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:19.830
This is my favorite quote.

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.590
"When I go to Yosemite, I
feel like I can honestly

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:23.760
be who I am.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.480
I can escape my problems
in a healthy way.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.150
"I take that first breath
of fresh mountain air,

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:33.640
and I inhale nothing but
good, positive energy.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.230
And when I exhale, my problems
are released out of my body.

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:39.270
I love the beauty of Yosemite.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:41.580
It encourages me and
gives me hope that I can

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.800
make my life beautiful, too."

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.560
That's a heavy-duty statement
from this one young woman

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.810
that was in foster care, group
homes, and in juvenile hall.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:52.800
And she goes, I just
love it up here.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.140
Pretty awesome.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.320
So we're called a
small nonprofit,

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.150
but I think we're
doing very big things.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:01.710
And we want our
big things to get

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:05.070
into the mainstream of helping
our kids back to nature,

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:07.710
helping us all back to that.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.750
So maybe as we're all
getting a group mind here,

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.637
we could think, how
could we all do that?

00:19:11.637 --> 00:19:13.470
How could we all make
a commitment right now

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:15.210
in some way, shape,
or form of our mind

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.877
to take one of your kids out
or other kids out into nature

00:19:17.877 --> 00:19:19.710
and go for a walk and
get to know each other

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:22.110
and start circle talks and
ask them how they're feeling?

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:24.540
That's the experience I've
been having in juvenile hall.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.831
Because when you first meet
each other, it's like this.

00:19:28.312 --> 00:19:29.520
And they would admit it, too.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.020
"Yeah, when you first met
us, we were kind of stiff."

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.390
I go, yeah, maybe a little bit.

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:35.550
But through trust and
respect, the basic elements

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:39.119
of being a healthy human being,
we started a good relationship.

00:19:39.119 --> 00:19:41.160
And that's why I'm saying
Sacred Rok is committed

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.340
to relationships and
building relationships that

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.270
have to do with
family, community,

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.540
but nature especially.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.594
Because I think our power--

00:19:50.594 --> 00:19:52.260
I don't know how to
use this word power.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.740
But I think power--

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.380
the earth seems powerful.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.969
The sun seems powerful.

00:19:57.969 --> 00:19:58.885
The ocean is powerful.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.610
Yosemite feels like
a whole new world.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:10.100
It clears your mind and gives
you a great feeling and joy.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.700
This is everything we all want.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.200
And you don't really
have to buy it.

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:19.790
One of the great
things we get to do

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:21.170
is trail work up in Yosemite.

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:25.370
We remove this asphalt.
One guy was pointing out

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.400
that asphalt is two
words for blame.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.380
And it's toxic material.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.880
And so I was looking
at these trails

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.050
forever, because
there's water flowing.

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:35.630
And they always erode, and
the little pieces of asphalt

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:36.740
go in the river.

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.200
So us guys-- the
assistant superintendent

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.915
at the time-- we were talking.

00:20:40.915 --> 00:20:42.790
And he said, man, we
need to get rid of that.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:44.300
I go, hey, our
guys will do that.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.130
So we got to doing
this community service

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:47.720
work for quite a while.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.520
I want to continue to do it.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.410
So these guys, they
love this kind of work

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:58.190
because you can thug around
and help the place out.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:59.360
This is Lamar Henderson.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.884
He's our voice in Merced.

00:21:00.884 --> 00:21:01.550
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.160
- As someone who's involved
in the juvenile justice system

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.440
here in Merced County,
what impact do you

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.840
think the Sacred Rok program
is having on the kids who

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.370
are incarcerated?

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:13.070
- Well, in my position as the
Chair for the Merced County

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:16.280
Juvenile Justice Delinquency
Prevention Commission,

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.610
I see Sacred Rok as being one
of the tremendous opportunities

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:23.570
in youth enrichment experiences
for our most fragile and most

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:26.071
valued youth.

00:21:26.071 --> 00:21:27.860
Having an experience--
I never get

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:31.500
used to seeing children
through little windows.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.800
And I'm always kind
of taken back at,

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.057
what were the life experiences
that brought this child here.

00:21:37.057 --> 00:21:39.140
And I know for some, this
is the most stable place

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.730
in their life.

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:44.330
So to have an opportunity
to participate in Sacred Rok

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:47.600
and experience
education nature's way

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.730
and to be in Yosemite,
this awesome, majestic

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.617
place that people come to
from all around the world--

00:21:52.617 --> 00:21:54.950
and many of our youth right
here in our community rarely

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:56.150
ever see it.

00:21:56.150 --> 00:22:01.820
So to take this experience
of being in juvenile hall,

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.640
of being in a situation
that seems so pessimistic

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.970
and hopeless and take
them to Yosemite and see

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:11.240
the transformation from the time
they come out of the facility

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.300
to the drive all the way to
Yosemite and everything that

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:18.170
comes with that-- the aesthetic
appeal, the change in climate,

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.610
change in air--

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:21.650
and see how that has a
transformational effect

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.010
on our youth--

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.890
I think it plant seeds of
hope that, man, I belong here.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.210
And this is a place
where I can go.

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:30.617
And it's accessible to me.

00:22:30.617 --> 00:22:32.450
And you don't have to
be rich, and you don't

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:33.610
have to be highly educated.

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:36.440
And you don't have to
be all these things

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.790
that we think have to accompany
health and wellness that they

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:42.300
have access to.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:49.520
So I think introducing new,
healthier, and accessible

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.560
opportunities for youth
is critically important,

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.737
especially for our youth
in the institution.

00:22:55.737 --> 00:22:56.320
[END PLAYBACK]

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:56.945
RON KAUK: Yeah.

00:22:56.945 --> 00:22:57.730
I love Lamar.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:00.570
He does such amazing work.

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:04.060
He's in other things,
like All Dads Matter

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.140
But he said something that
stuck in my mind once.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:09.725
He said, "Merced needs
a divine intervention."

00:23:09.725 --> 00:23:11.840
I thought that sounded
kind of like, whoa.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.310
Man, that's heavy.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:14.840
But this is where we're at--

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.100
I mean, really.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.490
Say if you get to drift between
these worlds from Yosemite

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:22.105
to coming here--

00:23:22.105 --> 00:23:24.230
it's interesting to build
the bridges between them.

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:26.146
And that's what we're
trying to do with Merced

00:23:26.146 --> 00:23:32.190
is build that bridge
between Yosemite and Merced

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.340
and get a stronger
sense of education.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:37.227
They're even building an
outdoor campus up in Yosemite.

00:23:37.227 --> 00:23:39.060
Nature Bridge is another
nonprofit up there.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:43.044
They're building a $57
million outdoor campus.

00:23:43.044 --> 00:23:44.460
And we're hoping
to have influence

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.690
on that somehow to bring back
the intimacy and the respect

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:49.950
to connect with nature--

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:54.690
not just scientifically,
but with the wisdom.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:56.380
"Sacred Rok is
about facilitating

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:57.440
the ceremony of nature.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.150
Everything we do together
is based on respect."

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:03.130
We're totally getting
get back to the basics.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:06.150
And I think that's what's so
profound about being human

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:10.170
and about the natural world is
if we can simplify, have time

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:11.780
to be simple--

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.860
the simplicity of just being.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.560
And that's why we
say "facilitating

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.791
the ceremony of nature."

00:24:17.791 --> 00:24:20.040
We just go for walks, and
we're in these environments.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.498
And like I said, as humans, we
have our own eyes to see it.

00:24:22.498 --> 00:24:24.090
We have our own
ears to hear it--

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:25.170
smells, taste, touch.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:28.830
Get these senses engaged.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:32.700
And I'm as motivated
as Google, personally.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.130
I'm as motivated as
Google to bring this

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:37.620
into the light of the
future for education.

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:43.685
Because these kids,
they are our future.

00:24:43.685 --> 00:24:46.820
And it's all about the
kids, in my point of view,

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.320
and their education.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.554
And these guys know
where they're at.

00:24:50.554 --> 00:24:52.220
That's why they can
say profound things,

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.670
like, "No matter how bad
the day is and the struggles

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:57.260
you're going through,
it's up to you

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:00.860
to make it the best
day you ever had."

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.804
That's an amazing comment.

00:25:02.804 --> 00:25:04.220
These are guys
that are locked up.

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:05.699
I don't even know
how they do it.

00:25:05.699 --> 00:25:07.490
I went into one of
those little cells once.

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:08.865
And we were making
a little film.

00:25:08.865 --> 00:25:11.302
When the guy closed the
door, I'm like, dang.

00:25:11.302 --> 00:25:13.010
The thought of having
to wait for someone

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:16.582
to open that door for
you freaks me out.

00:25:16.582 --> 00:25:18.290
But then some people
might be freaked out

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:21.830
to be 1,000 feet up on
El Cap tied with a rope.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:26.490
So it makes you
wonder, doesn't it?

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:28.420
But I think it's
really exciting,

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.565
our work and our
connection with kids

00:25:30.565 --> 00:25:31.690
and the beauty of Yosemite.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:34.531
Because it's so unlimited
in the possibilities.

00:25:34.531 --> 00:25:36.280
And that's what I mean
about Google or any

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.405
of these big companies now.

00:25:37.405 --> 00:25:39.550
They've came up with
ideas, a group of people,

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.320
and they went somewhere with it.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.930
And to see the intelligence
that we have-- but how will we

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:46.540
use that intelligence in the
future to think intelligently?

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.880
How to bring ourselves back
into balance and the world

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.502
back into balance and
break these barriers down,

00:25:51.502 --> 00:25:53.710
like that wall that there's
a guy that wants to build

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:55.330
between Mexico and here?

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:59.050
These walls-- what
are these walls?

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:01.780
It seems absurd that we
have so much intelligence

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:04.850
and we use it to sabotage each
other and do all these things.

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.310
That's what you learn about
going to juvenile hall.

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:07.820
You think, where
did this come from?

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.700
What's the history to this?

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.050
How well do we know our history?

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:13.390
Are we taught
their true history?

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:14.809
Do we know our
ancestral lineage?

00:26:14.809 --> 00:26:16.600
Do we know that we're
all indigenous people

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.290
from the planet?

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:20.290
Do we know that we're
made up of the earth?

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:22.534
Have we forgotten these things?

00:26:22.534 --> 00:26:24.700
And if we forget them, then
you can see the results.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.283
Because that's what's
happening today.

00:26:26.283 --> 00:26:28.090
We're recognized as
the lost generation.

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:34.390
But I say this with compassion
and respect and appreciation

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:38.170
for the healing that is going to
take place one way or another.

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:42.020
This is my campsite.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.260
This is in the morning--

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.630
like I said, the 10 summers.

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:49.880
And you know that
expression, it dawned on you?

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.990
It really exists.

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:53.750
It will dawn on you to see the
profound reality of the new day

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:56.735
coming, especially when you get
up when the stars are still up.

00:26:56.735 --> 00:26:58.610
And you can watch the
track of the moon, too.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:01.520
I'll see the moon as a
sliver with the sunrise.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:06.590
And then the full moon will be
setting as the sun is rising.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:09.037
To watch this
process is amazing.

00:27:09.037 --> 00:27:11.620
And to see the sun starts in the
east and ends up in the west.

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.460
But they tell me that
the sun doesn't move

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.540
and that the earth turns.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.240
That's true, right?

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.130
That's amazing.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:22.550
We are living in
an amazing reality.

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:23.315
That's reality.

00:27:23.315 --> 00:27:25.440
But we've created an illusion
that we call reality,

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.532
so we forget about the
reality of the sun not moving

00:27:28.532 --> 00:27:29.990
and the earth going
around the sun.

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:32.031
How does the earth know
how to go around the sun?

00:27:32.031 --> 00:27:33.560
How does it know?

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.110
How does your heart
know how to beat?

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:36.360
This is the good news channel.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.580
I'm just trying
to share it here.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.350
I love being inside
this building, sharing

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:40.850
these thoughts and feelings.

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:42.590
Because it brings
more power to us

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:45.215
as human beings to think clearly
and coherently for the future.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.040
It's very exciting.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.220
I think Sacred Rok
is serious fun.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:54.210
I love serious fun.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.040
That's what climbing
has been to me.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.740
You had to take it very serious,
the environment you were in.

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.406
If you didn't pay
attention, the gravity

00:28:00.406 --> 00:28:02.734
is just going to take you.

00:28:02.734 --> 00:28:04.650
There's a couple of our
elders standing there.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:05.730
You can see one of them.

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:07.188
I help out in the
native community.

00:28:07.188 --> 00:28:08.790
That's been a huge
opportunity for me

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:12.289
to get that extended
education as a human being

00:28:12.289 --> 00:28:14.580
and bring me back into my
indigenous reality as a human

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:15.810
being from the earth.

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:17.760
And I like one of the statements
our elders had threw out

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.150
the other day.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:19.860
"You know, they have
their universities,

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.390
but we have our universe."

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:23.490
I was like, whoa.

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:24.860
That's a statement.

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:27.360
Because when these guys talk,
they just say it to the point.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.350
"You got to appreciate water."

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.850
OK.

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:30.140
That's it.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.260
Got to appreciate water.

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:32.360
"Got to work together."

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:32.860
That's it.

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:34.144
We're working together.

00:28:34.144 --> 00:28:35.310
I mean, they call the shots.

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:36.840
And in that
community, the elders

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:40.154
are regarded as the say-so.

00:28:40.154 --> 00:28:41.070
That's a nice picture.

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:46.510
This is our group, juvenile
hall walking along the river.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.060
Beauty, beauty, beauty.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.982
So beautiful.

00:28:53.982 --> 00:28:55.690
And I hope that as
we're all in this room

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:59.830
right now that we can see
the beauty in ourselves--

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:02.854
the incredible phenomena
of a human body.

00:29:02.854 --> 00:29:04.270
And it's designed
after the earth.

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.936
Don't they say that
the world is covered

00:29:05.936 --> 00:29:07.870
with something like 70% water?

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:09.250
And we're mirroring that.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:10.570
We have that much water in us.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:11.814
I heard these things.

00:29:11.814 --> 00:29:13.480
Maybe there's just
someone making it up.

00:29:17.179 --> 00:29:18.970
So this is the environment
I'm coming from.

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:22.311
This is the environment
I know I'm connected to.

00:29:22.311 --> 00:29:23.560
And we bring our kids up here.

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.670
This is right outside that camp.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:25.990
This is about 200
feet from that camp

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:27.300
that I was saying I stay at.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.140
And these boys
went around here--

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:31.267
I think I counted 65 times.

00:29:31.267 --> 00:29:33.850
They'd run up, and they'd slide
down the water, a little rock.

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:34.516
And they'd fall.

00:29:34.516 --> 00:29:36.410
And they'd go by going.

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:38.500
Every time, they would
smile when they ran around.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.375
It was the greatest
thing you could ever see.

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.520
So this book-- we have
some here for you guys.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.280
It's called "Voice
from the Inside Out."

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.500
When I was being asked a
lot, are you seeing results

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.880
with these guys--
and I said, well,

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.505
yeah, every time we're together,
we enjoy each other's company.

00:29:56.505 --> 00:29:58.350
We're building a
friendship based on, again,

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:01.080
trust, respect, appreciation.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.510
And then Kenji came
to a class meeting.

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:06.170
And we call our class meetings
"Mission: I'm Possible."

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:08.670
Because I doubled for Tom Cruise
in "Mission: Impossible 2."

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:10.620
And I was shown a clip
to the kids in class.

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:12.160
And as I was looking at
this clip, I'm going,

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.000
man, it's not even real.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.790
It's like Hollywood and
it costs $80 million.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:16.140
That's pretty neat and all that.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:17.681
But after the clip,
I said, you guys,

00:30:17.681 --> 00:30:20.344
this is "Mission: Impossible,"
to get out of this situation.

00:30:20.344 --> 00:30:22.260
And then the teacher
said, let's start a club.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.400
We can call it
"Mission: Impossible."

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.590
But the kids changed it around
to say, let's call it "Mission:

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:28.092
I'm Possible" and "Mission:
Accomplished" when you get out.

00:30:28.092 --> 00:30:29.550
So at these lunch
meetings, we have

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:31.710
writing prompts where
the teacher and I will

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:33.240
get together and
suggest a question,

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.510
like, what does
water mean to you,

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:35.860
what does it mean to
be human, whatever.

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:36.960
And then Kenji joined a class.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.209
And I said, Kenji, what did
you think about the class?

00:30:39.209 --> 00:30:42.720
He said, there's a lot of
creativity in that room.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.140
That's all I needed to hear.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.110
So then we thought, what can
we do with that creativity?

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:47.850
So we put it into this
book, because then they

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:48.891
can speak for themselves.

00:30:48.891 --> 00:30:51.595
What's it like to be in a
jail cell, go up to Yosemite,

00:30:51.595 --> 00:30:53.970
and be underneath waterfalls
and rainbows, do trail work,

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:56.424
go swimming, and then go back?

00:30:56.424 --> 00:30:57.840
So we collected
all their writings

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.315
and let them speak
for themselves.

00:30:59.315 --> 00:31:01.440
And we'll be able to hand
some of those out to you.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.040
You can share them.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.610
So it's a great honor to
represent these youngsters that

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:09.210
are representing all of us,
because they're following

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:11.250
the lead that we give them.

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:12.977
If we put those
iPhones in their hands,

00:31:12.977 --> 00:31:14.560
if we put the computer
in their hands,

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.470
then what are they
going to do with it?

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:18.930
How do they know how to
really use it responsibly?

00:31:21.677 --> 00:31:23.760
You see that girl carrying
those little buckhorns?

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.480
I don't know if there's
another picture.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.947
It was so funny, man.

00:31:26.947 --> 00:31:28.530
There was some tourist
that found one,

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:29.850
and then they gave it to us.

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:32.099
And I said, let's go see if
we can find the other one.

00:31:32.099 --> 00:31:34.380
What are the chances of
finding the other one?

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.370
We did.

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:37.982
We did find the other one.

00:31:37.982 --> 00:31:38.940
Here's one of the guys.

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.020
He was saying that
this picture, it's

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.300
like a choice which way
you're going to go in life.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:46.801
And you've got those cells,
and you've got this nature.

00:31:46.801 --> 00:31:47.550
But it's an honor.

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:52.170
And through our diverse
group at Sacred Rok--

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:53.984
Kenji's colleague
was Brian Cooley.

00:31:53.984 --> 00:31:55.650
And Nancy also worked
in social service,

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:58.840
so it opened up
doors quite easily,

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.720
I could say, to get
into juvenile hall,

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.230
to show our film
"Return to Balance"

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:04.314
and start a relationship
for the last eight years.

00:32:04.314 --> 00:32:06.146
And we want to keep
going somewhere with it.

00:32:06.146 --> 00:32:08.880
We want to take it so when they
do get out of juvenile hall,

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.050
they have a place to go.

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:11.966
Because once they have
that ankle bracelet on,

00:32:11.966 --> 00:32:13.620
it's very difficult
as a teenager

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.800
to not be tempted to go
over to your buddy's house

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.980
that might be a known gang
member or whatever it is.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.559
And then they're
hauled right back.

00:32:21.559 --> 00:32:23.100
And we all know that
it's a business.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.995
We all know there's profit
being made off these industries.

00:32:25.995 --> 00:32:27.870
So we're not saying
we're for it, against it.

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:31.869
We're just trying to find
the healing and the potential

00:32:31.869 --> 00:32:33.660
of that energy to be
used in a positive way

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.892
to help society
and help our kids.

00:32:35.892 --> 00:32:37.350
So I think the
future of Sacred Rok

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:38.725
is to mirror these
juvenile halls

00:32:38.725 --> 00:32:41.220
and have other places
in safe locations

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.230
to get the right education,
the right skills,

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:45.030
and then come back
out into society

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:47.250
to be what one of our elders
said we need to become.

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:49.547
Helpers, healers, and menders.

00:32:49.547 --> 00:32:51.380
And they're ready to
do it, I'm telling you.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.180
They are ready.

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:53.100
They don't want any of this.

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.641
Like Lamar was
saying, they just were

00:32:54.641 --> 00:32:57.627
born in these circumstances,
rough situations.

00:32:57.627 --> 00:32:59.460
But they're being mined
now for their energy

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.185
to create jobs for other people.

00:33:01.185 --> 00:33:02.310
That's the hard look at it.

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:04.768
I'm just trying to be honest
as I can through my experience

00:33:04.768 --> 00:33:05.860
and what I'm observing.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.250
So I think the future is to
get those guys out of there,

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:10.410
go somewhere else, and have
different ways of being

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:14.580
educated and to contribute
to our communities.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:15.481
Huge potential.

00:33:15.481 --> 00:33:17.730
And probably a company like
this that could eventually

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:19.470
wrap their mind
around it could just

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:21.570
fan off some of that energy
that they call money,

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:23.028
and we could start
to work together

00:33:23.028 --> 00:33:25.850
on that future for the kids.

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:27.650
What a thought, huh?

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:28.705
That's how I think.

00:33:28.705 --> 00:33:30.330
Because when I started
climbing, people

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:33.300
said, you can't a way
of life through that.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.781
Even Kenji said I couldn't
have planned my life.

00:33:35.781 --> 00:33:37.530
But I think I was
planning it all the time

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:38.400
with my imagination.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.525
Because the power of
imagination can attract things

00:33:40.525 --> 00:33:42.510
that you would really
want, if you're sincere.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:46.800
I was very sincere about
wanting to climb rocks.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.100
But now I'm very
sincere about this.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:52.380
There she is with
those little horns.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.580
And you know, everyone
responds to nature

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:56.700
so well because it is a healer.

00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:01.430
These kids would jump in
the river if it was snowing.

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:02.640
They love to be in the water.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.470
That's our Fern Spring
we go to all the time.

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:06.178
That's the one I drove
my motorcycle past

00:34:06.178 --> 00:34:06.920
and broke my leg.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.920
And ever since then, I've
stopped at that spring

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:13.314
to pause for a minute before
I go in to Yosemite Valley.

00:34:13.314 --> 00:34:15.480
And this is a beautiful
environment, this waterfall,

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:15.760
too.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.989
And I went up there many
times to get some pictures

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:20.120
of that last light.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.670
And to hear that water hitting
the granite slabs below,

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:24.530
it just does something to you.

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:27.080
There's a song out there,
and that song, I think,

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.000
evokes the memory
of our DNA that

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.100
goes back in time to
know how we're connected

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.750
to all this beautiful world.

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.920
So again, can you
imagine my privilege

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:42.150
to be in this environment
for the last 45 years

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:44.560
and just to humbly try
to make sense of it

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.969
to share with the
next generation

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:48.639
so that they can have the same
kind of experience or a better

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:50.444
experience?

00:34:50.444 --> 00:34:52.360
So this is some of the
things we're looking at

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.909
to extend our possibilities.

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:57.310
We need to get
some transportation

00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:58.720
to go pick the kids up.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.530
Because we've said, just ride
the bus up, we'll pay for it.

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:01.180
But it's hard.

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:04.090
You've got to go pick them up.

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:05.020
It's set at whatever.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:08.900
Saturday at 8:00, meet at
this corner; we'll get you.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.069
And if you think about it-- and
we do some more of this stuff,

00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:12.610
the numbers--

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:17.265
it costs about $90,000 a year
to keep a guy incarcerated.

00:35:17.265 --> 00:35:19.390
And I don't even know what
budget we're working on.

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:21.760
Maybe I can get Nancy to
speak to this a little bit.

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.024
So that's some of our
story right there.

00:35:27.024 --> 00:35:29.190
And if there was some
questions, that would be nice.

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:31.890
Or I could ask our
Chairperson Nancy to come up,

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:34.370
or Kenji Yes, sir?

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:36.870
AUDIENCE: What are some of the
long term changes you've been

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:39.492
able to initiate in those kids?

00:35:39.492 --> 00:35:40.950
RON KAUK: That I've
seen with them?

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:41.970
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:44.599
RON KAUK: It's an ongoing
respect that we have.

00:35:44.599 --> 00:35:46.890
This is why I'm saying we
need to build the bridge when

00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:47.580
they're out.

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.913
Because when they're there,
we're together all the time,

00:35:49.913 --> 00:35:52.470
like once a week.

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:53.324
Could be for a year.

00:35:53.324 --> 00:35:54.990
And then we go to the
Facebook and we're

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:56.280
chatting back and forth.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.440
And the guys will send
me these positive notes.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.480
And so we still have
a dialogue going on.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.600
And that shows me that
we've made a connection.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.558
Because really, I think
we're trying to operate

00:36:04.558 --> 00:36:06.420
like an extended family.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.589
We relate to each
other like that.

00:36:08.589 --> 00:36:09.630
So that's what I've seen.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:11.100
Mainly, I've seen
the respect that

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:15.750
comes from them and the
willingness to work together.

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.550
When people say the
word hope or whatever,

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:19.920
it shows me the
possibilities of,

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.250
if we can reach out and give a
helping hand, they'll take it.

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:24.840
But we have to start
thinking bigger.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.730
Because for the last eight
years, I've been going there

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:29.063
and they've been coming to
Yosemite, it's a great thing.

00:36:29.063 --> 00:36:31.860
But like we're saying, if you
do the recidivism, a lot of them

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.750
slip right back because
the pressure is just

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:35.850
too much when they're
back in their communities.

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:37.310
And they're still young guys.

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:38.430
And you got older guys.

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:41.726
It's kind of a
challenge for them.

00:36:41.726 --> 00:36:44.100
So I've seen it in a personal
relationship-- very strong,

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.060
very positive.

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:47.010
And then on the other part of
the reality of the environment

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:48.720
that they're still staying
in, it's very difficult

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.509
to get out of it.

00:36:49.509 --> 00:36:52.050
And so I know a lot of our guys
have gone on to adult prison,

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:52.860
too--

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:53.660
not all.

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:54.660
I don't even know what--

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:58.602
we haven't necessarily
done the numbers on that.

00:36:58.602 --> 00:37:00.810
But that's why we know we
have to make the next step.

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.891
Yes, sir?

00:37:05.891 --> 00:37:07.723
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
being here, by the way.

00:37:07.723 --> 00:37:09.800
It's really awesome
to listen to you.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:14.092
When you get out there with
the kids for the first time,

00:37:14.092 --> 00:37:15.050
what's it like for you?

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:17.600
What have you found is most
maybe effective to build

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:21.050
a bond and a connection
in those first few days?

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:22.180
RON KAUK: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:23.870
AUDIENCE: Because I
haven't done this.

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:26.009
I would think maybe you
have something in your mind

00:37:26.009 --> 00:37:27.800
or you have a program
or something that you

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:28.670
want to get across.

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:29.660
Or maybe it's not.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:30.276
I don't know.

00:37:30.276 --> 00:37:31.400
I'd love to think about it.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.881
RON KAUK: That's
a great question.

00:37:33.881 --> 00:37:36.380
When I first went to juvenile
hall and I was talking to kids

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:38.330
and the one guy goes,
man, they're not sure if--

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:39.121
they don't get you.

00:37:39.121 --> 00:37:40.880
They're not sure what you want.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.380
I don't want anything.

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.880
I didn't want
anything from them.

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.320
I just want to be together.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.327
And I think that sets the stage
in why we say nature's way,

00:37:48.327 --> 00:37:49.410
education in nature's way.

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:51.750
There's a natural
way for us to be.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:53.250
So if I'm meeting
you-- how are you?

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:53.833
How do you do?

00:37:53.833 --> 00:37:55.550
And then we're checking
each other out,

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:57.570
like, what's your
interest or what's this.

00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:00.510
So what I'll do right off
the bat is, here's a pack,

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:02.270
here's some water and food.

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:03.470
Let's go.

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:04.492
We just start walking.

00:38:04.492 --> 00:38:06.200
But I can usually size
them up and think,

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.190
where's a good place to walk.

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:08.480
Because I know the place
so well, what kind of day

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:09.770
it is, where the
people might be,

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:11.144
I want to walk in
certain places.

00:38:11.144 --> 00:38:12.280
It inspires them.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:15.140
So you're letting them see
it first and feel it and not

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:17.540
have necessarily an adult
tell you how to think

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:18.920
and how to feel.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.540
So that's why we
say we facilitate

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:21.980
the ceremony of nature.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.056
So that's what's so
beautiful about being there

00:38:24.056 --> 00:38:25.930
all these years is I
kind of know where to go

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:27.344
and when to go.

00:38:27.344 --> 00:38:29.510
And then we'll strike up
just a little conversation.

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:31.551
So if you have some of
the other chaperones here,

00:38:31.551 --> 00:38:34.490
we're all just walking along
in a normal set like normal.

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:37.492
And we start to visit on
whatever topic is interesting.

00:38:37.492 --> 00:38:38.450
And then we could stop.

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:39.750
And they'll be
underneath El Capitan.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.375
And they'll say, have
you climbed that?

00:38:41.375 --> 00:38:42.040
And I go, yeah.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.682
Really?

00:38:42.682 --> 00:38:44.390
And then I might have
a story about being

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:47.374
up there in a snowstorm
and just wanting to get off

00:38:47.374 --> 00:38:49.290
the face of that rock
and saying, oh god, just

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:50.280
get me off this
face of the rock.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.990
I'll never do another bad
thing in my life again.

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.510
You know?

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.140
Because there's thunderclouds.

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:55.920
And they're like, wow.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.170
So I think the cool thing
is I get some respect, which

00:38:58.170 --> 00:38:59.045
is an honor.

00:38:59.045 --> 00:39:00.420
Because I've
climbed these rocks.

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:02.430
So they're kind of
intrigued by this story.

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:04.359
But I don't force
anything on them.

00:39:04.359 --> 00:39:06.900
Because there's a certain thing
about showing respect and not

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.525
forcing yourself on someone.

00:39:08.525 --> 00:39:10.650
And they're dealing with
that a lot in their lives.

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:13.050
Because like I said, they're
locked up in that room.

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:14.490
But this goes for any kids--

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:16.620
Boys and Girls Club,
foster care, all of them.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:18.911
Just respect them for who
they are and the intelligence

00:39:18.911 --> 00:39:21.240
that they have to
share how they feel.

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:24.780
So we're basing a lot
on just how we feel.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:26.040
It's flipping it around.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.870
We want to respond
to how we feel

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:30.000
and be able to talk about
how we feel and feel

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.411
trusted to do that.

00:39:31.411 --> 00:39:33.660
So I'm always amazed when
we have our writing prompts.

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.790
And everyone will stand up
and read it in their own way.

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:38.820
This is how I felt
up there that day.

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:40.860
And you've got a
rough bunch, too.

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.000
But we keep the respect.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.250
That's why we say we're based
on respect, because they

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:46.320
want to start teasing
a little bit, maybe.

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.547
But we all kind of
recognize that we're

00:39:48.547 --> 00:39:50.130
making this commitment
with each other

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:52.860
based on respect and then the
opportunity to go to Yosemite

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.930
and the opportunity
to have food together.

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:58.260
But I think a magic in
the healing part of it

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:02.122
is because we're just
so respectful and--

00:40:02.122 --> 00:40:03.080
what would be the word?

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:06.784
It's a nurturing thing.

00:40:06.784 --> 00:40:09.200
And the challenge of that is,
it's hard to write that down

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.340
on paper.

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.080
We had struggles
with some work groups

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.510
because it's like, what
are you guys doing?

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:16.620
We're going for a walk.

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:17.860
At what time?

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:20.260
When everybody's ready.

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.490
So I think we all like that.

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:23.831
That's why we all
need vacations, right?

00:40:23.831 --> 00:40:25.330
We're like, man,
this clock is going

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:27.710
to drive me right off
the edge of the world.

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:30.765
So we get up there and
we get on nature's time.

00:40:30.765 --> 00:40:33.390
And that's why I'm trying to get
all of us back to nature time.

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:37.140
You shouldn't have to
work more than half a day.

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.473
How fun is it to be here
and say stuff like this?

00:40:39.473 --> 00:40:40.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.150
Because i know we all
feel it, but we all

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:45.870
are making sacrifices
because we have to survive.

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:46.500
We need a job.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.333
And there's nothing
wrong with having a job.

00:40:48.333 --> 00:40:50.250
But like I say, the
philosophy of Akido

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:52.124
is to take energy and
guide it to the future.

00:40:52.124 --> 00:40:54.480
So how do we want this
to play itself out

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:57.690
in long-term thinking,
like the next 100 years?

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:00.880
I mean, this whole Silicon
Valley thing has been how long?

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.735
Not that long.

00:41:02.735 --> 00:41:04.610
We're talking about the
history of California

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:06.296
is only a few hundred years.

00:41:06.296 --> 00:41:09.130
Amazing how fast
it's all moving.

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:10.070
And it's cool.

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:10.570
It is.

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:12.730
It's a phenomena we're in.

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:16.000
But with that phenomena,
where are we going to end up?

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.340
And what is our responsibility
as humans being created,

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:20.089
put here in this earth
to experience life?

00:41:20.089 --> 00:41:22.990
What is our
responsibility, our ability

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:24.780
to respond to the
story we're in?

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:26.980
So Sacred Rok is
taking responsibility

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:30.190
to respond to the situation
that our kids have been put in.

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:32.080
Just for the sake of
staying incarcerated,

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:34.630
just that alone, is such
an interesting thing

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:35.486
to be involved in.

00:41:35.486 --> 00:41:37.360
But I can see nothing
but potential, a future

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.340
to get those kids out of there
and do something positive

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:41.230
with the power that they have,
the creativity they have,

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:43.438
the heart that they have
that actually put themselves

00:41:43.438 --> 00:41:45.666
in that situation.

00:41:45.666 --> 00:41:48.040
Man, they're going through
some serious rites of passage.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:52.302
So if they can get through
that, they'll excel.

00:41:52.302 --> 00:41:54.510
So it's a lot to, like I
said, wrap our minds around.

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:57.520
But I try not to overthink
if I can help it.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:01.200
My new thing is try to think
from here and feel from here.

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.790
I'm trying to get
that language going.

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:05.070
Some say the longest journey is
between the mind and the heart.

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:07.570
I think we used to be in our
heart more as indigenous people

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:09.030
that we all are, have been.

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:10.320
And then we got up to here.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.750
And now we're so
powerful in our intellect

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:16.170
that it's causing a little
confusion for the heart.

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:17.460
So maybe it's the middle.

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.110
Maybe we've got to get
back to the middle.

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:23.070
But like I say, what a
place to be saying this.

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:25.590
But the matter of fact is
we're all human beings,

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:27.000
and our kids are human beings.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.927
And they're being subjected
to a lot of challenges.

00:42:31.927 --> 00:42:33.510
AUDIENCE: Thanks
again for being here.

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:36.489
Could you talk about how you
got started in the program

00:42:36.489 --> 00:42:38.280
and how you started
the program in general?

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.145
Just your inspiration
and things like that?

00:42:40.145 --> 00:42:40.770
RON KAUK: Yeah.

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:43.070
Thank you.

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:46.500
One of our other board members
is named Steve Shackleton.

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.230
He's the former Chief Ranger
of Yosemite National Park,

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:51.460
former Chief Ranger of all
national parks in America.

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:53.060
And we've been good
friends forever.

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:55.110
And Steve and I will
take off on talks kind

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:57.750
of like we're having right
now, but just between us two.

00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:59.750
And we come from these
different kind of realms,

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:02.310
but we have the same connection
intimately to Yosemite.

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:04.230
Because he grew up there
as a kid, and his dad

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:06.060
was head of law
enforcement there.

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:07.740
So he said to me in
one of our walks,

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:09.840
you should really meet
this guy Kenji Hakuta

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.120
who's sitting in the back of the
room that's part of our board

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:12.620
now.

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:14.950
And I said, that would be great.

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:18.480
And then I finally did
meet Kenji briefly.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:22.329
But then, actually, Kenji
was on a solo backpack trip.

00:43:22.329 --> 00:43:24.120
And he stopped by a
place called Tioga Pass

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.970
Resort at the top of the
Sierras, just outside Yosemite.

00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:28.140
And he left me his number.

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.098
And he said, "I look
forward to talking to you.

00:43:30.098 --> 00:43:33.480
Maybe there's a project of some
kind we can work together on."

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.820
He left that message for
me at Tioga Pass Resort.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:37.800
I did not get that message
until the next year

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.660
because the place shut
down due to winter.

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.368
And when I went there
for the first time,

00:43:41.368 --> 00:43:43.560
they said, hey, Ron,
there's a message for you.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:46.680
I said, this is--
whatever year-- last year.

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.040
So when I went to the phone,
as soon as I could I dialed it.

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:50.820
Hey, Kenji.

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:51.930
It's Ron.

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:54.180
He goes, yeah, I was
wondering if you'd ever call.

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:55.740
I go, yeah, sorry, I
just got the message.

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:57.240
He goes, well, it's
funny you're calling now,

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:58.750
because I'm buying food
right now at the store

00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:59.708
to come up to Yosemite.

00:43:59.708 --> 00:44:01.790
And I go, OK, can we talk?

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:03.060
He came to my house.

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:04.830
We sat for hours
across from each other,

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:06.330
talking about all
the possibilities

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:07.830
of what we might do.

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:10.320
Then we ended up taking a walk
up one of my favorite trails

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.904
up above the Wawona Tunnel
with Nancy, his wife.

00:44:13.904 --> 00:44:15.570
And we started
considering what would it

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:17.490
be like just to bring kids
out here and let them see it

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:17.970
in their own way?

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:19.678
We could do this thing
about facilitating

00:44:19.678 --> 00:44:21.144
the ceremony of nature.

00:44:21.144 --> 00:44:22.810
They said, yeah, we
should do something.

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:25.920
Nancy worked with foster
care and our social service

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:26.610
in Merced.

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:28.350
So within a few weeks, we had--

00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:30.620
I don't remember how many
kids-- at least 12 or--

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:31.120
WOMAN: 18.

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:32.220
RON KAUK: 18.

00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:34.560
A group walking up that trail.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.900
And then with Nancy's
help-- because Kenji said,

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.670
you haven't met my wife Nancy.

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:40.080
She'll get things going for us.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.930
We were a nonprofit
status within some months,

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:44.080
as I recall.

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.210
So then we established
ourselves a nonprofit.

00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:48.007
And then we came over
to juvenile hall.

00:44:48.007 --> 00:44:48.840
We showed this film.

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.760
And as we went into
that place, we came out.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:52.230
I asked Kenji in
the parking lot,

00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:54.396
what did you think about
that meeting with the kids?

00:44:54.396 --> 00:44:56.580
He said, well, I think
we're getting warmer

00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:59.790
to the idea of what we're doing.

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:02.040
So it just came about.

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.587
But it was in my mind
for years to do something

00:45:04.587 --> 00:45:05.670
that would benefit others.

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:07.586
Because I think it was
in my subconscious mind

00:45:07.586 --> 00:45:09.150
that the adults
helped me at a time.

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:10.941
And maybe it was coming
up to my conscious,

00:45:10.941 --> 00:45:12.810
saying, well, it's
time for me to do that.

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:14.518
And that's getting
back to these thoughts

00:45:14.518 --> 00:45:17.370
over years of how you
attract the possibilities

00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:19.000
and the people to do something.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.190
And I think that's
why you're all here

00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:21.240
working with these guys.

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.040
Thank you guys.

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:26.390
