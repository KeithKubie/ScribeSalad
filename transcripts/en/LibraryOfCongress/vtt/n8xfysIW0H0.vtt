00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:19.090
[ Silence ]

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.660
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, good afternoon,
and thank you for joining us

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.720
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.020
I'm John Cole.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.330 position:56%
I'm the director of the Center for
the Book in the Library of Congress,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.390
which is the reading and literacy
promotion arm of the Library.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.130
We were created -- renewing
our 40th anniversary.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.940
This is -- we were created in 1977
by the historian Daniel Boorstin

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.820
when he was Librarian of
Congress, and he wanted the Library

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.050
of Congress to have a way to
reach out to the general public

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.920
to promote books and reading, and
now literacy and libraries as well.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.460 position:56%
And we are active in a number of
events and programs, both nationally

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.620 position:56%
and here at the Library of Congress.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.320
We were in at the beginning
of the National Book Festival,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.330
which is in Washington
now in September.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.380
And it started in 2001 in
the Center for the Book

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.860
with its ongoing author
program of noontime talks

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.370
that you're attending, thank
you, actually started in 1996,

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.060
and it's called "Books and Beyond".

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.020
So we have a long history of author
promotion and book promotion.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.190
This particular series
focuses on new books by authors

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.320
who have used the Library
of Congress,

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.910
and other libraries in their work.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.550
And our purpose is to make certain
that there's a public appreciation

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.620
of the results of the research
that's done in libraries

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.080
around the country, and also to
promote these particular books

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.870
in a way that will be productive,
we hope not only for the audience,

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:09.120
but for the author, and for the
whole enterprise of publishing.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.010
The way it works is follows.

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.360
We will hear from our guest author,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.530
and there will also be a brief
period for questions and answers,

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.120
and then a book signing at the end.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.820
Today's program is being filled
both by the Library of Congress

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.060
for its own website and archive.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.980 position:56%
We now have over 350 of these author
programs in the archive of Books

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.390
and Beyond, which are available on
the Library of Congress's website,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.420
not to mention, website
productions of many author programs

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.680
at the National Book Festival.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:58.250
We just had our 15th anniversary,
and we've had something like many,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.470
many hundreds of authors who have
been part of that book festival.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.460 position:56%
Today's program is also being
filmed by C-SPAN, which is wonderful

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.240
in terms of being able to reach out
nationally, and for this program

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.290
to be part of the C-SPAN archive.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.820
We will have time for a brief
question and answer period

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.670
at the end, and we hope that
you will have questions.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.050
I know that our author
will have answers.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.830
And I want to remind you that by
asking a question and being part

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.690
of that, you are really giving
us permission to perhaps be part

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.130
of the -- at least the Library

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.810
of Congress program
and website broadcast.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.970
Josh Kendall, our speaker today,
is an award-winning journalist,

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.830
and now a critically-acclaimed
biographer who lives in Boston.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.550
He's published many articles in
newspapers, Wall Street Journal,

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.370
the Los Angeles Times, the
New York Times, USA Today,

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.230
and Psychology Today, which I
think when I saw that I said, "Aha,

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.690
that's where Josh gets some of
those insights he's showing,

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.240
his psychological insights that
we will probably hear a little bit

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.830
about in today's presentation.

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.390
He's been writing books, at
least, I believe since --

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.660
Josh I don't have this right.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.210
This was -- "The Man Who Made
Lists" was published in --

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.510
&gt;&gt; Joshua Kendall: 2008.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.890
&gt;&gt; John Cole: 2008.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.880
And his first book --
well, first of all,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.470
Josh always takes a particular
angle on his subjects,

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.960
and I find it interesting,
and I'm always interested

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.910
in how he has not only
chosen his subject,

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.610
but what part of it
that he's emphasizing.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.940
And I finally figured out that
he has a not-too-hard to figure

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.150
out a special place in his
heart for obsessed people.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.530
And often they are book people.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:10.520
His first book, 2008, is titled,
"The Man Who Made Lists: Love,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:17.220
Death, Madness and the
Creation of Roget's Thesaurus".

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.410
His next book, two years
later, came, it was called,

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.350
"The Forgotten Founding
Father: Noah Webster's Obsession

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.470
and the Making of an
American Culture".

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.810
And then finally he got right
to it with the third book,

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.050
which is called, "America's
Obsessives."

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:43.010
And here he presents biographical
profiles of seven American icons,

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:49.040 position:56%
including Thomas Jefferson,
Charles Lindbergh, and Melvil Dewey,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.780
who was the founder of
the Dewey Decimal system,

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:58.820
and himself quite a wonderful but
absolutely obsessive personality.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.960
Now he has tackled and is
publishing in this election year,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.460
a book about another complicated
topic; I held it up once.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.400
It's called, "First Dads:
Parenting and Politics

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.860
from George Washington
to Barack Obama".

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.180
And here he's had to make
some careful selections

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.190
that I'm sure he'll tell us about.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.280 position:56%
But basically it brings together the
personal histories of our presidents

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.680
from yet another new angle,
their experience as fathers.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:37.030
And I'm very pleased to be able to
present to you for his latest take

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.990
on American obsessives and
American presidents, Josh Kendall.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.790
Let's give him a round of applause.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.510
[ Applause ]

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.980
[ Background Sounds ]

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.280
&gt;&gt; Joshua Kendall: Thank
you very much, John.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.580
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.290
I think this is the third talk I've
done at the Library of Congress.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:08.250
I spoke about a couple of my --
one of my word nerds, Noah Webster,

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.350
the forgotten founding father, the
author of Webster's Dictionary.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.870
And then I also spoke about the

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.750
"America's Obsessives"
a few years ago.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.790
When we learn about presidents, we
tend to learn to learn about them

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.190
for the first time in grade school.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.490
And the presidents are
almost godlike figures.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.830
We learn about Washington
and Lincoln.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.210
And they're kind of statues.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.900
I mean, they're -- it's as
if in childhood they're all

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.700
on Mount Rushmore, and
that's all we know.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.790
And then later in life, maybe as
teenager or young adult, or adult,

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.850
we start reading some biographies.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:50.000
And we get a sense, "Hmm, they're
not all they're cracked up to be,"

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.910
maybe, you know, they're
very flawed.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:58.930
And we tend to think of presidents
in very idealized terms, or --

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.790
either idealize them
or denigrate them.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:06.770 position:56%
And what I'm trying to do is capture
how complicated presidents are.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.070
They're many-sided.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:11.090
And I really want to talk
about presidential character.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.580
And I think and the way into
that is through the family.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.390
What kind of father
was George Washington?

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.630
What kind of father
was Abraham Lincoln?

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.600
And I want to give readers a feel
for what it was like to have dinner

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.930
or spend a weekend with
any of these presidents,

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.080
and that will give
you a sense of the man

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.140
and the decision-making process.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:40.200
And James David Barber, a
political scientist in the '70s,

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.050
wrote a book about
presidential character, and said,

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:46.380
"The issues will change,
but the character

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.360
of the president will last."

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.320
So when we think of presidents, we
tend to think of policy; you know,

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.670
"What was his foreign policy?

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.480
What was his economic policy?"

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.580 position:56%
But I think what I'm trying to focus

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.580
on is how the president
makes decisions.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.890
And we can learn a
little bit about that

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:07.130
through how the president
decides how much time to spend

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.640
with his children, whether
to punish his children,

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.730
whether to encourage his children;
and so that it's parenting

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.510
and politics from George
Washington to Barack Obama.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:21.640
Now, the information about
the presidents' kids,

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.230
there hasn't been much
written on this topic.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:30.420 position:56%
One reason is that the families have
tended to hide this information.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.940
Families don't want people
like me, biographers,

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.430
snooping around to find out, you
know, what happened to the kids.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:42.210
Some of the letters of John
Adams to one of his children

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.330
who died young are missing.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:50.210
And so the families tend to
guard against this information.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:58.200 position:56%
And also historians have often
overlooked the family relationships.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.620
And for historians, this is
all considered squishy stuff.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:09.180
Why would it matter whether -- what
kind of dad Franklin Pierce was.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.960
And what I've learned that
it's not squishy stuff.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.640
For instance in 2016,
one of the reasons

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.840
that Joe Biden is not
challenging Hillary Clinton

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.340
for the Democratic nomination
is that he lost a child.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.840 position:56%
And I wrote a piece for the New York
Times when that happened in October

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.560
when he decided not to run.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.140
And going back to Franklin
Pierce, I have a category to talk

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:40.400
about grieving dads,
dads who lost children.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:46.900
Franklin Pierce in 1853,
he was a dynamic person,

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.870
and he was considered --
you know, he was elected

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:55.160
in 1852 two months before
he was about to take office.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:00.130 position:56%
He takes the train from Andover with
his third and only surviving son,

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.150
Benny, who's 11 years old.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:08.600
That train crashes, Benny
gets a hole in his head;

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.420
something falls on Benny's head.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.600
Pierce has to pick up Benny
with a hole in his head.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.920
Benny dies.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.660
And Pierce has posttraumatic
stress disorder.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:18.960
His brain is fried.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.440
A couple of weeks later,
he writes Jefferson Davis,

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.020
his secretary who is going to
become the secretary of state,

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.060
"I don't know how I can go on."

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.270
And Pierce is totally out of
it for his administration.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.560
His wife literally goes psychotic
and starts writing letters

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:39.720
to her dead children, and the civil
war deepens under, you know, his --

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.680 position:56%
I mean, the civil war hasn't started
yet, but I'm saying the crisis

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.140
between the states gets much worse.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.810
So he's not really
there as president.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.910
And the same is true
of Calvin Coolidge.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:58.400
In 1924, Calvin Coolidge is about
to run for a term of his own.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.550
Remember in 1933 when
Calvin Coolidge dies,

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:05.350
the New Yorker journalist Dorothy
Parker says, "How could they tell;

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:06.890
because he's half asleep."

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:10.630
Well, before 1924, Calvin
Coolidge is a dynamo.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.460
He's proposing all kinds of things.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:18.620
In July of 1924, just as he's
about to start his own campaign,

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:25.060 position:56%
his 16-year-old son drops dead after
cutting his toe on the tennis court.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.810
It would something that would
be treated very easily today;

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:33.560
his son Calvin, Jr. And that's when
he starts sleeping 11 hours a day,

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:37.620
and that's when he's --
but he has five more years

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.990
to serve in the White House.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.260
So I argue -- and I go through
it in quite a bit of detail

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.660
in the chapter, that his
depression may well have caused the

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.000
Great Depression.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.570
So this isn't squishy stuff.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.990
This is about the lifeblood
of American history.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:57.690
And just think about it, George
Washington is our first president.

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:01.200
One of the reasons why George
Washington was elected president,

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.290
obviously he was very competent
and, you know, was a dynamic leader

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.080
who brought the country together;

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.980
but Washington had no
biological children.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.440
And after we kicked the
bricks out of our face,

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.630 position:56%
we didn't want to have another king.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.980
And Washington was a safe choice.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.960
And he writes this in a
draft to his first inaugural.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:27.250
He says, "And you can trust me as
your president that I'm not going

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.730
to pass on the reigns
of power to my son."

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.810 position:56%
And again, this isn't squishy stuff.

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:37.630
That fatherhood has
a deep connection

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.900
to the fabric of American history.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.580
And, you know, again, I think
we're facing that issue.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.680
And initially in this election
it looked like was going

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.910
to be dynasty versus dynasty.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.350
So again, Americans hate dynasties.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.650
And maybe that was one

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:55.190
of the reasons why Jeb Bush
had, you know, difficulty.

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:59.960
And this, again, goes back to
the case of George Washington.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:04.480
All right; let me talk a
little about my method.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.770
So this is a nonpartisan book; I'm
taking the long view of history.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:14.190
This is an election year, and I
don't want to encourage people

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.500
to vote for one candidate
or the other, but just think

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.140
about the issues, think
about character.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.460
So we've had 43 Presidents.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.630
Grover Cleveland was
president twice,

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:31.790 position:56%
and we've had 38 had biological
kids, including one of them who lied

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:35.880
about it, Warren Harding;
Warren Harding.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.000
So I have a chapter on presidents;
I call them "double dealing dads",

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.660
presidents with illegitimate kids.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:47.070
So but the other five
presidents all adopted kids.

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.260
So we have a database to --

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:53.410
like Washington adopted
Martha's surviving kids.

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:58.580
So we have a database to analyze
all the presidents as fathers.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:04.050
And I put the presidents
in six buckets.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:07.270
Preoccupied is the most common.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:11.390
So as Jimmy Carter --
Jack, his eldest son,

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.980
said, "Dad was one-track.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:18.520
You don't get to be president
unless you're driven."

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.620
So I mean, that's the most
common category is the preoccupy.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:26.280
These are people who are thinking
about politics all the time.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.010
Lyndon Johnson once said, "Oh,

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.940
I think about politics
only 18 hours a day."

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:36.140
I spoke to Lucy Johnson, and she
said that her sister Linda used

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.590
to read the Congressional Record

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.400
so she could get some
face-time with LBJ.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.190
LBJ could not say, "Hi,
Linda, how was your day?"

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:48.290
That would mean that, you know,
that's not about politics.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:50.350
But if he and Linda could talk

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:52.780
about the congressional
record, then they could connect.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.620
And the girls picked that up.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.710
So that's the largest
category, the preoccupied.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:03.140
Other categories are playful; Teddy
Roosevelt is a famous example.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:07.940
Teddy Roosevelt would work in the
afternoon, and then maybe at 3:00,

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:12.910
he would take off and play
tag in the attic with his son.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.520
And his friends were called
"the White House Gang".

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.510 position:56%
Then I have the double-dealing dads,
dads with illegitimate children.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:23.430
Warren Harding -- and a lot of
the material on Harding is here

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.250
at the Library of Congress.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:30.830 position:56%
And there's now DNA evidence proving
that the mistress who claimed

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:36.310 position:56%
that they had sex in the coat closet
in the White House wasn't lying.

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.490 position:56%
The DNA evidence came out last year.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:43.440
And the story about Harding is
that there was a book in 1928

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.240
by the mistress, and no one
believed it at the time.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:53.240
But then in 1964, a Harding
biographer stumbled on hundreds

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.350 position:56%
of love letters to another mistress;

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:59.310
and that mistress is
Carrie Phillips.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:06.310 position:56%
So if he was carrying on with Carrie
Phillips, then the man Britain,

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:10.590
her story, seemed much
more believable.

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:14.530
And actually, the Library of
Congress has just released all

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:18.530
of those Carrie Phillips letters
in the last couple of years.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.420
So preoccupied, playful,
double dealing.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.930
Another category is Tiger Dads.

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:26.440
You may have heard
of Amy Chua's book

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.990
about the Tiger Mom,
very tough dads.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:34.030
John Adams and John Quincy
Adams fall into that category.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:37.720
And Tiger Dad can either
make or break their kids.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.580
John Adams had John Quincy Adams,
and he basically told John Quincy

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:44.200
when he was a young man "Either
you're going to be president,

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.650
or you're going to be a failure."

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.600
And John Quincy became president,

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.960
but a couple of his other
kids had gotten depression,

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.230
and didn't do so well.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:56.280
Other categories are
the grief-stricken;

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.490
I mentioned Pierce and Coolidge.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:03.400
And the last category are the
sweet dads, the nurturing dads.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:07.080
Our current president whatever
one thinks about is politics,

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.280
I think everyone acknowledges
that he's a great dad.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.480
And but there were actually
some sweet ones going back

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.170
to the 18th Century.

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.810
James Monroe was very sweet.

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:23.250
And Obama is a first
sort of modern dad.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:27.790
I mean, Obama, as I told a reporter
from The Guardian the other day,

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:30.110
is the first presidential dad,

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.620
at least in my calculations,
to do diapers.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.130
And we're probably going
to see more of that.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:38.260
There are going to be more
nurturing dads in the 21st Century.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:44.760 position:56%
But what's interesting is that there
were still some in the 18th Century.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:51.100
And some presidents are
in more than one category.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:55.990
For instance, George Herbert Walker
Bush was both a preoccupied dad --

00:18:55.990 --> 00:19:01.050 position:56%
Jeb Bush once told a biographer, "At
least he didn't put us in a kennel."

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:06.160 position:56%
George Bush was based in Houston,
and he would fly back to Connecticut

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.700
on business, and leave
Jeb and George W. Bush,

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:14.860
you know, back in Houston a lot.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.410
And Jeb said, "At least we
weren't put in the kennel;

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:20.620
we were put with other, you
know, friends of the family."

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.460
But George Herbert
Walker Bush he was very --

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.520
and the preoccupied dads,
they love their kids,

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.850
but they're just very,
very ambitious.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:33.390
And they're just -- so one of
the subtypes is the absentee dad.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:38.040
But George Herbert Walker Bush
also was a grieving father.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.850
He lost his daughter,
Robin, the second child.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:44.700
She was about four
in the early '50s.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:50.440
And that -- so he falls
into both categories.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:57.470 position:56%
And that loss actually gave us a
playful dad, because George W. Bush,

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:02.540
his eldest son who became
president, he was the --

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:06.260
Barbara became very depressed
after this horrific loss.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.370
Apparently, that's when
her hair became white.

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:12.550
And George W. Bush became
very playful with his mother

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:14.810
in an effort to cheer her up.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.620
And he, then, was also very
playful with his two daughters,

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.610
and I talk a little bit
about him as a playful pal.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:28.070
Right; and in each chapter what
I did is I took three stars.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.070
So there are 43 presidents,

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.800
and I wanted to say something
about each president.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:39.190
But for instance, the
preoccupied dads, I talk about FDR,

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.470
Lyndon Johnson, and Jimmy Carter.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:46.270
So I have three stars, and then I
fold in a lot of other presidents,

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:49.680
Richard Nixon, or William
Howard Taft.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.680
So there are 18 presidents
I profile in depth.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:57.790
And for those 18 presidents, I did
archival research, either here,

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:02.600
or at the FDR library,
whatever I could find documents.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.020
And for those presidents, I
also interviewed family members.

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:10.030
I interviewed a couple of --
several of FDR's grandchildren.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:13.480
Some of them are as old as 90 now.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.690
And it was exciting just to talk
to someone who was there, you know,

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:19.270
when he -- 1933 when
he was inaugurated,

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.480
she was about four or five.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.090
But that was just very exciting.

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.930
And then for Jimmy Carter,
I spoke with his son, Chip.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:28.990
So for the 20th Century presidents,

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:31.970
I tried to do interviews
as much as possible.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:34.380
And then for 18th and
19th -- or for --

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.130
you know, for 19th and early
20th Century presidents,

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.900
I relied on archives.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.450
And I try to say something
about them all.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:45.470
So I even say something
about Chester Arthur.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:48.500
You know, no one remembers
who Chester Arthur was,

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.440
Garfield's vice president.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:56.320
And I found out that he was very
playful with his son, and his son,

00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.470
Alan Arthur, became a
playful polo player,

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:03.000
in case you wanted to know that.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.030
[Laughter] All right; preoccupied
is the largest category.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:12.100
So again, that's the
way to become president.

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:17.710 position:56%
And FDR, LBJ and Carter -- and I'd
estimate about 40% of presidents fit

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:21.470
into this category, Van
Buren, Taft, Nixon, Reagan.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:24.070
And then also this election --

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.470
I just wrote a piece
for Parade Magazine;

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:29.310
this election is kind
of a rejection of Obama.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.960
Obama's a nurturing
dad, who's a connector.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:37.530
And in this election, we're sort of
going back to the preoccupied dads.

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.870
Both -- Hillary Clinton's not
a dad, preoccupied parent,

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:46.610
but she was very ambitious,
you know, like her husband.

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:48.450
And same with Donald Trump.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:52.490
I interviewed Donald Trump's
-- one of his sons, Eric.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:56.070 position:56%
And Eric, when he was ten years old,

00:22:56.070 --> 00:23:00.120
was working with his father
at construction sites.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:05.590
And Jimmy Carter's children
were working on the peanut farm

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:10.020
at age ten; were collecting
peanuts and driving tractors.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:16.330
So the preoccupied fathers connect
with their children through work.

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.570
And Obama is very different.

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:22.700
Obama, like Harry Truman, is very
interested in sort of promoting,

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.250
you know, his girls
and their development.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:29.690
But the standard preoccupied dad --
or mom in the case of Mrs. Clinton,

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:32.470
is -- and Chelsea, you know,
works for the foundation,

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:35.180
and her connection --
she's been campaigning

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.760
since she was two years
old, I mean, her connection

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.560
to her parents is through work.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:48.390
And with FDR -- and sometimes,
the president is the same

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:51.650
with the country as
with his children.

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:54.520
John Adams gave us the
Alien and Sedition Acts.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.710
He was kind of an authoritarian
president,

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:59.600
and he was an authoritarian dad.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:04.050
FDR was a father figure
to his country.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:10.590 position:56%
When he dies in 1945, most Americans
felt as if they had lost a father.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:14.960
And he was a very inspiring
leader who instilled hope.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.330
But with his own children,
FDR a different side came out.

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:24.100
And his children literally
held him up.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:28.310
The book starts in 1924 at the
Democratic National Convention

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:32.350
when FDR makes his comeback
after polio, and his son, James,

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:36.790
is holding him up, because,
you know, he can't walk.

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:41.900 position:56%
And FDR, with his children, the
children are parentified [phonetic].

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.830
So with his own children,
he treats his own children

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:47.220
as if they were his parents.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.260
His own children are
kind of raising him up so

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.980
that he can raise the country up.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:58.980
And when James is young,
he wants to me meet --

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:03.420
one of the children is young,
he wants to meet his father.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.300
And they had to make
appointments in the White House.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.880
And the boy wants to -- the
adolescent is going to get married,

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.440
and he wants to talk to FDR and
in the middle of the meeting,

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.050
FDR shoves a document in
his son's face and says,

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:17.970
"What do you think about this?"

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:22.250
And the boy rushes out of the
Oval Office and tells Eleanor,

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:25.210
"I'm never going to talk to him
about anything serious again."

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:30.230
And FDR, again, to his own
children, is a bit neglectful

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:33.700
but to the country,
he's very empathic.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:37.430
And, you know, Ronald Reagan
was another great communicator

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:41.320
who inspired the country
with his infectious optimism,

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.310
but he kind of alienated
his own children

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:47.330
who he didn't really connect with.

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:54.120
Now, Jimmy Carter, as I said
had -- everyone forgets that --

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:58.090
most people who were around during
the Carter administration forget

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:03.170
that Jimmy Carter had these three
sons , that's Chip, Jeff, and Jack.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:06.180
We all remember Amy because
she was very photogenic,

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.790 position:56%
and she was going to primary school.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:11.940 position:56%
But Jimmy Carter had the three sons.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:15.720
And Jimmy Carter -- at
first the sons work with him

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:21.280
in the peanut farming, and
they start working at ten.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:26.660
And then the three sons in the
mid-70s are all in their 20s.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.510
And they're all married;
they all marry young.

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:33.660
And they're his campaign staff.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:38.080
So again, his children
-- without his children,

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.690
there would be no Jimmy Carter
winning the Iowa Caucuses,

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:46.360
because he had a built-in staff
of six when he was a nobody.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.620
And Jimmy Carter is on
"What's My Line" either in --

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:53.330
I think it's late '74 or early
'75, and they can't even guess

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:54.630
who he is, the governor of Georgia.

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:55.970
No one knows about him.

00:26:55.970 --> 00:27:00.130
But he's got this staff
of six and his children.

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:01.730
And he is very grateful.

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:06.370 position:56%
To his credit he's very appreciative
of how much his children helped him,

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:09.510
just as FDR's children
propped him up.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.250
[ Paper Sounds ]

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:18.840
All right; the playful pals, Grant,
Teddy Roosevelt, and Wilson --

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.920
and Wilson is -- everyone
knows about Teddy Roosevelt,

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.410
but Wilson is an interesting
case because we think of Wilson

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:28.170
as this dour intellectual,
which he was.

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:33.200
But a whole different side of him
came out with his three daughters.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:39.310
One of his -- his middle
daughter, Jessie, describes him as,

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:44.560
"A curious mix of dignity
and almost wild gaiety."

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.590 position:56%
He loved dancing with his daughters.

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:50.700
When he was in the White House,
he would do chicken fighting,

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.900
which is a kind of, you know,
pushing each other, you know,

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:56.420
dancing up and down the corridors.

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:59.170
And his brother-in-law, who
lived in the White House,

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:03.320 position:56%
Stockton Axon once said, "What would
the great American public think

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:07.170
if they could see their
austere president now?"

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:13.120
So Wilson is a whole different
ballgame inside the family,

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.940
than he was in public.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.630
So the three stars of
that chapter are Grant,

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:20.360
Teddy Roosevelt, and Wilson.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:24.010
And Grant was actually
a very sensitive dad

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:25.910
who loved playing with his kids.

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:28.140
And again, he was a general.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.160
And in the South, when
they think of Grant,

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.180
they think of a violent killer.

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.270
But he loved playing with his kids.

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:37.510
And there's also the question
of Grant and his alcoholism.

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:40.790
And I found that Grant was
a sensitive family man,

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:44.330
and he drank when he couldn't
be around his children.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:47.280
I found some very tender letters
that he writes to his wife.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:52.040
And he's lapsing into 21st
Century psychology, saying,

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.640
"I'm so attached to my boys.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.940
I miss them."

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:56.820
And that's when he starts drinking.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:02.470
So that gave me new insight
into Grant's character.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:06.480
Now the double-dealing dads,
the heart of the matter.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:12.870
My three stars of this
chapter are John Tyler,

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.900 position:56%
Grover Cleveland and Warren Harding.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:17.850 position:56%
I talked a little bit about Harding.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:24.530
John Tyler -- Tippecanoe and Tyler
[phonetic] to the election of 1840,

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:26.890
that was the most fertile ticket.

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:28.960
Harrison had about ten children.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.800
Tyler had about eight
children with his first wife.

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.900
Then he marries a second
wife in 1844,

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:38.800 position:56%
the last year of his presidency, and
has another seven children with her.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:42.970
But there are also oral histories,
and the oral history suggests

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:47.940
that both Harrison, as well
as Tyler, had slave children.

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:52.460
And Tyler -- I went
snooping around in Virginia;

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:55.370
the oral history suggests that --

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:57.750
there's an account
that Tyler bragged

00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:01.600
about having 52 slave children.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:06.130
That's hard to prove, but there
were allegations that came

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:10.890
out in the press in the 1840s
about some of these slave children.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:17.930
And I looked, and the most striking
allegations are that he sold a few

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:22.280
of the slave children;
so double-dealing dad.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:26.140
And I argue that Tyler both
betrayed these children,

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:30.250
and also betrayed the
country, because during --

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:34.050
when the civil war started,
there were five ex-presidents,

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:38.420
and only one of them sided with
the Confederacy; that was Tyler.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:44.630
And when he dies in 1862, Lincoln
refuses to acknowledge his death,

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:46.090
and considers him a traitor.

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:52.320
So as I said, sometimes the dad and
the politician are of the same ilk.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.840
And that's my argument with Tyler.

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.700
And then I -- you know,
Thomas Jefferson --

00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:59.670
a lot has been written
about Thomas Jefferson

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:02.710
as a double-dealing dad,
and I don't go into him.

00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:07.930
And then LBJ may have
had an illegitimate kid.

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:12.700
There are cancelled checks
from a woman who wrote a memoir

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:16.440
about an illegitimate child.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:21.750
And LBJ definitely was
a bit of a sex maniac.

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:27.870
He once bragged to his staff
and said, "I had as many women

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:31.080
by accident as JFK had by design."

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.750
So the allegations are
definitely believable.

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:38.510 position:56%
And again, what I do in the
chapter is just present the evidence

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:39.810
that there is.

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:41.630
Some cases, it's kind
of a slam dunk,

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:44.690 position:56%
some cases, the evidence isn't much.

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:49.600
But just to -- the three that
Tyler, Cleveland, and Harding --

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:55.030
in the case of Harding, there's DNA
evidence, and Cleveland does admit

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:59.050
that he fathered a
child out of wedlock.

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:00.350
And that was a big issue --

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:03.570
again, that was a big issue
in the campaign of 1884.

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:06.360
So again, this isn't just
squishy stuff about --

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:12.350
this was also that election pivoted
around an illegitimate child.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:16.100
All right; the grief-stricken,
Pierce --

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:21.200
my three stars are Pierce,
McKinley, and Coolidge.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.930
Pierce I told you about.

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:29.790
McKinley has two daughters in the
1870s, both die by the age of four,

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:33.830
and his wife becomes
chronically depressed.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:35.760
But again, it's not squishy stuff,

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:42.250
because it inspires
McKinley to go into politics.

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:44.850
And that's kind of his brand.

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:49.670
His brand was this sensitive
man who'd experienced this loss,

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:52.190 position:56%
who was very supportive of his wife.

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:57.480
His wife suffers a stroke,
and his wife is semi-invalid

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.830
for the rest of her life.

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:00.480
And she's very depressed.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:04.810 position:56%
And what people loved about McKinley
when he's first elected is that he

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:07.820
and his wife -- that
he is very sensitive

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.100
to his wife, and a
caring family man.

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:15.350
So out of this tragedy, it's
kind of polio made FDR --

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:18.290
you know, some of the
biographers have said

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:22.260
that that tragedy helped
FDR empathize,

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:24.410 position:56%
and helped him grow as a politician.

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:28.080
And the same can be said
with McKinley and his losses.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:31.740
And another interesting
example of a grieving dad --

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:34.440
he's not a star in my chapter,
but someone I talk about, is JFK.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:41.250 position:56%
You may have forgotten that JFK
loses his son in 1963 a few years --

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:43.900
a few months before
he's assassinated.

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:47.950
And that didn't so much have
an effect on national policy,

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:49.840
but it did affect his marriage.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:54.060
JFK was kind of carrying on with
various women as has been reported.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:58.740
And his relationship with his
wife was kind of cold for most

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.780
of their time in the White House.

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.730
But in his last few
months of his life,

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:06.940
he and his wife really
reconnected over this shared loss.

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.810
So it did have an effect
on the marriage.

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:12.980
And, you know, JFK was
really evolving, you know,

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.200
when he was tragically killed.

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.380
[ Silence ]

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:21.590 position:56%
Okay; the Tiger Dads are John Adams,

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:26.970
and John Quincy Adams
was also a Tiger Dad.

00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:31.510
His son -- when one of his
sons -- he had three sons,

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:35.570
and one of his sons is 45th out
of 85th in his class at Harvard.

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:39.910
And he says, "Don't bother coming
home for Christmas vacation."

00:34:39.910 --> 00:34:44.080
And then he says -- then when
his son does better, he said,

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.530
"I'm not going to go to your
Harvard graduation unless you're

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:47.860
in the top ten."

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:53.360
So he's always kind of changing the
goalpost, to use a modern metaphor.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:57.600
And another example of a
Tiger Dad is Eisenhower.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.530
He's a military guy.

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:01.300
Eisenhower had a son John.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.680
We think of Eisenhower as
kind of a daughter and golfer.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:07.210
I mean, he was in his 60s, you
know, for most of his presidency.

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:10.130
But, you know, he was doing,
you know, hundreds of push-ups,

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:14.590
you know, well unto his 50s, and
was an amazing physical specimen.

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:19.500
As a -- at army he tackled Jim
Thorpe; he was like a linebacker.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:23.280
And his son, John, once said, "My
father never hit me, but if he had,

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.920
he would have killed me."

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.100
And John said that he was born
standing at his attention;

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.260
and his father would
give him orders.

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:34.890
And Eisenhower also had a
bad temper, and that's one

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:37.520
of the things about Tiger Dads.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.630
And Eisenhower used to
bark at his aides a lot,

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:44.300
and Eisenhower then used
to tell them, "Well,

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.730
my mother taught me how
to control my temper."

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:49.700
And then as soon as he left the
room, one of the aides would say,

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.250 position:56%
"And she didn't do a very good job."

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:52.580
[Laughter]

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:54.610
[ Paper Sounds ]

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:58.620
All right; and now
the nurturing dads.

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:04.640
Rutherford B. Hayes -- remember,
we have the Easter Egg Roll,

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:08.090
which is the largest event in
the White House every year.

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:12.010
Well, that's the child -- to use
the prevailing metaphor of the day,

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:14.400
that's the child of
Rutherford B. Hayes.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.080
He was very sweet to his
own children, and one day --

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.360
in those days, the president
could kind of walk around --

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.670
you know, go out Pennsylvania
Avenue and take a walk.

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:25.110
He's walking in the neighborhood
and a strange kid comes

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:26.910
up to him [inaudible]
and says, "Hey,

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:28.520
can we roll our eggs on your lawn?"

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.720
And he says, "Let me talk to my
people, and I'll get back to you."

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.020
And he says, "Sure."

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:35.260
He was just a sweet dad.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:38.970
And he went for it.

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:43.440
Harry Truman was also very
sweet to his daughter, Margaret.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:47.280
Margaret describes herself
as a total daddy's girl.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.720
And you may not remember
that Bess Truman,

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:54.530
she hated publicity,
and was very shy.

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:58.290
And she was traumatized
early in life.

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:00.870
When she was 18 years
old back in Independence,

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:04.110
her father blew his
brains out in the house.

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:09.700
And Truman was actually afraid of
running, even being on FDR's ticket

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.590
in 1944 because of the publicity.

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:14.700
Suicide then was a
very shameful thing.

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:19.530
And Bess was just nervous,
and just kind

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:23.670
of a lifelong struggle,
kind of private person.

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:27.250
So Margaret just loved her daddy.

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:31.890
And a cute story is that Margaret
wanted to become a singer.

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:36.060
In the 1940s, she graduates
from George Washington.

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:39.290
And Bess, who's kind of stern,
says, "You don't want to --

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:42.750
you can't become a singer, you
know, this is America in the 1940s.

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:44.770
You've got to get married
and have kids."

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:46.890
And Harry says, "No, no, no;

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:49.750
if she wants to be a warbler,
let her be a warbler."

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:51.370
He's very supportive.

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:55.670
And again, today, Obama is
going to do something like that.

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:58.520
The nurturing dads are a
little more commonplace.

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.360
But that was rare for the time.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:03.880
And one of the fascinating things I
found about the nurturing dads was

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:10.040
that the nurturing dads did not
really have dads themselves.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.500
For instance, I mean,
obviously, Obama has a father,

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:17.280
but he only spent about two months
with his own father from Kenya.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:22.120
And Rutherford B. Hayes'
father dies before he's born.

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:27.210
So both of these men father
as they were mothered.

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:28.510
So people have said, "Well,

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:30.980
Bill Clinton is the
first black president."

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:32.280
Well, I think in many ways,

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.200
Barack Obama is almost the
first female president.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.750
He has a very feminine
way of relating.

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:40.490
You know, he's very
nurturing to his children,

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:42.430
and he's nurturing to the country.

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:44.810
And as I said in this
election, I think we're --

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:48.280
America is tired of that,
we want a stronger dad;

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.770 position:56%
we want a stronger authority figure.

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:54.120
And I said in my piece for "Parade"

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:59.560
that I think Americans might
appreciate him more when he's gone,

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:01.710
just the fundamental
decency of the nurturing dad,

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:04.620
whether that's Hayes,
or Truman, or Obama.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:10.060
When Truman left in 1952, his
popularity was like at 22%.

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.930
And everyone thought he was -- he
got a lot of the same criticism

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:17.230
as Obama, that he doesn't
stand up strongly enough,

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:21.490
he's trying to help
everyone get along.

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:25.460
But, you know, David McCullough
wrote that biography 25 years ago,

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:26.760
and there's just this sense

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:29.650
that Truman is now considered
just a very decent man,

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.260
and we really appreciate him.

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:35.370
And I think some of the same
is going to be felt about Obama

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:40.060
by generations who have no, you
know, recollection of him actually,

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:41.430
you know, being in the White House.

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:44.510
All right; I just want to
show you a few pictures.

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:47.750
[ Silence ]

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:51.100
So here is FDR with his eldest son.

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:55.510
So his children are always holding
him up, and that was the nature

00:39:55.510 --> 00:40:00.420
of the relationship, that, as
I said, he nurtured the country

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:03.250
and his children kind
of nurtured him.

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:05.480
[ Silence ]

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:09.150
And here's FDR with his
eldest daughter, Anna --

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:13.110
I mean, eldest child,
Anna, the one daughter.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.670
And again, the relationship
of parenting --

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:19.300
or of children in history -- I
did a piece for "Politico" talking

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.170
about Anna and her
effect on history.

00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:26.260
Anna may well have kept FDR
alive for an extra year or so.

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.990
She was living in the White House,

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:33.310
and FDR's doctors had no idea how
serious his heart condition was.

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:38.110
And Anna, you know, noticed how
frail he was, and was on top

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:43.830
of his health condition, and at
Yalta, she is watching over him

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:47.870
like a hawk to make sure that
he can attend to business.

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:49.170
So again, these children --

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:54.070
these relationships are really
critical to American history.

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:56.130

I think that's at the
-- yes running in '76;

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:11.010
and then the one I showed
you of Amy Carter, you know,

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:14.980
the one child everyone
remembers and her three brothers.

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:16.280
Here's Franklin Pierce.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.540
And Franklin Pierce
was very handsome.

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.600
He was a great speaker,
and there was

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.440
so much hope when he gets elected.

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:28.030
He's the last Democrat to
win a majority of the vote

until Woodrow -- in 1912
he's a very promising figure.

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:38.120
And he's just totally crushed
by the loss of his son, Benny,

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.840

Coolidge, Jr. This is the boy

who dies in 1924, and so Coolidge
had two sons, John and Cal,

Jr. And Cal, Jr. is
lionized as a national hero.

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.660
He was just a really
sweet kid, and he was all

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:03.350
over the papers during
Coolidge's second term.

Dad, John Quincy Adams.

He looks the part.

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:15.090
And here's George Washington Adams.

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:18.210
And this is the saddest
story in the book.

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:23.750
George Washington Adams buckles
under at Harvard under the pressure

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:25.400
of the Tiger Dad, his eldest son.

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.550
And his name is George Washington.

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:32.530
So John Quincy is basically saying,
you know, presidency or failure.

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:33.830
He does very well at Harvard.

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:36.430
He wins a big literary
prize, best in [inaudible].

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:39.470
So he's promising.

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:45.800 position:56%
But then, he starts drinking, he has
an affair with an Irish mistress,

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.440
and produces an illegitimate child.

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:53.450
And when Adams is leaving
here in Washington in 1829,

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:56.950
he writes to George and says,
"Come to Washington from Boston.

00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:59.600
Please come and help me move."

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:04.110 position:56%
And George is terrified that his
father is going to go back to Boston

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:06.280
and see what a mess
he's made of his life,

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.680
find out about his
illegitimate child,

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:14.400
and he kills himself en
route, he jumps off a ship,

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.890
and he's about 28,
which is the saddest.

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:18.830
And this is the Tiger Dad.

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:20.860
I mean, just -- you know,
he's either make or break,

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:24.640
and this would be -- you know,
maybe it was a genetic condition.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.730
I mean, I don't, you know, want
to say it's his fault or anything,

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:29.460
but just the toughness, you know,

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:34.120
it can be really overwhelming
for the children.

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:38.110
But again, another of his
sons, Charles Francis Adams,

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:40.890
does very well and his
presidential timber.

00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:43.470
But this child, this
is really the saddest.

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:48.210
But in general -- and I've
written for Smithsonian Magazine

00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:50.910
and couple other places, in
general, the first children --

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:54.310
until the current crop and
the Bush girls are doing well,

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:55.660
and Chelsea Clinton's doing well.

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:59.430
But in the 19th Century, they
used to talk about the curse

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:04.430
of the presidential child, that --
because these men were also driven,

00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:08.190
and they really didn't put a
lot of time into their families.

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:10.980
And they love their kids,
but they just -- it was a --

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:14.630
you know, they had -- the
family was second fiddle,

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:16.040
and a lot of the kids suffered.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:19.360
And sometimes it's just bad luck
like Benny Pierce being killed.

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:23.390
You know, Franklin Pierce was
actually a very sensitive dad,

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:25.950
but it was just bad luck that
Benny died; but this sense

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:27.280 position:56%
that the first children were cursed.

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:31.800
All right; here is John Eisenhower.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.820
And this is an amazing story.

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:39.040
John Eisenhower is with his
mother, and he graduates

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:44.450
from West Point on June 6th, 1944.

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:46.660
And that's where my chapter starts.

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:55.690
And right after that graduation, he
goes to visit his father in Europe.

00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:59.730
And his father, you know, is a
nervous wreck because of D-Day.

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:02.240
And he's sort of watching, you
know, "What's going to happen here,

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.870
you know, when the
war is a disaster?"

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:08.350
So there's a month-long
father-son bonding.

00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:11.250
And Eisenhower, again,
as a Tiger Dad, you know,

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:15.250
he's criticizing John's bridge
game, and he's criticizing John

00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:17.060
for his uniform is dirty.

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.490
You know, they take a jeep ride

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:22.950
and John's uniform gets
dusty, and Ike criticizes him.

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:25.160
And, you know, he was very tough.

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:29.580
John actually -- again, the
Tiger Dad can make or break,

00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:30.880
John actually does very well.

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:32.180
He just died a couple of years ago.

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:35.390
He was the eldest presidential
child; he dies at about 90.

00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:38.690
But he became a biographer
-- a military historian,

00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:40.110
and wrote a couple of bestsellers,

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:42.510
and sort of found his
niche as a writer.

00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:45.230
[ Silence ]

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:49.640
And here is the playful -- this
is a letter of Teddy Roosevelt.

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:55.160 position:56%
Teddy Roosevelt's writing to Alice,
and he writes these playful letters.

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:58.640
And again, the effect on history,

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:02.360
Teddy Roosevelt wins
the Nobel Prize in 1905.

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:06.670
And one of the reasons he wins
the Nobel Prize is he sends Alice,

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:11.930
his charming daughter,
to Asia on a mission.

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:14.910
And she schmoozes with
Asian leaders.

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:19.730
And again, she really helps
him; he negotiates the end

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:21.480
to the Russian-Japanese War.

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:25.640
But again, his child is
helping him in his career.

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.810
And so I wrote a piece for
"Politico" about the Trump children

00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:33.050
and Chelsea Clinton, is that
we elect not only a president,

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:34.750
we really elect a family.

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:36.900
So maybe we should just check
out, you know, with the children

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:40.260
because they're probably --
especially now when presidents

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:44.440
or candidates are older, their
children are going to, you know,

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:48.610
be around and may be, you know,
involved in some kind of show

00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:51.120
of diplomacy just as
Alice was in 1905.

[ Silence ]

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:55.440
All right; here's Grover Cleveland.

00:46:55.440 --> 00:47:00.820
Both he and Tyler are another
reason why I believe the claims

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:03.470
that they were double-dealing
dads is both Cleveland

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:08.040
and Tyler marry much younger
women, and they have a kind

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.240
of history of being playboys.

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:13.820
And here's Cleveland with
his much younger wife.

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:15.940
She was about 30 years younger.

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:18.670
And here's John Tyler.

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:25.050
And then here's a picture of one
of the slave children of John Tyler

00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:28.600
who -- the Tyler picture,
unfortunately, is very small,

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:32.030
but the facial features
are quite similar.

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:34.060
And that's some of
the evidence that --

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:40.920
I don't know if he fathered all 52,
but that there -- so Jefferson --

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:45.540
I mean, you know, Jefferson
and his slave children,

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:47.180
that was all sort of just rumor.

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:48.690
And then people started
to believe it.

00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:50.810
And then there should
be evidence there.

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:52.650
And I would -- you know,

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:55.780
I think historians now are
taking the Tyler allegations much

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:57.080
more seriously.

00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.500
And there isn't DNA proof yet,

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:02.660
but it sounds as though
there's something there,

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:04.180
and I talk about that
in the chapter.

be happy to answer any questions.

repeat the question?

&gt;&gt; Joshua Kendall: So the
question is about Ulysses S. Grant

00:48:34.770 --> 00:48:38.920
and his daughter, Nellie
Grant, gets married;

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.800

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.760
She marries this Brit, who --

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:47.550
and Grant is terrified because
she's going to move to England.

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:52.930
And the day of the wedding,
Grant goes into a room

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:55.340
in the White House and
just starts crying.

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:56.640
And it's really sweet.

And this is a guy who's a general
and killed a lot of people,

very tender side.

everyone had such high hopes,

losing his daughter to England,

fears were well-grounded.

to stay away.

up in a couple of categories.

I stick him in grieving dads.

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:52.610
And also in the piece that I
wrote for the New York Times

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:57.170
about Biden I talk a little bit
about this, because Willie dies

00:50:57.170 --> 00:51:01.020
in 1862 when he's about 11.

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:04.340
And Pierce immediately writes
Lincoln a letter, and says,

00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:06.510
"I know that you're going through."

00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:11.970
And Willie was a child -- Lincoln
had four children, it was the one

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:16.100 position:56%
to whom he was closest, and he talks
about Willie his like other half,

or a very, very intense
relationship.

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:23.360
And Lincoln -- and some of
the Lincoln biographers argue

00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:25.820 position:56%
that this loss kind of hardened him.

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:29.720
And that was just around the
time, the winter of 1862,

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:33.040
when he really steps up the
civil war and it's sort of like,

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:37.460
"Willie's gone, and it's
going to be okay to, you know,

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:39.650
I really have to do
this, and we really have

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:41.430
to step up the war efforts."

00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:46.900
So that's a way in which, again,
this loss, you know, again, is --

00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:51.480
may be related to national policy;
not always, but that's a theory.

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:54.830
But I just wrote a
piece for "Politico"

00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:58.370
about first children
that went to Harvard.

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:00.810
Malia has chosen Harvard.

She is the 23rd first
child, Harvard.

Yale comes in a distant
second at seven.

00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:09.970
And the reason I mention
that is Robert Lincoln,

00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:12.680
his eldest son, went to Harvard.

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:17.850
And there's a letter that the
Harvard president sends to Lincoln

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:23.060
in 1862, where he says, "Your
kid is failing chemistry.

00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:26.270
He needs a talking to."

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:29.930
And Lincoln was a preoccupied
dad with Robert.

00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:34.830
So with Willie, he was kind of
a playful dad, because Willie's

00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:38.500
at the White House so he can
spend more time with him.

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:40.050
But Robert he didn't see much.

00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:44.720 position:56%
And Robert once says that during
Lincoln's presidency, he never spoke

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:48.600
to him more than ten minutes
because he was so busy.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:53.930
And Robert, also at Harvard,

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:56.750
gets punished for smoking
in Harvard Square.

00:52:56.750 --> 00:53:01.470
He's kind of a -- he's
acting out a little bit,

00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:03.560
and was constantly
getting into trouble.

00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:09.490
But he does graduate from Harvard
and he goes to Harvard Law School,

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:11.250
but then he doesn't finish.

00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:15.430
And Lincoln appoints him
as Grant's assistant.

00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:21.420
And again, Robert has like a
Zelig-like role in appomatics.

00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:26.930
He's at Grant's side when Grant
meets with Lee in April of 1865.

for Eisenhower at his
farm in Pennsylvania.

00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:09.860
And Eisenhower finds out that
he's taking a long lunch break,

and he fires him, [laughter]
the Tiger granddad.

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:19.440

the next day, and he says,

golf and make up."

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:45.770
He would sleep in the Senate
Office Building when he was senator

00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:49.230
and even when he was in the White
House, he would often dinner alone.

00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:51.030
You know, he was a workaholic.

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:55.510
And again, that's one of the
reasons he became president.

00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:59.520
[ Silence ]

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:01.010
Other questions?

00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:03.010
[ Silence ]

00:55:03.010 --> 00:55:05.510
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:11.440
[ Background Sounds ]

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:13.050
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, Josh,
thank you very much.

00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:16.510
And join me in giving
Josh a round of applause.

00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:19.180
[ Applause ]

00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:21.970
Josh is, as you can
tell, an avid researcher.

00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:25.220
And when he digs, he
digs, and he remembers.

00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:26.520
And he's very prolific.

00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:29.360
Your books have come out about
once every two years once you

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:30.660
got started.

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:31.960
&gt;&gt; Joshua Kendall: Yes.

00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:33.260 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Are you going to tell
us what the next one is going to be?

00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:36.420
&gt;&gt; Joshua Kendall: I'm not sure.

00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:39.520
I think I'm going to dive into
presidential families again.

00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:40.820
I'm not sure exactly the --

00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:42.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, you've certainly
got background for that right now.

00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:44.670
&gt;&gt; Joshua Kendall: Yes; I spend
a lot of time [overlapping].

00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:46.600
&gt;&gt; John Cole: You should
go on a quiz show as well.

00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:47.900
&gt;&gt; Joshua Kendall: Yes.

00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:49.200
[Laughter]

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.500
&gt;&gt; John Cole: I know which
categories you could pick.

00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:51.800
&gt;&gt; Joshua Kendall: Yes.

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:53.100
&gt;&gt; John Cole: But we're
going to have a book signing.

00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:54.660
And if you'd like to talk
more with Josh and get --

00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:56.790
buy a book at a Library
of Congress discount

00:55:56.790 --> 00:55:59.090
and get it signed, now is the time.

00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:01.230
The book signing will
be right over here.

00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:04.970
We also have, as you go out,
a list of other talks coming

00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:09.080
up in our Books and Beyond series,
which is scheduled pretty much

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:10.940
through the rest of the year.

00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:13.120
And you'll find that
it's a nice variety

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:17.930
of both books really directly
related to the Library of Congress,

00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:21.670
or, in a way, to other
research libraries.

00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:24.650
And we're not against promoting
other libraries either.

00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:26.900
We like to show the
connections that are needed.

00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:31.540
And I know that Josh, for example,
did archival collections in several

00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:34.170
of the presidential
libraries, And then, of course,

00:56:34.170 --> 00:56:37.570
a lot of the secondary source
material, which is overwhelming,

00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:40.370
was used in some of the
rest of the family things.

00:56:40.370 --> 00:56:42.650
So you did a great
research job as well.

00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:45.290
So a final round of applause for
Josh, and meet him over there.

00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:47.570
[ Applause ]

00:56:47.570 --> 00:56:49.420
&gt;&gt; Joshua Kendall:
Thank you, [inaudible].

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:53.080
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
