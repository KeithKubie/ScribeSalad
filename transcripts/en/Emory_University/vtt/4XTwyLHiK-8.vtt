00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:15.480
There's a sense of pride and the flip side of that a huge sense of humiliation that comes with this illness

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.800
Because it's called mental illness is not called brain illness. I call it cancer of the soul.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.320
It eats away. It's very subtle. It's
very, like I said, insidious.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:35.620
It is something that has a hold on you. So you're not willing, no one is willing to really talk about it.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.200
If you are diagnosed with cancer and you're losing your hair, you have to talk about it. There's lots of sympathy that goes with that.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.800
There's not a lot of sympathy that goes with depression.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.700
It's a very private illness.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.640
There's such a misunderstanding, a lack of understanding, about what this illness really involves.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:02.300
The single biggest misconception about depression is that it's just a lack of will power.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.720
It's that if you're tough and in control of yourself that you can overcome it.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.720
That's not true.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:21.980
Depression is an illness. It is a physical
problem with your brain it's not a matter of willpower

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.600
anymore than cancer
or heart disease is a matter of willpower.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.260
It is still widely believed that
you can power through depression, you really can't.
