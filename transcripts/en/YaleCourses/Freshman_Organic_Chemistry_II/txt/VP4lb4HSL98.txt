Speaker 1:          00:02          Okay, so more today about the lore of acid derivative acids and acid derivatives, which you'll find in chapter 17, 18. We'll get on maybe at the end to chapter 19, but probably that's for Friday. Okay. At the end last time we were talking about uh, having, uh, an r minus that isn't organic metallic molecule react with an acid and showed that of course the first thing it does is act as a base, not as a nucleophile and pull off the Proton. But even at that stage it's possible to for another one to come in and add to the carbon oxygen double bond to give this dye salt. And then when this is hydrolyzed, at the end of the day, you get a ketone. So you can convert an acid to a ketone that way. But it's difficult because uh, sometimes it's not possible to do it in two stages.

Speaker 1:          01:00          Here you stopped at the, at the dye lithium salt, then you got rid of the r minus when you added acid and got the ketone. But in the case of using hydride rather than our minus as the base nucleophile. Again, you first make the salt, but the second time around, uh, you can get the aluminum also is the salt of the oxygen. And when you have that, it's possible. That's not a bad leaving group. It's better than the old lithium, the Oh aluminum so that it's possible to do an elimination reaction where the electrons of the lithium oxygen bond or the oxygen and I can help push out the aluminum, oxygen and ion. So that in situ, well while you're doing the reaction, it forms the Aldehyde bear in mind in the first step in the first reaction when we use the alcohol lithium, we got the carbon eel group back only after adding acid here at forms again, while the reaction is going on.

Speaker 1:          02:04          And of course aldehydes or reactive with literally Mulloon and hydride. So you don't stop at the carbonyl, you go all the way to the alcohol, adding two H's. Uh, now we'll see a little bit later or ways to try to control that. Now decarboxylation is another, uh, uh, interesting reaction of carboxylic acids. And in particular of dialysis, like melodic acid, which has two, uh, two acid groups attached to the same carbon. This is the scheme that, that, uh, Mitsui Nobu used in his paper to talk about, uh, making the compound at the bottom right that we discussed, uh, uh, Dave last time or the time before that. Now remember he first, he got this compound by forming that carbon carbon bond and it has two esters and a CN triple. But we said that it was possible to convert the, uh, the ester into an acid.

Speaker 1:          03:04          We'll talk about this a little bit more and the other Esther into an acid and the cyanide also the NIH trial group into an acid. Now I've drawn that asset at an interesting cotton formation here because you see a possibility this doesn't happen when you have the an eye on. But when you have the, the protonated carboxylate, then it's possible to do and you have to have them. It's possible to do this reaction. So you use these electrons to form a bond to that hydrogen. These go here, these go down here. What's the product at the top from this cycle? Can you see what it is?

Speaker 2:          03:43          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:43          what did the carbon at the top become? Carbon dioxide. Right? So, so you have co two that'll fly off. It's a decarboxylation and you're left with this, which is an Ian. All right? And of course that can undergo an alloy rearrangement to the, to the ketone form of the enormity and the h go on here, right? And then you have the product. So that, so when you have to a carboxyl groups on the same carbon and, and it's protonated so that you can do this cyclic mechanism to transfer the proton, then you can easily lose co two and do a decarboxylation. Okay. But there are other ways to do decarboxylation from acids. The Co two can be a leaving group also from Xco, two minus where x is something that can tolerate a negative charge or from the RCO too radical. So for example, carbonic acid though that hydrate of CO2 got gotten under can, uh, if it, uh, it's an acid, it's also a base.

Speaker 1:          04:53          So if you, if you get this, uh, form, then you can see how it can undergo the decarboxylation. So that's just the reverse. If the hydration of co two, so carbonic acid and CEO to go back and forth, uh, Civil Elisa, that's a case where the x can can leave with the, uh, with an unshared payer. Okay. Or Car Bam make acid where the, where it's nitrogen that does the trick and you can see the same kind of thing to get a decarboxylation, right. Or we actually mentioned last semester already a Colby electrolysis where it's a free radical that does it. So you start with a carboxylate an ion, but you do an oxidation to remove an electron from it, which then makes this, this free radical. But that free radical is fabulously unstable. When r is an eal group and it undergoes this, a shift of the electron, single electrons, it's a radical process, which is fast.

Speaker 1:          05:50          Even at four Kelvin, you can't see Ya ESR spectrum of this thing. Even at that very low and immediately lose a CEO too and gives the stable that the free radical, even if it's not a particularly stable, free radical. Uh, so you remember Colby used that, uh, unbeknownst to him to make r two R two was ethane. Remember he thought he had made the methyl radical, but once molecular weights were determinable, it turned out that he actually had the dimer, uh, ethane. And in fact, that reaction can work fairly well synthetically to take two acids, knock out two CEO twos and have the rs come together. Uh, that was done in 1848, but in 1973, uh, they got a 50% yield by doing electrolysis that generates this free radical by losing CO2 from it and the dimer was formed. Okay. So there are examples of decarboxylation, uh, but also there's another one that's interesting, which is to treat an acid, uh, with silver oxide, which gives a silver salt of the acid.

Speaker 1:          07:00          Right? Then if you treat that with bromine, you get our br. So you can convert a carboxylic acid to the are to the, to the [inaudible] bromide with one less carbon atom. A decarboxylation has been involved, okay. And it's pretty easy to see how that would work if you react. The salt with br to the o minus can do a nuclear filling substitution on bro, been with bromide leaving to give this, uh, to give this a bro brominated intermediate. But now if you have a free radical in there, it can attack the bromine to form the RBR bond and generate this radical, which is we've already seen immediately lose a CO2 and give. So we have a free radical chain that allows, uh, this, uh, brominated acid to become our br. Now this, this reaction to convert an acid to a, an Lpo, bromide is called the Hunt's Deeker reaction for a sort of curious reason.

Speaker 1:          08:06          It seems to me in between 1936 and 1944, uh, the hunts dickers husband and wife, uh, published, I think something like six patents for doing this and one paper in the open literature. Right? But in fact, the same reaction had been done in 1861 and published in a leading German Journal and Nolen, uh, by Alexander Porphyria of Bora Dean who was obviously much earlier than the hundred stickers. This is his, uh, his, uh, Tulum in Saint Petersburg. And notice that it doesn't have anything about doing this reaction on it cause he was not only a chemist, he was also a musician. Uh, so can you those, I know some of you are good musicians. Can you see what this line is up at the top?

Speaker 2:          09:01          What is it?

Speaker 1:          09:03          Paula. Betsy and dances by Bora Dean from Prince Igor. And in fact, although he didn't get any recognition in terms of the reaction being named for him, these people that came along 75 years later got their credit. He did get a posthumous Tony Award because that tool, you know, Dadada Dadada Dadada is the, is the theme of the musical Kismet. So he came out, okay. Anyhow, okay. But now when we think about, so here's a way to take our CEO too and make it into our br, right? When you're thinking about possibilities or synthesis, you should think about is there, is there a way to go the other direction to start with our br and go to our, to go to the acid with one additional carbon. So can you add a carbon to do that? Can anybody think of a way of doing that to take our br and substitute the br with an acid groups, you know, to put another carbon on the chain.

Speaker 2:          10:09          Okay,

Speaker 1:          10:10          we'll actually talk about this some more later, but we, we, we had shown an example that if you have cyanide, which, which is a nuclear file, so you could do an sn two reaction and put cyanide there. But cyanide has the same oxidation state of the carbon as the acid does. So just treating it with water and either acid or base, and we'll talk about this a little later on and he can do that. So you can go either direction, you can take the acid to the bromide or the bromide to the acid. And that's not the only way. Notice that this involves the are being our, plus the thing with the Lumo, the sigma star that gets attacked by the cyanide. But there's another way to start with Rbr, whereas our is r minus, it's a homo that does the, the uh, the attacking. So how would you convert RBR into something that's like our minus something that has a high homo?

Speaker 2:          11:04          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:04          Under what circumstances does ar have behave like our minus is it associated with a high homo?

Speaker 2:          11:14          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:14          When it's associated with a halogen, it's a low Lumo right. What is it? And it's the, uh, it's the sigma star, but how can you get the sigma to be high energy?

Speaker 2:          11:26          Pardon me?

Speaker 1:          11:28          A greenie. Ari Agent. Okay, good. So you, if you want our minus, you read, make a Greenie our reagent and now you have to react that in order to get an acid, what will you react it with? What will it attack in order to put the carbon oxygens on

Speaker 2:          11:47          Roy [inaudible]?

Speaker 1:          11:49          Yeah, sure. Carbon dioxide. It's exactly the reverse of the reaction we're talking about. Right? So you bring carbon dioxide in, you got the salt, treat it with acid and you do it. So there's, there are many ways to skin these cats. Okay, so we're talking about acid derivatives that we've just been talking about acids, but acid derivatives are things where you have some other group, their x with an unshared pair. Not, uh, not ooh. Okay. So, uh, one example that's called it an acid derivative is a night trial that we just talked about. Uh, another one is a key team. Now let's think about how these are regarded as acid derivatives there. As we just mentioned in the last slide, the carbon has a plus three oxidation level, cause x is electronegative something with the unshared pair there. And in night trial it's also plus three.

Speaker 1:          12:45          So you can go between these things, that acid just by treating them with water. Okay. Although you may need catalysts than a high temperature in order to do it. Night trials are not so easy to, do. You remember he, he a reflux that for 24 hours or something like that in order, uh, Mitsui, Nobu did in order to do this. Okay, that's fine. But over here the carbon is, is plus two in its oxidation level. It doesn't look like you're dealing with the same thing, right? However this other carbon is minus two and if you add water to it and if you go to the acid, it's minus three plus three. So it's, it's again no change in our overall oxidation levels. So you don't need an oxidizing her reducing agent and you can just do that with water. So key teen will react with water to give a carboxylic acid.

Speaker 1:          13:37          So all these things are called acid derivatives. Okay? First, just the word about the spectroscopy. In fact, I'll go in about three seconds through the first slide cause we've already done it in some detail. I remember we looked at carbon eel stretching frequencies in the IRR and saw that aldehydes and ketones were similar, but the amid was much lower frequency because of the unshared pair on the nitrogen being involved stabilized by the carbon oxygen Pi Star. And therefore weakening it to make it a weak bond. But it's in the case of, uh, but in the case of the Ester, the bond was in fact strengthened a bit. And in the case of acid chloride, it was strengthened quite a bit. And that the reason for that was that you could get this other curious resonance structure. Okay, so we already did this and I'm not spending any time just reminding you of it, but the one thing I'll talk about that's new is, is the an hydride, which is of course an acid derivative where the x group that can, that's attached to the carbon eel is another acid.

Speaker 1:          14:46          So here we see an IRS spectrum and here is the percent transmission. So that's, so this is very little light. Getting through a strong absorption means a means. A small number here. And if we look in this, this region, here's the carbon eel region, we see that there are two peaks, which isn't surprising because there are two carbon eels, right? There's one at 1819 which is very strong. And another one at 1750 which is considerably weaker right now to carbon eels to IRR frequencies to IRP because that seems to make sense except that it's symmetrical. Wouldn't you expect them to be the same?

Speaker 3:          15:31          Pardon me? Asymmetrical frequency.

Speaker 1:          15:35          Okay, so they couple, right? The two, they could either both be stretching at the same time or one can be stretching while the other shrinking. And if they're close enough together, separated only by ox one oxygen, they can interact mechanically one another and one of those is easier than the other. So the normal modes, there are two normal modes. Both involve both of the COO bonds. Right. And we can understand how it would be because if they're, if they're in phase both stretching at the same time, then the light will interact very strongly with it. Okay. Because both of them were being stretched by the same direction of the electric field and the light. So, and it turns out that that's difficult to do. It's difficult to stretch them both at the same time. It's better to have one stretch when the other shrinks in terms of energy.

Speaker 1:          16:26          So this one is hard to do. That means it's at high frequency, but it's quite intense because the, the uh, the, but they're both going the same direction. The other normal mode would have one going up while the other's going down. Now if they were strictly parallel, there would be no net interaction to the light for that. But if they're twisted a little bit or splayed out a little bit, then there will be some interaction with light. They won't exactly cancel one another. And that's what happens here. So you have a strong peak where they're both stretching at the same time and a week or peak where one is stretching and the other is shrinking. Okay. Now if you compare that with this sick leak image, which is another acid derivative where nitrogen is attached to the ACL group. And now we looked at the, at the peaks here, and you see a strong peak at low frequency and a week peak at high frequency. So it's exactly the opposite. Can you see why it would be the opposite?

Speaker 1:          17:32          Cause now when they both stretch at the same time, when when one stretches and the other shrinks, the oxygens are moving the same direction. So they're both in being pushed the way light wants them to go. Right where, so that one, which is now, which is now the easy one to do where stretch one and shrink the other is now very strong. It interact strongly with light. But the one where they're in phase here is now a very weak, they nearly cancel one another. Okay. So that's just an interesting additional example of, of uh, of, uh, IRR coupling. But it helps you see how you use the IRS to interpret stuff about structure as the weather to carbonyls are parallel or anti parallel most of the time. Okay. Now the Inter conversion, the chemistry of the acid derivatives. So the idea is that some nucleophile comes in and forms the bond and then the other one leaves day. So that's a substitution. But of course it involves a tetrahedral intermediate. It's not like sn two. You actually have an association to give it in a stable, intermediate followed by dissociation. So it's not a pentavalent transition state. It's a tetrahedral Tetra Vaillant carbon intermediate. Now, which group will leave from that intermediate x or y? Well, there's a hierarchy of these things. The easiest thing to leave as chloride than carboxylic acid than an alcohol and I, and then nitrogen and I. And so, uh, and you can, uh, you can see why this would be why so?

Speaker 1:          19:16          Because that's the order of stability of the Anti Ins, right. As, as, as exemplified in the PKA. So if you could make the most energetic one, the top one. Yeah, the acid chloride. Then by adding the others successful successively, you could make it into any of the other three or the next one. The asset and hydride into, in either of the other two or the ester into the amid or, and so on. So the important thing is to get up at the top of the ladder at the beginning. And you can do that the same way you'd converted alcohol to do RCL. You can get rid of the acid to the acid chloride by using SOCL too. And as I was saying, out of order before the, the, this, this order of the hierarchy is clear because of the pks, they're in the order of the stability of the Anti Ions, right?

Speaker 1:          20:12          But it's not just the stability of the anti ions that makes them have that order because as we saw before, you get resonance stabilization of the electrons that are on why that is the, the, uh, whatever this group is here, chlorine, oxygen, oxygen, nitrogen, right is those electrons are stabilized by the vacant orbital here as denoted by these resonance structures. So even if you didn't have the question of the stability, the, and ions, this stability of the derivatives would still be the same that it likes most to be with nitrogen because it can get the special stability from stabilizing the high energy electrons of the nitrogen. It's lower. If it's an oxygen, it's still lower if it's a carboxylate group because although it's an oxygens unshared pair, as in the case of alcohol, those electron, that electron pair on that oxygen has already stabilized by its own Carbonell group.

Speaker 1:          21:10          So it's not as available for being stabilized by, by the one here. So it's not, so this one is not as stable as that. This one is not as stable as that. And what that means is you don't have to do this with base in order to get these anti ends in order to have this reactivity scale. You could do the same thing if you, if you had acid catalyzed and we've already seen it in the case of Fischer esterification where you convert, uh, an out where now it's a question of alcohol and water. That is, are you going to put on Oh, are or are you going to put on o h right. And we've, we've gone through the acid catalyzed and mechanism of Fischer esterification which converts Oih to Orr or o r o h and the equal. And you can also do transistor effication.

Speaker 1:          21:59          You can take one Esther and a different alcohol and have the o our prime replace or double prime or something like that. You could go back and forth from one Esther or the other. But the equilibrium constant for this acid catalyzed processes about one. There's not much difference among the different ares, but you make it go the way you want in a Fischer esterification by using the law of mass action, you put in a whole bunch of alcohol, then you get that Esther. Okay. Or are you put in a whole bunch of water and then you get the carboxylic acid, right? So the going back and forth between a alcohol between Esther and acid also is, is very much like these transistors applications. But if you use base, it's a different story, right? So you can have a hydroxide come in and or minus go out. That's fine. And it looks like it should be, uh, an equilibrium constant of about one. But in fact, this reaction has a special name [inaudible] and it has an equilibrium constant, much greater than one. Now, why should there be a difference between o r and o h? An enormous difference. It's because this isn't the end of the line. That O r minus that disappeared can get back in the act. In what way?

Speaker 2:          23:21          Okay,

Speaker 1:          23:24          Sebastien. Right? This is it. This is not called an acid for nothing, right? So it can, it can transfer the proton to the or minus. And now that's very favorable because the pka of the acid is about five. The PKA of a typical alcohol is about 16 so they differ by 11 orders of magnitude. That means the equilibrium constant is about 10 to the 11th when you take factor in that you, that you don't stop at the acid but go to the anti end of the acid and to the alcohol. Okay? Now, why does this thing have a special name? Saponin effication this particular, uh, substitution reaction because you have these things called triglycerides, which are long chain acids, right? Attached as Esther's to a three carbon unit, right? Do you know what else you call those things besides triglycerides, but fats? Okay, so that's fat. And if you treat fat with lie, you're doing something that's been known through Millennia, right? Because lie is what you get when you take the ashes from a fire and, and filter water through it, right? And then evaporate the water. You know what you get? What lie is?

Speaker 2:          24:53          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          24:54          it's potassium hydroxide.

Speaker 2:          24:57          Okay?

Speaker 1:          24:58          So you treat it with Koh and you have this reaction take place. So you get carboxylic acids, long chain carboxylic acids, and you get alcohols on all those, those three. So these long chain fatty acids, the salts of them, the potassium salts are called what?

Speaker 2:          25:19          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          25:19          Why is it called [inaudible]? Pontification what's Savo owner? South Porn. Yeah. Right. It's so, right. So that's how soap was made and still is made. Right. And that stuff is called glycerin that try alcohol right now there's a very interesting book about lore in the Appalachian Mountains called the Fox fire book. Has Anybody seen that? There was a movie made from it a long time ago actually, but a bunch of high school, uh, uh, English class, uh, had the project of going out and talking to people who knew how to do things and then write the traditional lore. And one of the people they talked to was the grandmother of one of the girls who was, uh, whose name was Pearl [inaudible] Martin and who made soap. And so she showed the girl, she had a big kettle and put in Lard and put in lie. And, and stirred it up. And, and she says, and then there she says now the soaps making and so on. And so she got the soap out and she said, you know, I can wash my hair in it. And the girls were, were astounded that she would wash her hair in this stuff that came from lie.

Speaker 2:          26:29          Right. But

Speaker 1:          26:32          she said, I eat afraid to wash my hair in it. She said that their lard eats the lie. What did she mean by she? She of course, hadn't studied chemistry, at least I don't believe, although she had very good practical knowledge of it, that she knew that she could wash her hair with this stuff. Even though it you'd put lie in it. The girls were dumbfounded at this. Right. But the reason is that the large eight, the lie, the lie was like Aro minus, right. PK about 16. But this last stage that makes the reaction go, it makes it a Karbach slate with the PK of only five. So it doesn't hurt your hair. Yeah. So there's some tradition for you now. Uh, an interesting, uh, uh, question is how to, is what happens when the nucleophile is r o minus our apartment is r minus or h minus rather than these other things. So I'm going to put a little bit of this on the board and there's a, let's see us get this up. Put this thing over on the other screen.

Speaker 2:          27:41          Actually it's supposed to be there. Yeah, there it is. Okay, so let me put this up and get some light here. Yes, yes. This no, this, there we go.

Speaker 1:          28:16          Okay. So what if you have r minus or h minus as the nucleophile.

Speaker 2:          28:36          Okay,

Speaker 1:          28:37          so suppose we start, these are for reactions with acid derivatives. Suppose we use the acid chloride then if we use hydride for example, lithium aluminum hydride so the alh four minus hi homo there. Okay, so that's good. So hydride can come in here, put minus on the oxygen, chloride can leave

Speaker 1:          29:05          and we get Aldehyde. Okay. But, uh, the reaction won't stop there, right? Because we already know that aldehydes are reduced by lithium aluminum hydride. So we'll go on to put two, uh, pardon me to put two hydrogens on and, and make ultimately make this. And ultimately when you add acid, you'll get all the way to the alcohol, not just to the, sorry, not just to the, uh, to the Aldehyde. So it's not just our substitution of chloride by hydride, but you go on all the way to the product or if you have an al kill lithium or an LPL magnesium bromide.

Speaker 2:          29:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:58          You'd do the same kind of thing. You get the out the, the, uh, now would be a ketone first. Cause this is an art group.

Speaker 2:          30:07          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          30:07          But again, you go on and get the alcohol having put on two new our groups. So if that's the kind of alcohol you want with two our groups, there's a good to our groups have the same kind that you can get from an Lpo. Hey, lied then, uh, that's a good way to do it. Now if you do use an Ester,

Speaker 2:          30:31          yes,

Speaker 1:          30:36          I'll just write ditto.

Speaker 2:          30:38          Yes.

Speaker 1:          30:40          Right. If you, if you react it with Alyssa, Google hydride, you get all the way to the alcohol. Replacing now the or minus instead of the cl or if you use LPL lithium or I'll kill magnesium bromide. You all go all the way to the alcohol. In fact on a particularly interesting one is to use to chlorine or two asters. Can you see what would happen in that case if you use, if you react to those with the hydride or with the uh, or with the r minus at Lpl metal compound, what's going to be different? Well, if you went through, uh, yeah, you, you, you, you replace the chloride by r minus, same kind of trick we're doing here or h r h minus. Then you replaced the other chloride by h minus or are minus, get an Aldehyde or a ketone and then you do the, then you add to the carbon eel. So now we put three groups on. So we have a c o h at the end with three our groups. You could do the same thing with the hydride, but there wouldn't be much point in making methanol that way. You're using expensive reagents to make something cheap. But if you want something that has three of the same art groups on it, that could be a practical way of going about it. Okay. It's slightly different.

Speaker 2:          32:28          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          32:28          If you're using an ami and a mid, so suppose you is, let aluminum hide

Speaker 2:          32:39          dried. Now we'll get, uh, just, uh, all this are here. So we have Nh two

Speaker 1:          32:57          and h minus that came in right now what we've done above is then deludes this group that was originally there, Louis chloride or lose. Oh, minus R o minus. Right. But it's a little different here because with the aluminum salt here, the aluminum helps make this oxygen a better leaving group than it would otherwise be. So in k instead of losing, instead of coming like this and losing the nitrogen, what happens is the unshared pair helps you lose the oxygen. So the, the nitrogen is not lost. It's still

Speaker 2:          33:45          there as n a double bond. Now H and two h is on there. Right?

Speaker 1:          34:00          But now that's rather like the carbon eel group. Right? So the h minus can get the lithium aluminum hydride can get in the act again.

Speaker 2:          34:12          Okay.

Speaker 1:          34:13          And the product from lithium aluminum hydride reduction of an amid

Speaker 2:          34:21          isn't a mean.

Speaker 1:          34:36          Okay. So now these are examples then of going all the way to the coh carbon deals completely gone. And if you added two or in one case, three groups, uh, but you might actually want the intermediate, you might want the Aldehyde. So the question arises is there a way to stop it so you can get that intermediate product and you can do that. You can stop by tuning.

Speaker 2:          35:09          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          35:10          the nucleophile so that it's able to react in the first reaction but not reactive enough to react in the second.

Speaker 2:          35:32          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          35:33          So for example, instead of using lithium aluminum hydride use lithium aluminum hydride, but that instead of having other hydrogens on it has OT beautiful taken three times. Now there are two things about that having that in place of hydrogen. The first is that the oxygen is electron withdrawing. It stabilizes and ions. So it makes the electrons here that are going to be doing the attacking the sigma electrons. It makes the blower in energy at less reactive. What else about having the tea butyl group here would help in mitigating the reactivity of that? Try Tbo toxi lithium aluminum hydride

Speaker 2:          36:29          roll,

Speaker 1:          36:31          right? It's big. So it's hard to approach. Okay. So, so it's reactive enough to do take the acid chloride to the Aldehyde, but not to take the Aldehyde in the second step, but it's used at very low temperature at dry ice temperature. Right? So that, that second reaction won't happen or you can use, uh, in a very similar, uh, situation, a reagent called die bow. Again, you use it at minus 78 degrees and it's, it's again, uh, uh, an aluminum hydride. But now again, it has, it doesn't have the oxygen's [inaudible] but it has to isobutyl groups, which again are big and help, uh, help tame it so that one, it could be used with the ester and take it over to the Aldehyde or, uh, another way of getting from the acid chloride, uh, or, uh, uh, from the acid chloride and stopping at the Aldehyde is to do it with h two and a catalyst. So the acid chloride reduce it to put h two on the ends of the bond. But of course the Aldehyde can also be reduced. So you tame the reactivity of the catalyst by adding a nitrogen containing compounds. Quit on this is called the Rosen Monday.

Speaker 2:          38:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:34          Procedure. We saw this before, the idea of of a catalytic hydrogenation where you make the catalyst less reactive in order to stop it and remember what that was way back when.

Speaker 2:          38:47          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          38:47          right. The Lid lar catalyst where you wanted to take a triple bond and go just do a double bond but not from the double bond to a single bond. It was again a case of adding something that would poison the catalyst.

Speaker 2:          39:01          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:02          And finally, just as a reminder,

Speaker 2:          39:05          okay.

Speaker 1:          39:06          It's possible to have an acid chloride

Speaker 2:          39:10          yeah.

Speaker 1:          39:10          And react it with a very, very weak carbon nuclear file that only will react if you soup up the, uh, chloride by using ALC l three to help make that a good leaving group. Now you can use a really weak, uh, uh, uh, carbon nucleophile high homo on carbon, right. That will react to give the ketone. But won't react with the ketone because it's so weak here. Or you did a special thing to help make the chloride reactive, but it doesn't help make the Quito and you get reactive. Remember what the nucleophile is you use in this?

Speaker 2:          39:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:56          An ACL chloride, ALC, all three.

Speaker 2:          40:08          What is it?

Speaker 1:          40:19          He's situation. So you could use benzene as the nucleophile. We talked about it from the point of view of something attacking benzene, but now we're looking at it the other way. Benzene attacking the something else, right? So we make the aromatic Quito on that way by Friedel crafts isolation. But again, it's a question where you can do the first one but not the second one. By tuning the reactivity of the, of the reagents. Okay. Now, uh, acid base hydrolysis of RC. Yeah. Let me just use the other board here for it for a moment.

Speaker 2:          40:59          And this one? No, that one.

Speaker 1:          41:02          Okay. So we talked before about about converting the CN two carboxylic acid. Okay. And we can, we can go through acid and base catalyzed mechanisms of doing that. There's, it's, it's very simple. And I've, I've got a blackboard realization of that just to trace through it quickly. Okay? So you have the, the, the night trial, the CNE group, protonate it rev a resonance structure. They ass plus on carbon. React that with, so now you've got the COO bond, lose a proton, okay, so you have the alcohol here now, but then protonate the nitrogen. Now that's uh, now we have this, but if you take a take of base and pull off this proton, you have the amid, okay? In other words, this is an Al Lily curry arrangement. It's a height, uh, uh, hydrogen hydrogen here that goes to the other end of this double bond, okay? So you, so you could get partway to the acid you get from the, this acid derivative to this acid derivative, the amid, okay.

Speaker 1:          42:15          But now suppose you protonate this back again and get to this one, which I've redrawn here and have that carbon plus attacked by the, by water, right? So now a second water attacking the carbon. Okay. And take the Proton off here and put it on the nitrogen and then have the Nh three leave with the electrons. All right? You know this cat die and lose a proton and now you're all the way to the carboxylic acid. So there are two stages of substituting water here. First or first adding first adding water to give the amid and then changing the amid acid derivative into the asset itself. So that's acid ketalysis and I won't spend more time on it now, but it would be good for you to be able to do that. Okay. But you can also do it with base, right? So in base you, you attack the CN triple bond as if it were a COO double bond and write this, but a proton on right.

Speaker 1:          43:18          And now do the elderly curry arrangement. The same thing we did before, except that now instead of being acid catalyzed, it's base catalyzed. So we're halfway, there were two the amid, I have once we put the last proton on and now we can go from the amid, attack it and then lose the Nh two probably after when it's inappropriate mated farm and we have the carboxylic acid and drive it all the way to completion in base as in the case of Saponin effication by making the anti in the stable Carbox lady and I am okay. So they're both acid and base could be used but it's a hard reaction to do. It has to be heated a lot and there sometimes people even do it using biological catalysts that to try to get it down to two, a lower temperature.

Speaker 1:          44:11          Now a key teen we said was another, uh, another uh, acid derivative. So you have an acid chloride and react it with an a mean. We've just been talking about reactions like this where the product, you lose chloride add nitrogen and the product is an amid the carbon eel with nitrogen next to it. But this is a special case because there are three alcohol groups on the nitrogen. You'll see how that makes it special. I, Asia, we have you put, if you put, if you use the nitrogen as a nucleophile and attack and chloride leaves, then you have n plus, right? Because you've used the unshared pair to make that new bond and normally you'd, what would you do with that? And plus how would you get rid of the charge north? Normally you lose a proton from the amine. But this time we used a try out kill.

Speaker 1:          45:10          I mean so it can't do that. So in fact it doesn't do it right. Instead instead of doing it probably attack, sometimes chloride probably leaves, but chloride can come back and then nitrogen leave because it couldn't become stable by losing a proton. So that probably goes on. But another reaction can happen instead, which is for the, the nitrogen base to attack a proton here. So you could do an elimination reaction, lose hcl and you generate then key teen, this funny molecule, which is sort of an analog of co two, right? Except instead of an oxygen, you have ch two group here. Now that group then can be attacked by a nucleophile the same way CO2 is attacked. And now you have the nucleophile attack and that attack and that's an analyte so we could draw the resident's form of it, right? And we could put a proton on there, right from the, from the protonated nuclear file and get the, get the product right.

Speaker 1:          46:14          Plus the nucleophile and I in which has now been able to do it to the next, uh, key teen. Okay. So what we've done is convert, uh, keeped heating into an acid derivative depending on what nucleophile we used, right? And you can use lots of different nuclear files. Here's for example, taken from that, uh, Jones textbook is a, is a sulfur as the nucleophile. This, they said it was done at dry ice temperature for three days and gave a thioester right? At 93% yield. Or instead of base catalyzed like this, it could be acid catalyzed. So reaction with t butyl alcohol with acids, so the acid can protonate the oxygen, then the oxygen, this oxygen can attack, right? As a nucleophile lose the proton and you get the TB, the Lester 87% yield, or you can use a nitrogen, right? This has done an ethanol water and it gives us 75% yield. Of course these other things could have, could have reacted right? The O minus or the r h o minus could have reacted if it were in base, but it's probably it, although it's not, doesn't, isn't said so here it's probably an acid. So it's probably acid catalyzed reaction now then you can have a insertions into ACL. Our bonds. Let me just start this and we'll finish it up next time. So we'll talk about the first reaction. You remember this picture? Who's interesting in this picture that we talked about before? This guy here.

Speaker 1:          47:55          Remember who that is. What did he do? If you can't remember his name, he made try fennel methyl, right. That's Gomberg. So this is the same picture. And there's buyer who was the boss of the lab. But this is Victor Villinger. I a Swiss who was working in the music lab at the time and just at 1900. So the same time that that, uh, God Berg was making try fennel methyl, the buyer Villinger reaction was, was invented, which inserts oxygen into, uh, an ACL bond. So let me just, uh, do that one quickly on the board and then we'll quit. So what we're doing is taking our oh bar and we're going to insert on Adam in here to make it r o o r right? So change a ketone into an ester. And the way it's done is to react it with a per oxy acid.

Speaker 2:          49:13          All right?

Speaker 1:          49:16          So now we have our oh minus and it's, it is acidic. So we'll take the old liners, uh Oh. Oh,

Speaker 2:          49:32          okay.

Speaker 1:          49:34          And now normally we normally, what we think of as these electrons come in,

Speaker 2:          49:40          okay.

Speaker 1:          49:42          And lose this group. Look, probably lose this group, but we don't have a leaving group here, right? So instead what happens is that these electrons come here.

Speaker 2:          49:57          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          49:59          So we have double bond o at the top are, and now what's attached here is, oh, this, oh. And attached to that o is the other r and this good an ion has left,

Speaker 2:          50:17          right?

Speaker 1:          50:18          So we ended up by inserting an oxygen into the CR bond. And we're, we're gonna talk more about that next time.
