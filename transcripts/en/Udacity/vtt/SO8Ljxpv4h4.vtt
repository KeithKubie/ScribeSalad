00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.162
So if we did multiply each of these terms by 2 x what new equation would we get

00:00:05.162 --> 00:00:09.468
here? Keep in mind that when we multiply through by the LCD we're really going

00:00:09.468 --> 00:00:13.177
to clear each of these fractions. That's the goal. We want to get something

00:00:13.177 --> 00:00:14.649
that's more simple to work with.
