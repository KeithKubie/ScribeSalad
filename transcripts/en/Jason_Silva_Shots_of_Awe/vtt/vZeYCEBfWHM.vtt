00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.740
I've been lucky enough
not to lose anyone

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.230
I love except my grandfather
to actual mortality.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.230
But that doesn't mean
that I haven't experienced

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.910
symbolic death, symbolic death
in the form of love lost.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.970
There's a reason that
melancholic movies get

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.485
under my skin and why I can't
look at most Instagram photos

00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:37.270
for more than a few
minutes at a time.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.710
Because I get sad over something
I haven't necessarily lost yet.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.110
Falling in love is like
staring into the sun

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.820
and finding that
instead of blinding you,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.620
it illuminates you.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.940
And all of a sudden, you
went from being blind

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.132
and then you can see.

00:00:50.132 --> 00:00:51.590
It's the moment of
feeling like you

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.350
are complete for the first time.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.720
Roland Barthes says, all
of my desires, abolished

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.560
by the plentitude of
their satisfaction.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.890
Love is fulfillment.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.250
Love is to overflow.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.620
Love is spill over.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.010
Love is aesthetic arrest.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.200
Love is the italization
of experience.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.230
Love is getting caught up in
something larger than yourself.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.110
Love is radiance beyond
all previous limits.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.300
It's consummation,
it's consecration.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.890
It's a dance with the divine.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.080
It's, I went to God just to
see, and I was looking at her,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.570
reflected right there
in front of my eyes.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.205
That's love.

00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:24.790
And so when you lose
love, when you break up

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.770
with somebody you cared
about, somebody in whose arms

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.535
you felt the promise
of forever, and you

00:01:30.535 --> 00:01:32.423
felt the promise
of eternity, you

00:01:32.423 --> 00:01:34.405
felt the promise
of souls merging.

00:01:34.405 --> 00:01:36.270
And then to contemplate
the idea that there

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.330
was a time when we were
together, and now we are not,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.470
how could it be so?

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.994
How could it exist, that once
we were us and now we are not?

00:01:44.994 --> 00:01:47.160
And then you look at old
videos and old photographs,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.630
and you can't
believe that there is

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.040
a reality playing
back there for you.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.861
You are seeing a
replay of something

00:01:53.861 --> 00:01:55.900
that was real and
tangible and solid.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.850
And where'd it go?

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.280
And where'd it go?
