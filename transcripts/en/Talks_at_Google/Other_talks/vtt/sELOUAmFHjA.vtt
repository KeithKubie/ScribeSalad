00:00:01.767 --> 00:00:02.350
PRESENTER: OK.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:02.850
Good.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.680
I'm going to be very short.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.690
I know you're here
to see Jakob, not me.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.750
But just a couple of
words of introduction.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.282
First, it's my pleasure to
welcome Jakob to Google.

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:13.490
It's not his first time here.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.700
He actually was on the
Google initial advisory board

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.690
years and years
ago, and was one of

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.670
the original early
consultants at Google.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.820
So he's actually returning.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.720
Jakob is, I think, arguably
the world's foremost expert

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.860
on usability right now.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.250
He wrote a book last fall
called "Mobile Usability"

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.575
on mobile usability, and I think
there's some copies in the back

00:00:38.575 --> 00:00:40.450
that-- if you are
interested-- some are free,

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.710
and you can buy them
as well, if you'd like.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.470
Jakob has a Ph.D. from the
Technical Institute of Denmark.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.580
He's worked at
Bellcore, Sun, IBM,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.750
and now is in his own company
with Don Norman-- Nielsen

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.380
Norman Group.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.380
One interesting
thing that I found

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.040
when I joined Google a few years
ago was-- we were over in 42--

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.280
and the design group was
centralized at that point.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.850
And there was a picture
of Jakob on the wall,

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.770
kind of in an angelic pose.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.892
And underneath
it, it said, WWJD.

00:01:13.892 --> 00:01:15.335
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:15.335 --> 00:01:17.710
PRESENTER: And under that, in
case you didn't understand,

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.560
what it said was,
What would Jakob do?

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.960
So it's kind of a little
bit of an irreverent play

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.790
on Jakob's influence at Google
and the field of usability.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.424
So please help me welcome
Jakob to the stage.

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:35.999
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:37.290
JAKOB NIELSON: Thank you, John.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.450
Thank you, everybody.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.710
Yes, I won't really talk
about mobile usability now,

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.010
because I'm sure all you
are working on that anyway.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.710
I'll talk more about the
past and the future, really--

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.050
kind of a combined little
set of things there.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.650
Some of the themes
I want to cover

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.830
are that we have a lot of things
we know about usability that

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.970
is very stable in this
otherwise fast-changing field.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.370
I want to touch a
bit on the question

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.199
of the specific
technology and platforms--

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.550
whether it matters or
not-- and kind of both

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.860
are the answer here.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.410
And then I want to
end with talking

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.354
about how we get usability
more widely applied.

00:02:17.354 --> 00:02:19.270
Before I do that, I was
just going to show you

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.634
a little video clip
of one of-- you

00:02:21.634 --> 00:02:23.050
know, we do a lot
of user testing,

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.820
as you do as well--
Is to show you

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.780
a video clip of
one of the studies.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.790
And this is a study--
was done, actually,

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.410
in London, as it turns out.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.500
But we did it in a
hotel, because we

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.500
didn't have a lab there.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.284
So as you may know,
in hotels, when

00:02:37.284 --> 00:02:38.700
you want to get
onto the internet,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.560
they first show their
own hotel screen,

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.630
and then you kind of
click through that,

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.570
and then you get online.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.050
Right?

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.633
And for everybody
in this room, that's

00:02:44.633 --> 00:02:47.200
not anything you consider
to be a usability problem

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.810
But we had this
user-- and I'm going

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.643
to show you what happened
when he was trying

00:02:50.643 --> 00:02:55.110
to get onto the-- so he's
just trying to get online,

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.920
basically-- that's the problem.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.980
So all of your work
is for nothing,

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.620
because you can't get to Google.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.320
And the reason I'm showing
you this is that it really-- I

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.030
think this showcases,
in many ways,

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.870
the design challenge we're
facing-- that we have

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.190
a lot of users whose
mental model of computers

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.430
and the internet is like there's
no distinction between what's

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.180
a browser, or what's a web
site, what's an operating

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.060
system, what's this
and that and the other.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.670
For all the people
in this room, we

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.300
have those very
clear distinctions.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.580
And that helps us then
understand all the fancy stuff.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.320
But this guy couldn't even
get onto the internet, really.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.560
He couldn't get to Google.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.280
He didn't distinguish
between what's

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.780
a browser, what's a
Google, what's a website.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.810
Our moderator who was
running this study

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.640
was kind of violating,
a little bit, some

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.477
of the rules for
doing user testing,

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:48.810
because he was helping him here.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.730
But the reason for that was
that we were not interested here

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.765
in studying how he gets online.

00:03:53.765 --> 00:03:56.390
We're interested in studying how
he would use various websites.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.702
We had to get him to
those websites, which

00:03:58.702 --> 00:04:00.160
is why you should
try to help them.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.300
Well, maybe if you use another
browser, it'll be easier.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.730
No, that was not the
problem, actually.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.805
So I think we have still a
lot of things in usability.

00:04:10.805 --> 00:04:12.180
And that's just
going to-- again,

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.030
for a little bit of history--
show some of the cases

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.810
where I have taken
big companies to task.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.200
Because, of course, small
companies make design mistakes

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.230
as well, but the big ones
are the ones that are worth

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.550
talking about.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.190
Flash-- 99% bad.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.160
I mean, that was just
really-- at that time--

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.860
a great assault on usability.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.720
WAP was the early way
of doing mobile devices.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.280
And I think WAP
is a great example

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.637
of that the technology
actually does matter.

00:04:44.637 --> 00:04:46.470
Because it's not just
that it was mobile way

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.710
of getting onto the internet.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.427
It was such a bad way of
getting on to the internet

00:04:50.427 --> 00:04:51.760
that it was said it didn't work.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.720
We did a big study
of this in 2000.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.330
And usually in my company,
when we do a study,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.880
we publish a big report with
guidelines and how we recommend

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.032
you should do design.

00:05:02.032 --> 00:05:03.740
But in that case,
there was only, really,

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.620
one guideline, which
was, don't do it.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.310
Because WAP was so bad.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.170
Right?

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.430
PDF online.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.637
So the one I had here,
the search engines.

00:05:12.637 --> 00:05:14.970
This is actually not a complaint
about Google being bad.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.430
It's a complaint about
Google being too good.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.610
The others, I complained
about the bad design.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.568
This is actually a
complaint about good design,

00:05:21.568 --> 00:05:24.090
because I think Google has
been so good that it has kind

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.710
of almost taken over
the internet more

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.920
than I would like to see.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.120
But I can't really ask
you to do worse work.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.810
So I don't really
know how to handle

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.351
that problem, other than, ask
other people to do better work,

00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:35.000
I guess.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.670
Amazon's Kindle-- that's
another good example

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.420
that the details really matter.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.970
Because their first
attempt at doing

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.200
a tablet was really terrible.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.200
And we did user testing
on this, and just

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.660
with a handful of people.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.540
And it's a great example of why
you can do it with few people,

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.630
and you will really learn.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.395
Because we had-- just
with those few people,

00:05:58.395 --> 00:06:01.090
it was clear that it was
insufferable to get anything

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.570
done on-- I would say-- on
the 2011 model of the tablet.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.000
Now, last year's model
is already much better.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.800
Another example of that, by
the way, was the WAP study.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:20.020
Because I believe we had about
10 users or so in that study.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.820
And after we
published the findings

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.770
to the telecoms industry--
the entire telephony industry

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.000
was just a huge industry,
particularly back then.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.160
Kind of rejected our findings.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.410
Said, well, you only tested
it with so few people,

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.640
and they only had their
phones for a week.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.140
And it's kind of like,
well, if after a week

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.420
you still can't figure out
how to get tonight's weather

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.405
forecast, and we asked people,
would you like to use it,

00:06:43.405 --> 00:06:47.088
and they say no,
it's kind of like--

00:06:47.088 --> 00:06:47.889
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:49.680
JAKOB NIELSON: This is
not a small finding,

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.420
in which case, for sure, if it
had been a little issue, then

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.086
it wouldn't have been
a big enough study

00:06:54.086 --> 00:06:56.060
to determine the
big and small issue.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.100
But for a big issue, for sure.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.856
The latest example is Windows 8.

00:07:01.856 --> 00:07:03.230
And what I wrote
about Windows 8,

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.360
it should be called
Microsoft Window--

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.169
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:07.460
JAKOB NIELSON: In the singular.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.680
Because they abandoned
multi-windowing,

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.930
which is their
trademark, really.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.400
And that's another example
where it's-- reportedly,

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.600
they're now going to
kind of scale back,

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.620
and do it either right--
or at least better--

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.940
the second time around.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.370
But for a lot of
these cases, a lot

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.020
of these kind of
really big failures

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.300
were things that
could have been found

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.720
with relatively small studies.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.540
I mean, our studies
are not big studies.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.520
We don't have the budget of
Microsoft Usability department,

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.590
or Amazon Design Group, or
anything of that nature.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.210
And we find, with
very small studies,

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.670
that these are failed products.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.370
So I do think that
these big companies need

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.920
to get better-- except maybe
Google needs to get worse.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.130
I don't know.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.230
But because I have been
doing these things,

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.360
it's been somewhat
controversial over the years.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.460
And so I do see things like this
from time to time getting out

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.209
there.

00:08:01.209 --> 00:08:02.500
This one I kind of like better.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.370
This is when I did this
talk with Don Norman.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.860
And it's like-- feel like
the rebel alliance, you know,

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:12.000
trying to make things
better for the people.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.790
But one of the big
things that people

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.200
say against all of this work
that I'm talking about here

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.020
is that, when we
have our usability

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.490
findings and these guidelines
and recommendations,

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.120
it constrains their
creative freedom.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.990
So is it true that designers
are sort of suffering

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.380
under these nasty
usability people?

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.419
And I would say no.

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:38.520
And I'll give you a few
different arguments for that.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.440
And so my first one,
I'll take an analogy

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.760
from the field of music.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.200
And I'll do this little
participatory exercise here.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.340
So I'm going to play for
you two pieces of music.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.320
So this one piece of
music, but performed twice.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.410
And it's by two
different opera singers.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:56.970
So they're both going to
sing the same little piece

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:00.110
of an opera, and your
job is to identify

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.440
which of these two opera singers
is Luciano Pavarotti-- you

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.500
know, this rather fat, very
famous opera singer, Pavarotti.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.240
So which of these two people--
the first or the second--

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.974
they'll sing same
thing-- who is Pavarotti?

00:09:13.974 --> 00:09:49.990
[OPERA SINGING]

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.750
JAKOB NIELSON: OK.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.524
Exact same thing, second singer.

00:09:53.524 --> 00:10:32.710
[OPERA SINGING]

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:33.460
JAKOB NIELSON: OK.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.100
So who thinks that
number one was Pavarotti?

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.970
We have 5% of the audience.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.000
Who thinks number
two was Pavarotti?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.655
And we have 80% of the audience.

00:10:41.655 --> 00:10:44.030
And the last 15%
have no opinion.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.750
OK, so the majority
was right, which

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.280
means that you guys
are all big opera fans.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.300
Well done.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.167
But it's clear--
in this example,

00:10:53.167 --> 00:10:54.750
it's clear there
there's a difference.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.500
And the first guy was
a great singer, too.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.040
But there's still a difference
between the singers.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.740
And this is a very
constrained design problem,

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.530
to create this
operatic performance,

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.320
because every single
note they're singing

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.114
was written more
than 100 years ago.

00:11:08.114 --> 00:11:10.530
Every word they're singing was
written more than 100 years

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:11.029
ago.

00:11:11.029 --> 00:11:13.110
And yet, there's
plenty of creativity

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.244
left in the performance.

00:11:14.244 --> 00:11:16.410
And design is not nearly
that constrained, you know.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.240
And what we're doing
in usability is,

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.970
we're documenting the
facts of the world, which

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.920
is how things really work.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.029
And so as an example--
another example--

00:11:28.029 --> 00:11:29.320
let's see if I have a pen here.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.160
I have a pen.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.180
So here I have a pen.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.047
And since I'm actually
giving a lecture now,

00:11:36.047 --> 00:11:37.130
I don't really need a pen.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:38.910
So therefore, I'm just
going to leave my pen here.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:39.680
You see the pen, right?

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.000
I'm going to leave it there.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.680
And maybe later I think,
maybe I do need my pen anyway.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.980
So I'll go, I'll get my pen.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.960
And do you remember
where to leave my pen?

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.970
I left it here.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:51.920
I'd swear it.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.660
So this is bad.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.649
I leave my pen here.

00:11:54.649 --> 00:11:55.815
This is where I want my pen.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.761
Now I'm very annoyed
with Sir Isaac Newton.

00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:03.010
Why did Newton come up with
this stupid law of gravity

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:06.150
that causes my pen to
not be where I want it?

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.350
Well, that's clearly
the wrong reaction.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.040
It's not Newton's fault that
things fall to the ground.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.220
It's not my fault
that people have

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.190
trouble using certain websites.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:19.470
It's because that's the
way human people are.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:24.260
And so, in my view,
usability constrains design

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.510
in one way, which
is that it reveals

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.080
the facts of the world, which
is the fact of the users.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.330
And users are very
different than you guys.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.860
Users are like the first
guy we saw in the video.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:36.860
And that's how it is.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.550
And they are like
that whether or not

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:39.710
we'd show the video clip.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.610
They are like that anyway.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.660
And you've got to design for
the way people actually are.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:49.120
And so that's really what I'm
trying to kind of get through

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.610
is those issues.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.570
And we have a lot of
things we have learned

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:55.180
over the years about usability.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:01.530
There's also things that
are not unchangeable facts.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.040
So let me show another
example to demonstrate that.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.880
So what am I doing now?

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:11.997
Anybody knows what
I'm doing now?

00:13:11.997 --> 00:13:14.680
AUDIENCE: Holding
a pine cone up.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.990
JAKOB NIELSON: You're
being very literal here.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.416
JAKOB NIELSON: I'm guarding
against evil spirits.

00:13:22.416 --> 00:13:24.165
If you've ever been
to the British Museum,

00:13:24.165 --> 00:13:25.164
you will have seen this.

00:13:25.164 --> 00:13:27.609
This is the gesture for
guarding against evil spirits.

00:13:27.609 --> 00:13:29.400
But you don't have to
go to British Museum,

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.000
you can also go to
Louvre in Paris,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.700
and you'll see there as well.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.720
There's in fact endless
of these monuments that

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.080
show this guarding
against evil spirits.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.855
When you hold up like this, it's
guarding against evil spirits.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:48.540
So it was universally
accepted-- at least in Syria

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.460
3,000 years ago.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.680
And today, I think
nobody knew, right?

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.100
So in that sense, that's
kind of like, well,

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.830
can we use this icon?

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:01.140
I mean-- well, if it's
universally known,

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.820
yes, I can use the pine cone
gesture to guard against--

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.560
to make you feel I'm guarding
you against evil spirits.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.120
On the other hand,
there's no inherent reason

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.720
why that should be so.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.690
That can easily
change over time.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.020
And a great example of
that in the web world

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.840
is whether blue
indicates click-ability.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.760
There's no real inherent reason
blue should mean click here.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.260
For a long time it
did, because that

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.380
was the way all websites worked.

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.080
And today, it's one of the ways.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.760
It's probably still-- marginally
speaking-- the best way.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:35.000
But there's not a big thing
there specifically in blue.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.760
On the other hand, a
lot of other things

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.410
are pretty long
lasting and universal.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:41.460
So for example, if
you have a big head,

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.750
you're probably important guy.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:43.355
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:43.355 --> 00:14:44.230
JAKOB NIELSON: Right?

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.990
And that's many
thousand years ago,

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.200
and we can still see
the same thing today.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:52.810
Or you want to give people
an idea of what's ahead,

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:56.140
which we sometimes call
information send up,

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.480
before people go there.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.720
So this is a photo from
the Las Vegas airport.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.300
It's very useful,
very good usability

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.360
to have things like that.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.490
And those are more universal.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:11.340
Or that complexity is inherently
more difficult to use.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.490
So I have both these
two kitchen timers,

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.580
but the one with the big numbers
that can read without glasses,

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.954
and it's easier to
set it-- and how often

00:15:18.954 --> 00:15:20.870
do you really need to
keep track of like three

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.860
different roasts
at the same time?

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.550
It's not nearly
as useful, right?

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:29.220
So I think a lot of these things
we have found over the years

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:33.930
really do still matter.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.630
Another example is
that a lot of people

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.620
have been kind of rejecting this
because of banner blindness,

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.320
but which I keep finding
it again and again.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.922
So to the right
are some examples

00:15:43.922 --> 00:15:45.130
of some eye tracking studies.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:48.600
And I put in these little boxes
indicating where the ads are,

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.245
and you see no fixations there.

00:15:51.245 --> 00:15:52.620
To the left, on
the other hand, I

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.670
have an example from one of
the first studies we did.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:57.630
Enough-- is it
annoying enough yet?

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.620
Had a little running car there.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.860
So in that study,
we asked people

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.400
to find out about delivery
information on this flowers

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.380
website.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.380
And nobody could find.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.310
And this thing-- this
blinking delivery truck--

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:14.340
was on the screen at all times,
and people couldn't find it.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.190
And it's because if it looks
like-- it was not an ad.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.390
It was, in fact, important
delivery information.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:23.410
But if it looks like an
ad, it'll be tuned out.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:25.640
And this is just
a learned behavior

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.420
that keeps being like that.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.320
I'll show you another example,
because it's really nice.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.540
We did a few years ago a
study on the Ask website.

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.587
How can you not notice that?

00:16:36.587 --> 00:16:37.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.510
JAKOB NIELSON: Big rat right in
the middle of the page, right?

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:41.800
But that's how it is.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.430
And I can spend another
five hours showing you

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.140
more video clips of
the same phenomenon.

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.800
But they really are true.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.800
And so what I want to
talk about-- so therefore,

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.886
that's why a lot of
the technology issues

00:16:53.886 --> 00:16:55.260
don't matter as
much as we think.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.750
I think there's a lot
of tendency in our field

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.360
to believe that because we
moved to a new platform,

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.510
all the rules are different.

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:05.670
Because we have, let's
say, faster bandwidth.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.230
Something that-- things changed.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:08.890
So some things do change.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.060
That's very true.

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.084
But a lot of them don't.

00:17:11.084 --> 00:17:13.250
And we are too enamored, I
believe, with technology,

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:16.050
as opposed to these kind of
really basic human factors

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.030
phenomena.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.380
So I'm going to show
you an example of that

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.940
from one of my own
very early work,

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.240
just to show you how I
make bad mistakes as well.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.930
So this is a study
I did in 1984.

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.292
And the problem is, if
you have more information

00:17:32.292 --> 00:17:33.750
than you can fit
in the screen, how

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:36.305
do you do what-- that's a very--
how do you deal with that?

00:17:36.305 --> 00:17:38.180
And so there are two
ways of dealing with it.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:42.930
So if I'm going to, let's say,
want to watch-- view line K,

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:43.810
right?

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:44.910
Is that up or down?

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:45.409
Right?

00:17:45.409 --> 00:17:49.620
So it could be I move
the information up.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.320
So that was, mental model is Up.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.830
It could also be that I
move my view port down,

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.460
and now K is visible.

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.300
So those are two
different ways of thinking

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.370
about the same problem.

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:07.020
So at the time--
in '84-- I'd been

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.960
to some usability conferences.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.840
And there was some
research done at IBM.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.400
And at IBM at the time, they
had these full screen text

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.280
only terminals--
the-- whatever they're

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.270
called-- 3270 terminals.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:21.910
And they had done
a study showing

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:26.757
that if people had the mental
model, in this case, Down, then

00:18:26.757 --> 00:18:28.840
they will perform a little
bit better than if they

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:29.840
had the mental model Up.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.300
So you just change what
you call the commands.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.133
I mean, the same thing
will actually happen,

00:18:33.133 --> 00:18:35.080
but if you change what
you call the commands,

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.610
people will be a little
bit faster if they think

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:41.189
of it being a Down command
to display the line K.

00:18:41.189 --> 00:18:42.980
And of course, they
test display the line A

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.830
as well, and all that.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.839
And I had seen these
early computers

00:18:46.839 --> 00:18:49.130
that had come out at the
time, like Macintosh and stuff

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.720
like that-- really early
revolutionary graphical user

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.120
interfaces-- and so I
went to the university.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.100
I was too poor to
actually buy a Macintosh.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.870
They were expensive at the time.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:00.680
So I didn't have one.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.140
But I had seen the demos.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.000
And in demos, it
was very clear to me

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.190
that you could see the graphical
user interface-- you could

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:09.980
really see the text move
up in a more smooth manner

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.440
then you could see in those
full screen terminals.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.460
So to me, it very much felt
like it was an Up command

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.710
to move the K up
to become visible,

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.370
because you could
see it move up.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:23.180
So we actually did get hold
of a graphical computer

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.820
at university, and we
implemented this thing,

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.450
and did the study.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:30.680
And I really expected that now I
would prove that graphical user

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.740
interfaces required the opposite
mental model of text-based user

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.839
interfaces, because clearly
in text it was Down.

00:19:36.839 --> 00:19:39.380
Text only screens were Down,
and in graphical user interfaces

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.370
it was Up.

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.580
Our study came out the
same as the IBM study.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.270
Down was a superior
mental model.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:47.130
I mean, not by a
lot, but by a little.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:50.320
And the reason was because the
difference between up and down

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.670
here was not the
difference between text

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:54.740
only versus graphical screen.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:59.750
The difference was between you
moving something and seeing

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:00.850
it being moved.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.529
When I just saw
the demo-- I didn't

00:20:02.529 --> 00:20:03.570
have the computer myself.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:07.200
And when I saw the demo,
the text was clearly moving.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.530
But when I was there, I was
clearly moving-- or the user

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:12.670
was there-- they were
clearly moving towards K.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:16.830
I mean, their thinking was, I
want to move down the document.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.600
And that became
the dominant factor

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.970
in which of these two ways
of thinking about the problem

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.510
are superior.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.600
And so I point this
out because I'm

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.360
kind of arguing against us being
too enamored of technology,

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.949
while admitting
in this example I

00:20:30.949 --> 00:20:32.240
was too enamored of technology.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.210
Because I thought
that the difference

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:38.140
in the type of display we were
using would make a difference.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.800
And in fact, it was a
different user's task

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.091
that was making the difference.

00:20:43.091 --> 00:20:44.840
And of course today,
we do have, actually,

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.470
an interesting
difference, because now we

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.470
have another way of
moving information, which

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:52.560
is with a gesture.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.670
And so when you're
moving the gesture,

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:58.310
then actually moving
to see K actually

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:00.430
does feel like an Up movement.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:03.000
That's because now I'm
actually moving the text.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.356
Before, I was
manipulating the window.

00:21:05.356 --> 00:21:06.980
So again, it's a
difference in the task

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.540
that makes the difference.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.760
And I think that's important
for us to keep remembering.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.690
Now, after this long argument
about how technology doesn't

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:18.310
matter, it actually does matter.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.400
Because even though I think the
big principles are definitely

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.050
the same, a lot of the smaller
details are very different.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.935
And the details matter so
immensely to usability.

00:21:27.935 --> 00:21:31.565
It's like people can have a
lot of really big picture ideas

00:21:31.565 --> 00:21:33.940
that they do really right,
and if people can't figure out

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.251
where to click, the entire
thing is for nothing.

00:21:36.251 --> 00:21:36.750
Right?

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:40.100
And we've seen a lot
of examples of this.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:44.200
One of the most recent ones
to come out was, I think,

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.860
Facebook's home
thing for Android,

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.650
which reportedly was a big
failure, because it didn't

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:55.140
design, really, for
Android's special features.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.280
But that is history
repeating itself,

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.890
because the exact same thing
has happened many times

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:04.170
over with, for example,
people porting software

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.700
from Windows to the
Mac-- just like earlier

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.750
versions of Microsoft Word and
things like that, that were not

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:12.740
really native to
that environment.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.862
Or when Windows was young,
people porting things from DOS

00:22:16.862 --> 00:22:19.070
to Windows, and it wasn't
a graphical user interface.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:22.100
So it's really just
another example

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.660
of the same point,
which is, have

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.520
a design for the
characteristics of the device.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.650
And as the devices--
particularly

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:32.535
the more primitive or simplistic
they are, the more important

00:22:32.535 --> 00:22:34.530
it becomes to really
fit with them.

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:36.950
If you have a very
broad, general purpose,

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:40.095
like powerful, it's
maybe a little bit less

00:22:40.095 --> 00:22:42.390
so important to
exactly fit it right.

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.650
So if you have a really
big, huge computer screen,

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:48.080
and a very powerful
computer, you

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.170
can suffer a little bit more
that it's not 100% right.

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:54.080
And if you have a
small phone, it's

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.624
more important that
it's exactly right.

00:22:56.624 --> 00:22:58.290
And so there's a lot
of discussion today

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:00.200
about things like
responsive designs

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.730
and so forth-- about how you
can makes things adapt and fit

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:06.920
to the different environments,
different screen sizes,

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.150
and so forth.

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.440
And on the one hand,
it's very appealing,

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:15.400
because you obviously want to
design once and run everywhere.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:19.060
But I remember once
we had this slogan,

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:20.720
code once and run everywhere.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.030
And it really was like, code
once and run everywhere,

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:25.400
but test everywhere as well.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.400
Because it still broke
in half the cases.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.550
And that's the same here.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:30.990
If you're trying
to make a design,

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:34.110
it's like reform flows
itself, and you're

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:36.110
using it under
different circumstances,

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.810
then you do need some different
prioritization of features.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:40.560
Maybe certain things
should not be visible

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.480
initially, and so forth.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.620
So I'm going to show you
another example of this--

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.680
of how the details matter.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.970
And this goes back to
this WAP study from 2000.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:51.172
So again, looking at it.

00:23:51.172 --> 00:23:53.380
So this was considered to
be an advanced mobile phone

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.930
at the time.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:58.520
And you can see here that if
we wanted to see the news,

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.120
first we get a News screen up.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.550
Then the upper left and upper
right is, we get a News menu.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.730
Then we select News.

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:11.634
Lower left is the menu
of news headlines.

00:24:11.634 --> 00:24:13.050
We select one of
these headlines--

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:15.390
let's say "Railtrack
says Hatfield line not

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:16.120
in good state."

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.310
So then we get an
article, lower right.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.700
What exactly happened is
that over four screens

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.990
we've gotten two
lines of actual news,

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.070
because they keep repeating
the same things over

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:30.570
and over again.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.520
So for example, when we go
from lower left to lower right,

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.390
they repeat that headline
that we just clicked on.

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:40.370
Now, in traditional
design guidelines

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:41.955
for things like
websites and so forth,

00:24:41.955 --> 00:24:44.270
for hypertext
navigation, all that,

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:46.920
the traditional guideline
is to actually confirm

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.340
the user's location.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:51.290
Give them some
navigational situations,

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:55.470
and confirm from what they just
did, they know where they are.

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:58.240
Also, things like "eXcite Latest
News"-- the top line-- as well,

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.485
is another example of
navigational feedback

00:25:01.485 --> 00:25:02.874
or confirmation.

00:25:02.874 --> 00:25:05.290
So in that sense, they are
following one of the guidelines

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:08.780
that in 2000 we would
have had for doing

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.510
a website for a
desktop computer.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:15.240
But for this small
display, those guidelines

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.232
should actually
not be followed--

00:25:17.232 --> 00:25:19.440
you should follow other
guidelines instead that says,

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.070
really maximize
amount of content

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.642
you're giving to people when
you have that small a screen.

00:25:24.642 --> 00:25:26.100
And interestingly
enough, it may be

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.700
that these type of findings
we had back from that study

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.850
are relevant again now
with design for watches,

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:35.910
because smaller screens
are getting popular again.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:37.760
But my main point,
anyway, is you really

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:42.580
have to optimize for the device,
the smaller device we get.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:45.710
So I want to talk now about
how to broaden this out

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:48.170
to more people and
more companies.

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:51.750
And of course, it's nice that
big companies like Google

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:56.390
has a great user research and
great designers and everything.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:58.210
But we need more
companies to do it.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:02.030
We need all 300 million websites
to do well in all of that.

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:04.450
So again, I want to reach
back through history

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:06.080
and give you an example here.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.870
So this is from 1628.

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.140
So if you go to Stockholm
in Sweden today,

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.240
you will see this ship
here-- the museum.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.570
It's an old warship.

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:17.540
And it was built in 1628.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.940
So at the time, Sweden
was at war with Poland,

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:23.650
and the King decided they had
to have a really big warship

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:25.640
to fight the Poles,
and so they built

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:30.544
this ship that was the biggest
warship they ever built.

00:26:30.544 --> 00:26:32.210
And when it had been
built, it was still

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:35.360
sitting at the harbor--
hadn't sailed yet.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.970
But the captain said, well,
before we launch this ship,

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:40.060
we should do a stability
test on the ship.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.100
So you've got all
these sailors on deck,

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.600
and you had them
run back and forth.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.420
So they run to the one side
of the deck, and all of them

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.900
run to the other
side of the deck.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.400
And they run back and forth.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.900
So as these guys
run back and forth,

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.970
the ship sort of starts
leaning more and more--

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:56.220
tilts and tilts and tilts.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.160
And so at this point of time
during the stability test,

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:03.810
the admiral of the Swedish
fleet comes down to the harbor

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:06.070
and sees what they're
doing, and he orders

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:08.073
the captain, stop
that test-- we're

00:27:08.073 --> 00:27:11.060
going to launch this ship now.

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:14.820
So they set sail, they launched
the ship, they sail out.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:18.470
And while they're in the middle
of the harbor, a gust of wind

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.250
comes and blows over the ship.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.010
It keels over, it sinks.

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.650
And it sank in the middle
of Stockholm harbor,

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:27.300
which is why they recovered
it hundreds of years later,

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.900
and it's a museum now.

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.820
But it never made
out of the harbor.

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:33.540
It was that unstable a ship.

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:37.180
And so this story actually
proved two things.

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.130
The first, of course,
is that Star Trek

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:42.060
was right-- captains are
smarter than admirals.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.336
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:44.336 --> 00:27:46.710
JAKOB NIELSON: But the second
thing-- more to our point--

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:51.480
is that, test before you
launch, or your ship will sink.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.080
And so it's just
proven hundreds of-- I

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.510
mean, every time, basically.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:58.670
You've got to do it
before you launch.

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:02.360
I saw a nice t-shirt by some
guys in Italy that says,

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.289
test it, or they will detest it.

00:28:05.289 --> 00:28:06.455
It sounds better in Italian.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.570
But that's the basic point.

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:13.270
So we want to do these
very early simple studies.

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:16.480
And here's an example
of a study that-- one

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:21.079
of my early studies of
some early intranet icons,

00:28:21.079 --> 00:28:22.620
through testing with
just four users.

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:26.320
And the first one was intended
to be a bulletin board

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.040
symbolizing what's new.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.950
And what the users said was--
bulletin board, bulletin board,

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:33.480
bulletin board, laundry.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.840
Now, when you have one
of four users telling you

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:40.440
that your icon is completely
mistaken, that's 25% percent.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.730
But it's not really a
statistically reliable number

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:43.280
there.

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.950
So what are you going
to do about that?

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:47.540
And so this is where the
expertise comes into play.

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.780
You interpret this
data, and you say,

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.120
well, it's probably not
going to actually impact,

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.640
when we have people
used to this,

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:58.300
that they're going to think it's
laundry, so we keep the icon.

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.680
But in further research,
we keep in mind

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.852
if it's going to
cause any issues.

00:29:02.852 --> 00:29:03.560
And it never did.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.990
So that was the
correct decision.

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:06.870
The next icon--
the middle icon--

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.509
was intended to
mean World Wide Web.

00:29:08.509 --> 00:29:10.050
This was so new at
the time, and it's

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:12.010
represented in the interface.

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:14.250
So what did people say?

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:16.870
Networking on a world
scale-- that's close enough,

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:20.710
Map/location/global, the
dimensions of the planet--

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:23.440
really completely off
the wall, and networking

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.760
around the world,
also pretty close.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:29.529
Well, so here again we have just
a few people getting it wrong.

00:29:29.529 --> 00:29:31.320
It's really the same
as for the first icon,

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.278
statistically speaking.

00:29:32.278 --> 00:29:35.259
But here my decision
was, there's

00:29:35.259 --> 00:29:36.550
something wrong with this icon.

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:38.180
And the reason is,
I can refer back

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.179
to some usability principles,
which in this case

00:29:40.179 --> 00:29:42.460
is a mismatch in dimensionality.

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.790
The globe is a
three-dimensional object,

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:48.770
and the network map is
a two-dimensional map,

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:49.760
and that's a mismatch.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.801
And that's what causes
people to not understand--

00:29:51.801 --> 00:29:53.720
the two things don't
feel connected.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:57.990
So we replaced the 3D
globe with a flat map--

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:01.230
as you can see, the final
icon-- and that worked well.

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:04.260
So this is kind of why, if
you're going to do these kind

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:06.380
of very small end tests,
you cannot really realign

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:06.705
on a statistic.

00:30:06.705 --> 00:30:08.380
You have to rely
on interpretations.

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.320
So why is it OK to rely
on interpretations?

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.799
Because we do know
things about usability.

00:30:13.799 --> 00:30:16.090
This doesn't mean that these
interpretations are always

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:17.650
100% accurate.

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:20.530
But it does mean that they
are likely to be correct.

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:23.730
And it's going to be
easier to make a decision

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:27.010
and proceed on your project,
while keeping in mind--

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:30.240
like with this first icon--
that just maybe you're wrong,

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.280
and you may have to
revisit your position.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.390
Because remember that no
decision is also a decision.

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:38.530
And if you don't
act on the data,

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:40.070
then you are much
more likely to be

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:42.940
wrong than if you let
yourself be guided

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:47.082
by just a little bit of data.

00:30:47.082 --> 00:30:49.040
So the probability of
making the right decision

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.665
actually goes up
dramatically with even

00:30:50.665 --> 00:30:54.070
a tiny, tiny amount of data.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:58.250
So what we want to do is to want
to expand the use of these user

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:00.640
research usability
methods around the world.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.030
And I have the little--
cited complex chart

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:05.810
here to indicate this.

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:07.680
There are two ways,
really, how you

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.980
can do better in
terms of usability.

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:14.630
And on the x-axis is better
methodologies-- so doing

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:17.400
what I and many other
people recommend.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.880
And on the y-axis, we have you
could have better management

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.410
support.

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.945
You could have it more
institutionalized, more

00:31:23.945 --> 00:31:25.900
a part of the official
way the company is run.

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.600
So there's two kind of-- there's
a pragmatic how you do it,

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.510
and then there's kind of on
how it's organizationally

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:32.810
Instituted and supported.

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:35.190
So there are two different
ways you can worry about.

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:37.990
And these bubbles
here indicate--

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:40.330
we did a survey among people
participating in an event

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:42.340
that we run called
Usability Week.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:48.690
So 244 people positioned
their company on these scales.

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:51.080
And in fact, there's quite
a lot of people from Google

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:51.955
who go to this event.

00:31:51.955 --> 00:31:53.501
So probably some
of them are you.

00:31:53.501 --> 00:31:54.750
But of course, it's anonymous.

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:56.458
So I can't say where
Google is in the map

00:31:56.458 --> 00:31:58.610
according to the
Googlers themselves.

00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:59.950
But you can think about that.

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:02.360
That's your little
take-home exercise.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.650
But what I want to point out is
that-- so the size of bubbles

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:08.100
indicates how many people
positioned their company

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.510
at that spot in the diagram.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:12.400
And what we really
want to point out

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.620
is how the vast majority of
companies are in the red zone.

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:20.280
So they don't do really quite
the recommended methodologies,

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.860
and don't have that much
management support for it

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:23.800
either.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.920
And this is, of course,
a biased sample,

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:29.110
because these are people who
come to usability conference.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:31.180
So if we think about all
companies in the world,

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.520
they would probably
be much worse off.

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:37.140
But this is why we are still
in the early stages of really

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.431
making design driven
by user needs.

00:32:39.431 --> 00:32:41.430
So there are some companies
up in the green area

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:43.910
that do most-- or
maybe even everything,

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:48.262
for a very few up at the number
eight-- do everything right.

00:32:48.262 --> 00:32:50.470
But another thing that's
interesting about this chart

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:53.300
is, we don't have so many people
out in the other corners--

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.850
the upper left and
lower right corner.

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:58.450
We have a pretty high
correlation between these two

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:00.670
dimensions of two
different things you

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:05.130
can do, so that every day,
as I'm doing methodology

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:07.730
work and the management
support, and how much

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:10.720
it's part of the company
culture and institutionalized,

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:14.190
these two things tend
to go quite together.

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:15.700
And that's interesting,
because they

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:20.120
are two different strategies
for how to get better design.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.390
And different people have
different opinions about it.

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:24.098
So actually, in the
Nielsen Norman Group,

00:33:24.098 --> 00:33:28.630
I have been the one advocating
the methodology approach.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:29.680
Let's do it.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.389
And my colleague Don Norman
has been advocating more

00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:34.680
the management support role--
let's convince management

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.684
to do better.

00:33:35.684 --> 00:33:37.850
And the truth is, really,
that both of us are right.

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:39.420
In this instance you need both.

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:42.040
Because these things
tend to be quite-- as

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.430
you can see from the
data-- quite correlated

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:45.680
among companies.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.050
But if you think
about this point

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:50.220
that almost everybody--
even among the biased sample

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.400
of companies that do care
enough about usability

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.770
to send people to usability
conference-- even there,

00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:58.270
most companies are
in the red zone.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:00.090
So we're still in
the early stages

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:04.590
of really getting technology
to work for people.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:06.370
I mean, even just
before we did this talk,

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:09.520
I had trouble getting
the projector set up.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.939
And thanks to the good A-V
staff here, we've made it work.

00:34:11.939 --> 00:34:13.730
But it's amazing that
still-- to this day--

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:19.040
we have to struggle of just
projecting a simple slide show.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.810
And that's because
technology companies still

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:26.110
care too much about, let's
put on some new feature,

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:28.449
as opposed to make
the old feature work.

00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:34.420
I think we need more attention
just to that simple quality

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.151
assurance, really.

00:34:36.151 --> 00:34:36.650
OK.

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:42.170
So to conclude here, some of the
big challenges for usability.

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:45.560
I think we need to have much
more focus on productivity

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.409
growth for knowledge workers.

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:49.360
And so much of
what we hear today

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:53.092
is more about the fun or
playful side of computers, which

00:34:53.092 --> 00:34:54.550
is also very
important, admittedly.

00:34:54.550 --> 00:35:00.990
But we do live in a
knowledge economy.

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:04.340
And supporting, essentially,
our type of work,

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:06.560
but many other types
of work as well.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.440
Collaborative
work, all this kind

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.470
of more information
processing work.

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:12.780
We don't really have, I
think, a good enough grasp.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.610
And that is one
of the big reasons

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:18.036
that growth in the economy
is really slowing down

00:35:18.036 --> 00:35:19.410
in all the advanced
countries is,

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:22.560
we know how to make agriculture
more productive for sure.

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:26.430
We know how to make industrial
manufacturing more productive.

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:29.900
Those two segments of industry
are both doing extremely well

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.430
at being more and more
productive every year.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:35.320
But our share of the economy,
which is much the biggest

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:39.630
these days, we don't know how
to make us much more productive.

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:42.170
And one of the
reasons we don't know

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:44.510
is that it's not
worked on very much.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:49.660
So a project we did recently
was about social networking

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:52.520
in the enterprise-- social
networking and intranets.

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.450
And we studied a lot
of different companies

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:56.550
who are doing these
type of things.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:58.740
And the common feedback
we asked about-- so

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:01.350
how do you make sure the
ROI-- the return on investment

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:04.250
of your investment in
adding these features

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:06.700
to your internal
computer system?

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:09.680
People said, well, it's
obvious we should have that.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.740
Just like email-- it's
obvious we should have it.

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.414
Well, obvious is
not good enough.

00:36:13.414 --> 00:36:14.830
Because it's
actually not obvious.

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:18.480
There's so many-- we have had
so many other examples of things

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.510
that sounded good
but were not good,

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:22.770
or were done in a
sub-optimal manner.

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:25.110
That I feel that
that's the same here.

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:28.422
That if we really found
better ways of measuring which

00:36:28.422 --> 00:36:30.630
type of computer interfaces
really make people, let's

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:33.660
say, better at problem
solving, more creative,

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:39.590
more able to get their work done
in a more high value fashion,

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:42.960
it would vastly
increase our growth

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.290
of the economy-- our
contribution to the economy.

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:49.020
That's just one of the
really biggest things.

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:52.190
Another one is the health risks
of information technology,

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:55.100
where I particularly want to
point out the problem of driver

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:58.300
distraction, which is a
huge killer of people.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:02.380
So it's possible that the real
answers with driver distraction

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:03.700
is the driver-less car.

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:05.910
So maybe you guys
are on to that.

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:07.530
But truthfully,
even if that works--

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:10.274
and it would be at least 10
years before everybody has one,

00:37:10.274 --> 00:37:10.940
that's for sure.

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:13.780
So let's just look at
the 10-year perspective.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:16.630
So over the next 10 years,
about two million people

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:20.860
will be killed by driver
distraction worldwide.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.620
So one more thing
about this is--

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:24.490
people who work on
Android here, you're

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:26.906
going to be responsible for
about one million people being

00:37:26.906 --> 00:37:29.862
killed over the next 10 years.

00:37:29.862 --> 00:37:31.320
I mean, not personally
responsible,

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.190
but I mean, because they
use it wrong, and so forth.

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:38.220
And so if we can work on
driver distraction, and really

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.590
try-- not even
solve the problem,

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:41.910
but just reduce the problem.

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:44.429
So if we could reduce driver
distraction to the point

00:37:44.429 --> 00:37:46.470
where we could cut these
deaths in half, that way

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:48.350
we could save a million
people from being

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:50.010
killed over the next 10 years.

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:53.180
It may be not as good as
curing cancer, but it's almost.

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:56.000
It's a really
major thing that we

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.830
could do if we could really
address this problem some more.

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:04.260
And there used to be this issue
about couch potatoes-- people

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:08.765
sitting and watching
television and getting sick.

00:38:08.765 --> 00:38:10.140
And now we're
probably just going

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:11.670
to have iPad potatoes instead.

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:15.910
So same type of problem again.

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:19.120
There's also other issues that
are maybe not as well known.

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:23.240
So the internet has
really been pushing

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:27.060
a much more shallow
approach to information--

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.480
as we know-- this kind of in,
out, and just kind of click

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.050
quickly on things, and all that.

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:33.280
Which is what information
forwarding theory predicts.

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:36.150
Because the easier
it is to move around,

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:38.337
the more people
will move around.

00:38:38.337 --> 00:38:39.920
And they will move
around information.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:44.520
So they don't sit and
immerse themselves deeply.

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:48.809
I just wrote a new book--
I can't help myself.

00:38:48.809 --> 00:38:50.350
But the truth is
that a lot of people

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:51.050
don't read books anymore.

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:52.040
They just look at--
[SNAP] like this--

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.470
a web page about the stuff.

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:56.030
And you don't really learn
as much from a web page

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:59.640
as you do from, let's
say, reading a book.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:03.350
So we need to do something
to overcome this problem,

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:07.230
and also look at what effect
does this have for, let's say,

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:09.350
the school system or
for children's learning.

00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:13.850
But just for our-- adult
people's-- our learning,

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:16.090
our ability to
understand new things.

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:19.400
It's a very shallow information
environment on the web,

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.270
unfortunately.

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:25.010
My final point is about
old users or seniors.

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:28.360
So as we all know.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.350
we have a problem with
the aging society,

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:33.610
in terms of things like Social
Security, because those pension

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:35.480
schemes were
introduced when there

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.260
was a lot of young
people available to pay

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:39.440
for each old person
to be retired.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.870
And nowadays, two things happen.

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:42.245
First of all,
people live longer,

00:39:42.245 --> 00:39:43.780
which is, generally
speaking, good.

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:45.900
And secondly, lower
birth rate means

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.140
we have fewer younger people.

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:49.190
So now there's
fewer young people

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:51.440
to pay for each old
person to be retired.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.450
So Social Security is
going bankrupt soon.

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:55.650
We all know that.

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:57.190
But that's only one thing.

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:59.339
There's also the
problem of-- going back

00:39:59.339 --> 00:40:00.880
to the issue of
productivity, we know

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:04.470
that productivity is
declining as people age,

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:08.860
in terms of some of the more raw
measures of things you can do,

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:11.780
like how fast you can get
various different things done.

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:14.490
And so the hope is that,
in return for that,

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:17.010
old people are hopefully more
knowledgeable, and so forth.

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:18.190
That goes to my first point.

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:21.600
We don't really know yet how
to really do well on that.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.120
But in any case, we
are an aging society.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.670
We are going to have more
and more old people around.

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:29.390
And so we need to
really focus also

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:32.490
on supporting old people
in use of computers.

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:35.070
And that's another thing
that's being quite ignored,

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:37.770
and most companies are much
more interested in chasing

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:41.926
after teenagers than
chasing after grannies.

00:40:41.926 --> 00:40:43.550
I'm going to show
you-- this is a study

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:44.924
that we just
announced, actually,

00:40:44.924 --> 00:40:47.492
today-- so this is
news, the data we did.

00:40:47.492 --> 00:40:49.940
We did a little study
where we compared seniors

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:52.880
versus middle aged
people, I guess,

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.670
using a variety of websites.

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:57.610
And you can see here--
the usability matrix here.

00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:00.050
Basically, seniors have
lower success rate.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:02.020
They're slower--
they're 43% slower

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.480
at doing the same things.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.330
They make more errors.

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:06.900
And not surprisingly
they, therefore,

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:10.500
don't like these
websites as much.

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:13.220
So we put all that
together, right?

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:16.260
And we can see that we really
have a significant problem

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:19.494
if we want to empower
this group of users,

00:41:19.494 --> 00:41:20.660
and empower in so many ways.

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.600
It could be to stay in
the workforce longer

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:26.166
to solve some of our
problems in the economy.

00:41:26.166 --> 00:41:28.040
Or it could be more on
a personal fulfillment

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.350
based thing.

00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:30.960
I mean, people
are living longer,

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:33.140
so they should stay
active longer as well.

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:36.440
So all these different ways
we need to really work harder

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:40.530
on making websites
and other technology

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:41.530
more usable for seniors.

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:45.320
I'm going to end with just
a one video clip of one

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.150
of the people in
our seniors study.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:48.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:52.290
JAKOB NIELSON: So yeah-- that's
how real people are, right?

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:54.770
And so I show this video
clip for two reasons.

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:57.130
One is, I think his
last reaction is,

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:59.940
that's the business rationale
for doing usability, right?

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:03.750
Because delete if they
can't use your site.

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:07.120
But the other was maybe the
more human and humane issue.

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.060
That we really do
need to support

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:10.380
a broader set of people.

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:15.460
And if we do that-- we all
talk about this great future

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:18.360
of computers and how
great technology can be.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.260
But it only really
will be great if we

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:22.210
can support all
of these peoples.

00:42:22.210 --> 00:42:23.245
And we can.

00:42:23.245 --> 00:42:24.370
We just have to work on it.

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:26.154
So thank you very much.

00:42:26.154 --> 00:42:32.445
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:32.445 --> 00:42:33.320
PRESENTER: All right.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.530
I think we have about 10
minutes for questions.

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:36.750
So we have a mic here.

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:39.170
And we also have a Dory that
you can post a question to.

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:43.712
And let's take one from the Dory
before we get somebody here.

00:42:43.712 --> 00:42:45.170
You've talked about
this first one.

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:47.920
How do you think about
designing across devices,

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:52.770
such as mobile, tablet, laptop,
glass, driver-less cars,

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:55.856
consistency versus
unique tailored features?

00:42:55.856 --> 00:42:57.480
JAKOB NIELSON: I
think it is a paradox.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.350
Because, as I said in my talk,
it's like on the one end,

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:01.860
technology does not matter,
and on the other hand, it does.

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.560
So I think you first
have to find out

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.340
what are the core
user needs, and try

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:08.960
to make those consistent
across the devices.

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:12.050
But then you have to,
on the other hand,

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:15.940
adapt to the circumstances
of the specific platform.

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:18.940
Because if you don't do that--
if it just kind of grates

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:22.410
on people as they are
using it on that platform--

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:24.400
they will just
not want to do it.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.400
On the other hand,
we already have

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.820
more of a trans-media
environment,

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.940
where people do move between
devices during the day.

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:36.670
And if they can't keep their
expectations constant--

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:38.670
so it's more like the
deeper expectations should

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:41.600
be kept constant, but the
more surface manifestations

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:45.105
should be adapted to the device.

00:43:45.105 --> 00:43:45.980
PRESENTER: All right.

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.434
Next one-- and if anybody
has a question here,

00:43:48.434 --> 00:43:49.350
we've got a mic there.

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:51.690
But have you run any
voice-related studies?

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:54.210
If so, what are the primary
insights that you've gained?

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:55.040
JAKOB NIELSON:
Well, I'd say this

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.930
is so long ago that I'm not
sure how much it translates.

00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:58.596
But I used to work
at the phone company,

00:43:58.596 --> 00:44:02.520
and we did some things
that were only voice.

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:04.970
But it really is so long ago
that I can't really-- I think

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:06.415
the main problem, I
think, with voice-- well,

00:44:06.415 --> 00:44:07.410
the other thing we've
done, of course,

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:09.576
is a lot of accessibility
studies with blind people,

00:44:09.576 --> 00:44:11.135
and that is voice only as well.

00:44:11.135 --> 00:44:12.930
And I think the
main thing I want

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:15.082
to say about that is,
the problem with voice

00:44:15.082 --> 00:44:16.290
is that it's one dimensional.

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:17.926
It kind of has low persistence.

00:44:17.926 --> 00:44:19.800
So as soon as the word
is uttered, it's gone.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:24.430
So memory load is a much
harder problem in anything

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:25.699
that's an audio interface.

00:44:25.699 --> 00:44:27.990
And so that's-- again, it
goes back to this thing about

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:29.670
you've got to design
for the device.

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:33.280
In this case, design to really
try to minimize memory load.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.144
But also, the word order
becomes more important.

00:44:36.144 --> 00:44:38.060
The thing that people
should remember the most

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.435
should be said last, which
is more important in voice

00:44:40.435 --> 00:44:42.810
than with it on the screen,
where they can kind of glance

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:45.339
over everything almost equally.

00:44:45.339 --> 00:44:46.380
PRESENTER: Let's go live.

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:49.640
AUDIENCE: So there's been a
movement, especially with touch

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:53.000
devices, away from
words and menus,

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.610
and more toward
sometimes features

00:44:55.610 --> 00:45:00.160
that need to be-- they're not
that obviously discoverable,

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:04.790
and you kind of discover them
by touching sort of randomly

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:07.215
and playing around.

00:45:07.215 --> 00:45:10.150
Do you have any advice on how
to teach people that are not

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:12.900
normally familiar with
touchscreen devices

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:15.650
how to discover these
types of features?

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:16.550
JAKOB NIELSON: Yeah.

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:18.216
First of all, I would
actually recommend

00:45:18.216 --> 00:45:21.770
against that, because I
think that discoverability

00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:23.450
is an inherent problem.

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:28.195
And I think it's better to
make things visually apparent,

00:45:28.195 --> 00:45:29.570
hoping people will
discover them.

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:34.370
Because most people don't
tend to explore so much.

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:35.660
Little children do that a lot.

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:37.250
They really like to
poke around everywhere.

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:38.624
So we found and
studied some kids

00:45:38.624 --> 00:45:42.567
that they actually prefer this
kind of mine sweeping thing--

00:45:42.567 --> 00:45:44.900
move my hand around and touch
things and see if it-- not

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.370
blows up, but if things happen.

00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:46.870
Right?

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:49.190
So that's a nice kind of
games-like environment.

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:51.150
But for grown-up
users, they tend

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:53.450
to be so focused on
the thing that they

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:56.710
know that they don't
explore other places.

00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:59.865
I mean, you can do things
like having little demo mode

00:45:59.865 --> 00:46:03.630
or reveal modes, and
some form of animations.

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:06.530
But I think that's also
almost like Band-Aid type

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:07.640
of solutions.

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:10.030
So I think anything
that's a core feature,

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:12.310
I really would encourage
to still emphasize

00:46:12.310 --> 00:46:13.190
discoverability.

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:16.500
Because the majority
of people don't like

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.975
to spend their time
playing with computers.

00:46:18.975 --> 00:46:19.475
See, we do.

00:46:19.475 --> 00:46:21.974
This is, again, about how we
are different than the majority

00:46:21.974 --> 00:46:22.580
of people.

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:25.590
So the majority of people don't
spend so much time exploring,

00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:28.760
and therefore, they often will
never explore these features.

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:30.980
And actually almost
worse, sometimes they

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:35.110
may discover them by mistake,
not knowing what they've done.

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:36.750
This is called
accidental activation,

00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:38.480
which is a big problem
in touchscreens--

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.474
that you touch
something by mistake.

00:46:40.474 --> 00:46:42.140
And if you didn't
know what you touched,

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:43.780
it kind of is almost
like it literally

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:44.980
is blowing up under you.

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:47.220
So that's another kind
of downside of that.

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:48.920
So yeah.

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.170
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:52.749
PRESENTER: Let's have another
question live, please.

00:46:52.749 --> 00:46:53.290
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:57.330
I'm wondering, how do you
think about change and change

00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:57.930
aversion?

00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:00.440
Like when people are
iterating on interfaces

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:03.050
or rolling out new
versions of a service?

00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:04.987
That's always a big
topic internally.

00:47:04.987 --> 00:47:05.820
JAKOB NIELSON: Yeah.

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:07.270
Oh, but I think
the first thing is

00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:09.390
to recognize that it is real.

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:11.630
And so if you roll
out something,

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:13.930
you get a lot of
nasty email, it's

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:15.240
not because you did a bad job.

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.570
It's because users
just don't like change.

00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:20.940
So that's the first And
just kind of steel yourself.

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:22.500
I wouldn't say ignore that.

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:24.380
But don't take it so seriously.

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.000
There's a lot of criticism just
when something new comes out.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.382
But that said, it is real.

00:47:28.382 --> 00:47:30.590
And therefore, you shouldn't
roll new things out just

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:31.172
to be new.

00:47:31.172 --> 00:47:33.380
And I think there's a lot
of problems with the people

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:36.630
who work on a design
project, to feel

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:38.530
that it needs a kind
of fresh approach.

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:40.910
Because you sit staring
at this screen all day,

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:41.960
whereas the users don't.

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:43.834
Or even if they do, they
don't care about it,

00:47:43.834 --> 00:47:45.600
so they don't absorb
as much about it.

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.790
So that would be my kind
of-- another recommendation

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:50.800
is to kind of be
conservative, and don't

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:53.610
change unless it really
is a major step up.

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:56.250
Because if it's a small step,
it's probably not worth it.

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:59.440
Because you are going to
aggravate a lot of people.

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.470
So those would be my main
recommendations there.

00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:05.810
But for sure, we want
to do new things, right?

00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:07.850
So you want to have
new design as well.

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:09.799
But only when it's big news.

00:48:09.799 --> 00:48:11.340
AUDIENCE: As a
researcher, how do you

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:13.510
distinguish when you're getting
feedback between something--

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:16.060
how can you tell if it is
change aversion, versus this

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.587
is actually a step backwards?

00:48:17.587 --> 00:48:18.920
JAKOB NIELSON: True, true, true.

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:20.380
I mean, you probably
can't, really,

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:22.630
other than you have to expect
that there's some change

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:23.130
aversion.

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:26.350
So therefore, if people
just say, I don't like it,

00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:29.640
then it's likely to be that
it's just because it's different

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:31.725
one to what they already know.

00:48:31.725 --> 00:48:36.114
On the other hand, if they have
difficulty using it, well, then

00:48:36.114 --> 00:48:38.030
you have to-- of course,
there's a possibility

00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:39.696
that it's just because
they're very used

00:48:39.696 --> 00:48:41.360
to doing things in one way.

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:44.220
And that's when you may have
to do a longitudinal study,

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:46.610
and you may have
to actually hire

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:49.140
people for a week or something,
that can just torture them

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:50.390
until they get over that.

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:52.770
And then, if you still
have the problem, well,

00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:53.700
then it really is bad.

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.408
On the other hand, if
after a day or two,

00:48:55.408 --> 00:48:57.130
people are all of a
sudden much better,

00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:59.340
then it's just a
temporary problem.

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:03.570
But still remember that the
temporary problem may become

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:06.800
an insurmountable hurdle,
because in real life,

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.920
you can't force people
to use it for two days

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.190
until they have gotten better.

00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:13.130
So often people just
give up on something.

00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:15.120
I mean, it depends on
what it is whether or not

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:16.910
people will stick through it.

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:20.530
But that's why you need to
learn these kind of assistance

00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:23.380
mechanisms that help people--
if you move something

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:25.730
around in an interface,
in the old place,

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:27.770
leave a little marker
behind for a long time

00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:30.370
to teach people where it moved.

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:31.130
Things like that.

00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:33.100
So you need to help
people overcome that

00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:34.119
as much as you can.

00:49:34.119 --> 00:49:34.910
Because it is real.

00:49:38.372 --> 00:49:40.330
AUDIENCE: I'm concerned
I'm kind of reiterating

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:43.000
the last question.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.190
I've noticed a bit of a
trend-- people back-porting

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:49.409
mobile interface
paradigms to the desktop,

00:49:49.409 --> 00:49:51.200
kind of like what Apple
did with scrolling.

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.330
JAKOB NIELSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:54.230
AUDIENCE: Do you think that's
a good move in the long term

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:56.360
for the sake of kind of
normalizing those things?

00:49:56.360 --> 00:50:00.570
Especially for-- my kids think
in terms of touch devices,

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:01.556
for example.

00:50:01.556 --> 00:50:03.430
Will that make more
sense to them inevitably?

00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:05.350
Is it worthwhile?

00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:07.372
Or is it just arbitrary?

00:50:07.372 --> 00:50:09.580
JAKOB NIELSON: Well, I mean,
first of all, part of it

00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:12.010
is arbitrary, like the example
I showed with the pine cone.

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:13.780
That's just a completely
arbitrary symbol.

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:15.710
But if that is a
symbol people know,

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:17.970
then take advantage of
that and then use it.

00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:19.600
And It could be the same here.

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:22.860
If people have a lot of
experience with, let's say,

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:24.820
mobile interaction
paradigms, then

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:27.870
that could be your first
gold mine-- the first thing

00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:30.610
that you go to mine or pick
from when you're coming up

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:31.932
with ideas for a new design.

00:50:31.932 --> 00:50:34.140
I mean, definitely leverage
what people already know.

00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:37.460
That said, one of the points
I made in my presentation

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:40.580
was that there are differences
between the devices.

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:43.370
And one of the big differences
is that on a desktop computer

00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:45.940
you have a much larger screen,
you have a more accurate

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:47.600
pointing device, and so forth.

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:50.000
So I don't actually
think that we really

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.580
should move to having only touch
interaction on the desktop,

00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:54.450
because I think we
can do much more.

00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:56.780
And also these
bigger gestures you

00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:58.910
have to do on a
really big screen also

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:00.710
are more tiring and
so forth as well.

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:04.920
So I don't think we
should make it the same.

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:06.480
But I think we
should try-- I mean,

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:07.650
consistency is always good.

00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:08.774
It's good for its own sake.

00:51:08.774 --> 00:51:11.540
This is why design is a little
bit more challenging than just

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:13.164
saying oh, [SNAP]
this is how we do it.

00:51:13.164 --> 00:51:15.845
Because you have kind of
contrasting trends there.

00:51:15.845 --> 00:51:16.720
PRESENTER: All right.

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.136
So let's go to two
more questions.

00:51:18.136 --> 00:51:20.944
And I'm going to ask mine first,
and then we'll end with yours.

00:51:20.944 --> 00:51:22.610
This question, I think
it's interesting,

00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:24.400
because it's from the book.

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.520
And I'm interested
in the relationship

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:30.020
between client apps on
mobile devices and web apps--

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:32.719
or interaction with
web-based products--

00:51:32.719 --> 00:51:34.510
and how you see that
playing out over time.

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:36.007
JAKOB NIELSON: Right.

00:51:36.007 --> 00:51:38.090
Well, I mean, over time
is a little bit different.

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:41.660
But I think what we know now
is that the native apps are

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:45.500
definitely superior, just
because of what I was saying,

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:47.410
that you optimize to the device.

00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:50.140
And the more impoverished the
device is, the more important

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.540
it is that you optimize
as much as possible.

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:55.770
And that's what the
native app will do.

00:51:55.770 --> 00:51:57.950
And that said, I think
that over time we

00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:01.160
will expect that the mobile
devices gets more powerful,

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:03.810
the mobile bandwidth gets
speedier, and so forth.

00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:07.416
And also the web tool kits and
whatever get better as well.

00:52:07.416 --> 00:52:09.790
And so I would actually expect
that this distinction will

00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:12.180
probably narrow
and not be as big.

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:13.870
And in five years
from now, it may well

00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:17.180
be that a well-designed
mobile website will

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:19.560
be just as good or
better than a native app.

00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:21.220
So it may not be
something that one

00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:23.410
would want to invest in
for the true long term.

00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:25.850
But I think for the short
term, I would recommend.

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:30.919
Well, if it's something
that's a big, important thing,

00:52:30.919 --> 00:52:32.460
I would recommend
doing a native app.

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:34.606
And if it's a small
scale thing that's

00:52:34.606 --> 00:52:36.730
going to have five users,
then just do the website.

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:40.296
But right now, I would say
the app is still better.

00:52:40.296 --> 00:52:41.670
PRESENTER: And
our last question.

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:43.050
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:45.810
Since you have the future
in the title of your speech,

00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:48.885
so I wonder what you
think about the future

00:52:48.885 --> 00:52:54.732
of the gesture-controlled input,
or something like Xbox Kinect?

00:52:54.732 --> 00:52:55.440
How do you think?

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.880
Do you think that's the
future of the interface?

00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:59.170
JAKOB NIELSON: That's a
great, great question.

00:52:59.170 --> 00:53:00.628
I just don't think
it's the future.

00:53:00.628 --> 00:53:05.000
I'd say I had futures-- in
plural-- in my title slide.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.490
Because I do think that it's
going to be more diversified.

00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:10.810
And I think as a
lot of environments

00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:15.700
were having-- well, having
your body be the input device,

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:18.950
having the world become the
computational environment.

00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:20.790
I think there's a lot
to be said for that.

00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:23.630
At the same time, I don't think
that's the only thing-- even

00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:27.810
the optimal thing-- for a lot
of the tasks we will want to do.

00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:30.205
So I think there's a
lot to be said still

00:53:30.205 --> 00:53:32.866
for having as big a
screen as possible.

00:53:32.866 --> 00:53:34.490
I don't know what's
the biggest screen.

00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:36.448
I have never yet seen
the truly biggest screen.

00:53:36.448 --> 00:53:39.685
But maybe certainly the size of
an old fashioned big newspaper

00:53:39.685 --> 00:53:42.210
is probably the biggest
screen we would want to have.

00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:45.070
But about that size, at
least 300 DPI resolution

00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:45.900
and so forth.

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:49.110
So a millions of
pixels type of screen.

00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:53.700
I think there's a lot of value
in that for a lot of the tasks

00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:54.560
people want to do.

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:57.440
So I think both types of
interfaces will be there.

00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:00.660
Gestures have several downsides.

00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:02.900
They are less precise, and
therefore, certainly, they

00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:05.300
have less of that
persistence-- whereas something

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:06.910
that's a visual interface.

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:10.180
And there's a reason why
all these icons and stuff

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.160
have lived for so long.

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:14.260
It's because they have a lot of
usability and inherent benefits

00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:17.530
by being steady on the
screen-- you can see them,

00:54:17.530 --> 00:54:20.310
you can remember them,
they tell you what to do,

00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:21.040
what to click on.

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:23.517
Whereas with a gesture, I
got to make up the gesture,

00:54:23.517 --> 00:54:25.350
I got to remember the
gesture, and so forth.

00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:27.580
So you probably have a
smaller vocabulary there.

00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:29.830
There are a fewer number of
fancy gestures you could--

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:31.560
I mean, we know even
now from tablets

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:33.752
that any advanced
gesture you will not

00:54:33.752 --> 00:54:35.710
see if you're going to
study with normal users,

00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:37.376
because they don't
do advanced gestures.

00:54:37.376 --> 00:54:41.805
They only do, like, tap and
slide and very simple things.

00:54:41.805 --> 00:54:42.680
PRESENTER: All right.

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:44.200
Thank you all for
joining us today,

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:48.140
and please join me in
thanking Jakob Nielson.
