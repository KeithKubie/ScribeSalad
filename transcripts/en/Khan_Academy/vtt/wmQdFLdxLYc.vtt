00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.580
Karina drained a bucket of water. Let W(t)
denote the amount of water W

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.940
(measured in milliliters) that remained
in the bucket after t seconds.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.620
Which equation best represents
the following statement?

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:20.800
Over the first 25 seconds,
the amount of water remaining

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.900
decreased by an average of four milliliters

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.240
each second.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.200
Let me rewrite this, let me paraphrase
this and then maybe

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.740
we'll be able to think about the math a little bit.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.820
They're saying that the average

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.400
rate of change

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.940
of the amount of remaining water, so I could say the average rate of change of W, with respect to time,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.820
over first 25 seconds

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.360
is equal to

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.940
a decrease.  The water decreased

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.480
by four milliliters each second. So if we're decreasing,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.140
if our rate of change, if W is going down, our rate of change is going to be negative.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.640
Every second that goes by, W is going to go down by some amount, so it's going to be

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.700
negative 4 milliliters,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.280
I'll just write that as mL,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.420
negative 4 milliliters per second.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.060
Now can we write this in a more "mathy" way?

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.460
"The average rate of change of W
over the first twenty five seconds?"

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.360
The rate of change of W is going to be
our change in W over our change in time.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.360
It's our change in W over the first 25 seconds, divided by the change of time over the first 25 seconds

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.740
which is just 25 seconds.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.640
Our change in W is going to be our

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.520
finishing amount remaining in the bucket,

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.780
so W(25).

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.460
That's how much we have at the end of this interval that we care about, how much water is remaining,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.640
minus how much water we started off with,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.800
divided by how much time goes by.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.480
And we could say "Hey,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.340
you know, we finished it at the 25th second, we started at the 0th second,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.400
or 25 minus 0 is just going to be 25."

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.260
This expression I just wrote is the average rate of change of W over the first 25 seconds.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.480
Notice the way I wrote it.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.620
When I write it like this it might be a little bit clearer.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.560
This is our ending W minus our initial W,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.520
and this is our ending time minus our initial time.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.800
This last part just simplifies to 25.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.300
And they tell us that this is going to be
negative 4 milliliters per second.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.940
This is going to be equal to negative 4.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.720
And the units up here in the numerator,
this would be in milliliters,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.860
and down here would be in seconds.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.100
So it makes sense that this would end up
being in milliliters per second.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.280
But anyway, which of these choices have that?

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.280
I have one more choice down here.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.360
This one over here looks exactly like what I just wrote.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.500
Now, a tempting one might be this one up here

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.920
and the only difference between this one and this one

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.080
is that we have a positive 4 over here.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.360
But keep in mind what this would imply.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.600
If W(25) minus W(0),

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.500
in order for this to be positive (because we're dividing by a positive 25),

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.760
then this would have to be positive.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.700
In order for this to be positive, that would mean that we have more water remaining after 25 seconds

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.480
than we do after 0 seconds,
because in order for this to be positive

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.420
this one has to be larger,

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.020
which means that somehow the bucket
is filling up with water, not draining.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.820
But we know that the water is decreasing
by an average of 4 milliliters each second.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.820
So if we're decreasing, this value over here
needs to be equal to negative.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.980
You have to have a lower value after 25 seconds than you do initally.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.300
So that minus that needs to be a negative value.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.260
If you have a negative value up here, and you divide by a positive value,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.000
you should get a negative value.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.720
It also makes conceptual sense.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.900
The water is decreasing, the rate of change of water with respect to time

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.980
should be negative, because the amount of water is decreasing.
