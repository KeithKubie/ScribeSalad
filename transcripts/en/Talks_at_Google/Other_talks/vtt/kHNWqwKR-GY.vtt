[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.172 --> 00:00:10.380
MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.170
Thanks for coming.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.600
I'm here to introduce
Professor Robin Fleming, who

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.564
will be introducing
our speaker today,

00:00:17.564 --> 00:00:19.230
because she knows
what he does and knows

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.590
him much better than I do.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.673
So without any further ado.

00:00:28.824 --> 00:00:30.490
ROBIN FLEMING: So
it's really a pleasure

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.960
to be able to introduce
at Google Dominic

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.100
Powlesland, who's really
the leading pioneer

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.710
and advocate for all things
computing in archeology.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.420
And there are just a
few essential things

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.920
you need to know
about Dominic other

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.000
than the information
that's on this slide there.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.140
He's the director of
the Landscape Research

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.260
Center at York, and
from there, he's

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.060
presided over the largest
and most important

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.850
excavation in Europe.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.520
And he works on a scale
that really no one else does

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.880
at a site called West Heslerton.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.270
West Heslerton is an enormously
complex multi-period chunk

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.227
of landscape, and it's produced
over a million artifacts.

00:01:06.227 --> 00:01:07.810
And I know that's
one of those numbers

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.400
that Google doesn't count
that low, but in archeology

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.850
that's a very, very big number.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.330
In his 30 years of dealing
with West Heslerton,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.340
Dominic has pioneered a whole
gamut of digital methods

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.850
in archeology, which are now
absolutely standard practice,

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.130
including remote
sensing, the collection

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.989
integration and analysis of
geospatial data, 3D imaging,

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:30.280
as well as all sorts of
interesting things like the use

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.480
of isotopes and DNA.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.330
And the last important thing
to know about Dominic before he

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.240
comes up is that
he's been excavating

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.920
since he was 11 years old.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.050
And one doesn't get to hear
of an archeology prodigy

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.872
very often, and I think
he might be the only one.

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:49.176
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:50.562 --> 00:01:52.520
DOMINIC POWLESLAND: Thank
you very much indeed.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.220
I am a landscape
archaeologist, and I

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.360
will try as much as possible not
to get nerdy about my subject.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.690
But I've also been involved in
computing for a very long time.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.250
We started using computing in
the field in the very early

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.889
1980s, and have been
using handheld computers

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.050
for data collection since then.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.550
And amazing enough, I went to
a conference a couple of years

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.020
ago in Australia, and
apparently they've

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.280
invented this thing called
a mobile phone which

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.000
you can record on,
and it's really quick.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.020
I was never really
interested in quick.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.040
My interests are in
having consistent quality

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.220
data that allows us to
produce improved analysis.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.770
So most of what we
know about archeology

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.080
has been discovered as
a result of serendipity,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.880
chance discovery.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.390
In this particular case of
an Anglo Saxon cemetery,

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.510
this is a cemetery from the
fifth to the seventh century

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.740
with lots of bling in
it, all sorts of stuff.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.960
And it was discovered
by a man walking a dog.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.434
And he at school had done the
three Rs, archeology reading,

00:02:55.434 --> 00:02:57.350
archeology writing, and
archeology arithmetic,

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.350
because that's all you
learned in West Heslerton

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.340
School in 1952, because the
school teacher was passionately

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.780
interested in the past.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.360
And my interest is
really in trying

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.200
to understand the human
influence on landscape,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.070
the human response to changes in
landscape-- things like climate

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.220
change and what goes on
in the world around us.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.565
And it will be now more
some time in the 1980s, very

00:03:25.565 --> 00:03:28.730
early 90s I was interviewed
for a job in the Geography

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.690
Department in the university
in the north of England.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.610
And I said what I want to
do is I want to have this--

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.210
because I'd already written the
GIS that we still use-- I said

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.687
my GIS to be the
whole world, and I

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:42.520
want to be able to go
anywhere in the world,

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.060
and I want to be able to map
things like climate change

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.630
on the globe.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.910
I didn't get the
job, and some time

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.290
after that, some other
bastard keyholded it.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.870
And I'm very, very
grateful, because it

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.780
is the most transforming
piece of software.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.700
I do not know a
person who hasn't

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.010
looked at their own
house in Google Earth.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.057
It allows us to do
things that we could not

00:04:06.057 --> 00:04:06.890
do in any other way.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.889
Well, we can do them other
ways, but actually it

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.040
makes things easier.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.430
In terms of communicating
with the world beyond,

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.339
making things
easier is important.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:21.420
I'm interested in the computers
in the service of mankind.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.160
Many years ago in the mid
'80s, I made a BBC television

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.300
program, or we had a
series called "Computers

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.870
in the Service of Mankind."

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.460
And it was a great
pity that somebody

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.410
in the BBC at the final moment
changed the title of the series

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.040
to "So I Bought a
Computer" because it really

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.780
didn't have the same
ring, and it really

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.350
wasn't about what I believe in.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.825
I believe that we
use these tools.

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:46.370
They're like really
good pencils.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.210
And we use them to engage
people and encourage

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.050
people to become absorbed in
what we do intellectually.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.889
So most often, you'll
see things like this.

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.180
This is a dot distribution map.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.846
I [INAUDIBLE] show, that red dot
is the place I'm talking about.

00:05:00.846 --> 00:05:02.740
So it's in the
northeast of England.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.040
And dot distribution
maps are very popular,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.500
and I'm sure that
all of you that

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.300
are involved in things
like Google Earth

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.510
will be happy in
the appreciation

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.720
that the bit in between the
dots is not an empty place,

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.920
it just happens to be you
don't know anything about it.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.750
So when I first
went to this place--

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.930
these are all in kilometers, I
know that's new money for you.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.360
But that's probably about
10 or 11 miles across,

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.190
and nine or 10 high.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.000
And that was the known
archeology in this area.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.430
So these are
prehistoric earth works.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.510
They're part of a
major drove way system.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.890
How you got around the
countryside at about 3000

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.680
BC is you went along
the tops of hills,

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.320
because you'd already
got rid of all the trees.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.550
So you could not only
see the landscape,

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.000
but you could be seen in it.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.262
So if someone was feeling
unfriendly towards you,

00:05:51.262 --> 00:05:53.520
you would know it.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:01.490
So I started digging
in this place in 1978.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.730
It started as a
rescue excavation,

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.256
a gravel courier was destroying
that Anglo-Saxon cemetery.

00:06:07.256 --> 00:06:11.000
And what we found very
quickly was actually

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.500
there was archeology that was
buried beneath blown sand that

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.330
was unique in Britain.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.370
To have this barrow-- this is
a Bronze Age barrow from about

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.050
2,500 BC-- it's older than
that-- that's entirely

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.540
buried by blown sand and has not
seen the light in 3,000 years.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.050
So this is very unusual.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.846
Most of these monuments,
somebody who wanted something

00:06:32.846 --> 00:06:35.220
from the mantel piece would
have gone in the 19th century

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.890
and extracted the contents.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.620
And so this is very rare.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.860
So we have archeology
that's preserved in a way

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.150
that we don't generally find.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.390
So that makes it potentially
more intellectually engaging,

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.940
and might give us
more information.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.390
This is the best thing you
can do with your clothes on.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.040
Digging, quite
frankly, allows anybody

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.130
to be five years old in
terms of their engagement.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:01.155
And I still get a real buzz when
I pick something up and realize

00:07:01.155 --> 00:07:03.710
that somebody hasn't touched
this for 4,000 years,

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.340
this piece of flint, or bone
comb, or whatever it is.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.480
There's a real
contact there, and I

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.820
don't suppose I will ever
lose that love and things.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.584
I used to have short
shorts and short hair

00:07:15.584 --> 00:07:16.500
for a very short time.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.200
This is sometime in
the 1980s I think.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.970
And these were in a
very, very famous--

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.500
they're in sort of the bible
of archaeological techniques.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:30.510
And there I am with my handheld
computer shop, PC 1500.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.700
And why did I go into
all this computing stuff?

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.350
Well, because I am chaos.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.320
We used to use bits
of paper to record on.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.270
And once I realized I
was digging a trench that

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.020
was 110 meters wide
and 750 meters long--

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.720
which is quite a lot of
this troweling stuff--

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.620
and it was full of
archeology, I realized

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.310
that my abilities to manage
the pile of paper that

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:58.059
just kept rising was appalling.

00:07:58.059 --> 00:07:59.850
And I would go and get
out a piece of paper

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.270
because it was about something
I was interested in at the time.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.090
Phone would ring, they'd tell me
about this burial or something,

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.990
so I'd go find the
paperwork, and then

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:08.280
I'd put it down somewhere.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.280
And then somebody would
ring for something else.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.190
And before no time at all, I
had piles of paper everywhere,

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.940
and I couldn't find anything.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.190
And my father was
a civil engineer,

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.900
and he gave me a
Wang 2000 computer,

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.380
and I taught myself
to program on that.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.100
And we ran it in a sort of
a primitive way, really.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.570
We spent two years
designing a data structure

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.160
before we got a computer,
because I really

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.909
wanted to be able to ask
every question I would ever

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:35.919
think of this data.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:40.090
And it's quite critical,
so we have a site, an area,

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:43.289
the concept was a unit
of soil or a feature.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.010
This is not just archaeological.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.519
Any environmental science
could use this structure.

00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:49.310
And an object number
was a two-letter code.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.110
So you've got a three-digit
number, a two-letter code,

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.700
a five digit number,
a two-letter code.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.380
So 12 characters that
make you unique key

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:01.120
for every single thing
that we found since 1978.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:06.640
And about two years ago, in a
moment of severe frustration--

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.930
because I have so many
different rate arrays in my home

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.380
to make sure that
I've got backups

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.140
of the backups of the backups
if I ever lose anything--

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.510
I typed one of those
numbers into Google

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:21.132
and I immediately got my thing
back at the top of the page.

00:09:21.132 --> 00:09:23.352
And that is quite extraordinary.

00:09:23.352 --> 00:09:25.060
There is no other
archaeological database

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.280
in the world that's
heavily computerate

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.130
that would automatically give
you that return straight away.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.300
This is an object,
it's a 3D model.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.180
This is a Bronze Age beaker,
and the beaker people

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.016
are to do with the introduction
of bronze in Northern Europe.

00:09:42.016 --> 00:09:44.470
They're very significant
in that period in sort

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:48.360
of when agriculture
becomes properly settled,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.460
and they made these fancy pots.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.340
And we know from the pollen
that they contain alcohol.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.580
And it may be that
part of their power

00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:00.120
was because they could
control this wonder stuff.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.120
And by 3D modeling it
with very high precision,

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.110
I can get schools anywhere
in the world to look at that.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.320
I can send a note to
an academic colleague

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.050
and say, oh, it looks like
we've got this white stuff

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.180
in the decoration on this.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.400
Would you like me to see
if I can send you a sample,

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.900
and you might be
able to analyze it?

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.320
So I consider that what
we do in 3D imaging

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.480
is creating digital
afterlives for objects.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.690
And SciOp will tell you
that they preserve things

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:27.409
by scanning them.

00:10:27.409 --> 00:10:29.200
They do not preserve
them by scanning them,

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.350
they make a surface that
pretends that it's preserved.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:38.600
But we are able to create a
very precise, measurable models

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.420
which can be articulated,
and could even be printed,

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.910
which get people close to things
that they would not otherwise

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.510
be able to do.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:49.495
So just before Christmas I
did a Chinese oracle bone

00:10:49.495 --> 00:10:51.120
at the University
Library in Cambridge,

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.175
the oldest piece of
writing they have.

00:10:53.175 --> 00:10:56.810
It's 2,500 BC, or thereabouts.

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:00.150
And it was published it
FIZZ.org a few weeks ago,

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:04.150
and within two days
there were 5,000 hits.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.720
So 5,000 different people
looked at this object

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.360
from around the world.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.110
Now, this pot would
have never been

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.330
seen by the number of people
that have now seen it.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.820
So anyway, there's a bit
about our data structure.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.470
And amazingly enough, that
data structure is still used.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.120
We still use it today.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.120
So this country seems
to have a problem

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.693
with people called Donald.

00:11:25.693 --> 00:11:27.430
Don't know what it is.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:28.960
These are the
ramblings of a Donald,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.350
I don't know if any of you
know where this comes from.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.040
Donald Rumsfeld.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.090
That's the one.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.630
"There are known knowns.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.400
There are things we
know that we know.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.640
There are known unknowns."

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.859
There is bollocks, basically.

00:11:41.859 --> 00:11:45.710
But it actually
does describe what

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.395
we do when we try to do
remote sensing quite well,

00:11:48.395 --> 00:11:50.520
and I've used it for lots
of remote sensing things.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.430
So I want to very
quickly run through bits

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.160
of the aspects of the landscape.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.480
The landscape that we live in is
textured by human interference.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.546
This is a Bronze Age
barrow, and that dodgy thing

00:11:59.546 --> 00:12:01.170
was the thing we got
to piss alignment.

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:03.070
Sometimes they
survive beautifully

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.680
in the way of these
monuments here.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.810
Other times they're
just in plowed fields,

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.240
and we see them due to
differential growth in crops

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.670
from planes.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.610
You can see them in
Google Earth as well.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.390
You can see lots of
them in Google Earth.

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:17.410
You can see everything.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.980
But if only you'd make
sure they take the pictures

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.720
on the right day.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.760
I had a project with the
BBC about 10 years ago,

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.590
and we were going to do a sort
of crowd-- not crowdfunded,

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.050
but crowd-data
project-- and I wanted

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:32.490
to get people all
over the country

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.934
to take a five kilometer
square and try and find

00:12:35.934 --> 00:12:37.350
all the things
that they could see

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.580
in the crops in Google Earth.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.480
And it didn't happen.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.710
I understand the idea
has been recently nicked

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.620
by somebody from over
here, but I don't mind.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:46.630
I have lots of ideas.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:50.550
But it is utterly absorbing.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:54.620
I have wasted many, many hours
looking through Google Earth

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.617
at crop marks.

00:12:55.617 --> 00:12:57.200
This one is available
in Google Earth.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:57.700
I know that.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.220
This is one of my photographs,
but at the same time,

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.840
images that were used in
Google Earth were created.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.350
And the thing about Google Earth
as opposed to me flying around

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:10.720
in an airplane is flying around
in airplanes is lots of fun,

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.780
but the Google Earth
coverage is contiguous.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.040
And this is why it is important.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.890
It doesn't have any gaps in it.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:21.090
And that makes it
like nothing else

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.640
that we can do in terms
of visualizing landscape,

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.310
because we can't do
it any other way.

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.750
So it doesn't have eight
centimeter resolution data

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.460
very often, which is a pity.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.337
I wish it did.

00:13:33.337 --> 00:13:34.920
But with eight
centimeter resolution--

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.340
so this is a piece of
a later [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:41.670
Roman ladder settlement,
we call them.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:45.460
So if we want to think
about the bigger world,

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.440
we do have to get
out of our boxes.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.560
This is my daughter
when she was one.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.181
We had to drink all
the wine to find

00:13:52.181 --> 00:13:54.680
a box that's big enough to put
her in while we moved her out

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.990
of our room.

00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:00.730
And it is that process
of not believing

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.505
what you think you know.

00:14:02.505 --> 00:14:05.800
Taking on those unknown
known known unknown things

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.720
and trying to recycle
your knowledge,

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.730
never believe what you think you
believe, because you're wrong.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.130
And so we started a
campaign of trying

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:18.402
to go from looking at
excavations to the much

00:14:18.402 --> 00:14:19.110
bigger landscape.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.190
A landscape which of
course we've already seen,

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.130
has got nothing in it.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.980
So we've used lots of
different techniques.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.370
This is a GeoEye two
meter monochrome.

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:31.660
And the interesting about
the two meter monochrome,

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.490
it's not really two
meter data at all.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.450
It's just been sold
as two meter data,

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.150
because these pixels
are very fuzzy.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:39.930
When you look at
their five meter data,

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:41.660
they're not that fuzzy.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.460
But of course, they're
not really much good

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.210
compared to this.

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:48.100
So this is a five
centimeter probably,

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.510
and this is the conventional
archaeological air photography.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:57.310
And so we still have our
place, but fortunately, people

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:59.100
like you are
catching up with us.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.230
And eventually, the
clock in Google--

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.650
being able to go through lots of
pictures as we go through time

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:05.270
is very good.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.980
You see a lot more data.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.950
So we also have the problems,
there are bits of landscape

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:11.900
that we can't see.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.066
So what do we do with those?

00:15:13.066 --> 00:15:14.350
We do lidar.

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:17.060
So this is a lidar
airborne laser scan

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.220
of a piece of the
[INAUDIBLE] where

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.950
my wife works on the
archeology, the very

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.084
post interesting period,
of the 19th century.

00:15:24.084 --> 00:15:25.750
It was one of the
most industrial places

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:27.970
in the world at the time.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.170
It was the first major
iron production site.

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.670
And they have a
project, and they're

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.090
looking at these
production sites down here.

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:38.280
And the lidar, we can take the
trees away quite effectively.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.660
So we can see through trees and
see the landscape underneath.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.140
And then we can take that
data and we can put it back

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.580
onto Google Earth, and we
can replace Google Earth

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.450
with our image,
which in this case

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:51.260
is lit from multiple directions.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:55.590
So we get a better grasp of how
that landscape fits together.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:57.950
So after a lot of
years, we end up

00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:59.880
with a crop mark
distribution like this.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.000
So all this stuff.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.280
This is the same map,
and this is showing you

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.460
all the things we found
through our photography.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.470
And it has problems,
because it there's

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.690
holes all over the
place-- there are gaps.

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:11.710
Because our air
photography is responding

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.090
to ground conditions
which are variable,

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:17.290
to climate conditions
which are variable,

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:19.770
to crops that are grown
or may not be in fields,

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:23.390
so you can't go out and
go flying for a week

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:25.230
and find everything
that's there.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:31.490
This is the accumulated effect
of flying from 1979 to 1996.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.010
So lots of flying.

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:38.930
But what we can do is we can
introduce multiple techniques.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.730
So this is an eight
centimeter, and it

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:41.902
is an oblique photograph.

00:16:41.902 --> 00:16:43.610
This is where I had
to cut the wheel out.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.805
The wheel looks really
boring in the image.

00:16:45.805 --> 00:16:47.930
And this was because I had
to hang out of the plane

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:51.260
in order to get the photograph,
and so the wheel's in the way.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.270
And these things here, this
is a Neolithic long barrow,

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.150
so about 3,500 BC.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.430
This is a Bronze Age round
barrow, about to 2,500 BC.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:02.840
And these square things are
Iron Age burials and monuments

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.069
from about 500 BC to 300 BC.

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:09.430
And in this field here it
looks like it's diseased

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:11.680
because there are thousands
of dead people planted

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.060
in holes in the ground.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.910
If we try an alternative
method, in this case

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:20.150
a geomagnetic method, we
find different results.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.560
And in fact, if we use
lots of different methods

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.880
and we keep going
back, each one of them

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.300
produces its own results.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.400
So one is just not everything.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.560
We have to find ways of using
all these different techniques

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.000
and joining them together.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.720
So while we were looking
at the landscape--

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.750
this is the cemetery
where we started.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:39.280
We then dug this
little hole, which

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.420
is 500 meters from
one end to the other.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:45.717
Which, if you're troweling,
is a very, very big trench.

00:17:45.717 --> 00:17:47.300
Now most archaeologist
do what we call

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.520
blanket coverage, no trenches
bigger than a blanket.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.210
We go for 100 meter squares and
we join them all up together,

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.460
because the only sample
that's really worth looking at

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.040
is 100%.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.830
And there's a reason for
this, because if we only

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:02.400
look at little percentages of
things we don't understand,

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.830
we're not going to
understand them.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:07.020
And we've had to develop
quite novel techniques

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.110
to deal with the data.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.300
So this is my own GIS.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.870
This is a stratigraphic diagram.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:15.690
This shows this the sequence
of soil deposits in layers

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.720
as you go through the site.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.970
This one's on top of that one.

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:20.810
And if it's on top of something,
the thing underneath it

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:23.184
should be earlier, unless it's
in a stream, in which case

00:18:23.184 --> 00:18:24.780
it might be upside down.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.720
But the laws of
superimposition are

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.180
fundamental to the
way we see archeology.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:34.870
But when you've got 30,000 units
of soil, handling all of that's

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:38.650
quite difficult. So this is
tied to the drawing over here.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.840
The dots are all finds.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.170
And we can work our way up
and down through this diagram,

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:47.580
showing the sequence at which
these different features occur

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.580
and the different events happen.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:54.050
It's a bit like using the
time slider in Google Earth.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:57.826
And so Google
Earth, is it useful?

00:18:57.826 --> 00:18:59.450
Yeah, I think it
probably is, actually.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:04.600
So this is the archive from
that excavation in Google Earth.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.710
And hopefully this will work.

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.470
This is one of these features.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:09.880
It doesn't matter what it is.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.480
It's a cavity floor building
in a sixth century settlement.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.330
That's the plan.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.330
As archaeologists, we
also draw the sections.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:22.760
So there's the cross
sections through the feature.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.800
The feature has
spatial integrity

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.100
with the material inside it.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.100
Those are all the finds.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.202
The green things are
objects, the brown things

00:19:30.202 --> 00:19:30.910
are animal bones.

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:35.430
This one only had
5,500 objects in it.

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:37.390
There's some basic
stats in here.

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:40.340
I was saying earlier
at lunch that I

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.250
tried something else
in Google search today

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:47.240
and it didn't work, so I'd
love you to solve my problem.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.270
You don't have a function in
there to say I want to search,

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:53.830
but can I just search all
the tables that's published.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:57.610
Because if you did that, getting
to data would be really easy.

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:01.410
Because the billions HTML tables
that are out there archived

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:04.767
all over the world aren't hit
by the Google search engine.

00:20:04.767 --> 00:20:07.100
Whereas if your search engine
said right, I can see this

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.640
is a table, because
I can read HTML.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.830
Let me look in the table.

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:15.180
Because Google's ability
to search free text

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.680
is unparalleled.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.940
It's clever.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.800
I have to admit it.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.720
But tables are different,
because in tables, you

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.420
put structured data.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.010
And if you could
start using Google

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:28.895
to search structured
data, people with my life

00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:31.520
would be ruined forever, because
I spend all my time going wow,

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.676
I just found this out.

00:20:33.676 --> 00:20:35.800
But anyway, I just offer
that as a challenge.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.890
Anyway, there's tables here
and they've got stuff in them.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:42.610
This is all for one feature.

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:47.950
If I wanted to know whether
any sheep, domestic goose,

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:51.770
deer femurs, that
would be really useful.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.740
But I can't search for that now.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.490
So I shall go back
to the narrative.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:00.820
There is no other archaeological
archive like this in the world.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.720
Every single unit of soil
and every single object

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.470
and every single
drawing is represented

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.310
in our archive, all in HTML.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:13.090
The GIS that we use generates
these pages automatically.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:14.200
You just press go.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.340
And there's a bit
of fiddling around

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.715
with some of the scanning of
the drawings, but most of it

00:21:17.715 --> 00:21:21.870
is done directly,
computationally.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:26.500
So we found out
from our photography

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.040
that we have lots of gaps.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.960
We then found out that if
we use magnetic techniques,

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.560
we can see different things,
and we can see lots of things.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.962
So this is part of a
12 square mile survey

00:21:38.962 --> 00:21:41.420
in which we've collected data
to make mere ten sets a meter

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.390
intervals for about half of it.

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:47.510
And it was, until very
recently, the largest

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:49.730
archaeological geophysical
survey in the world.

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:54.150
Colleagues of mine in Vienna
who have many, many more toys

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:58.160
and lots of people have just
made one just a bit bigger.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.370
But it doesn't have
this much stuff in it.

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:05.160
So that's looking at 11,
12 kilometers along a road,

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.565
and that's about a third
of our total survey.

00:22:08.565 --> 00:22:10.565
And what it does is it
takes this landscape that

00:22:10.565 --> 00:22:13.430
was formerly empty, and
it has the highest density

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:16.000
of archeology of any
landscape in the world.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.090
Which of course isn't true.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:20.710
It has the highest density
of observed archeology.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:24.060
The rest of the world
hasn't yet been observed.

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:26.690
Now, the problem
with all archeology

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:31.830
is that it's all very well
having it, but it's not safe.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:37.510
And so this thing here--
you see where my mouse is?

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:38.060
Yeah.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.400
That thing there is a plow mark.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.960
So the bottom of the
plow mark is down here

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.200
where this two meter red and
white stick ranging rod is,

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.420
and that sat on top
of a load of ash.

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:55.949
This is a seventh century
cavity floor building,

00:22:55.949 --> 00:22:56.990
and it's filled with ash.

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.180
It's filled with the ash
from 10,000 tons of grade

00:22:59.180 --> 00:22:59.740
processing.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:02.770
It's very important
in historical terms.

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:04.780
But for what I'm
talking about today,

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:10.200
the problem here is that the
next time this field is plowed,

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.350
we will probably lose
all that archeology.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.390
Because the next time they'll
plow at closer spacing,

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:20.030
and that 15 centimeters of
the past will disappear.

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:22.580
Now, if that happens to
include a prehistoric house

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.560
with a preserved floor
because it's under blown sand,

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.310
then we're losing
something which we don't

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:29.500
have anywhere else in Britain.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.720
So this is quite critical.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.470
So what the hell can we
do with all that data?

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:41.080
So this is another application
using the Google Earth plugin.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.790
And I know you now
have better toys,

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:45.030
but I haven't had time to
rewrite all of this stuff,

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:47.970
and I probably won't
because it works.

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:55.330
And we put that big survey in
using the Google Earth plugin,

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:56.950
and this is it.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:58.900
And it contains a whole
range of other data.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:03.810
So this is a survey giving
us the depth of blown sand

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:06.260
on top of the archeology.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:10.590
And it's then colored
according to preservation.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:12.900
There's all sorts
of short words I

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.600
used to describe the bits that
were in red, but I won't today.

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.840
The bits in blue are
the very best preserved.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.360
Now, it's not important
necessarily that this

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.770
is archaeological data.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:27.234
This is chronological
data about a landscape.

00:24:27.234 --> 00:24:32.290
And I'm now going to
attempt the ridiculous.

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:34.246
So there's a piece of landscape.

00:24:34.246 --> 00:24:36.120
If I want to see that
gradient with the data,

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.090
I can put that on the top.

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:40.340
This is not normally
in public open access

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:43.040
at the moment, because
this is a treasure hunter's

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.150
guide to my landscape.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:47.182
And they won't let
me store landmines,

00:24:47.182 --> 00:24:50.430
so we don't put
out the thing that

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:53.730
allows them to precisely know
into which bit of which field

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:54.640
they should go.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.640
And that's not because I
don't believe everybody

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.520
should have the information.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.995
It's just we have to develop
a strategy to look after it.

00:25:01.995 --> 00:25:05.850
And part of that strategy I
will probably talk about later.

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:10.770
And we can put the blown
sand over the top of that

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:13.020
in a transparent
layer, and we can

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.870
start to see the correlation
with those bits of archeology

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:18.800
that are underneath
the blown sand.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.107
And that shows us those
bits of this archeology that

00:25:21.107 --> 00:25:22.940
should be best preserved
and those bits that

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.730
are least well preserved.

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:26.630
Now, this one doesn't
have the map behind it

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:28.088
because I replaced
it with a model.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:34.960
And the reason for that is it
hides the individual fields.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:39.890
And what we've then done
is something which I

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:42.290
think is probably quite novel.

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:44.110
So this takes a while
to load because it's

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:46.120
hundreds of megabytes.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:51.730
But one of the great things
about the plugin-- and I

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:53.850
don't know who in Google
is responsible for this,

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:56.816
but whoever it is give
them a big hug from me.

00:25:56.816 --> 00:25:58.190
Because they did
something really

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:00.700
clever when they included time.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.470
Because we human beings are
not very good about time,

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:06.480
and archaeologists and
historians are crap at it.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.180
We think that time
happens at points,

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.510
and then it moves onto another
point and another point.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:12.200
But actually, it's not.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.267
It's a whole load of
things that bunch together,

00:26:14.267 --> 00:26:16.100
they're all doing things
at different speeds

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.900
and different things
are happening.

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.970
So what I wanted to be
able to represent-- because

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:25.520
in landscape, the
landscape we live in

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:32.730
is an accumulation of
different things over time.

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:35.710
Not very many people in this
room have bought a house

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.160
and decided it was 50 meters
in the wrong position,

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.970
I'm just going to move it.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.111
Or your gardens in
the wrong place.

00:26:42.111 --> 00:26:44.485
If you're very wealthy, you
might buy another bit of land

00:26:44.485 --> 00:26:46.770
and have a bigger garden,
but you wouldn't necessarily

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:49.320
move a road because it
was not a nice road.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.180
I don't like that road,
let's move it 50 yards.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:56.570
So we are landscapers of
accumulation over time.

00:26:56.570 --> 00:27:00.130
So what we did with
this is that we

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:03.140
use this clock
thing which allows

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.940
you to animate through time.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.990
But it does a bit more than
that, because each one of these

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:11.400
features-- each
one's been coded,

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.434
and there's all the GIS
stuff in the background.

00:27:14.434 --> 00:27:15.850
And you've done
something to this,

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:17.020
and I don't know what it is.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.960
Because for years,
what this did--

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.610
and when I went to see Google in
California for the first time--

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:24.461
these clicked on
things that give you

00:27:24.461 --> 00:27:26.960
information with flash, and we
couldn't find how to stop it.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:31.450
But it's obviously working
now, and I'm very pleased.

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:34.670
So we give every single
one of these features--

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:39.360
there's about 35,000 of them in
here-- a time when it starts,

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.220
a time when it
theoretically ends,

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.450
and a time when it's
still happening.

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:45.690
And it's that still happening
that's very important.

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:50.140
So these prehistoric monuments,
the barrows, the burial mounds,

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:56.680
they might be being used from
3000 to 2000 BC, or 3500 1800.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.430
But at 1800 they don't
stop being there.

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:02.086
They're a fundamental part of
that landscape until about 1750

00:28:02.086 --> 00:28:04.020
AD.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.170
And so we need ways in
which we can articulate.

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:07.630
And we're able to do this.

00:28:10.558 --> 00:28:15.529
And if I'd had a lot more
time and a job to do it,

00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:17.320
what we would have
done, we would have done

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.920
this dynamically on the fly.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.945
But we don't.

00:28:21.945 --> 00:28:23.770
The time is hard-coded in.

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:25.350
So we have a
database behind this,

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:28.490
but it doesn't change
when I do this.

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:31.340
This is all done
in HTML and KML.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.060
And what it does is it
draws everything twice.

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.510
And it draws it from the
first date to the end date,

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:39.390
and then it draws it in gray
form the end date to the still

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:40.280
there.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.030
But this articulates
the landscape

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.170
in a way which is much more
honest and much more real.

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:46.850
And this is quite
important if you

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:49.164
want to deal with people
who aren't archaeologists,

00:28:49.164 --> 00:28:50.830
and you'd like them
to understand what's

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:51.913
going on in the landscape.

00:28:51.913 --> 00:28:55.090
So all this green stuff,
this is our time scale.

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:59.170
So the green stuff is
the Iron Age of Roman,

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:02.360
if you want to have
a handle over it.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.340
The blue stuff is
earlier, it's Bronze Age.

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:08.202
And somewhere or other
some orange, if I move out.

00:29:08.202 --> 00:29:09.160
Oh, here's some orange.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.480
These are Anglo-Saxon.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:16.180
So this OD covers
about 9000 years.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:18.690
I cover the bit
from about 15,000 BS

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:21.180
to 1,000 AD, after
which it becomes

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.290
a post-Interesting period.

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:26.420
But we don't need
to worry about that.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.390
But this provides us with
a mechanism of distributing

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:32.200
knowledge, not just data.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.600
So I can go out into this.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:38.870
This landscape looks pretty
boring at the moment.

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:41.600
You don't see this when
you're walking around in it.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.810
And fortunately, it is also
uniquely well preserved.

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:47.250
So all this stuff, this
underblown sand here

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:52.030
is about to have its future
terminated, I have a feeling.

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:55.930
So three weeks ago or
thereabouts-- the 4th of April,

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:58.190
it was in The Guardian.

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:04.280
So "Entire Yorkshire village
could be yours for 20 million."

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:07.170
Google like a research
center in Britain

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:10.060
where you could have away
weeks and you could go and do

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:14.900
environmental and spatial
research in a 27-bedroom house.

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:18.470
They don't mention it has a
bit of a hole in the roof.

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:23.080
This is for us a real crisis,
because this particular estate

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:26.890
has not been doing deep
plowing for the last 50 years.

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.440
So all that archeology is
currently well-preserved.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.970
And if it just goes to the
most rapid turnaround, biggest

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:37.016
return farmer, it will
all get destroyed.

00:30:37.016 --> 00:30:40.767
And the reality is, we want to
take about 200 or 300 hectares

00:30:40.767 --> 00:30:42.600
out of this and create
an archaeological and

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.440
environmental research park.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.730
We want to plant that geophysics
in different organic herbs,

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:49.870
which will actually
make their own income.

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:52.730
The rest of the estate will
actually be self-sustaining.

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:54.650
I think this is
a brilliant idea.

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:57.020
I've been working on an idea
for that for some years,

00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:00.360
and it's come up for
sale a bit too soon.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.640
I'm looking, but I haven't
got 20 million this week.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.940
But I think it would be a
really good thing for somebody.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.690
So if we don't do that, well,
say goodbye to the past,

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:11.330
I mean.

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:19.510
Not necessarily, because we
will be able to get knowledge

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:21.500
from those areas.

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.060
And we will be able
to distribute it.

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.555
But of course, we won't
be able to distribute it

00:31:26.555 --> 00:31:28.720
without the tools
that you produce.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.184
So I know this hasn't
all been about computing,

00:31:32.184 --> 00:31:34.600
and I would like to tell you
about all the other computing

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:35.530
stuff we've done.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:37.690
So one of the things I was
talking about in Harvard

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:42.675
yesterday was it's something you
could also do in Google Earth.

00:31:42.675 --> 00:31:45.070
A lot of stuff that
we do in real science

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.012
is all about probabilities.

00:31:47.012 --> 00:31:49.220
And so we use these things
called radio carbon dates.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:52.620
So all of you people
are radioactive.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.990
And sadly, you're not very
good from a trace element

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:57.440
point of view.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.880
The Americans are much worse
in terms of trace elements

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.171
than people in Britain,
because you've had supermarkets

00:32:02.171 --> 00:32:03.250
for much longer.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.190
So the oxygen,
led, and strontium

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:09.340
isotopes that you eat and go
into your bones and your teeth,

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:12.560
we can use those to source
where people lived in the past,

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.640
broadly.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.190
And in fact, most of it they
get from the drinking water.

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:21.830
But my children all come from
Lidl, or Tesco, or Waitrose,

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:23.530
if we get better off.

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:28.860
But I'm old enough to have
come from East Anglia.

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:32.100
But radio carbon
dating, and we're all

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.630
filled with radio carbon.

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:36.070
When we die, that radio
carbon starts to decay,

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:39.790
and every 5,473 years, it
reduces to half that amount.

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:42.040
So that's how we date things.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:46.600
But of course, it's a
precise imprecise science.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:48.150
We use lots of
Bayesian statistics

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:50.510
to improve the return,
but the reality

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.970
is that it then produces
very silly diagrams, which

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:54.990
most people can't understand.

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:59.210
And so we've developed a method
of reading the probabilities.

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:02.670
So when you calculate your
date, they output file

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:05.490
includes a probability
for every single year

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:08.620
that it could conceivably
be in your date.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:11.460
So that might be a span of
300 years or 1000 years,

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.280
depending where you are.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:17.580
For this period, it's usually a
span of about 150 to 200 years.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:20.260
And it always comes
out 95% probability.

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.790
But the 95% probability
is not for bump number

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:26.210
one or two or three,
it's any one of those.

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:30.220
So we then read in
that information,

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:33.160
we hold that all
in the giant table.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.040
And then as you
articulate the data,

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.980
it then maps those with
different densities.

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:40.770
And those densities
reflect the probabilities.

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:42.730
And then you get
to use this thing.

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:43.930
The contents in here.

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:47.540
These two things are really
good spatial data analysis,

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.900
and the bit inside
does the real work.

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:53.180
And if you can actually look
at these aspects of probability

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:57.105
reflected in brightness, you
see an entirely different world.

00:33:57.105 --> 00:33:58.980
And it's something I
would quite like to see.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.500
If we could do that
in Google Earth,

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.790
I'd be delighted, because
I'm a little surprised

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:09.380
that any other GIS
exists anymore.

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.780
I think a few more
tools on top of Google

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.929
Earth, you would have--
the world is your

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:15.500
[? welk, ?] as they say.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:16.449
It's almost there.

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:18.681
You can import stuff,
but actually, you

00:34:18.681 --> 00:34:20.139
could do all those
things that Esri

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:22.580
does without any trouble
at all, with a relatively

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.030
small programming load.

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:27.050
And I appreciate Google Earth
is not the big money maker.

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:29.960
But I wonder how many
Google users there

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.679
would be in the world had it
not been for Google Earth.

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:36.360
Because people that
are not computerate

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.320
go first to Google
Earth because they

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.940
want to see what their
house looks like.

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:42.750
They don't go and
do a Google search.

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:45.010
My children come home
from school and say daddy,

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:46.060
can we Google it?

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:47.350
Can we go Google it?

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:48.469
Yes, of course you can.

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:50.385
But that's because they
live in a house that's

00:34:50.385 --> 00:34:52.100
wall to wall
computers and people

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.520
that write software and stuff.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:58.220
But I live in a remote
village, and I've

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:02.880
watched the profile of
computer consumption,

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:07.860
and it goes Google Earth is
much sooner than using a Google

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:10.460
search.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.210
Eventually, I'm sure
it will be different.

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:14.827
When my children are
grown up the world

00:35:14.827 --> 00:35:16.660
will be completely
different because they're

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:17.785
growing up with this stuff.

00:35:17.785 --> 00:35:20.290
But certainly my generation.

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:24.520
I know people that still don't
know which is the on bottom,

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.670
and they don't have wacky
phones and the rest of it.

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:32.460
So I appeal for
two things, really.

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.290
I need help.

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:37.090
This landscape needs help.

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:41.530
But also, I think the
beauty of applied computing

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:50.010
is that we can properly
engage a global public.

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:53.240
And I think that's a
moral responsibility.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:55.320
And I feel that it's
a moral responsibility

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.550
for this archeology.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:59.080
I've been running this
project-- I dreamed up

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:02.230
the project in 1978
and 1979, and I've

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:04.140
been working on it since then.

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.930
I have in between-- I've
had all sorts of nice titles

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:08.820
and been the field
archaeologist in residence

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:12.420
in the delightful
town of Cambridge.

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:16.189
But actually, I'm still
doing this bloody job.

00:36:16.189 --> 00:36:17.980
It would be nice to
have a job, because I'm

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:20.700
a self-employed unemployed
archaeologist at the moment.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:24.680
But if it was worth
doing, it's only worth

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:28.970
doing if it gets out
there to other people.

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:33.332
And you are the people that
deliver the tools that do that.

00:36:33.332 --> 00:36:35.300
And I am extremely grateful.

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:41.180
I had to write an email
to someone the other day,

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:43.110
and it said-- oh,
it was somebody

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:46.650
that came to one of my lectures
at Harvard who is a historian

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:48.900
and knows all about
monastic stuff.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.820
And he hadn't been
able to stay there.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.770
He wrote and said thank you
very much, all that stuff.

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:55.790
But I really wanted to
ask you about Yeading

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:59.740
[INAUDIBLE] Priory, which
is where I used to live.

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:02.760
And I said of course in
1980 when I was first

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.230
trying to find out about this
particular ancient monument,

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:09.550
I looked it up and the only
nun I found anything about

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:11.390
was not the nun he
was interested in.

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:14.850
It was a nun that became
pregnant in the 15th century

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:16.140
and caused lots of trouble.

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.190
So there's loads and loads
of medieval documents

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:19.890
about this particular nun.

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:23.850
Of course, now-- we didn't
have the internet then.

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:25.440
You had physical
books and libraries

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.790
which were 50 miles away.

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:32.960
So it is a transformed
world thanks to Google.

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:36.720
We're able to do things that
we could not do any other way.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.050
But again, it's this
thing about serving.

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:42.470
You're serving the dinner,
the intellectual food

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:43.630
of the future.

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:45.172
So I thank you.

00:37:45.172 --> 00:37:48.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.720
If you have any questions.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:56.550
AUDIENCE: So there's a little
bit of-- for your own time

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:58.900
investment and people
working on a project,

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.810
there's a bit of
how do you balance

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:07.000
the time you spend like data
collection versus organizing

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.197
your data versus actually trying
to get insights into your data?

00:38:10.197 --> 00:38:12.530
DOMINIC POWLESLAND: I think
that's a very good question.

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:15.090
So first of all,
the reason that we

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:17.340
have run the most computerate
archaeological project

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:20.510
in the world is because
I'm the director.

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:23.860
And I taught myself to
program, and I wrote the GIS

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.200
because it was necessary.

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:29.545
So I used to do six
hours a night for years,

00:38:29.545 --> 00:38:32.514
and there's about 60,000
lines of code in the GIS.

00:38:32.514 --> 00:38:34.680
It does things you can't
do with any other software.

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.230
We still use it.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:41.580
So I was a serious workaholic.

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:43.310
I didn't have children then.

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:44.730
I was just tired all the time.

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:48.220
So I'd spend the day digging
and the night writing software.

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:50.100
But nowadays, that's all there.

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:54.330
But everything is from the word
go, every bit of field work

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:59.000
that we do, the
structure underlies it.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.790
So all the people that work
with me are used to using it.

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:05.100
So for instance, if we
3D a model in excavation,

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:09.330
and we've done a lot of really
serious research on this,

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:11.790
people say oh,
this is fantastic.

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:13.230
It's really quick.

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:15.060
Well, it is quick,
and we can produce

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:17.120
a record that is unparalleled.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:20.630
I may be able to bring one up.

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:24.370
This gives us an insight into
what we're busily destroying

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:27.650
as field archaeologists that
we cannot do any other way,

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:33.180
because we cannot draw to the
resolution that we get from

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:36.120
a digital model.

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.720
This is a dead
person who could not

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.680
be retrieved from the ground,
because the bones were

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.060
too fragile.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.620
And we're able to
get a 3D record.

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:49.930
We could not draw
with a pen and paper

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:53.060
very well, because it's in
the bottom of this deep hole.

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:57.590
But-- and this may not be
the best model of them all.

00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:59.970
And there's lots of models
of this particular body.

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:01.720
But we're able to
model to the degree

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.850
that we can see underneath
the measuring stick.

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:08.220
And once that's got
it's final texture on--

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:11.630
So I could then go and do that.

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:13.700
We can take the photographs
in the afternoon,

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.480
we can process it
overnight, we can

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.760
print it to scale as an auto
image in the morning on a piece

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.660
of waterproof paper
with waterproof ink,

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:23.180
and I can go out with the person
that dug it and say right,

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.410
now tell me all about it.

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:27.890
We then write those notes
on that piece of paper,

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:29.990
and those are transposed
into the computer.

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:32.180
The one place we would
write on the bit of paper,

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.220
because I want them
with the image.

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:37.880
Now, we could not do
that any other way.

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:41.060
We have insights
into this that we

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:43.070
don't get from anything else.

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:46.240
The logical extension
of that approach

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:55.440
is in this model, which has
all these numbers all over it.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.170
So these are all the context
numbers, the units of soil

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:01.940
that have been excavated, and we
can go around and look at that.

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.610
If we were to draw
that by hand, it

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:05.320
would have taken a long time.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:08.510
And my view of what
we do as excavators,

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:11.170
it's a conversation
with the ground.

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:13.340
So we are faced by
this big pile of data

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.520
which is soil that
has stuff in it,

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.740
and that conversation is
how we try and understand

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:20.480
it and interpret it.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.390
If I can take somebody out
and sit on the ground in front

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:25.660
of it, and say right, we've
got this image, oh look,

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:28.930
I hadn't noticed that,
what's going on there?

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:31.649
It's a whole new
level of information,

00:41:31.649 --> 00:41:33.190
and the bizarrest
thing in the world.

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:35.120
So these are made using
digital photogrametry.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.125
And you take lots
of pictures, you

00:41:37.125 --> 00:41:39.870
use Agisoft PhotoScan
Pro to process them,

00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:41.260
and it will create the 3D model.

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:44.530
But what I had no idea about
when we started doing this--

00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:47.310
I've been doing this for
quite a few years now.

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:50.240
So this is a small trench.

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:54.920
This thing here where the
hand this is a Palisade slot.

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.930
It's the defensive
wall that was thrown up

00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:00.410
when the Scotts trashed
the English in 1300

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:02.030
something or other.

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:04.950
Edward Longshanks ran
away, leaving his army

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:06.520
to be slaughtered
at this hill fort.

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.470
And this is a very
late re-defense.

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:12.890
And this is a Bronze Age-- about
1,000 BC-- timber fence that's

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:13.830
part of the rampart.

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:16.680
If I go and look at
this from the outside,

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.160
I see something different.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:23.190
And this is to do with
human perception and acuity.

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:26.760
So when I look at the section
from one side, the stones that

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:29.750
come towards me
from the other side,

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:33.480
they have an increased
ocular presence.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.920
When I turn it
around, the stones

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.952
that have been knocked
out of the site

00:42:36.952 --> 00:42:39.810
are replacing that
ocular presence.

00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:42.590
So we see stuff in stone
holes which haven't

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:44.600
been scraped with a trowel.

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:49.610
So my view is that we
don't have any option.

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:55.380
If we don't start using these
techniques, we are stuffed.

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:57.437
The problem we
have is archiving.

00:42:57.437 --> 00:42:59.270
That is probably the
biggest problem of all,

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:00.530
how do you archive
all this stuff?

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:02.446
And very fortunately,
the wonderful university

00:43:02.446 --> 00:43:04.650
of Cambridge have what
they call the DSpace, which

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:06.650
is their infinite archive.

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:09.630
And they have offered
to take all of our data.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:11.470
We offered it to
SCI-Arc, they wanted

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:14.490
to charge us lots of money,
which didn't seem quite fair,

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:15.630
really.

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:18.270
But Cambridge has said
they will take it all on.

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:20.070
And that will give it a future.

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:23.775
And I'm also a big believer
in things with printing.

00:43:23.775 --> 00:43:26.960
The biggest problem in
the world for archiving

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.116
is digital photography.

00:43:29.116 --> 00:43:30.810
I bet at least
one of you has got

00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:33.240
a phone that takes photographs.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.552
And you use it, and
you take pictures.

00:43:35.552 --> 00:43:37.760
And when you lose your phone,
you lose those pictures

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.593
if you haven't put them
on your Google space

00:43:39.593 --> 00:43:40.840
or wherever it happens to be.

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:42.510
These spaces are all
very well, but when

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:44.090
you join them and you
put things on them,

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:45.510
they're suddenly
each a hard disk.

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:46.480
I had no idea.

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.260
I thought they were out there.

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:53.190
So digital photography is an
absolute potential crisis.

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:56.986
So our view is we take
those best archive pictures

00:43:56.986 --> 00:44:00.590
and we print them on
archival paper very small,

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:02.620
because they could
be scanned in again

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:05.420
in the future, if the
digital copy disappears.

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:10.010
So it's a strategic part
of all our planning.

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:16.190
We have to have that sorted
before we go and dig the hole.

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:19.940
You can't sort of go and start
a thing and half way through,

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:22.930
I just need to go back and-- oh,
I have just destroyed that bit.

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:26.320
So archaeological excavation,
every single experiment

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.850
is unique.

00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:29.240
It's an un-repeatable
experiment.

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.920
So that landscape with it's
blown sand and all that stuff

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.640
underneath it, once
it's gone, that's

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.710
4,500 years of the past
of the north of England

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:40.680
that will never come back.

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:44.760
So there is a
responsibility driving all

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.249
this insane computing, really.

00:44:48.249 --> 00:44:49.540
Does that answer your question?

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:51.410
AUDIENCE: I think
it does, thanks.

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:53.090
AUDIENCE: So looking
at the 3D images,

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:56.128
I was curious what process you
go through to generate that--

00:44:56.128 --> 00:44:58.140
the vase and then this.

00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:00.570
DOMINIC POWLESLAND: So the
pots are quite difficult,

00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:04.420
because it's got the inside
and the outside in only one go.

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:08.840
So the idea in essence,
we use a piece of software

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.180
called Agisoft
PhotoScan, which is

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:12.810
written by some Russian people.

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:13.590
And it is superb.

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:16.400
Of all the things that do
this, it's by far the best,

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.250
and I've tried them all.

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:20.310
So when we do a lot of
the 3D modeling ones,

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:25.936
I will describe the technique
in a paper like this.

00:45:25.936 --> 00:45:28.420
A fat man.

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:30.395
So this shows you the
photographic approach.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:38.440
And then when we use
structure for motion,

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.960
which is the mathematics
behind how you calculate

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:42.720
where the camera
is, but basically

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:45.020
it's looking and using
bundle adjustment

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:47.000
to identify groups
of pixels that

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.510
have a recognizable
contrast signature from one

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:51.690
to the other.

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:53.610
So it goes through
each image and tries

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:55.822
to match up those signatures.

00:45:55.822 --> 00:46:00.120
And it will do it basically
to a very crude point cloud,

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.470
and then it works out
where that projects

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:05.370
the positions of the
cameras that you see here.

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:08.460
From that, it then
reverses the process

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:12.210
to try and improve the position
of the camera precision

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:15.190
by reversing it back
onto the object.

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:17.180
And when you've got
through that process,

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:21.820
you then triangulate
it to get a tin model.

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:25.797
But to get inside that pot, just
take hundreds of photographs.

00:46:25.797 --> 00:46:27.380
And you have to mask
them all as well,

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.088
because depth of field
for a small object

00:46:29.088 --> 00:46:30.631
is really quite problematic.

00:46:30.631 --> 00:46:32.630
So if you read an article
that says all you need

00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:34.400
is a rubbish camera,
don't believe a word.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.880
You need a good camera
and a proper lens.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:40.760
And you have to be very--
it's like everything we do.

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:42.450
You have to be rigorous.

00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:46.010
It's rigorous, boring science.

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:48.870
You do it the proper way,
and you get good results.

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:51.242
And if you don't, you don't.

00:46:51.242 --> 00:46:53.700
If you look at this on the web,
all those runes on the body

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:58.000
are all individually
tagged as well.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.600
I think it's had 8,000 or
9,000 people have looked at it.

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.170
Now 8,000 or 9,000
people would never

00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:04.540
have seen that during its life.

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:08.490
And I'm hoping that
we will eventually

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:11.650
be able to get radio carbon
date for the contents.

00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:16.260
But in terms of if you happen
to be a rune geek or you happen

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:19.120
to be in a school, being
able to go and look

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:22.890
at the vessel in this way-- so
there's a little bit of control

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:23.850
you have on the web.

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:28.423
So if I turn this
to high definition,

00:47:28.423 --> 00:47:30.590
and then I turn
this to shadeless,

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:33.124
you can say inside
it quite well.

00:47:33.124 --> 00:47:35.540
But this is all down to hundreds
and hundreds of pictures,

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:38.590
and having to mask everything
that's out of focus.

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:44.250
So it took about four hours
to do the photography and four

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:46.000
weeks to get the result.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.080
And it wasn't like I sat there
for four weeks working on it.

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:55.470
I have a very heavily
specified Windows PC

00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:58.325
with a wacky graphics
card, and I've

00:47:58.325 --> 00:47:59.650
got a heavily specified fruit.

00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:02.590
And between them, once they've
got the good graphics card,

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:05.642
you can get this stuff
processed quickly.

00:48:05.642 --> 00:48:08.100
And it's about having exactly
the right number of pictures.

00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:11.050
If you got too many, it
slows it down enormously.

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:13.570
If they're not sharp,
it doesn't work.

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:15.500
So you've got to be rigorous.

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:20.072
But the end result is stunning.

00:48:20.072 --> 00:48:21.780
And more people have
seen this than every

00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:25.320
would have seen it in its life,
and it's being used in schools.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.990
So I've just done a
project on a stone

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:31.980
cross, Gosforth
in Cumbria, which

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:33.300
is four and a half meters high.

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:35.200
So we have a camera on
a pole which I control

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:38.920
with a phone, 700 photographs.

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.960
Most irritatingly,
the north side

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:43.000
of the cross which
is mostly eroded

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.960
is away from the sun,
which while you're

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:48.110
trying to photograph it, the
sun is directly in front of you.

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:50.700
The weather was supposed
to be overcast that day,

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:53.896
overcast but blue sky.

00:48:53.896 --> 00:48:58.920
And that was done so that two
schools could share this object

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.080
and work on it together.

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:03.670
One is an inner
city London school

00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:06.560
with a very mixed intake,
and one is a tiny village

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:09.280
school in Cumbria.

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.300
And those kids have
had the opportunity

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:13.165
do something they
could never have done.

00:49:13.165 --> 00:49:17.350
You know, the Cumbrian kids know
about it, because it's there.

00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:19.370
And it's half pagan
and half Christian,

00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:23.090
which makes it even better,
because it has stories that

00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:25.114
go into multiple directions.

00:49:25.114 --> 00:49:26.530
And the great thing
about any sort

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:31.050
of digital futures
and digital afterlives

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:35.190
is that we're not
concerned with one thing.

00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:37.660
I was taught by my dad that
you're either a polymath

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.620
or you're dead.

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:42.260
I think that wasn't a bad line.

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:47.080
I think everything we
do digitally gives us

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:50.510
the opportunity to engage
new and different people

00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:53.610
and to get everything
we can out of one

00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:56.580
piece of digital resource.

00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:57.350
Does that help?

00:49:57.350 --> 00:49:57.942
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:57.942 --> 00:50:00.510
DOMINIC POWLESLAND: Sorry.

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:02.900
AUDIENCE: What are the
markers along the surface?

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.990
DOMINIC POWLESLAND:
Oh, those are stamps.

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:09.760
They're made using the
sawn-off tine of an antler.

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:14.460
And the thing about this
is that as you go around,

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:16.030
what day of the week is it?

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:17.830
He's got a hangover, look.

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:20.560
There's a double impression
in quite a lot of them.

00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:22.300
So they're just decoration.

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:23.890
What is very novel
of course is you've

00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:25.556
got this line that
goes around the side.

00:50:25.556 --> 00:50:28.500
Now, how do you express this in
normal black and white drawing?

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:31.590
So that line starts up
there and comes around here.

00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:35.680
It's a spiral that goes--
how do you do that?

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:38.560
Now, the drawings of
this pot look nothing

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:41.316
like this-- the
published drawings of it.

00:50:41.316 --> 00:50:42.940
And you can't go and
have a look at it,

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:46.040
because it's in a cupboard
in the British Museum.

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.790
And they've got a lot of stuff,
so allowing this to go out

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:52.270
there is I think is brilliant.

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:56.850
But I've got to dig out, we've
got several of these antler

00:50:56.850 --> 00:51:00.220
tines from our settlement, which
have got these stamps cut out

00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:01.350
of them.

00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:02.950
It's just decoration.

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:06.900
[APPLAUSE]
