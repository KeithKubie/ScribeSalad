00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.500
Well now you've learned what I
think is quite possibly one of

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.010
the most useful concepts in
life, and you might already be

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.920
familiar with it, but if you're
not this will hopefully keep

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.330
you from one day filing
for bankruptcy.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.830
So anyway, I will talk about
interest, and then simple

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:21.865
versus compound interest.

00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:23.770
So what's interest?

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.840
We all have heard of it.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.030
Interest rates, or interest
on your mortgage, or how

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.240
much interest do I owe
on my credit card.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.140
So interest-- I don't know what
the actual formal definition,

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.610
maybe I should look it up
on Wikipedia-- but it's

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.850
essentially rent on money.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.350
So it's money that you pay
in order to keep money

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.520
for some period of time.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.420
That's probably not the most
obvious definition, but

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.920
let me put it this way.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.640
Let's say that I want to
borrow $100 from you.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.760
So this is now.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.120
And let's say that this
is one year from now.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.080
One year.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.830
And this is you,
and this is me.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.580
So now you give me $100.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.915
And then I have the $100
and a year goes by,

00:01:09.915 --> 00:01:12.570
and I have $100 here.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.980
And if I were to just give you
that $100 back, you would

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.510
have collected no rent.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.470
You would have just
got your money back.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.880
You would have
collected no interest.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.470
But if you said, Sal I'm
willing to give you $100 now if

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.860
you give me $110 a year later.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.620
So in this situation, how
much did I pay you to keep

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.620
that $100 for a year?

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.200
Well I'm paying you
$10 more, right?

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.610
I'm returning the $100, and
I'm returning another $10.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.510
And so this extra $10 that I'm
returning to you is essentially

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.570
the fee that I paid to be able
to keep that money and do

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.790
whatever I wanted with that
money, and maybe save

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.630
it, maybe invest it, do
whatever for a year.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.200
And that $10 is
essentially the interest.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.530
And a way that it's often
calculated is a percentage

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.850
of the original amount
that I borrowed.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.140
And the original amount that I
borrowed in fancy banker or

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.980
finance terminology is
just called principal.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.630
So in this case the rent on the
money or the interest was $10.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.920
And if I wanted to do it as a
percentage, I would say 10 over

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.240
the principal-- over 100--
which is equal to 10%.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.480
So you might have said, hey Sal
I'm willing to lend you $100 if

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.420
you pay me 10% interest on it.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.770
So 10% of $100 was $10, so
after a year I pay you

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.810
$100, plus the 10%.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:47.560
And likewise.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.220
So for any amount of money, say
you're willing to lend me any

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.540
amount of money for
a 10% interest.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.680
Well then if you were to lend
me $1,000, then the interest

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.950
would be 10% of that,
which would be $100.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:11.020
So then after a year I would
owe you $1,000 plus 10% times

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.555
$1,000, and that's
equal to $1,100.

00:03:14.555 --> 00:03:17.780
All right, I just added
a zero to everything.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.090
In this case $100 would
be the interest, but

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.130
it would still be 10%.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.170
So let me now make a
distinction between simple

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.000
interest and compound interest.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.220
So we just did a fairly simple
example where you lent money

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.540
for me for a year at
10% percent, right?

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.280
So let's say that someone were
to say that my interest rate

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.930
that they charge-- or the
interest rate they charge to

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:51.000
other people-- is-- well 10% is
a good number-- 10% per year.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.700
And let's say the principal
that I'm going to borrow

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.900
from this person is $100.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.980
So my question to you-- and
maybe you want to pause it

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:18.570
after I pose it-- is how
much do I owe in 10 years?

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.140
How much do I owe in 10 years?

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.080
So there's really two ways
of thinking about it.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:30.350
You could say, OK in years at
times zero-- like if I just

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.430
borrowed the money, I just
paid it back immediately,

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.730
it'd be $100, right?

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.210
I'm not going to do that,
I'm going to keep it

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.570
for at least a year.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.270
So after a year, just based on
the example that we just did, I

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:48.870
could add 10% of that amount to
the $100, and I would

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.050
then owe $110.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.420
And then after two years, I
could add another 10% of the

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.800
original principal, right?

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.610
So every year I'm
just adding $10.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.775
So in this case it would be
$120, and in year three,

00:05:03.775 --> 00:05:05.310
I would owe $130.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.770
Essentially my rent per year to
borrow this $100 is $10, right?

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.580
Because I'm always taking
10% of the original amount.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.090
And after 10 years-- because
each year I would have had to

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.120
pay an extra $10 in interest--
after 10 years I

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.630
would owe $200.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:23.200
Right?

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:33.520
And that $200 is equal to $100
of principal, plus $100 of

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.580
interest, because I paid
$10 a year of interest.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.260
And this notion which I just
did here, this is actually

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.020
called simple interest.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.260
Which is essentially you take
the original amount you

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.840
borrowed, the interest rate,
the amount, the fee that you

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.140
pay every year is the interest
rate times that original

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.090
amount, and you just
incrementally pay

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.380
that every year.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.980
But if you think about it,
you're actually paying a

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.390
smaller and smaller percentage
of what you owe going

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:59.170
into that year.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.950
And maybe when I show
you compound interest

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:01.690
that will make sense.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.530
So this is one way to interpret
10% interest a year.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.960
Another way to interpret it is,
OK, so in year zero it's $100

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.840
that you're borrowing, or if
they handed the money, you say

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.230
oh no, no, I don't want it and
you just paid it back,

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.550
you'd owe $100.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.630
After a year, you would
essentially pay the

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:27.450
$100 plus 10% of $100,
right, which is $110.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.830
So that's $100,
plus 10% of $100.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.180
Let me switch colors,
because it's monotonous.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.970
Right, but I think this
make sense to you.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.030
And this is where simple
and compound interest

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.220
starts to diverge.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.930
In the last situation we
just kept adding 10%

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.480
of the original $100.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.310
In compound interest now,
we don't take 10% of

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.310
the original amount.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.310
We now take 10% of this amount.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:02.440
So now we're going
to take $110.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.470
You can almost view it
as our new principal.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.840
This is how much we offer
a year, and then we

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.110
would reborrow it.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:19.810
So now we're going to owe
$110 plus 10% times 110.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.220
You could actually undistribute
the 110 out, and that's

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:32.950
equal to 110 times 110.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.440
Actually 110 times 1.1.

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.280
And actually I could
rewrite it this way too.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.850
I could rewrite it as
100 times 1.1 squared,

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.920
and that equals $121.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.790
And then in year two, this is
my new principal-- this is

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.110
$121-- this is my
new principal.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.990
And now I have to in year
three-- so this is year two.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.710
I'm taking more space,
so this is year two.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:06.450
And now in year three, I'm
going to have to pay the $121

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:14.820
that I owed at the end of year
two, plus 10% times the amount

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:20.450
of money I owed going
into the year, $121.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.950
And so that's the same thing--
we could put parentheses around

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:29.270
here-- so that's the same thing
as 1 times 121 plus 0.1 times

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:35.650
121, so that's the same
thing as 1.1 times 121.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.800
Or another way of viewing it,
that's equal to our original

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:44.180
principal times 1.1
to the third power.

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:46.060
And if you keep doing this--
and I encourage you do it,

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.660
because it'll really give you a
hands-on sense-- at the end of

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.030
10 years, we will owe-- or you,
I forgot who's borrowing from

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:57.962
whom-- $100 times 1.1
to the 10th power.

00:08:57.962 --> 00:08:59.050
And what does that equal?

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.320
Let me get my spreadsheet out.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.690
Let me just pick a random cell.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:10.980
So plus 100 times 1.1
to the 10th power.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.160
So $259 and some change.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.730
So it might seem like a very
subtle distinction, but it ends

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:24.580
up being a very big difference.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:30.610
When I compounded it 10% for
10 years using compound

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.100
interest, I owe $259.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.290
When I did it using simple
interest, I only owe $200.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.770
So that $59 was kind of the
increment of how much more

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.360
compound interest cost me.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.610
I'm about to run out of time,
so I'll do a couple more

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.560
examples in the next video,
just you really get a deep

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.460
understanding of how to do
compound interest, how the

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.680
exponents work, and what
really is the difference.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.060
I'll see you in the next video.
