Speaker 1:          00:01          The Joe Rogan experience. All right, cool. So we were just talking about your books and I tried, I said, let's save it. Let's save it for the podcast because I wanted it to sound fresh. I want you to reset. So tell me about, you wrote two books. I wrote two books and you know, as you know, I'm a, you know, movie writer and a movie and television producer said mildly. I mean, I made some fucking amazing movies. Wow. Thanks. Thanks Joe. My pleasure. Yeah. And um, uh, and all this, I think, you know, uh, my whole life and whatever those stories are the movies are and the successes, I kinda think anyone that's really focused can, can do what I do. So that was kind of the end product of the first book, which was, it was called a curious mind, the secret to bigger life. And um, that book is really about, I mean, how much do you want to know about it and everything?

Speaker 1:          00:57          Everything. Okay. So basically I couldn't read it all in elementary school and it caused a lot of trauma, a lot of shame. And then a lot of trauma. Did you have dyslexia? I had dyslexia, very, very quite acute dyslexia. And I think we're out in Woodland Hills, which was the fancy part of the Valley. I grew up in the flats of Sherman Oaks. Uh, actually as a, as a little kid going to Riverside drive elementary school and then later to Nobel junior high and then later Chatsworth high school. And in elementary school I couldn't read it all. And they didn't classify it as dyslexia that it was just your slow, you're dumb. You, uh, why can't you answer this? Uh, and then you'd say, I can't read. And then that didn't make sense. It just didn't see none of those things computed really, that somebody couldn't actually read a word and I really couldn't read a word.

Speaker 1:          01:57          So when you can't read a word, then you find ways to uh, survive, cope, um, and not have the teacher look you in the eyes and say, okay Brian, come to the board and answer this question because you're never just going to produce more shame cause you're not, you don't know the answer. It's not possible. So I found that, um, as that went on for a little while, for quite a while around the fourth, fifth, sixth grade, I really looked at people, I really looked them in the eyes to learn. And I've found that by looking somebody in the eyes, you could engage, I didn't know this then, but you engage their heart. If you're really doing it with sincerity and interest, you can engage people and move them and evangelize things young, get people to like play on your team and or you play on their team, they pick you and stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:51          Good things happen. Um, except the reading part. Um, but it, it enabled me to learn a lot just by looking at people and talking to people. And my, I had this one mentor, this little grandmother, uh, her name was Sonya and a little Sonia. She's like four, 10, I guess, you know. And she would always say to me, she'd see me once a week, minimally, always once a week, and she'd say, you're going all the way, you're going to make it big, think big, be big. And she had all these isms because a half my mom's side of the family was Jewish. My dad's side of the family's Catholic, the Jewish side, the grandmother was my mentor. And the worst thing that really was the single person that I could kind of count on in life. And she'd constantly tell me how, how things, I'd go, great.

Speaker 1:          03:42          You have a gift for gab, she'd say, and, and every time she said, you're gonna go all the way. I'm thinking there's like absolutely no empirical evidence. I'm going all the way anywhere except my parents were always arguing, let's put him back. The teacher, miss STIGs had, let's put him back. So I just wasn't going anywhere. I didn't think so. So that gave rise to me, give rise to the fact that I thought the way I can really learn a lot is have these kind of curiosity conversations. And once I graduated college, I did this on a weekly basis. And if still do it to this day, once a week, sometimes once every two weeks, but never more than once every two weeks. I never, I'm pretty militant. I'm extremely militant about it. Like how do you do it? Like what do you mean? Um, well what I do is I think about, it's often, and I, I know you do something possibly similar to this and, and, and, but my system would be, I bombard myself with, now I can read of course.

Speaker 1:          04:46          Um, and I was able to start to read like in high school, can you tell me how they fix that? They couldn't fix it. It's not, it wasn't fixable. How to dyslexia reverses words on you, right? Uh, versus the way you view letters and, yeah. Well, it's scary. Initially as a kid it's scrambles the letters. Then when it gets better, it reverses the words. And to this day I still start on the right and go to the left. So it takes like really thoughtful, disciplined to make sure I'm always starting. Do you mean with the sentences or the sentences with a sentence? Really. So you'll start at the right end of the, you should read Hebrew or something. Isn't that different languages do that, right? Yeah, I guess they do. Um, but incidentally when you have dyslexia it's very hard to learn other languages. So I would imagine very, very hard.

Speaker 1:          05:39          So, um, but I can read and I bombard myself. So how do you switch it around? Like when, when your, your brain is making you read right to left? Yes. Um, I, I, I started to learn, just create like, just like an exercise, a discipline where I could, like in K as in college, I was able to read, I get forced myself to start on the left and go to the right. Is there a certain mechanism that's causing you to do right? To laugh? Like do they know what the cause of this is? Not that I know of. Hm. Not that I know. Probably something neurological and certainly genetic. I mean I have no genetic trace, but it has to be a letter within your genome. I have to get, having to guess. So you learned how to read, you learned how to figure it out.

Speaker 1:          06:30          And then you said you, you have these conversations at least once every two weeks. So how do you do this? Like, what do you do? You organize them, they're structured, they're structured. They, they, they're, they see there's a randomness to them because often you'd have to, I have to, it's not like getting on your show where everybody wants to be in the show. Uh, I say that with a compliment of course, but I, I'm begging people you, because even though down with you, I'm begging him to sit down with me and I'm groveling and uh, I'm calling assistance directly. I still, I have three assistants, but I make all of my own phone calls always. You know, why? Because I have this discipline of getting to know assistance and going, Hey, it's Brian is Richard around or, and I just like, I do that. That's so refreshing from a guy who's as successful as you are because so many times when people get that successful, you insulate yourself with a bunch of other people that do all the calls for you and open all the doors for you and you just kinda, you stay insulated and more aloof.

Speaker 1:          07:34          Yeah. Thanks. Well, thank you. Thanks. Well, I, yeah, they do. People do. I mean look, there are producers that are sort of, that are, you know, let's say we're in the same category, same ill that just do it differently. I, I made a lot of deliberate choices through trial and error. I saw, I went through the 80s where power guys had desks above the other chairs that are on the other side. I have the power guys always had black lacquer furniture and they did all these power things. And I thought, I want to re, I want artists to like me relate to me. And I always did everything to create a democratic environment because not that I was such a cool guy, but more like you just get so much more out of a creative person by not intimidating them. Sure. Yeah. And I just saw, you know, my peers and sometimes often, you know, someone maybe a decade ahead of me, you know, I don't want to say I'm so close to saying names, but, but just those sort of tough guys, you know?

Speaker 1:          08:38          Um, and I, I didn't think that was an effective, I just didn't think it was effective. And I wasn't making these really hardcore action movies. I was doing movies that were, they're designed to a mite, a ignite emotion and feeling. In fact, even when I do public speaking, I say, Oh, Brian Grazer dead or whatever they might say. But I goes, I'm, I always say I'm in the feelings business. I'm not a movie producer, so I'm just a, I'm in the feelings business because I feel like that's what we want out of a cinematic experience for me. Sure. The movies I'm interested in doing or TV shows is that, so, um, because I, I grew up loving those movies in the 70s and I'm captivated by things that move me emotionally and elevate me emotional. So you make these phone calls and you arrange these conversations. So you arrange basically a podcast that no one's listening to that's kind of like you.

Speaker 1:          09:43          That's exactly, I never thought of it in those words. That is really funny. You should probably record them. I S so I've done it for say, 35 years. Really? You didn't record any of them the first 15 years and nothing. I didn't write no really notes either. And then the second 10 years that was, you know, I'd say 15 was nothing. I just did it cause I felt like that could inhibit somebody or I felt like I was trying to do these sort of down low in a way. Like I didn't want to commodify them, you know, like industrialized by conversations and I had friends go like, Oh, can we be part of it? And I tried it once with a couple other guys. It during my thing and it fractionalized or my attention. Yeah. And it, it, when I found the great thing about the conversations, the one on one with no one else in the room, which that's all I do.

Speaker 1:          10:41          Again, I've, I tried it different ways. It, it create your, what's you're trying to do, I'm trying to do is like create the best date that Isaac Asimov I've had had or, or you know, or I mean I have so many people, you know, just uh, Margaret Thatcher. I'm trying to, like, I'm, I'm trying to be, have no idea of a time and space and I want them to have no idea of time and space and because that is like your best date. And I always think like my, what is my best date with a girl? My very, for me Brian, cause I, I, I, my best date is, I'm not even thinking about time and it's just becomes almost like a, a biochemical event. It's just things are evolving. And I felt like I could do this with Nobel, with many Nobel laureates, with Sheldon glass cow who converted the four forces of Daisy nation, uh, uh, of, of nature to three.

Speaker 1:          11:36          And I brought his name up because, uh, well first of all, I knew that your show, you could, you could do whatever you want. And, and was Sheldon Glasgow? It's like, I usually do an hour or two hours, but I hung out with this guy, shut up my whole day down for six hours. Wow. Just because I was so captivated by him and he talked about multiple subjects. So basically I am always got somebody that I'm really wanting to meet and it's takes a year at least or sometimes years to organize this, to get them to say yes or to be in the same city or be willing to say yes and meek flight in New York or some other place. It sounds like you have figured out the benefit that I've experienced from having podcasts and having these kinds of conversations one on one conversations, but you did it just for your own personal edification.

Speaker 1:          12:30          Yeah, it's, it's kind of amazing, but it's, I have gotten more out of talking to people like this and it's, it made me grow more as a person and make, made me understand more about communication and how to talk to people than anything I've ever done in my whole life. Because you don't normally have this completely unfilled. It's one of the reasons why I like headsets as well because it locks you in. It's like your, your volume of you talking is the same level in my ears as it is in your ears. We're all on this one. It's not like there's distance between us. We're in each other's ears and we're talking, there's no phones, there's no nothing. We're sitting across from each other. How would I ever organize this? I had thought about that with so many different people that I've had a chance to talk to.

Speaker 1:          13:17          Like how would I ever get Sean Carroll, the astrophysicist says to sit down and just talk to me for three hours to count against him. I would never get him to do that. I would never get them to, Hey, let's put headphones on and you just tell me about stuff like explained to me about no one, no one would ever do that. But because of this thing called the podcast, because I can share it with all the other people that are listening. I've had this chance to have these kinds of conversations and it sounds like you've done the same thing, but without an audience. That's really brilliant. It's a brilliant way that you figured out that this is a great way to, to, to expand your own understanding of people by being one on one with these brilliant folks. Yes, exactly. And, and, um, and maybe you do this too, but I, I've found, I mean, I do meet a lot of people. I reach out to me people that are, you know, expert. Um, it's many different things that I, that I don't do, of course. But sometimes I just, I become really motivated just to meet somebody because they're so uniquely committed to something. They're so obsessed. Yes. Um, and I've even found that I've learned a lot from Uber drivers and baristas and stuff where I, um, so I, I, but I do reach out to meet, you know, people that have really had a very intense, committed to a really intense journey and often have triumphed in
