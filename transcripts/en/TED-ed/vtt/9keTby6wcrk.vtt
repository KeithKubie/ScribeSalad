00:00:06.489 --> 00:00:12.719
In a Moment of Vision...

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.249
It's the 1930s, San Francisco.

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:17.955
Joseph B. Friedman 
and his young daughter Judith

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:20.799
are sitting at the counter 
in a soda parlor.

00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:23.344
Judith has just ordered a milkshake.

00:00:23.344 --> 00:00:26.224
Vanilla or strawberry, we may never know.

00:00:26.224 --> 00:00:30.770
When the milkshake arrives,
Joseph watches as little Judith struggles.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.114
Seated on the parlor stool,

00:00:32.114 --> 00:00:34.908
she is unable to reach the mouth
of the striped paper straw

00:00:34.908 --> 00:00:37.072
protruding from her shake.

00:00:37.072 --> 00:00:42.060
Joseph, in a moment of vision, 
modifies Judith's straw.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.174
He inserts a screw into one end,

00:00:44.174 --> 00:00:45.962
and using a piece of dental floss,

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:49.555
crushes the paper between the threads
of the screw

00:00:49.555 --> 00:00:53.636
creating a series 
of tiny equidistant corrugations.

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:54.851
After removing the screw,

00:00:54.851 --> 00:00:57.586
the straw is able to bend over the side
of the glass

00:00:57.586 --> 00:01:00.813
and Judith is able to savor her milkshake.

00:01:00.813 --> 00:01:03.391
Joseph initially markets 
the new flexible straw

00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:06.973
to hospitals to help patients
drink while reclining,

00:01:06.973 --> 00:01:10.842
but eventually, with the marketing
and business savvy from his sister Betty,

00:01:10.842 --> 00:01:15.082
the bendy straw becomes a beloved utensil
of every child

00:01:15.082 --> 00:01:17.152
and a regular household item.
