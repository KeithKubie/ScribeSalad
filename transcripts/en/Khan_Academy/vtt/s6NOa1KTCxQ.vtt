00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:04.807
- [Voiceover] Zhang Tao
has two one dollar bills.

00:00:04.807 --> 00:00:06.351
So two one dollar bills.

00:00:06.351 --> 00:00:08.231
So let's just write that as one plus one,

00:00:08.231 --> 00:00:09.798
because each one dollar bill

00:00:09.798 --> 00:00:11.691
represents one dollar.

00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:13.711
So, one dollar plus one dollar.

00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:15.394
That's the two one dollar bills.

00:00:15.394 --> 00:00:17.634
One five dollar bill.

00:00:17.634 --> 00:00:19.178
One five dollar bill.

00:00:19.178 --> 00:00:21.570
So that represents five dollars.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.217
And three 10 dollar bills.

00:00:24.217 --> 00:00:26.515
Three 10 dollar bills.

00:00:26.515 --> 00:00:31.333
So that's plus ten plus ten plus ten.

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.817
How much money does he have in all?

00:00:33.817 --> 00:00:34.468
Well, let's see.

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:36.755
One plus, let's see if
we can calculate it.

00:00:36.755 --> 00:00:38.415
One plus one is two.

00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:40.083
Two plus five is seven.

00:00:40.083 --> 00:00:42.756
So, these are going to be seven dollars.

00:00:42.756 --> 00:00:45.350
And then 10 plus 10 plus
10, that's three 10's.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.073
So that's going to be 30 dollars.

00:00:48.073 --> 00:00:50.929
Now what's seven ones plus three 10's?

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:52.949
Or what's seven plus 30?

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.350
Well, that's going to be 37 dollars.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.646
So Zhang Tao has 37 dollars in all.

00:01:00.646 --> 00:01:02.107
Let's do another one of these.

00:01:04.895 --> 00:01:07.205
Diya has six one dollar bills.

00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:08.888
And actually, let's draw it out.

00:01:08.888 --> 00:01:10.715
Diya has six one dollar bills.

00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:14.527
So that's one, two, three,

00:01:15.112 --> 00:01:19.464
four, five and six.

00:01:19.464 --> 00:01:21.112
And these are one dollar bills.

00:01:21.112 --> 00:01:23.910
So, one dollar bills.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.590
This is my rough drawing
of one dollar bills.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.773
Have to draw a lot of
one dollar bills here.

00:01:29.773 --> 00:01:33.302
So, she has six one dollar bills.

00:01:33.302 --> 00:01:35.932
She has three five dollar bills.

00:01:35.932 --> 00:01:37.586
Can we do that in a different color?

00:01:38.339 --> 00:01:41.489
So, three five dollar bills.

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:44.667
So one, so that's a five dollar bill.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.390
Two, that's a five dollar bill.

00:01:49.098 --> 00:01:51.917
And three five dollar bills.

00:01:53.517 --> 00:01:54.487
That little circle in ....

00:01:54.487 --> 00:01:56.385
That's supposed to be
the picture of someone.

00:01:56.385 --> 00:01:57.477
Let me make it clear

00:01:58.215 --> 00:02:01.428
these are pictures of folks.

00:02:01.428 --> 00:02:03.989
Of famous historical figures.

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:08.029
So, these are pictures of
famous historical figures here.

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:11.581
And then finally she
has one 10 dollar bill.

00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:13.589
One 10 dollar bill.

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:15.122
So one 10 dollar bill.

00:02:15.122 --> 00:02:17.072
So it's worth 10 dollars.

00:02:17.072 --> 00:02:20.601
A picture of a famous historical
figure right over there.

00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:23.120
So, how much money does she have in all?

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.513
Well, the six one dollar bills

00:02:24.513 --> 00:02:26.940
that's going to be six dollars.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.519
The three five dollar bills

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.730
that's going to be worth
five, 10, 15 dollars.

00:02:32.237 --> 00:02:34.826
So plus 15 dollars.

00:02:34.826 --> 00:02:36.370
And then the one 10 dollar bill.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.348
That's going to be worth 10 dollars.

00:02:38.348 --> 00:02:39.389
10 dollars.

00:02:39.912 --> 00:02:42.353
So, what's six plus 15 plus 10?

00:02:43.046 --> 00:02:44.629
Well, let's see, six plus fifteen

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.904
is going to be 21.

00:02:46.904 --> 00:02:51.049
21 plus 10 is going to
be equal to 31 dollars.

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.964
Is equal to 31 dollars.

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:54.586
And you could have also added it this way,

00:02:54.586 --> 00:02:56.426
You could have said 15

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:59.790
plus 10 plus 10

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.878
plus six plus six.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.809
Add them together

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:07.025
and we would have gotten five

00:03:07.025 --> 00:03:09.502
plus zero plus six is 11.

00:03:09.502 --> 00:03:11.457
That's one one and one 10.

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:13.244
And then you have three 10's here.

00:03:13.244 --> 00:03:15.763
So, 31 dollars.
