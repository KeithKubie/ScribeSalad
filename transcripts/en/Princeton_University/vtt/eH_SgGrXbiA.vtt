00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.940
DANIEL FLORYAN: My thesis
work is broadly on fish

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.750
swimming and understanding
how fish swim well

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.040
and how they swim fast.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.480
ALEXANDER SMITS: Daniel
is advised by myself

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.540
and also by Professor Rowley.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.640
And he's essentially doing two
or at least twice as much work

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.680
as most people do for a thesis.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.920
He's doing some very
interesting computational work

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.630
with Professor Rowley.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.940
And he's doing the
experiments with me.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.328
And it's a very symbiotic thing.

00:00:36.328 --> 00:00:37.870
We're talking about
the same problem,

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.670
but we can ask
different questions

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.833
using these different tools.

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:43.750
CLARENCE ROWLEY: So Lex
is a very accomplished

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.850
experimentalist, and
I have some experience

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.770
with simulations and theory.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.020
And this is a problem that
we'd already sort of agreed

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.115
to start working on.

00:00:51.115 --> 00:00:52.962
And Daniel was a grad
student who came to us

00:00:52.962 --> 00:00:54.420
and was interested
in this project.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.200
So in some sense, it was
a natural collaboration.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.170
DANIEL FLORYAN: So I
came in to Princeton

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.840
not knowing exactly what
I wanted to work on.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.910
I knew that I wanted to work
on fluid mechanics broadly,

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.170
which is what my thesis is on.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.000
And I knew that a
lot of the people who

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.940
work in the area of fluid
mechanics here are very good.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.560
But I didn't have a
specific topic in mind.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.100
So when I first came, I just
talked to all the people

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.110
who worked in fluid mechanics.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.170
And after having some good
conversations with them,

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.930
I found two people who were
working on the same project,

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:27.430
actually.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.880
And that was this
fish swimming project

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.880
that I'm working on now.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.470
And it was something
that really struck me,

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.660
because more than anything else
it's sort of curiosity-driven,

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.340
and that's what
really stuck to me.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.320
This is a computational
fluid dynamics simulation

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.760
of a virtual swimmer.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.620
Because of the movement
of this airfoil,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.980
it's pushing fluid out
faster in that direction,

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.800
accelerating in that direction.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.000
And so the fluid pushes
back on the airfoil

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.410
and propels it in
the other direction.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.635
So this is, again,
how swimming works.

00:01:59.635 --> 00:02:02.260
ALEXANDER SMITS: So he's broken
that down into some very simple

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.890
models and then been
able to say something

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.320
about what nature
is trying to do,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.080
but also how we might be able
to use that in an engineering

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.927
context.

00:02:11.927 --> 00:02:13.510
DANIEL FLORYAN: It's
really validation

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.300
that I'm doing something
interesting, something

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.630
of value, something
that not just

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.790
myself but other people
also find interesting too.
