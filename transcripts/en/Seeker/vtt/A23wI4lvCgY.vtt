00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.460
You unlock this world with a deep sea submersible.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.190
At 1000 meters you’re moving into a world
of both shadows and wet substance, of things

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:17.000
and stranger things, you have just crossed
into… the bathypelagic zone.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.329
Hello there land lubbers, Julian here for
DNews.

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:24.039
Until July 10, 2016 the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration ship Okeanos will

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.919
be over the deepest part of the Pacific ocean,
the Marianas Trench, working 24 hours a day

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.479
studying the ocean floor.

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:34.130
And luckily for you, you can watch the live
stream and have the chance to see creatures

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.130
no person has never seen before.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.860
They’ll be exploring areas of the ocean
past the point where a little light gets through,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.470
called the mesopelagic or “twilight” zone,
into a sea of constant darkness called the

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.180
bathypelagic or “midnight” zone.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.680
Most of the volume of the world’s oceans
is in the bathypelagic zone.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.410
Even deeper than that, from 4 km to 6 km down
is the abyssopelagic zone, aka “The Abyss.”

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.970
The Okeanos diving robots bottom out at 6
km in depth, where most of the seafloor is,

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.820
but the marianas trench can cut as deep as
11 km.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.420
When you look at the life forms at these depths,
the bathypelagic and abyssopelagic might as

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.859
well be another planet.

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:15.439
Giant isopods, viperfish, gulper eels, glowing
jellyfish, almost everything looks like a

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.249
nightmare or a fever dream.

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:21.229
Even shrimp that cluster around hydrothermal
vents are oddly pale and ghostly, why does

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.100
everything look so weird down here?

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.991
Well like all animals, their environment plays
a huge role in their evolution, and the deep

00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:30.359
sea is about as extreme an environment you
can find.

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:32.100
The biggest factor is the pressure.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.229
For every kilometer you dive down, pressure
becomes a hundred times greater than the air

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.549
pressure we experience on the surface.

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.010
That means at the ocean floor a body would
have to withstand 600 times the pressure it

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.010
would up here.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.290
To do that it helps to be flexible, with soft
bodies or cartilage that bends without breaking.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.369
More watery bodies keep them from compressing,
and it’s hypothesized that an elongated

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.240
shape would help organisms cope with pressure
too, which would explain the abundance of

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.200
eel-shaped fish in the depths.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.639
Flat rays would really feel the pounds per
square inch across their large area bodies.

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:06.639
The pressure even affects deep sea life at
a cellular level.

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:10.610
Their cell membranes need more unsaturated
fats to keep them liquid, otherwise their

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.230
walls would become crushed and frozen solid
and they wouldn’t function.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.280
Inside they have more organic molecules called
piezolytes, which bind to water and keep their

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.250
proteins from being distorted.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.080
Fish also need to find new ways to manage
their buoyancy down there.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.050
Gas bladders that fish near the surface use
would be crushed, so species develop workarounds.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.630
The blob fish’s flesh is gooey and low density.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.710
At depth the water crushes it into a workable
shape, but unfortunately for the blobfish

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.820
when we catch them and bring them to the surface
they puff out and become the poster child

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.310
for ugly animals.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.120
Other fish have fins so long they act as a
tripod, allowing them to stand on the ocean

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.120
floor.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.790
The long stilts sense vibrations and help
them catch prey.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.460
That’s another problem in the deep: food
scarcity.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.930
Since no light penetrates there is no plant
life.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.030
Everything either survives off falling dead
organic matter, chemicals coming out of occasional

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.510
plumes, or the rare other living organisms
they find.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.070
Unique hunting strategies are adopted, like
anglerfish that lure in prey with bioluminescent

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.070
light.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.840
They rely on ambush because it takes less
energy, and have slow metabolisms to stretch

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.040
out each meal.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.350
Anglers, viperfish and fangtooths have long
teeth that trap prey like a cage.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.240
Other fish use lights to confuse predators,
and some predators use lights to see, like

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.480
lanternfish.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.910
Many animals have given up on sight entirely
and may have non-functioning eyes or no eyes

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.910
at all.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.420
While it’s hard to see and find food this
deep, it’s even harder to find a mate.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.700
To overcome this, some fish are hermaphroditic,
so no matter what mate they bump into they

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.080
can reproduce.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.130
Anglerfish females release pheromones to attract
tiny males.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.490
When a male comes along, it attaches himself
to her, eventually fusing to her and providing

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.240
sperm in exchange for sustenance.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.280
It’s not a hospitable environment, but even
at these depths there is still life.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.140
Aside from the bizarre nightmare fish, there
are also, sponges, sea stars, squid, and crabs.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.760
No word on pineapple houses though.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.280
Even though there are lots of fish in the
sea, we’re still taking a pretty big bite

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.280
out of them.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:14.600
To learn about one proposed solution to overfishing
check out Trace’s video here.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.760
More people have been to the moon than the
bottom of the Marianas trench.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.780
So would you rather travel to the ocean floor
or the surface of the moon?
