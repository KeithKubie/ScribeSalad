00:00:00.476 --> 00:00:03.171
- [Voiceover] 1945 really
represents the final

00:00:03.171 --> 00:00:05.553
throes of World War II.

00:00:05.553 --> 00:00:09.528
In Europe, you might
remember, at the end of 1944,

00:00:09.528 --> 00:00:11.982
we have the Battle of the Bulge starting,

00:00:11.982 --> 00:00:14.429
which is an incredibly bloody battle.

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.813
The U.S. forces, which
kind of take the brunt

00:00:16.813 --> 00:00:20.903
on the Allied side, lose
roughly 20,000 troops,

00:00:20.903 --> 00:00:23.479
but by January, they're
able to break through

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:25.165
and invade Germany.

00:00:25.165 --> 00:00:28.285
So as you go into early 1945, the Allies

00:00:28.285 --> 00:00:30.796
are on their march
through Western Germany.

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:33.184
Now if you go on the east, the Russians

00:00:33.184 --> 00:00:36.684
or the Soviets are also marching westward.

00:00:38.694 --> 00:00:42.644
By January of 1945, they're
able to take Warsaw,

00:00:42.644 --> 00:00:45.347
and from there, they continue to march

00:00:45.347 --> 00:00:47.347
westward towards Berlin.

00:00:48.311 --> 00:00:50.545
Now the writing is on
the wall at this point.

00:00:50.545 --> 00:00:53.576
The Allies look like
they are going to win,

00:00:53.576 --> 00:00:56.415
and so they meet at
Yalta, the major powers,

00:00:56.415 --> 00:00:58.766
to discuss what happens to Europe

00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.426
after World War II.

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:01.969
What happens to Germany?

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.014
Is it split up?

00:01:03.014 --> 00:01:04.527
What influence will the different

00:01:04.527 --> 00:01:08.278
Allied victors have in
the different countries

00:01:08.278 --> 00:01:09.578
of World War II?

00:01:09.578 --> 00:01:13.817
So this is happening in
Yalta in February of 1945.

00:01:13.817 --> 00:01:15.100
Let me write that down.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.954
That's in February.

00:01:15.954 --> 00:01:17.238
All the while this is happening,

00:01:17.238 --> 00:01:18.713
even though the writing is on the wall

00:01:18.713 --> 00:01:20.265
that the Allies are going to win the war,

00:01:20.265 --> 00:01:21.854
they weren't taking anything for granted.

00:01:21.854 --> 00:01:24.761
They wanted to absolutely
force a surrender

00:01:24.761 --> 00:01:27.253
by the Axis powers in
Germany in particular.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:29.559
So they continue to firebomb major cities

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:31.960
of Germany, and firebombing
is an incredibly

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.809
devastating form of bombing, where you're

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:35.321
literally trying to destroy the city,

00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:36.770
set the city on fire.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.487
The most notable of these cities that

00:01:39.487 --> 00:01:42.021
were firebombed were Hamburg and Dresden.

00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:44.267
The firebombing of
Dresden, movies and books

00:01:44.267 --> 00:01:45.483
are written about it.

00:01:45.483 --> 00:01:48.236
The Nazis did also firebomb London,

00:01:48.236 --> 00:01:50.399
but that didn't have quite the same

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.081
devastating effect as
the Allied firebombing

00:01:53.081 --> 00:01:55.971
of Hamburg and Dresden, and actually

00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:58.233
of Tokyo and other Japanese cities,

00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:00.985
as we will see in a few minutes.

00:02:00.985 --> 00:02:02.918
But then everything really comes to a head

00:02:02.918 --> 00:02:04.335
in April of 1945.

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:09.761
It's in April that as you can see,

00:02:09.761 --> 00:02:11.160
as you get into April and May,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.723
the Allies are able to essentially

00:02:13.723 --> 00:02:16.490
occupy major chunks of Germany.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.823
They're able to push Axis forces

00:02:18.823 --> 00:02:20.176
outside of Italy.

00:02:20.176 --> 00:02:21.791
They have effectively won.

00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:24.522
Mussolini gets captured
and then gets executed.

00:02:24.522 --> 00:02:27.024
Soviets are able to take Berlin,

00:02:27.024 --> 00:02:30.143
and maybe most importantly, April 30th,

00:02:30.143 --> 00:02:32.291
Hitler commits suicide.

00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:34.807
So, Hitler commits suicide,

00:02:34.807 --> 00:02:36.441
and he's not the only one.

00:02:36.441 --> 00:02:38.444
Several other major leaders,

00:02:38.444 --> 00:02:40.800
Nazi leaders, commit suicide as we

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.508
go into this period right over here.

00:02:42.508 --> 00:02:44.384
Essentially the war is won in Europe

00:02:44.384 --> 00:02:46.476
at this point, and that's made official

00:02:46.476 --> 00:02:48.924
on May 8th, May 8th, which is a good

00:02:48.924 --> 00:02:51.440
day to remember, known as VE Day,

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.964
Victory in Europe, Victory in Europe Day.

00:02:54.964 --> 00:02:57.737
So the Allies have won in Europe,

00:02:57.737 --> 00:03:00.122
but everything is not over yet.

00:03:00.122 --> 00:03:03.925
World War II is still
going on in the Pacific.

00:03:03.925 --> 00:03:07.888
So let's go down to the Pacific Theater.

00:03:07.888 --> 00:03:10.305
Starting the year in January,

00:03:12.126 --> 00:03:15.071
the Allies are able to
take the Island of Luzon.

00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:18.478
In particular, they're
able to take Manila.

00:03:18.478 --> 00:03:21.811
Then, as we go into February, they began

00:03:22.892 --> 00:03:25.447
the invasion of Iwo Jima, which is

00:03:25.447 --> 00:03:28.612
an incredibly bloody campaign.

00:03:28.612 --> 00:03:31.744
You have 70,000 marines invade the island

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.859
verus 22,000 Japanese troops.

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.558
On top of that you obviously have air,

00:03:36.558 --> 00:03:38.559
you have the Air Force involved,

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:41.809
you have the Navy involved, but I guess

00:03:43.242 --> 00:03:44.644
what's even more mind-boggling, you have

00:03:44.644 --> 00:03:46.881
significant Allied deaths.

00:03:46.881 --> 00:03:49.431
You have 7,000 deaths on the Allied side,

00:03:49.431 --> 00:03:51.877
but even more amazing, out of the 22,000

00:03:51.877 --> 00:03:54.050
Japanese soldiers that were defending

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.700
Iwo Jima, 19,000 get killed.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.783
So 19,000 of 22,000 Japanese
soldiers get killed.

00:04:03.185 --> 00:04:05.451
So you can imagine how bloody this is.

00:04:05.451 --> 00:04:06.760
And this picture, which is probably

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.330
one of the most famous military photos

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.190
ever taken, especially
in the United States,

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.924
this was taken of Marines storming a hill,

00:04:13.924 --> 00:04:16.616
storming a mountain in Iwo Jima.

00:04:16.616 --> 00:04:18.680
And just to imagine how
bloody these things are.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.461
I just gave you some of the numbers.

00:04:20.461 --> 00:04:22.608
Even this photo, which
is a real photograph,

00:04:22.608 --> 00:04:24.222
even this photo, where it looks like

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:26.121
hey look, the Americans
have at least taken

00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:29.478
this mountain or this
hill right over here,

00:04:29.478 --> 00:04:31.912
even out of this photo,
three of these Marines

00:04:31.912 --> 00:04:34.080
die in the next few days as they continue

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.235
to try to take Iwo Jima
or take the entire island.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:39.633
So you can imagine the Japanese

00:04:39.633 --> 00:04:43.542
were able to mount a ferocious
defense of the island.

00:04:43.542 --> 00:04:46.743
They aren't able to fully take the island

00:04:46.743 --> 00:04:48.600
until we get into March.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.378
So by March, so maybe
I'll say February to March

00:04:53.378 --> 00:04:56.211
you have the invasion of Iwo Jima.

00:04:57.421 --> 00:04:59.237
Now the whole time that this is happening,

00:04:59.237 --> 00:05:02.080
you have B-29s firebombing major cities

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.215
in Japan, and especially Tokyo.

00:05:04.215 --> 00:05:07.167
So once again, these cities
are really being destroyed.

00:05:07.167 --> 00:05:09.140
This is all-out war.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.416
But still the Japanese
have not surrendered.

00:05:11.416 --> 00:05:15.905
So in April, actually
April going into June,

00:05:15.905 --> 00:05:18.518
you have to remember April in Europe,

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:21.706
this is when it was pretty much done with.

00:05:21.706 --> 00:05:23.880
Hitler commits suicide in April.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.951
But in April going into June of 1945,

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:30.340
you have the Allied invasion of Okinawa,

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.173
which once again, is an incredibly

00:05:34.263 --> 00:05:35.891
bloody campaign.

00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:37.974
You have above and beyond

00:05:39.141 --> 00:05:42.532
the tens of thousands of Japanese soldiers

00:05:42.532 --> 00:05:44.982
that get killed at Okinawa,

00:05:44.982 --> 00:05:47.521
you have tens and tens of thousands

00:05:47.521 --> 00:05:49.390
of civilians who get killed

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.102
or commit suicide.

00:05:51.102 --> 00:05:53.071
So once again, this is all

00:05:53.071 --> 00:05:55.738
very unpleasant and very bloody.

00:05:57.404 --> 00:06:00.754
But we continue on, and still the Japanese

00:06:00.754 --> 00:06:01.842
have not surrendered.

00:06:01.842 --> 00:06:04.457
Although even in 1944, their navy

00:06:04.457 --> 00:06:06.192
is all but destroyed,

00:06:06.192 --> 00:06:09.057
but they're mounting
this ferocious defense.

00:06:09.057 --> 00:06:12.844
In parallel to all of this, the Allies,

00:06:12.844 --> 00:06:15.772
especially the U.S., has
had the Manhattan Project

00:06:15.772 --> 00:06:19.081
to develop nuclear weapons, and they

00:06:19.081 --> 00:06:22.292
decide to use them,
Truman is now president,

00:06:22.292 --> 00:06:25.923
in order to accelerate the end of the war.

00:06:25.923 --> 00:06:28.506
And so in August 6th, they drop

00:06:30.824 --> 00:06:33.648
an atomic bomb on Hiroshima,

00:06:33.648 --> 00:06:36.437
essentially destroying that city.

00:06:36.437 --> 00:06:38.237
And it's interesting to read accounts

00:06:38.237 --> 00:06:40.502
of how the Japanese learned about it

00:06:40.502 --> 00:06:42.229
or what they didn't learn
about it, obviously.

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:44.737
Obviously no one was expecting bombs

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:46.544
that could just obliterate a city,

00:06:46.544 --> 00:06:48.780
literally, in seconds.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.539
Still, there wasn't a
surrender from the Japanese,

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:53.904
and so, let me write this.

00:06:53.904 --> 00:06:57.321
This is August 6th, and so on August 9th,

00:06:58.238 --> 00:07:01.831
you have another atomic
bomb dropped on Nagasaki.

00:07:01.831 --> 00:07:03.680
At the same time that this is happening,

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.430
you have the Soviet
Union invading Manchuria.

00:07:08.326 --> 00:07:11.961
You have the Soviet
Union invading Manchuria,

00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:13.183
and so enough was enough.

00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:14.656
You have the Soviets who are now getting

00:07:14.656 --> 00:07:17.215
involved in the Pacific, the Americans

00:07:17.215 --> 00:07:19.239
seem to be able to literally destroy

00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:21.806
Japanese cities at will,

00:07:21.806 --> 00:07:24.723
and so on August 14, 1945, you have

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:29.906
the Japanese surrender.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.340
Japanese surrender, and then this does

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.507
not become truly official
until September 2, 1945,

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.514
which is called VJ Day,
Victory in Japan Day.

00:07:45.514 --> 00:07:49.115
That marks the real end of World War II.

00:07:49.115 --> 00:07:51.114
Obviously, World War II ended at the end

00:07:51.114 --> 00:07:54.969
of April, May, officially
early May in Europe,

00:07:54.969 --> 00:07:57.409
but now in early
September it is officially

00:07:57.409 --> 00:07:59.174
ended in the Pacific as well.

00:07:59.174 --> 00:08:01.674
And the Allies are victorious.
