1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04,881 --> 00:00:07,550
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast. Yeah.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,803
Ah,

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,240
the chicken in on you.
I'm just checking in on you.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,610
So you know your week's going.
How are you holding up,

6
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:27,310
how you're handling today's
top stories in the news? Um,

7
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,790
I haven't seen much about
it, but I guess Nike, uh,

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,800
got on board with the colon.
[inaudible] Colin Kaepernick, right?

9
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:40,610
Say, hey, sometimes you gotta do this
to get debt, right? And then everybody,

10
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:44,760
you know, you know the deal, you
know, people are, it's like, Hey,

11
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,530
my point is about police brutality
and ever since nine 11 a bit.

12
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,420
Yes sir. Sir. We're
not talking about that.

13
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,300
No one is saying that your
brother is not over in Iraq.

14
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,220
He's talking about police brutality.
What,

15
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,890
where the fuck out of the country.

16
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,460
And that right there
is political discourse

17
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,820
in 2018,
you know,

18
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,910
not saying people listen back in
the day, but at least they, they,

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,030
they did a better job pretending.
You know what?

20
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:22,380
Where does Nike get off acting like
they give a fuck about people. You know,

21
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,630
if they really, you gave a shit
about people when they, uh,

22
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,470
have allowed that documentary exposing
their fucking sweatshops to air at some

23
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:32,860
point. Oh, shots fired and bill, if, uh,

24
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,840
if you gave a shit, wouldn't you not
be wearing a Nike shirt right now? Hey,

25
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:41,280
fair enough. We're all full of shit. Um,

26
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,140
Jesus Christ.
If I see one more fucking moron.

27
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,700
Yeah,

28
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:47,970
yeah.

29
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,970
No screaming about troops or nine 11 on
a subject that has nothing to do with

30
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:57,180
it.
Jesus fucking Christ.

31
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,670
It's a protest about police brutality.

32
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,090
He is allowed to do this.

33
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,860
The long allowed to misconstrue.
It's construe what he's saying, Dan.

34
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,460
You know,
but that's what it is.

35
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,190
I think that's what happened with
the Internet is now everything.

36
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,190
Even when it isn't about you,
it has to be about you.

37
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:20,840
Yeah.

38
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,030
You know, all of these fucking people,
you know what I mean? It's, it's, it just,

39
00:02:25,031 --> 00:02:26,500
it just be all of this shit,

40
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,880
this fucking shit you see on Instagram
with a person's acting like they're

41
00:02:30,881 --> 00:02:32,200
trying to inspire you.

42
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:36,160
When they're really just trying to show
you all the cars they have outside of

43
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:39,460
their fucking a giant
house with their abs.

44
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,630
You know the fuck was I
joking about that with,

45
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:47,410
I did the Bill Simmons podcast that
was joking about that. You know,

46
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,000
all these fucking celebrities always
telling you how hard they're working.

47
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,760
Yo, we out here grinding. It's
like everybody. Everybody is.

48
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,330
A lot of people weren't blessed. Most
people were not blessed with your gifts.

49
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,230
They're grinding does not fill an arena,
you know,

50
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,630
but there are really
good fucking carpenter,

51
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,570
but no one's going to sit there
and watch him frame of fuck.

52
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,370
While I guess you wouldn't
frame a house as a carpenter.

53
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,850
I finished copper numbers. I'm
thinking, what are you saying, bill?

54
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,390
That regular carpenters aren't as good as
finished carpenters? Well, I mean, yeah,

55
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,310
you can hide a lot of your
mistakes in the walls.

56
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,120
Hey,
my brother was a carpenter.

57
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,680
Um, he built a shack and I wreck,
that's not what I was talking about.

58
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,880
Ah,
I felt like yelling.

59
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,603
MMM.

60
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,460
Anyways,
I saw a little bit of it.

61
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,560
I saw somebody retweets something
and it was something about Fox News,

62
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:57,050
of course, trash and Kaepernick of
course saying he's not American. Uh,

63
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,790
and of course saying probably that,
you know,

64
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,270
he doesn't support the troops because
he's talking about police brutality.

65
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,690
Yeah.

66
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:13,230
Oh, the weather outside is frightful.
Um, so there you go. But um,

67
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,610
by all means, you know,
people, uh, you know,

68
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,490
don't burn your own property.
You know,

69
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,060
even if you don't like Nike's,
you could give it to a homeless guy.

70
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,950
And also when you burn that stuff,

71
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,090
you're just really polluting
your own environment. Yeah.

72
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,840
With all that rubber and God knows
what else is on the fucking sneaker,

73
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,030
what do you have to burn it? Why can't
you just throw them out or set them aside?

74
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,780
They always got to burn it.

75
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:45,570
I remember when Lane Kiffin lift
left fucking Tennessee in this guy.

76
00:04:45,571 --> 00:04:50,160
Somehow it's some lane Kiffin
Jersey and he like lit it on fire,

77
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,810
filmed it,
and then pissed on it.

78
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,010
Okay.
You run

79
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,850
up and leave and Tanner
steep or book in USC.

80
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,060
Uh, what do you think about
an American Corporation?

81
00:05:06,061 --> 00:05:09,450
Poisoning our own food supply.
What

82
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,700
are you going to let you cornflakes
on fire and then pee on him?

83
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,010
What are you and asked us,
what the fuck you talking about?

84
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:22,940
You Bald headed freckled
mother fucking Yankee cut.

85
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,620
Would the fuck you do now on here?

86
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,060
No southern guy ever said can't do.

87
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:30,350
They can if current and that's
how they'd say it. Good.

88
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,780
Um,
[inaudible]

89
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,350
why am I acting like it's everybody
down the south burning their Nike's?

90
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,563
I Dunno.

91
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,051
I don't know why.

92
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:47,870
There's not more people saying like
this was about police brutality.

93
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,580
You may or may not agree with it,

94
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,880
but to then try to make
it about something else,

95
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,940
which then leads you to burn your own
sneakers is probably not the direction you

96
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,910
want to go in. However,
that's not what you know.

97
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,680
But the thing is is if somebody is burning
their own sneakers and then you show

98
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:10,910
it on TV, like all of those channels
you have flipping through, right?

99
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:15,650
There's, there's the fucking the lawyer
chick, right? You flip the channel.

100
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,480
There's the, there's the Jack Ryan Guy.
You flip the channel is to Psi Phi.

101
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,470
You flip the channel.

102
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:24,890
There's a commercial you flip the channel
is a saga gave you flip the channel.

103
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,830
Somebody sneakers are on fire,
you're going, what the fuck is that

104
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,940
with somebody in those, when
those caught on fire, my God,

105
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,420
what? What? How do those sneakers catch
on fight fire and, but yet, you know what?

106
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,280
I think we cracked the code here.

107
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:44,870
People for anyone in Hollywood listening
to this, if you want to hit series,

108
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:49,850
you need fire. That'll make people
stop. But it's got to look real.

109
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,980
So in other words, you know, like
when you shoot without a permit,

110
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,600
you got to like light something on fire
without permission and then it'll look

111
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:00,590
real because it is real.

112
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,070
And if you can somehow capture the people
running out of whatever the fuck you

113
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:04,904
lit on fire,

114
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,800
then I think you could actually get people
to stop long enough and possibly sit

115
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:14,660
through some commercials that they
would allow your show to air for the

116
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,690
following week. So see, I
guess there is a silver lining

117
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,580
for the life of me.

118
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,580
I will never fucking understand people
that take it to that fucking level.

119
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,040
I get the UK, you're not agreeing. Well,

120
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,490
let's say you know it's about
police brutality, but you're like,

121
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:36,140
that's not the way to go about
protesting. Fine. I get that. Fair enough.

122
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:41,090
Good point to you sir or Madam. But when
like you take it to the point that like,

123
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:43,743
you know,

124
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,660
you're going to burn your shit

125
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,170
and then film it and then uploaded onto
the internet and no point during any of

126
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,430
that fucking process.

127
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,090
You like those sneakers when it was just
crying, children's sewing them together,

128
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:02,690
didn't you? You don't like
how fucked up. I mean, I mean,

129
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:06,950
how far back are we going to take
this? You know, if you really care.

130
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,083
All right,

131
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,090
Dan, you wouldn't buy those
things in the first place.

132
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:20,050
You'd be going down to the
fucking a sneaker factory
and given that little kid a

133
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,870
break and you'd sit down on the stool
and you'd fucking glue your shit together

134
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:27,890
yourself, wouldn't you, wouldn't you? Um,

135
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,020
I dunno. All I know is I'm sitting here
right now and I don't have the Internet.

136
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,960
I'm a 50 year old man. I don't have
the Internet. I don't know when.

137
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:40,930
I'm going to be able to upload this. Uh,
I once again upgraded my sister, you know,

138
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,110
my uh, buddy of mine was just telling
me, Greg Fitzsimmons just at his podcast.

139
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:46,220
I don't know when that's going to air.

140
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,590
Gee Cibele why are you doing
all these podcasts? Well,

141
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:52,760
cause I got some big tour dates coming
up in f is for family season three is

142
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:56,600
right around the corner.
The the fuckers done, man.

143
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,550
We're getting ready to start promoting.

144
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,233
MMM.

145
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:06,130
Well you bet. Promote [inaudible]
brought her over now ran.

146
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,630
Don't burn my sneakers.

147
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,250
I will burn my fucking sneakers.
Hey Nike,

148
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,200
I'll be watching.

149
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,170
Oh,
burning my fucking sneakers.

150
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:22,550
Don't make me burn my pole
over cause I'll fucking do it.

151
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,690
Yeah,

152
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,700
just do it. Yeah, I'll fucking do it.

153
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,180
I'll come over there like your
whole fucking factory on fire.

154
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,300
How dare you kneel during
the national anthem.

155
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:38,990
Yeah.

156
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,680
Do you have any idea how
disrespectful kneeling is?

157
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,140
Okay.

158
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,580
Whenever I go to church and pat,

159
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,780
she says everybody take their knees.
It's like, I will not disrespect God,

160
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,820
but getting on my fucking knees.

161
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,960
Everybody knows. If you
believe in Jesus, you stand up,

162
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:07,120
you go eyeball to eyeball with that
hip is some bitch and you see how you

163
00:10:07,121 --> 00:10:10,820
measure up.
You look at him in the eye.

164
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,110
Yeah,

165
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,560
maybe you're a little taller looking
down on them being like, Hey Jay,

166
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:16,930
okay,

167
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:21,490
fuck was up with that hooker man.
Or maybe you you,

168
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,630
you want them a little fellows but
with a big heart. Just keep coming,

169
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,690
knock them down.
Keep coming like a fucking wolverine.

170
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,680
Fucking Michigan Wolverines
is sponsored by Nike.

171
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,320
I'm going to go in there and
I'm going to burn all of them.

172
00:10:36,321 --> 00:10:38,900
Tight little yellow pants.
They run around it.

173
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,750
Ones that hug their
buttocks is in such a way,

174
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,680
I'm sorry people,
I don't have the Internet right now so I,

175
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,560
I can't look up anything about sports,

176
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:53,140
so you're just going to have to suffer
through another fucking 20 minutes of

177
00:10:53,141 --> 00:10:53,974
this.

178
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:55,170
Yeah.

179
00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:00,170
I'm contractually obligated to continue
running my fucking mouth for another 19

180
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:03,090
minutes.
The contract.

181
00:11:03,091 --> 00:11:06,990
I signed with myself kind of like with
Motley Crue signed that contract that

182
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:11,070
they were never going to tour again
because if they did then I guess they're

183
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,460
going to sue themselves.
That's how that works.

184
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:16,890
Okay.

185
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,760
I'm sitting here right now.
I am staring at a VCR DVD player

186
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,323
and uh,

187
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,580
I'm trying to find, you know,
I don't have the Internet.

188
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,390
I'm trying to find a fucking
radio shack or something.

189
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,130
Oh Jesus. What did I just
do? I can't hear myself.

190
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,150
I can't hear myself. There we go.
Now I can hear myself. You know,

191
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,060
I just literally just fucking bought
this shit and now it doesn't work. I,

192
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,830
you know what, I'm going to bomb
in a blame Colin Kaepernick.

193
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:52,960
Uh, anyways, the fuck if
somebody texted me here,

194
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,860
allow me Andrew through
this Goddamn podcast. Um,

195
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,050
yeah,

196
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,270
there's best buy. Still sell the shit
you need for that. Does anybody know

197
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,410
that's one of those things, man, when
you hang onto the old technology,

198
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:10,520
cause I got all my old standup tapes over
here on VHS. I converted most of them.

199
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,050
And then there's other
ones and it's just like,

200
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:16,220
I don't know what the fuck's only
shit before I go send it over there.

201
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,353
Well,

202
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,820
trying to think,
did I ever make a porno?

203
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,840
You gotta ask yourself before
you send your VHS tick,

204
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,080
you ever hear VCR man,
it's this new fangled fucking machine.

205
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:34,720
Yeah.

206
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,630
Is it put out by Nacky
cause I light it on fire.

207
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,943
MMM.

208
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,500
Some redneck is going to go
to a Chinese restaurant and,

209
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,400
and accidentally light one of
the people that are on fire,

210
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,953
you know,

211
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,490
because he's going to give him a tip
and he's going to be like, do you like,

212
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,380
you know,
you like,

213
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,170
and she's going to be I likey and then
he's going to think she said Nike and

214
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:06,730
then let's see that. See how that happens.
It's a slippery slope. Once you start,

215
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,020
did you start lighting shit on fire man?
Like you don't know where,

216
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,590
where's it going to stop?
I mean, maybe if you do it,

217
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,320
you start to like it, right? And
then the next time you wife's like,

218
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,840
could you take the trash out

219
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,680
and you're walking over their shoulders
slump looking down at the linoleum

220
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,080
defeated man.

221
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,350
You get like a foot away from the
trash and suddenly just remember

222
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,130
how good it felt.
Like your own sneakers on fire.

223
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,310
All of a sudden you lift at fucking
hit up proud first time in years

224
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,760
and you knew like,
you know what?

225
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,913
Yeah,

226
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,040
you want me to take this trash out?
You fucking bitch.

227
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,583
I'll take it out.

228
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,600
I'm allotted on fire and I'm a film it
and I'm going to put it on the Internet.

229
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,020
Yeah.

230
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,830
And then we'll see what damn sneakers
sale and motherfuckers say ban.

231
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:21,963
MMM.

232
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,050
16 minutes to go.

233
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,810
Oh Jesus.
Um,

234
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:35,250
the red sox are playing 500 ball.
When is Chris sale coming back?

235
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,600
I have no, he's the guy. He
is the guy that prevents us

236
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,380
from slice of fucking funny.
Everybody I told,

237
00:14:43,381 --> 00:14:46,120
you know I told those fuckers at ESPN,
they wouldn't listen to me. They don't,

238
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:46,340
they,

239
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,350
they are afraid to listen to this podcast
when they said the fucking Yankees got

240
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:54,620
swept. This fucking division
series is ober. Yeah,

241
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,730
he said that the first week of
fucking August. And what did bill say?

242
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,310
What did the balding freckled con to
never played baseball belong beyond the,

243
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,370
the minor or major leagues.
Okay.

244
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:12,430
Got kicked out of baseball because he
got a d in math in 19 fucking 79 was the

245
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:19,691
last time I played in an organized
league and even I could see it even I was

246
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:22,850
going, hey, wait a minute. ESPN.

247
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:24,970
Yeah,

248
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,110
there's like 60 fucking games left
and were up by nine and a half games.

249
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,180
I don't know what kind of fucking uh,

250
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,990
Muslim assets textbook you're looking at.

251
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,520
The numbers don't add up.
Um,

252
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:44,923
yeah,

253
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,440
we'll probably going
to win like 105 games.

254
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,090
I even know where the
fuck around right now.

255
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:54,560
Last I saw he's like 91 or 92 probably
go 500 for the rest of the fucking year.

256
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,740
You know, it's, it's never fucking Yogi
Berra said it's not over till it's over.

257
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,390
And he said that before there was
a wild card, a one game playoff,

258
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,670
19 fucking rounds of baseball.

259
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,570
He said that back when all you had to
do was win the fucking division and you

260
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,120
won the pennant and then you
had to win four more games.

261
00:16:14,121 --> 00:16:15,380
You won the world series.

262
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,810
Even that fucking guy

263
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,840
who essentially mocked mentally
challenged people his entire life with is

264
00:16:27,841 --> 00:16:29,460
planned out.
Goofy segs,

265
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,583
right?

266
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,080
Playing Glib the whole time, like a hot
chick trying to get some free drinks.

267
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,520
Never figured out what that
guy's angle was. Even he said,

268
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:44,300
it ain't over until it's over.

269
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,120
Who said what first

270
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,293
fine

271
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,420
sounded like Abbott and Costello who said
it ain't over till it's over first or

272
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:59,440
like what came first that or it
ain't over until the fat lady sings,

273
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,333
right.

274
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,460
Everybody knows if you want
to hear somebody could sing,

275
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:10,850
you got to get a fat
woman, right? Fat Woman,

276
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:14,990
fat woman listen to, we're saying, right.

277
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,060
Isn't that that theme song?
And they come walking out,

278
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,290
they always had some sort of flair
on for a code or some sort of, uh,

279
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,153
some sort of,

280
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,460
I dunno what something but
dazzle coming out day with,

281
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,010
they have fat feet fucking

282
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,860
just all squeezed into those little pumps.

283
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,320
Hello. Shayle Kann. Who? E. Right? Singing
the shit out of the national anthem.

284
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,520
Why would they sing at the end
of the game? You know why? I bet.

285
00:17:45,521 --> 00:17:50,290
Because they didn't have fucking jumbo
trons back in the day. You don't see,

286
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,480
everybody's just walking out and all
you could hear was the sound of fucking

287
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,850
people stepping on empty peanut shells.

288
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,610
Just Racist Shit right there to stop
people from being racist to each other to

289
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:04,230
get them out of it.
And that's just the white people

290
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,250
you fucking day best. I mean,
you a fucking Irish bastard.

291
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,760
Fuck you're,
you're fucking Daigo right back there.

292
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,320
When like the Irish and the Italians,

293
00:18:17,321 --> 00:18:19,690
like white people were like
racist against each other,

294
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,960
Polish people,
all of that shit.

295
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,630
They needed to keep them calm when
they walked out of the ballpark.

296
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,050
So then they just had some fat
lady come waddling out there.

297
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:33,840
Everybody could laugh at her
going, well, you know what?

298
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:38,430
I might have fucking tuberculosis release.
My feet aren't oozing out of my shoes.

299
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,100
Then she'd get out there singing
and our man, hey, how I lobby our,

300
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,360
I'm five foot two are

301
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,243
[inaudible] girl.

302
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:51,470
Okay.

303
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,230
Everybody just put on their
fucking derbies and they walked up.

304
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,500
Yeah,

305
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,540
take me out to the ball game.

306
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:03,290
Take me back to my neighborhood where
everybody looks like me and we fucking

307
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,580
cabbage for three cars where I rich
people in the Irish section of they'll

308
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:09,720
fucking town.

309
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,490
Keep your pasty freckled fucking
ass in your own neighborhood. Right.

310
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:20,070
So weird how they glorify that, that
error in sports. A simpler time.

311
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:25,830
The good old days or baseball.
They tell it two different ways.

312
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,090
They're either,
you have like that,

313
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:31,020
that version we're Billy crystal talks
about going to the Yankees game and

314
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:34,500
seeing Mickey Mantle or
they do the real shit,

315
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,950
the Jackie Robinson story
that it's just like, oh, okay.

316
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,640
And all in that see exact
same fucking footage.

317
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:44,790
Other than that black cat being
thrown on the field. Other than that,

318
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:50,420
it's all the exact same footage and how
you're viewing it has less to do with

319
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:54,450
what they're saying and more to do with
the music that they play underneath it.

320
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,220
11 minutes to go.
I don't have my rewrite now.

321
00:20:04,221 --> 00:20:07,940
I'd be reading my fucking advertising
and I could get through this part,

322
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,430
but I don't fucking have it.

323
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,290
By the way. Butcher box. You're welcome.

324
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,740
I have blown up heritage bread.
Pork.

325
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,210
Okay.

326
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,390
I blown it up. I brought,
I brought it back.

327
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:30,670
It was so fucking far gone.
People didn't even know it was missing.

328
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:33,640
I had never heard, I been eating
pork chops my entire fucking life.

329
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:40,230
Bacon,
Ham and cheese sandwiches got older.

330
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,810
I moved to New York. I was introduced
to a Cuban sandwich. Right.

331
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,170
All of that fucking

332
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,950
what do they got their welcome
whenever I think I got to go fucking

333
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,910
cause you're dumb bill.
Oh that's probably it.

334
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,330
Pork Butt, right? Pork shoulder.

335
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,590
Is it really the acid of the pig and
they just say pork shoulder cause they

336
00:21:06,591 --> 00:21:09,410
don't want you to be reminded, you
know they do say rump roast, right?

337
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,290
Hey all you guys out there burning
your sneakers. You know, you know,

338
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:18,850
you know you also have like
an apocalypse like game plan.

339
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,680
You know what I mean?
You like Bill Walsh,

340
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:26,681
she calling all the plays in the first
half and I'm just fucking showing up and

341
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:29,450
I'm not even gonna know what
the fuck's gonna hit me. Right.

342
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,220
I am an apocalypse plant to
die within the first hour.

343
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,600
Ah, Shit. That's that. I mean,
that is the ultimate plan,

344
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,160
you know, cause then I, then
I get to be a ghost. Right.

345
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:53,330
And I'm already as white as one.
Right. That might be my, my disguise.

346
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,890
The freckles would give me away.

347
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,623
MMM.

348
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,010
No, you die within the first hour and
then you just hang around. You want,

349
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:07,550
you know, like, remember Patrick
Swayze and uh, Moondance,

350
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:12,030
whatever that fucking movie was called,
our hair to Tam or

351
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,720
a dad or not judged with this chick
and her knows that she chose to change.

352
00:22:25,571 --> 00:22:28,810
You knew way. That was weird. Um,

353
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,540
ghost Jesus Christ.
I said I wanted to be a fucking ghost.

354
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,250
Yeah, I remember that. When
he would look up at the light.

355
00:22:38,251 --> 00:22:42,990
Evidently you have an option when you
die. All right? If you go into hell,

356
00:22:42,991 --> 00:22:45,180
you don't have an option.
You just get manhandled.

357
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,270
Look like you grabbed some
chicks ass at the club.

358
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:53,250
These fucking Damon's just come up
and they just grab you and then that's it.

359
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:58,290
But if you lived a good life,
if you took out their trash,

360
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,800
I guess you could look up at the light
and God gives you the option and be like,

361
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,040
hey man, you want to come
behind the velvet rope? Or like,

362
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:16,180
do you just want to fucking, you want to
be a voyeur for awhile? I'm not judging,

363
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:20,440
dude. This isn't going to go against
your record. Okay, you done good.

364
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,330
You did good enough to get up here.

365
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,720
You know there's another train
coming in in a couple of weeks.

366
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,900
If you want to just fucking hang around,
you mean you got to hang around, right?

367
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,740
You've got to go Tom Sawyer and hang
out at your own funeral. That'd be,

368
00:23:32,741 --> 00:23:34,960
that'd been no funerals
at the fucking apocalypse.

369
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:36,280
There'll be the old school once

370
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,140
they fucking dig up
fucking foot and a half

371
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,070
foot and a half trench deep trench.

372
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,090
You just hope they don't see anything
sparkling in the dirt or they're just

373
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:53,350
going to leave you out in the open
and keep digging. Is that uranium,

374
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,380
you know it's going to have an easy time
during the apocalypse is going to be

375
00:23:59,381 --> 00:24:01,660
the hipsters cause they're already like,

376
00:24:01,661 --> 00:24:04,300
they already have the
fucking grizzly Adams beard,

377
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,020
so let's stay warm in the winter.
They're already, you know,

378
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:12,010
they know how to make like their own
jam and fucking bear in the bathtub like

379
00:24:12,011 --> 00:24:14,920
all this old school stuff. Some of them
know how to make their own clothes.

380
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,780
Like I think hipsters are going to be,

381
00:24:16,781 --> 00:24:19,480
I think they're going to be all right
and we're all going to be like, wow.

382
00:24:19,481 --> 00:24:20,314
You know what?

383
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:25,070
I remember I wanted to fight that kid
cause he told me that he's learning how to

384
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:27,660
be a blacksmith,
you know,

385
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:33,240
and the other kid was building a steam
ship and then all of a sudden the

386
00:24:33,241 --> 00:24:35,370
apocalypse is going to happen.
You'd be like, you know something.

387
00:24:35,371 --> 00:24:37,170
Those are some skills
I wish I had right now.

388
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:45,090
Oh Jesus Christ. This is like
the longest fucking podcast ever.

389
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:51,450
Okay, five minutes to go. Jesus
Christ, five minutes left.

390
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,720
Um, I'm going to be in
Sacramento this weekend.

391
00:24:57,721 --> 00:25:00,900
Everybody know north of Sacramento.

392
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,580
I'm doing a casino up there
with a rose bowl tailgate.

393
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,830
Less legend.
Jason Lawhead,

394
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,910
master flat top grill,

395
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,790
Shep master smoker
math.

396
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,150
You put them on a green egg.

397
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,470
A fucking a standard fucking grill

398
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,080
demand is going to [inaudible] going
to make something. He just makes,

399
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:30,630
he makes everyone around him
better with like, you know,

400
00:25:30,631 --> 00:25:34,890
it'd be like if you just add that player
that causes everybody to elevate their

401
00:25:34,891 --> 00:25:38,520
game. The second we added Jason
Law, head to the fucking tailgate,

402
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:43,720
everybody had a few more
beers, right? Everybody?

403
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,690
Uh, I dunno. Eight a
little bit more everybody.

404
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,860
Everybody just took it a little bit more
and we got an extra room for the first

405
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:49,491
time ever.

406
00:25:49,491 --> 00:25:54,270
We made it to the playoffs
of arguably the top whatever,

407
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,250
400 tailgates and our section though,
there's some people that throw down, man,

408
00:25:59,251 --> 00:26:02,640
they bring like satellite dishes
and shit and like TVs, you know.

409
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:04,560
But I'm telling you,
you want to,

410
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:08,970
you want to bring the fucking
flat top fucking grill.

411
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,700
All right?
But the Goddamn propane tank,

412
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,020
none of that shit squat and around with
your little firebox trying to get the

413
00:26:17,021 --> 00:26:20,890
coals burning and all of that shit.
Fuck that.

414
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,590
You just turn on the
gas week weekly Click,

415
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,230
let that fucking thing heat up.
Drink a bloody Mary.

416
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:35,560
And next thing you know fucking you making
yourself an egg sandwich with bacon.

417
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:41,370
Oh, delicious. Toasting up your egg mic.

418
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:46,200
Yeah, you're fucking Yah, Yah. English
muffins. That's just breakfast.

419
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,710
Now you've moved onto whiskey,
right?

420
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,330
It's fucking per,
I got the flat top going over a

421
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:59,870
over Labor Day. And by the way,
I'm telling you, I made the,

422
00:26:59,871 --> 00:27:04,520
I made the practice burger. I took it
right out of the fridge and I was like,

423
00:27:04,521 --> 00:27:08,600
you know, I should have fucking
had this been room temperature,

424
00:27:08,601 --> 00:27:12,890
but I don't have the time. And I
threw it on. I did five minutes,

425
00:27:12,891 --> 00:27:16,780
both sides. I made sure it was nice
and thin or whatever. Um, it was,

426
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,100
I guess a little too
thick and I took it off.

427
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,920
Had a nice crunch to it and everything,
but when I got to the middle,

428
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,790
it was like rare.
So I was like,

429
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:30,440
well thank fucking God. I didn't,
by the way, I ate it still.

430
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,750
I still ate it.
Fucking hamburger in the middle.

431
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:36,530
It was like the consistency of
bubblegum and a very dangerous,

432
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:37,730
very dangerous thing to do.
You can,

433
00:27:37,731 --> 00:27:41,300
you can get away with that with steak
because you just fucking with one steer at

434
00:27:41,301 --> 00:27:44,480
that point. But hamburger is just like
a million stairs, you know what I mean?

435
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:48,110
That's like, you know, eat that raw.
That's like going rob with a porn star.

436
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,630
You have no idea how many
people you just fucked.

437
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,820
So I took the meat out of the fridge,
got it at room temperature,

438
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:59,870
and then I did six minutes
on both sides and uh,

439
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,570
got nothing but compliments. So
there, there's a little tip for you.

440
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:07,430
This little tip that I learned from
a pro chef is you got to get up the,

441
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:10,700
you've got, you've got to hit a
fucking breakfast ball. All right?

442
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,740
You got to make one for yourself.
You make the mistake on your own.

443
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,420
All right. If I just took all that
meat out and just throw it on there,

444
00:28:20,421 --> 00:28:23,990
everybody would have had bubble gum in
the middle of fucking raw meat in the

445
00:28:23,991 --> 00:28:24,920
middle of their burgers.

446
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,330
They'd have to take the fucking buns off
and all of that messy shit and I'd have

447
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:34,250
to put it back on and everybody would be
looking at me like my balls just rolled

448
00:28:34,251 --> 00:28:35,600
off the fucking porch.

449
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:41,040
What kind of a man doesn't know
how to cook over and open flame?

450
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:42,643
Huh?

451
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,780
That's what they would be saying.
Nope. Didn't say that about me

452
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,580
because in private when no one was around,

453
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,810
I failed miserably.
Okay,

454
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,170
well that's one to grow on for the
love of God. Is that 30 minutes.

455
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,790
Ah, 29 minutes. One minute to go.
People. What have we learned here?

456
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,850
We've learned that bill
can do a southern accent.

457
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:12,980
We've learned that anytime anybody's
dumb built as a southern accent,

458
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,080
we've learned that bill has
watched dirty dancing and ghost.

459
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:25,750
And, uh, I think I did an
advertisement for eating pigs and,

460
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,530
uh,
putting them on a flat top grill.

461
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,750
I don't know what else she
fucking need out of this. Um,

462
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:35,410
at some point this will be uploaded.

463
00:29:35,411 --> 00:29:37,900
And the next thing you're
going to listen to his, uh,

464
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:40,930
audio of me on my cell phone,
probably reading

465
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:45,640
that should have already been read at
this point when I wrapped it up. Um,

466
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:47,440
on Saturday,

467
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:53,070
this Saturday I'll be at the Toronto Film
Festival for the Premiere of the front

468
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:58,720
runner star in Hugh Jackman,
who's already getting Oscar buzz.

469
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:04,510
Uh, it's going to be very exciting
to be a, to be that close man,

470
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,350
to be that close to the,
the biggest trophy out here in Hollywood.

471
00:30:08,351 --> 00:30:12,400
And I ain't talking about your third wife.
There's a southern accent again.

472
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,553
MMM.

473
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,570
Yeah. It's going to be,
this is going to be cool.

474
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:22,630
I am so fucking psyched and feel so
lucky that I got to be in that movie.

475
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,780
Everybody knows seeing the trailer,
except everybody who listens to this,

476
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:28,070
who will now write negative shit,
hip,

477
00:30:28,071 --> 00:30:32,870
all have positive things to say about it.
And um,

478
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:38,980
like I said, don't blink. If you blink,
you're gonna miss me, but you will not.

479
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,850
And I guarantee you will
not miss my mustache.

480
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,590
All right, that's it. Have a great
weekend. You can't enjoy the reads.

481
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,890
A little bit of music and then I'm going
to give you another 30 minutes for free.

482
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:55,120
A greatest hits from a Thursday
afternoon just before Friday,

483
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,080
Monday morning podcast from a month,
uh, for our Thursday earlier this year,

484
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,470
years ago. I have no idea. I
forget how the system works.

485
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:08,110
Don't talk to me about it.
All right, that's it. I'll
see y'all later. All right,

486
00:31:08,111 --> 00:31:12,400
time for the advertising. Speak
of the devil. It's butcher box.

487
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:13,751
What's your box?

488
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:18,751
Delivers healthy 100% grass fed
and grass finished beef free range,

489
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:21,700
organic chicken and heritage breed pork.

490
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:26,110
The incredible quality of butcher box
meets starts with the commitment to

491
00:31:26,111 --> 00:31:31,111
raising animals humanely and free of
antibiotics and hormones before they're

492
00:31:31,361 --> 00:31:35,380
slaughtered. Each box comes with at
least eight to 11 pounds of meat,

493
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:38,890
which is enough for 24
individual sized meals. Lsu,

494
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,080
Rafat bastard or a competitive eater.

495
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:46,090
You can choose from five different
box types. All beef, beef and chicken,

496
00:31:46,091 --> 00:31:47,830
beef and pork mixed box.

497
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:52,860
Custom box lets you choose your own cuts
there for $20 off your first box in two

498
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:58,760
pounds of free ground brief and every
box for the rest of your life. So, uh,

499
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,790
for the rest of life of your
subscriptions, here's me,

500
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:06,090

501
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,120

butcher box subscribers,

505
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:28,090
All right, who's next? Oh, it's
him. H I. M. S. Here's a problem.

506
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,840
66% of their men lose their hair by age.

507
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:33,940
35 js is,

508
00:32:33,941 --> 00:32:37,450
I got past 35 without that
then it was all downhill.

509
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,160
Thing is when you start to hair loss.
It's too

510
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,790
late. It's easy to keep the hair you have
than to replace the here you've lost.

511
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:49,070
Is that a hairline slowly starting
to move backward. Any bald spots yet?

512
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:53,510
How will you feel a year from now
if it's business as usual up there?

513
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:58,370
Why the guys turned to weird solutions
or do nothing when they could turn to

514
00:32:58,371 --> 00:33:00,800
medicine and science.
I feel like they're insulting me here.

515
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,860

526
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,810

530
00:34:00,441 --> 00:34:03,380
if they took me under their wing and
they got me all my fucking hair back,

531

how weird would that be? Uh, do it before.

564
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:18,240
How excited are you that
football is officially back?

565
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,850
Oh, this is the greatest time
of year. It's Jagan in La.

566
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,800
It's starting to get colder at night.
I love it. I'm actually, I, you know,

567
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,340
I know there's all these new rules
and they could barely hit each other.

568
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,120
Oh my God, I don't see, I don't even care
if it's flag football. It's football.

569
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,063
I'm sorry.

570
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:41,050
Is this the best football into
Halloween and Thanksgiving?

571
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,190
Christmas. I love it.
Favorite time of year.

572
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:47,310
Honestly, Sean, it's the
feeling I get when I, uh, when
I give myself a little, uh,

573
00:36:47,311 --> 00:36:52,190
abstinence from the old medication and
then I get to indulge again in that,

574
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,920
that first like sinking into the couch.
That's football for me. I'm, I'm stoked.

575
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:59,010
It's back comfort food,
baby. It is so great.

576
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:02,550
I feel like they scared us a little bit
in the a week two and week three of the

577
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:05,540
preseason. They were just
flagging everything. Any, any, uh,

578
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:08,760
guy lowers his helmet even though he's
got his head up trying to hit him right

579
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:09,594
in the chest.

580
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,020
They're throwing a flag and then all
of a sudden week for the preseason,

581
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:17,790
all those flags dried up. I have
a feeling when it comes. Yeah,

582
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,710
Thursday night we'll see.

583
00:37:19,711 --> 00:37:24,150
Very few of those penalties actually
called because the refs are just as big a

584
00:37:24,151 --> 00:37:27,420
fan of football as us and they know it'll
just kill the game if they do it all

585
00:37:27,421 --> 00:37:28,700
the time.
I think they should.

586
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:33,370
They'll rent the rest, stop making that
call. It's the top talent to do it.

587
00:37:33,371 --> 00:37:37,930
This is the deal. At some point,
if the game's going to continue,

588
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:40,060
you're just going to
have to sign a release.

589
00:37:40,061 --> 00:37:42,580
If you want to play this
at a professional level,

590
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,700
these are the risks and
they're going to make you like,

591
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:48,340
they're probably drawing
up that contract right now.

592
00:37:48,341 --> 00:37:52,390
You can never come back and
sue us. I mean, look, if, if,

593
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:57,690
if this state or the federal government
can put you in jail for like 30 years

594
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:02,140
and then realize they screwed up and the
only way they let you out as you can't

595
00:38:02,141 --> 00:38:06,290
sue them. I'm sure the NFL
can draft something. Yeah.

596
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,430
These for these people, that belt,
they'll come up with something.

597
00:38:09,431 --> 00:38:11,080
So I think the game will be okay.

598
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:14,320
Yeah. The same people who drew up
the warnings for cigarettes now,

599
00:38:14,321 --> 00:38:18,040
the Philip Morris guys, they'll meet up
with the NFL, they'll figure it out. Hey,

600
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:21,640
you just got to put this warning on the
helmet. You know, we'll still be good.

601
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:25,180
Yeah, come on. It was great.
It did feel like this, uh,

602
00:38:25,181 --> 00:38:30,181
this college football weekend leading
into the NFL was almost a kind of a warmup

603
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,480
or play baby.
Yeah.

604
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:35,120
Did you watch football?
Because football has been like,

605
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:38,770
it's just been what it's been all
about man for the last few years.

606
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:40,510
Like it's just,
it's so exciting.

607
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,500
And then they finally figured out not
to have all those like just a hundred

608
00:38:44,501 --> 00:38:46,300
cupcake games.
You know,

609
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:50,080
like I remember back in the day when
you would gamble and like in like, uh,

610
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:50,861
September,

611
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:55,861
like Nebraska would be favored by 58
over Kent State and then they'd cover,

612
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,830
it was like ridiculous. Um, but now
there was smart enough where they had,

613
00:38:59,831 --> 00:39:01,420
they had the Michigan Notre Dame game,

614
00:39:01,421 --> 00:39:05,170
they had Lsu Miami that the Florida state
game last night. I missed all of that.

615
00:39:05,171 --> 00:39:09,910
I was doing some daddy labor
day stuff with the family.
I missed that one. But, um,

616
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,710
I,
I absolutely,

617
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:16,940
I love college football as much as I
love pro so much to my wife's Chagrin my

618
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,700
entire weekend and this
weekend I'm actually in
Sacramento and then I got to go

619
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:24,090
to the Toronto Film Festival.
Uh,

620
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:28,720
so I'm missing Saturday football and
I'm flying home during the one o'clock

621
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,020
games. So there's going to be a lot
of Dvr and going on in my house.

622
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,690
Oh, that's my favorite thing.
Every season is the, uh,

623
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,900
really football's back already.
It's only August,

624
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,240
wasn't it?
Just the draft.

625
00:39:41,241 --> 00:39:45,070
What happens then you've got the
combine and then you just go, hey honey,

626
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:48,980
what are the real housewives?
In the off season. Exactly.

627
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:53,570
The Bachelor is a full time sport.
Like you know the NFL should be as well.

628
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,310
Yeah. That, that Andy Cohen show,

629
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:59,340
that's their sports center where they
hit those women all stirred up again.

630
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,850
What about on this play,

631
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,540
which you said you're barren
and you couldn't have children.

632
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:07,440
They start yelling at each other.
It's like watching a round the horn.

633
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,520
Yeah, it does. It does.

634
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:15,220
It cougars in the pacing of a studio
show cause they bring up game film.

635
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:18,480
They're breaking it down. What are,
you know they have former players,

636
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,460
former bachelor's weighing in turning
point. Madden telestrator over there.

637
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:24,300
That's great.

638
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,680
That's the only way I could,

639
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,600
I had to like get like look at my
wife's perspective and just be like,

640
00:40:30,601 --> 00:40:32,130
this is just her sports center.

641
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,310
And then I was able to kind of relax
and then I really look at a lot of the,

642
00:40:35,311 --> 00:40:39,360
you know, it's a lot of the sports chatter
out there. It's just so ridiculous.

643
00:40:39,361 --> 00:40:42,480
It's like somebody like me who's not even
connected to it. Just be, I'll tell you,

644
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:45,660
I'm really concerned about our middle
release, you know, talking baseball.

645
00:40:45,661 --> 00:40:46,530
It's like,
oh,

646
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:50,070
are you somebody who never played
beyond not getting picked in gym class,

647
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,870
but we thing is always funny. Sean's a
big fan of doing that with the eagles.

648
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:59,070
I do enjoy the I, you know,
we're, we're going to win it
all this year. It is a way,

649
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:02,600
because if you don't win,
you get all this crap.

650
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:07,250
You guys saw that show you are blah,
blah, blah. Then all of a sudden you win.

651
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:10,490
And then the other guy's like, oh,
we're easy. They apply. You didn't play,

652
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,590
but what do you mean? Yeah, when I,

653
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:16,370
when I wake up Monday and eagles got
their ass kicked, I'm fucking depressed.

654
00:41:16,371 --> 00:41:20,300
All right. I have to live with that.
These guys, that's just a job for them.

655
00:41:20,301 --> 00:41:22,430
This is my fucking life.
So yeah, I might drop

656
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:26,310
and people give you shit
saying you guys suck.

657
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:31,140
You guys show Philly's a bunch of losers
and then all of a sudden if you win

658
00:41:31,141 --> 00:41:35,720
every that, that's, that's when you know,
you want to gain. When people say, oh, we,

659
00:41:35,721 --> 00:41:39,050
it's not weird. It's like, oh, we must
have something that, that you resent.

660
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:42,940
Yes, exactly. All right, well,
perfect transition bill. We, uh,

661
00:41:42,941 --> 00:41:46,600
we picked up a couple of games here
to break down with you. Of course,

662
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,760
all the spreads come in from our
official partner in my book. He died a g,

663
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,440
he's that Promo code bill beds for
a hundred percent deposit bonus.

664
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,140
First game opening game of the season.

665
00:41:56,141 --> 00:42:01,141
Atlanta falcons heading into Philadelphia
right now it's looking like eagles

666
00:42:01,211 --> 00:42:04,480
minus two and a half. I think it
opened at like three and a half.

667
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,800
It was up to four when it sounded like
when's was playing now whence is out

668
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,070
foals. His name to starter. Which
way you lean in on this game.

669
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,163
Ah,

670
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,850
I, you gotta take the Eagles
at home. I know. I, you know,

671
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:22,040
they're going to be raising the flag.
Every one's going to be going nuts.

672
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:26,690
Half the crowd will be in that
little jail. They have. Um, I,

673
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,450
Huh. I, it's, it is, it's still the eagle.

674
00:42:31,451 --> 00:42:35,650
So those should win this game, but there's
still, until they, in that second one,

675
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,890
this is still the still angels on earth,

676
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:41,860
but I'm going to take the
eagles at home considering, uh,

677
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:47,250
nick falls at a pedestrian 300 yards in
the Superbowl compared to Tom Brady's

678
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:53,580
500 yards and losing, which
will never be broken. Does it

679
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,700
again,
thank you so much for bringing this up.

680
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:01,510
I go at it with Patriots fans who say
that Brady had a better game, that false.

681
00:43:01,511 --> 00:43:06,511
Now Brady had an amazing game and you
can't obviously knock Brady's play at all,

682
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:11,860
but in that particular game I would say
nick foals out played him because of the

683
00:43:11,861 --> 00:43:16,210
couple of key plays foals made and the
limiting of the turnovers and Brady

684
00:43:16,211 --> 00:43:17,044
obviously.
Yeah,

685
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:22,370
Sean's defensive of Nick fold is a
passion of mine and Brady obviously.

686
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:25,360
What? Well, no, and then the fumble,

687
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:29,470
that kind of turned the game at
the end in on the other side,

688
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,590
you've got nick foals driving down to
get a touchdown. Now. I'm not trying to,

689
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:33,903
I'm up to

690
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:38,930
Tom Brady's not a running back.
He's like shifty one years old.

691
00:43:38,931 --> 00:43:42,520
If you don't block it, he gets
tackled. He had that one fumble, dirty,

692
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:45,200
true for 500 yards.
If you're really going to put that,

693
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:50,030
it was our defense defense. What's
the problem on both sides of the ball?

694
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:54,110
Catch the ball. Nick false came out
like it was a regular season game.

695
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:57,650
He wasn't nervous. Tom Brady's
Tom Brady, false offenses,

696
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:02,090
played great defense defenses
on both teams. Sucked.

697
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:07,140
Sucked. The only thing was the eagles
sucked a little less than he goes.

698
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,710
Basically the eagles made the only,

699
00:44:09,711 --> 00:44:14,270
I think defensive play the game, you
know, it's all I'm saying. Listen,

700
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:17,870
you started this shit sitting
there congratulating you. Hey,

701
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:19,050
if you're going to say like,

702
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,180
but that is like like
some ESPN shit to say

703
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:29,000
somebody close to 500 yards
and they're the problem. They,

704
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:32,010
I think they're all kind of
offs. Yeah. Tom didn't have the

705
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,550
magic. No. I, at this point it's my,
it's probably my second favorite sport.

706
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:39,480
Watching Sean talk about how nick falls
had a better game than Tom Brady and the

707
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,330
, and to be clear, Tom
Brady had an amazing game.

708
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,960
The reason the patriots lost was because
they couldn't stop anyone on defense.

709
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,170
That's, that's what I'm
coming. Really what you're
bringing it full circle for us.

710
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:52,400
Nick is going to suck like he has
the rest of his career and the,

711
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:54,573
I don't think that's good,

712
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,360
but also like eagles couldn't
stop the patriots either.

713
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,580
They stopped the one fucking to do. There
was like two punts the whole game. Yeah.

714
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,473
Yeah.
It was crazy.

715
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,600
There's no talking shit about what your
defense did in that game other than we

716
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:11,520
made one play that they would like the
offense was it? It was the weirdest.

717
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,310
I can't watch it because
it's too still too close,

718
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:18,950
but I have to go back and watch it. It's
the weirdest fucking game. I mean that's,

719
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:19,501
that's,
that's,

720
00:45:19,501 --> 00:45:22,350
that's some shit that happens that
like division three high school,

721
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,470
but it's like two pumps in a game.
You look like a big game.

722
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:28,980
It was really a, it was, it was bizarre.

723
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:34,410
And it started off with what's his
face is like, like, like crying,

724
00:45:34,411 --> 00:45:37,440
like he's at a funeral
that Malcolm Butler.

725
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:40,900
Oh Man, what did he do? What did
he do? I guess we'll never find it.

726
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:43,200
I should've known.
I should've known when he was,

727
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:47,640
when they'd bet anytime Bella
check does that we lose.

728
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:51,090
So I remember we were playing the jets
at home and Wes Welker and made all those

729
00:45:51,091 --> 00:45:54,150
feet joke about Rex Ryan.

730
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:59,250
We sat him and that Brady threw the worst
pass of his career on that screen pass

731
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,770
or it was just,
it was like he threw it three yard hail.

732
00:46:01,771 --> 00:46:05,820
Mary went up in the air and there's
always a pick six. And uh, so anyway,

733
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:10,440
what happened, man, I bet you guys beat
somebody else because I was very happy.

734
00:46:10,441 --> 00:46:13,980
I would have what I could have enjoyed
watching the eagles. Finally, when am I?

735
00:46:13,981 --> 00:46:18,981
Because I don't wish longterm misery on
any sports fan other than a select few

736
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,720
Montreal,
Montreal Canadien fans and Yankee fence.

737
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:27,840
Everybody else.
Everybody else.

738
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,930
All right, so Kramer
said, are you going with,

739
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,490
obviously I'm going to be on the eagles.

740
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,860
The key with foals is if you give him
time, if he doesn't face a pass for us,

741
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,680
he's going to be okay. They got Jason
Peters coming back at left tackle.

742
00:46:41,681 --> 00:46:44,320
I think that'll be huge.
They get some of their weapons back.

743
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:46,240
I think they could scheme
up a decent game plan.

744
00:46:46,241 --> 00:46:51,241
I think their defense will play good
against the Falcons here week one and uh,

745
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,950
yeah, they're raising the banners.
I think there'll be jacked for it.

746
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,540
I'm going on the eagles.

747
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,550
You guys shut down the vikings,
you know everybody,

748
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:01,660
you guys just completely
shut them down in the,

749
00:47:01,661 --> 00:47:05,440
in the NFC championship game,
if I remember correctly.
So they'll be census there.

750
00:47:05,441 --> 00:47:08,050
I just don't,
that was like a twilight zone game.

751
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:09,510
It was bizarre because I,

752
00:47:09,511 --> 00:47:13,650
every scenario in my head going over
the game for the eagles to when it was

753
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:17,610
going to be a defensive struggle,
you know, or, or a low scoring game.

754
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:21,570
I certainly didn't see teen 13 yeah,
something like that.

755
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,590
That's what I was thinking and I was
shocked to see them pull it out with the,

756
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:28,710
you know, 74 points or whatever
scored. Yeah, I mean, listen,

757
00:47:28,711 --> 00:47:32,140
it's tough to go against the, the, I
mean the Patriots got run up last year,

758
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:35,950
but typically the team raising the
banner, it's a good bat. You know,

759
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:38,150
the contrarian in me also likes the line,
you know,

760
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:42,490
the line move is moving the wrong way.
Nick falls did just win the Superbowl MVP.

761
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,860
So gotta give them the
benefit of the doubt.

762
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:47,140
But what I would say the Falcons
could have that pass rush showing.

763
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:49,180
You mentioned the past,
the rush that could be this problem.

764
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:50,950
And just out of principle,

765
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:54,370
I'll of course I'm going to fade the
eagles fan niggles. All right. Next up.

766
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:59,050
Big Game. Houston Texans at the
New England patriots right now.

767
00:47:59,051 --> 00:48:03,670
Patriots six point favorite.
And uh, I'll kick things off.

768
00:48:03,671 --> 00:48:07,210
I like the pats here. Lane six
against this Texans team. I mean,

769
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:12,300
one thing that's been pretty consistent
in the Brady Belicheck era is they look

770
00:48:12,401 --> 00:48:13,630
good coming off a loss.

771
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:18,660
And if you look at 2012 when they lost
the Superbowl in 2008 they and even back

772
00:48:18,671 --> 00:48:22,200
to the parcels and 96
they came back and uh,

773
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:26,740
they won 34 13 they want
1710 they want 41 to seven.

774
00:48:26,741 --> 00:48:27,610
Like this team,

775
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:32,320
I think we'll come out with a statement
game and really put it on the text.

776
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,010
And so that's what I mean,

777
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:36,100
I'm not sure, I'm not trying to
be a jerk here, but how does,

778
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,220
how does that have anything
to do with this team?

779
00:48:39,221 --> 00:48:42,960
All those on all of the personnel from
all of that, that's like, you know, they,

780
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,810
they, they play really good historically
in the sand when it's 70 degrees out

781
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:52,300
check I guess. Yeah, I guess, I guess
to me it's, I don't bell chicks,

782
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:56,620
the guy that just doesn't lose back
to back games and I think, listen,

783
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:00,610
little brother coming off a
Superbowl loss. Yeah. Bill O'brien,

784
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,140
former guy in the coaching tree. I think
he's gonna want to put it on him. I just,

785
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:09,700
this patriots team seems like they're
ready to make a statement at home against

786
00:49:09,701 --> 00:49:10,534
the texts in steam.

787
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:16,020
How do you, how do you see it go?
Well, I think that Texas quarterback,

788
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,530
what's his name there to Sean Watson?
He's coming off the ACL.

789
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,360
He's going to be a nightmare.

790
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:24,030
He's going to be a nightmare
for us trying to contain him.

791
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:25,890
And the only thing I like is,

792
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,740
I guess they have the worst
offense of line in the league.

793
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:33,510
I think that bodes well for
us. Um, what's the spread?

794
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:35,920
Six patriots lane six at home.

795
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:40,300
Oh, they always pick the perfect
number. Dot. Yeah. They're so good.

796
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:42,400
Now what I'm gonna do,
I'm actually,

797
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,830
I'm actually gonna take the Texans with
the points because you have the last

798
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:50,430
year we played the Kansas City chiefs
and they came in and they, they,

799
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,070
they killed us it up.

800
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:55,390
So I'm going to play your game and talk
about something that happened before.

801
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,560
Probably doesn't matter.

802
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,890
I think everybody's going to
jump on the path being like, oh,

803
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:02,170
they're gonna be pissed because
you've lost the super bowl.

804
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:07,060
Everything you just said.
And then the Julio Jones,

805
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:11,530
that wasn't really your though on a sports
bar like me who have jobs and make a

806
00:50:11,531 --> 00:50:15,010
couple of great catches in. Now also,
this is their revenge game. I'll forget,

807
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,830
they'd haven't seen her since we,
uh, came back and this, you know,

808
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:22,070
came back historically two years ago
in the Superbowl against them. So, uh,

809
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:28,400
sorry, I think you're bringing the
falcons in there for a second right there.

810
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:31,580
I have not only a plan,
I'm sorry.

811
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:36,260
Oh, good. Kramer. Which way? Which way
you lean in here? Uh, I mean, yeah,

812
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:41,120
it's Bellicheck just whoops.
On his disciples period. Yeah.

813
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:46,610
Not much to handicap to Watson would
scare me with that defense. Yeah. Um, I,

814
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:49,670
I do, I am curious to see the
offensive line, but I've just seen,

815
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:53,600
I feel like we've seen this so many times
where a t and optimistic disciple of

816
00:50:53,601 --> 00:50:58,070
bill Belicheck comes in and just gets,
gets a shit pushed in. So yeah, I'm not,

817
00:50:58,071 --> 00:51:00,330
I'm not fading the Patriots
Week One. Yeah, I do.

818
00:51:00,331 --> 00:51:03,380
I do think bill is hitting on
something. No. Because I feel like,

819
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:06,350
and maybe this is again
just kind of a gut instinct,

820
00:51:06,351 --> 00:51:09,410
but the paths kind of play
themselves in September.

821
00:51:09,411 --> 00:51:13,010
They use it as an extended preseason.
Kind of trialed some stuff,

822
00:51:13,011 --> 00:51:14,180
figure out some things.

823
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:19,840
And I'm still shocked that Patricia got
a head coaching job because I don't know

824
00:51:20,091 --> 00:51:24,080
that defense didn't Wah, you know,
instill a lot of confidence. So that's,

825
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:26,570
that's crazy that he got that Detroit Keg.
Okay.

826
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:31,700
You liked that reminds me of when I first
moved out to la the first time in the

827
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:31,920
late nineties,

828
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,920
everybody out here either had a Seinfeld
or a friend's credit and that entitled

829
00:51:37,081 --> 00:51:39,990
them to some sort of
show runner, like, uh,

830
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:42,690
or they would get some sort of deal
and they would pair them up like, oh,

831
00:51:42,691 --> 00:51:45,240
this guy wrote on friends.
This guy wrote on Seinfeld,

832
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:50,080
I think bill Bellacheck is the
Seinfeld of writers' rooms. Yeah.

833
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:54,520
So see if you did, if you did anything,
if you will, the water boy. Yeah,

834
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:58,860
he was a water boy. Bill Belichick,
you, you don't make a lateral move,

835
00:51:58,861 --> 00:52:03,330
you don't become the waterboy,
you get elevated in position.
So maybe that's why a

836
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:05,020
Patricia's,

837
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:08,380
where were you guys? I mean it's so true,
but it sounds like Patricia is just,

838
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,170
it sounds like people are already
Pennsylvania men as a failure.

839
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,690
It sounds like things aren't going well.

840
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:17,350
There's some weird dynamics going on with
that team. All right. One of the, uh,

841
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,870
one of the Monday night games.
There's the dual Monday night game.

842
00:52:19,871 --> 00:52:21,970
Do a kick off the season,
which fuck it.

843
00:52:21,971 --> 00:52:26,020
Why not the La Rams head
up to Oakland right now.

844
00:52:26,021 --> 00:52:30,160
The Raiders four point home
dog bill. I'll let you, uh,

845
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:33,670
get things cause started here. How do
you, how do you see this game shaken out?

846
00:52:33,671 --> 00:52:36,760
Deal at, do you like the Raiders?
What's your thoughts on John Gruden?

847
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,190
MMM,

848
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:45,190
I'm hoping that he doesn't
regret going back to the 24,

849
00:52:46,251 --> 00:52:46,791
seven,

850
00:52:46,791 --> 00:52:51,440
three 65 life of coaching when I
always feel like when coaches get into

851
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:53,270
broadcasting and there was good at that.

852
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:57,650
Good at it as is Gruten is they gotta
be sitting there going like this?

853
00:52:57,651 --> 00:53:00,380
Just job as a joke.
Yeah. Compared to what?

854
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,790
Compared to what I used to have to do.
But I imagine he missed it.

855
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:06,740
Obviously they gained the right
amount of money. He came back,

856
00:53:06,741 --> 00:53:10,340
I mean Gruden I know he's been gone for a
while, man. I mean, well, how many years?

857
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:13,840
Like almost a decade and a half. He left
like early two thousands. Am I right?

858
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:17,260
Yeah, I think it's been at least 10
years. I think we looked it up. It was,

859
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:21,750
it was before the wildcat. So to
put that in perspective, yeah.

860
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:24,840
2007.
Yeah.

861
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:27,720
So that's a long time.

862
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:30,960
And each generation of kids
is a little bit different.

863
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:34,250
And he's also rebuilding. And, uh,

864
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:37,350
I saw the thing on the Ram's head
coach where he could recall like,

865
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:41,610
you see it on real sports at
Bryant Gumbel. Like there'd
be like, Hey, a minute, 42,

866
00:53:41,611 --> 00:53:46,080
week eight, third quarter,
what happened? He's like, Oh
yeah, we ran that sweep play.

867
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:49,440
Uh, the guard didn't get out,
uh, quite where we wanted him to,

868
00:53:49,441 --> 00:53:53,170
but he got the job done. He has like a
photographic memory. I think that guy is,

869
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,690
is like, if anybody's going to
be the next generation of guys,

870
00:53:57,691 --> 00:54:01,500
it's gonna be him. And, um, where he's,

871
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:05,950
where he's just taking the ram
so quickly. I just think, uh,

872
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:09,270
because gluten is just starting to put
it back together. I would take the ramps.

873
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:10,403
Okay.

874
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:12,110
Kramer, you first of all, yeah,

875
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:16,880
Make Bay comes off like somewhere between
a serial killer and rain man in that

876
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:21,170
piece. He's definitely like, well advanced
of grew and, and, and just just imagine,

877
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,500
I mean I have to deal with
millennials on a daily basis. John,

878
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:27,020
I cannot imagine John Gruden
dealing with millennials. I mean,

879
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,840
we know why he came back.
We saw it in hard knocks last year.

880
00:54:29,841 --> 00:54:32,840
He still was making a playbook.
He just didn't have anyone to give it to.

881
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:36,740
He loves rock and the visors,
he's, he's cut like half the team.

882
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:41,690
I think I saw that there's, there's 31
new players on his 53 man roster. Um,

883
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,860
I saw a great tweet.

884
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,610
The Raiders decided to pay a coach $100
million and not pay their best player.

885
00:54:46,611 --> 00:54:51,350
90. Uh, so many reasons that, I
mean, this is the ultimate, like,

886
00:54:51,351 --> 00:54:52,970
just take the ugly dog,
right?

887
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:56,750
This is the ultimate take the ugly dog
on Monday night, but I can't do it.

888
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:00,770
I can't do it in this spot. So yeah,
I'm going to fade. I come on wheat,

889
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,950
we think Jay Gruden's a joke. At
least I do. He made a mistake.

890
00:55:03,951 --> 00:55:06,740
He's going to realize it
quickly. My talks, I wouldn't,

891
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:10,340
I wouldn't normally like to take a kind
of road favorite here in a divisional

892
00:55:10,341 --> 00:55:15,320
spot. I, I normally like to take a Monday
night home dog. Great Opportunity here.

893
00:55:15,321 --> 00:55:16,131
But man,

894
00:55:16,131 --> 00:55:20,480
this Raiders team isn't crazy
disarray and it just seems like th the

895
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:23,780
quarterbacks pissed off. He's upset
that they traded their best player.

896
00:55:23,781 --> 00:55:27,740
It's a weird move to pull this close to
the season and the Raiders did the what,

897
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:32,630
24th ranked defense with Cleo Mack.
You trade a all time defensive player.

898
00:55:32,631 --> 00:55:35,030
Now maybe this lined up working
out for them in the long run,

899
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:37,010
but I think this Rahm's office,

900
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,520
even though they didn't get a lot of
reps in the preseason for whatever reason

901
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:41,721
McVay maybe,

902
00:55:41,721 --> 00:55:46,210
you know they use the crazy analytics
and some sports sides Gruden's using the

903
00:55:46,211 --> 00:55:50,040
analytics. He openly challenges
analytics, which I Kinda,

904
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:53,410
I normally like the old school
guy approach there, but uh, yeah,

905
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:56,420
I'm looking guys also that they're moving.
Yeah,

906
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,570
they got half the shits and
boxes. Like I just, I just felt

907
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:05,120
yes. You look at that, you look at the
ram season that last year in St Louis.

908
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:09,810
Did Donnie go well moved out to Fisher.
It was just a complete disaster.

909
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:13,580
We just think of this, if John like
John Gruden became a caricature,

910
00:56:13,581 --> 00:56:14,660
much like John Madden.

911
00:56:14,661 --> 00:56:19,310
Imagine if John Madden came
back to coaching after like
15 years. No fucking way.

912
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:22,460
Yeah. I think burden. Uh, it'll
be interesting. I don't know.

913
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,370
I'm not that guy.
Can't coach.

914
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:27,220
I'm just saying he walked into
a hell of a situation and yeah,

915
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:32,100
he's playing these guys week one who are
just going to build on what [inaudible]

916
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:35,190
the past two seasons, how much
they've improved. I just think that,

917
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:37,070
I think they are going to keep going.
Yeah.

918
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:39,410
The rams have a lot of
momentum from last year.

919
00:56:39,411 --> 00:56:42,830
Not even catching like an east coast
team playing that late kick off.

920
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:46,560
You're catching another west coast teams.
So it's not like they have no, it's,

921
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:48,470
there might be more rare.

922
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,500
I mean there's gonna be a lot of rams
fans right now that the bandwagon has

923
00:56:51,501 --> 00:56:55,100
gotten nice and roomy. Yeah. I
think it's, I think it's just,

924
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:57,260
I don't see a lot of fans going up to,

925
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:00,710
that's also true horror picture show.

926
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:04,810
That is such a weird tradition.
You guys,

927
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,050
let's get her costumes on and go to the
game. The foam spike shoulder pads. Like,

928
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:11,240
Hey, I got to, hey, we're
going to go tailgate.

929
00:57:11,241 --> 00:57:15,920
Let me stop off at Michael's first to
get all my face pain and Styrofoam cones.

930
00:57:15,921 --> 00:57:18,550
The glue on the shoulder pads.
I'm a pirate.

931
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,480
Yeah.
They used to look like a biker gang.

932
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:26,100
The crowd somewhere along the line yet
starting to look like, like a musical.

933
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:31,530
Like, like, like, like for kids or
even this, even the scary things.

934
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:32,760
It looks a little friendly.

935
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,820
It's almost like if kiss
just became sharing section.

936
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:39,970
Yeah.
And it's like rocky horror pictures,

937
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:43,680
whatever the hell that stupid
movie meets like, uh, like meats,

938
00:57:43,681 --> 00:57:46,330
like a Disney ride or something.
Like,

939
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:50,170
we can only make it so scary because we
don't this something about like when you

940
00:57:50,171 --> 00:57:53,250
have the dad bod and,
and,

941
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:57,010
and foam spikes coming up.
I love that.

942
00:57:57,011 --> 00:57:58,920
They think that they're
intimidating together team.

943
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:03,160
The other team literally has 300 pound
guys trying to rip their heads off.

944
00:58:03,161 --> 00:58:06,370
But you're up there dressed like a
pirate and you're the one who's going to

945
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:09,830
throw 'em off iPads. Man,
you're freaking me out.

946
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:14,820
There's a lot of that. The dog
pound lot of that Ellie stuff like,

947
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:19,050
you know, your dad goes there and a
rubber mask eaten dog biscuits. It's like,

948
00:58:19,051 --> 00:58:20,320
come on dad, I gotta go. I gotta go.

949
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:24,230
Cool on Monday. I have to respect
you father. Come on. Yeah,

950
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:29,130
you just helped me with my math homework.
You're not crazy. All right bill,

951
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:33,830
before we, uh, before we let you go here,
what is a, maybe it's these three games,

952
00:58:33,831 --> 00:58:37,430
maybe it's a, a, another game you
feel really strongly about week one.

953
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:41,690
Can we get you to throw out a lock? You
know, we are gambling podcast. So what is,

954
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:44,240
what is bill burrs
leadpipe lock for week one?

955
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:49,260
My lead pipe lock.
All right,

956
00:58:49,261 --> 00:58:52,110
this is my lock and it's not
going to be gambling related.

957
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:58,680
My lock is going to be
whatever happens this week.

958
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:04,290
Most people in sports are gonna Talk
Radio are going to act like, you know,

959
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:07,860
like say Oakland gets their ass is kicked,

960
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,440
all they're going to be talking about
that John Grown you make the fingers was

961
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:17,820
Jacob was he sitting on $100 million
and he's all in one worst case scenario,

962
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:24,170
one game out of first they're going to
act like every God damn thing that happens

963
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,610
this son Thursday, Sunday and Monday is
what's going to happen the whole year.

964
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:33,680
They do it every fucking year. When Kansas
City came out and kicked the Patriots,

965
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:38,150
as all of a sudden Kansas City was the
fucking team of the future and what

966
00:59:38,151 --> 00:59:42,470
happened to them? You know, the Patriots
went back and won the AFC championship,

967
00:59:42,471 --> 00:59:46,820
you know, so I mean, just
don't listen for gamblers.

968
00:59:46,821 --> 00:59:51,330
Do not listen to all of the freaking
out that that they're going to be doing

969
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:52,970
when they do it. That's
just, I don't know.

970
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:57,590
They always got asked like the fucking
sky is falling or Jesus just came back

971
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:00,080
after every single game.
You know what I mean?

972
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:03,470
You look at some of the teams that
started to and Oh and then get destroyed,

973
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,070
missed the playoffs and that's a great,
you know,

974
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:11,240
advice especially for gamblers because
a lot of times you see one week and then

975
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:15,170
complete crazy overreactions and
we always talk about that week too.

976
01:00:15,171 --> 01:00:18,200
When you're picking your games,
don't overreact to that week one.

977
01:00:18,201 --> 01:00:21,090
If you had a strong feeling
or you know whatever you,

978
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:24,290
you were really high on the team,
it could just be one bad game.

979
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:27,680
Don't totally throw out your shit.
Buy Lotion Bailo

980
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:31,630
exactly. Look for the look
for that overreaction spread.

981
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:33,190
See if he can jump on that.

982
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,670
Tons of line value there and of
course you can head over to my book.

983
01:00:36,671 --> 01:00:40,880
He died ag to take advantage of that
potential line value either week one week

984
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:45,710
to live betting prop bets. They got it all
in game way during my bookie. Dot. Agee.

985
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,940
Use that Promo Code Bill bets
for a 100% deposit bonus. Bill.

986
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,760
Appreciate you calling in man. And uh,
we'll talk to you soon. Thanks dude.

987
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:54,750
All right guys, go pass. I'll see it.

988
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,190
Ah,
later.

989
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:06,903
Crazy.

990
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:22,390
Hey,
what's going on?

991
01:01:22,391 --> 01:01:25,630
It's built bar and it is the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

992
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:29,680
August 23rd, 2010. How the hell are you?

993
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,070
What's going on?
I just got back from Portland,

994
01:01:33,071 --> 01:01:37,120
Oregon actually taping this a Sunday
night cause I got a bunch of bullshit I

995
01:01:37,121 --> 01:01:39,730
have to do tomorrow.
Um,

996
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:43,990
I dunno what the fuck I just got back
from Portland and I hate doing these

997
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:48,430
things Sunday night because I'm, I'm
still like jet lagged. I'm out of it.

998
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:52,870
So, uh, this is gonna be a rough
one and I'm plowing through this.

999
01:01:52,871 --> 01:01:54,340
Even if it fucking sucks.

1000
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:59,640
I'm not stopping it and rerecording it
like I did last week because that ended

1001
01:01:59,831 --> 01:02:01,030
up getting me in trouble.

1002
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:04,450
That's how I started talking about
that doctor Laura Shit last week.

1003
01:02:04,451 --> 01:02:07,300
And I got to say for the first time,
maybe the second time ever,

1004
01:02:07,301 --> 01:02:10,510
I'm nominating myself as Douche bag of
the week because last week I actually

1005
01:02:10,511 --> 01:02:15,340
supported Dr Laura Cause I had no
fucking idea who she was. And uh,

1006
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:19,740
you know, I was having a rough time
doing the podcast. I needed fodder.

1007
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:22,200
Somebody send me an email,
what do you think about this?

1008
01:02:22,201 --> 01:02:25,830
And I watched like a ten second clip of
evidently a five minute clip and I just

1009
01:02:25,831 --> 01:02:29,790
thought she was imitating some something
she saw on def jam. So I was like,

1010
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:32,400
well she's quoting it,
she's not calling anybody that word,

1011
01:02:32,401 --> 01:02:36,910
but the ban all that bullshit.
And then Jay's, oh Jesus.

1012
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,730
The fucking emails came in

1013
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:43,490
from a, I ever deadly. Uh,
for my 14 podcasts listeners.

1014
01:02:43,491 --> 01:02:48,110
Evidently like six of them
are African American. Um,

1015
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:49,911
and uh,
yeah,

1016
01:02:49,911 --> 01:02:54,710
they read me the riot act in different
stages and I got admit they will fucking

1017
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:56,360
write cause I didn't,
I, you know, something,

1018
01:02:56,630 --> 01:03:00,290
my uninformed logic is usually funny that
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking

1019
01:03:00,291 --> 01:03:03,860
about and I go off on shit and I realized
that our race probably isn't one that

1020
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:07,640
you should probably do that on. I
didn't know that. She was like, uh,

1021
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:11,630
like rush Limbaugh with a cunt.
I had no idea. I just, you know,

1022
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:16,130
I don't know the fuck she was that she
was some soccer mom with a podcast,

1023
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:21,560
you know, and she was like, all the crazy
kicked out there, fucking blah blah blah.

1024
01:03:21,561 --> 01:03:26,540
I had no idea. Sorry. Fucking
eggs on my face. Um, but you know,

1025
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:30,950
it was funny. One guy got so
into fucking trashing me. Wait,

1026
01:03:30,951 --> 01:03:32,240
before I close this email,

1027
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:38,090
here's something I got from a former
marine talking about that clapping for,

1028
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:41,900
uh, the troops going through the
airport. He goes, as a former marine,

1029
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:46,070
nothing was a bigger joke than seeing
those support. The support, the troops,

1030
01:03:46,071 --> 01:03:51,071
stickers talk about an empty
gesture and clapping is even lamer.

1031
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:55,520
I have always fucking thought those
bumper stickers with stupid support.

1032
01:03:55,521 --> 01:03:56,180
The troops,

1033
01:03:56,180 --> 01:04:01,070
she to Sligo by that for a buck slapping
on the back of your truck or car and

1034
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:05,360
then he just drive away. Well, I did
my part. Do you support the troops?

1035
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:10,400
Have you looked at my bumper
sticker will. All right then. Um,

1036
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:14,840
yeah, that's fucking lame. Um, he said,
and clapping is even lamer. He said,

1037
01:04:14,841 --> 01:04:19,010
you're on the right track. Sending
over drinks to veterans who got back,

1038
01:04:19,011 --> 01:04:22,790
but think bigger. How about a
program called head for heroes?

1039
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,220
That's right.
Every,

1040
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:29,620
every service member of returning from
whatever fucked up Third World Shithole

1041
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:31,730
we're engaged in at the time,

1042
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:36,920
gets met at the airport by some
gorgeous whore and blown in a specially

1043
01:04:36,921 --> 01:04:38,180
designated area.

1044
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:42,020
That would be a great way of
showing the country's gratitude.

1045
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,360
You know what? I think if you can build
a banker's out, give them $1 trillion.

1046
01:04:46,361 --> 01:04:49,540
I think it, you can get a couple
of fucking who is, you know,

1047
01:04:49,541 --> 01:04:54,430
forget about the girls who have a
fucking uniform fetish. Um, but anyways,

1048
01:04:54,670 --> 01:04:58,150
uh, yes, so I got fucking trashed. Um,

1049
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:00,610
I took a little heat off of Mel Gibson.
I bet.

1050
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:04,870
Then he heard a couple of less a fucking
hate mails last week, so I apologize.

1051
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,480
I don't know who she is.
I'm not gonna Apologize For my stupidity,

1052
01:05:07,481 --> 01:05:10,340
but in the future when it's
something, you know, race-related I,

1053
01:05:10,341 --> 01:05:14,080
I will try to be a little more informed.
All right,

1054
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,960
well I've got to find this fucking
email with this guy fucking trashed me.

1055
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:22,480
You know, he said, uh,
[inaudible] let's see. He goes,

1056
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:25,240
it starts off good. Just trashing
me, which I totally get. He goes,

1057
01:05:25,241 --> 01:05:28,420
just like in your bit, you did
about the Jimmy, the Greek thing.

1058
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:32,290
It's best for white people to just
leave it alone. Dr. Laura May be old,

1059
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:36,220
but she's aware enough to
know what happens to white
people when they say the n

1060
01:05:36,221 --> 01:05:39,130
word or bring up racial
supremacy theories. See,

1061
01:05:39,131 --> 01:05:40,810
that's the part of the
tape I didn't watch.

1062
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:48,550
I showed up late to that rally,
you know, by the time I showed up,

1063
01:05:48,551 --> 01:05:51,280
they had already put the cross
out. You know, everybody's hoods.

1064
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:54,310
They took them off. It was a hot day.
I didn't know what I was walking into.

1065
01:05:54,311 --> 01:05:57,990
I thought it was like a fucking, you
know, Aa meeting or something. You know,

1066
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:02,740
we're all over by the table, haven't
donuts. It's my fault. I came in late. Um,

1067
01:06:02,741 --> 01:06:05,050
so anyways, uh, he said
the podium comes out,

1068
01:06:05,051 --> 01:06:08,290
so I'm surprised you defended
Dr Laura in this case.

1069
01:06:08,291 --> 01:06:10,590
They asked where I got a lot of them.
Surprise. You defended or can we,

1070
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:13,720
cause I watched eight seconds of
the tape because I'm Maura. Um,

1071
01:06:13,721 --> 01:06:16,530
I don't understand why there's
any debate about racial ethnic,

1072
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:21,280
why any debate about racial inequality
always comes down to comedians and def

1073
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:25,750
comedy jam. I don't think it does,
but evidently a, in your world,

1074
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:29,980
maybe it does. Um, I've heard
this argument before, well,

1075
01:06:29,981 --> 01:06:34,981
black comedians say this and that
about white people and say the n word,

1076
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:40,960
why can I, is it fair for
minority comedians? [inaudible]
Pitta and all basic,

1077
01:06:40,961 --> 01:06:44,470
all that's all that shit? Uh, I'm
trying to get to this part here.

1078
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:49,600
So then he was talking
about this documentary saw
where some comic was saying,

1079
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:52,330
you know, making a joke. This is actually
a good joke where white people like,

1080
01:06:52,331 --> 01:06:56,890
why can't I say the n word? Uh,
and then the dude was like, Oh,

1081
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:00,250
it was Chris Rock. Well, why do you even
want to say it? Right. Great fucking joke.

1082
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:05,050
Totally makes sense. And then the
punchline is, I've sailed the world.

1083
01:07:05,051 --> 01:07:09,130
I've fucked Raquel Welch.
If I could just say the n word,

1084
01:07:09,131 --> 01:07:13,270
my life would be complete. And then
this dude writes after that, he goes,

1085
01:07:13,271 --> 01:07:18,010
I think that it bothers white people
because you're not used to being told that

1086
01:07:18,011 --> 01:07:22,360
you can't do something white people used
to be able to do and say anything they

1087
01:07:22,361 --> 01:07:25,690
wanted.
Now there's all these rules.

1088
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:28,900
Isn't that fucking that,
that part of the email,

1089
01:07:28,901 --> 01:07:31,690
that's where it just went off the fucking
rails for me. You know what I mean?

1090
01:07:31,691 --> 01:07:35,440
It's like I totally get it.
She's a fucking idiot.

1091
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:39,940
I didn't realize it because I watched
that short little clip, you know,

1092
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:43,990
I shouldn't have support that shit.
And, and you're offended by that,

1093
01:07:43,991 --> 01:07:47,680
which I totally get. And then
in the end, you make some dumb,

1094
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:52,060
general generalization about white people.
See where all the same,

1095
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:56,950
we're fucking morons.
Jesus Christ.

1096
01:07:56,951 --> 01:08:00,370
I've sailed the world. Fuck walk. Hell,
we'll see. That part's the joke. But this,

1097
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:03,820
here's what he writes bothers white
people that you're not being used to told,

1098
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:08,200
being told that you can't
do something. Oh yeah, yeah.

1099
01:08:08,201 --> 01:08:13,100
We just run around doing whatever the
fuck we want to do. It's great. Ah,

1100
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:16,190
Jesus Christ. That's, that's
one the great stereotypes

1101
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:20,390
is that we're all Kennedy's living on
fucking Martha's vineyard rather than

1102
01:08:20,391 --> 01:08:21,224
fucking

1103
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:22,493
okay.

1104
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:25,330
You know, the majority of
white people aren't out there.

1105
01:08:25,331 --> 01:08:29,110
Majority of white people sitting
in cubicles not living their dream,

1106
01:08:29,111 --> 01:08:31,750
drowning in a sea of fucking debt,
trying to get health insurance.

1107
01:08:31,751 --> 01:08:34,990
Isn't that the majority of fucking
white people? Evidently not.

1108
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:38,590
Evidently according to this guy,
white people have yachts

1109
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:45,940
sailing the world. All 300
million of us, you know,

1110
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:50,440
do you just see it during that, the Gulf
War, uh, the Gulf spill there, you know,

1111
01:08:50,441 --> 01:08:52,480
that was one of the biggest problem.
All those white people,

1112
01:08:52,481 --> 01:08:57,220
all the 300 million white people with
our fucking yet just sailing around. Oh,

1113
01:08:57,221 --> 01:08:59,770
it's so awesome to be white. You can
just walk them. You can do what it say,

1114
01:08:59,771 --> 01:09:02,320
whatever you want to do.
It's fucking incredible.

1115
01:09:03,690 --> 01:09:08,370
Um, that's an argument I've, I've
gotten it to, uh, with the, um,

1116
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:13,100
I think every fucking,
yeah.

1117
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:18,350
Female comics, black comics, every fight.
They just go, yeah, it's easy for you.

1118
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:23,000
All you gotta do is show up,
man. Oh yeah, that's all it is.

1119
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:28,610
I don't even audition. I just lay here and
they, they call me up and I'm like, why?

1120
01:09:28,611 --> 01:09:32,330
Why did you give me that part then?
Cause your white, here you go.

1121
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:37,160
You don't have to work
for shit. Uh, you know,

1122
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:40,760
that's that classes. You know that, that
fucking double standard right there. Okay,

1123
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:42,590
now we're opening a whole
nother can of worms.

1124
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:44,660
Let's talk race for the next
couple of weeks. People.

1125
01:09:44,661 --> 01:09:49,070
This ought to bring out a lot of ugliness.
Um, that's that classic fucking like,

1126
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:52,040
that's one of those statements like you,
if you flip that thing,

1127
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:55,370
what you just said there,
that generalization that you made of,

1128
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:58,340
of white people that basically what
we just sit around and they do.

1129
01:09:58,341 --> 01:10:02,060
People just give a shit and we can
do whatever the fuck we want to do.

1130
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:06,280
You basically going to define
us by the Illuminati. MMM.

1131
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:13,190
If you flip that around and somebody white
says that upon another race of people,

1132
01:10:13,370 --> 01:10:16,510
then there were in like a Mel
Gibson situation. All right,

1133
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:18,650
now I'm open this up for discussion.

1134
01:10:18,651 --> 01:10:23,060
I'm not opening this up for
fucking rednecks to come
on here and be like, yeah,

1135
01:10:23,061 --> 01:10:25,460
that's why the fuck I'm talking about.
I'm not saying it like that,

1136
01:10:25,461 --> 01:10:27,290
but what I'm saying, you know
what? This is what I've learned.

1137
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:30,380
Traveling the fucking
Globe and by the globe.

1138
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:34,010
I mean I went to two other continents.
I went to Australia and Europe.

1139
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:41,090
I did all my research with just white
people. All right. A. Dot. Yeah.

1140
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:46,040
I think pretty much people
are people. We're all the
same. You know, there's a few,

1141
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:51,160
like very small percentage of people on
this planet are genuinely good people

1142
01:10:51,471 --> 01:10:53,210
and everybody else is
pretty much full of shit.

1143
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:56,330
And everybody looks at everybody
else and I think they got it easier.

1144
01:10:56,990 --> 01:10:59,330
And all you gotta do is,
yeah, you gotta do is this,

1145
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:02,960
I got to work twice as hard at this guy
and this guy does this. And you know,

1146
01:11:02,961 --> 01:11:03,980
no one wants to know

1147
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:07,800
what I've learned.
Well,

1148
01:11:07,801 --> 01:11:09,780
you probably don't wanna know
because I'm a fucking moron,

1149
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:12,960
but for what it's worth,
this is what I've learned.

1150
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:17,250
Life is that life isn't fair.
It's really fucking difficult.

1151
01:11:17,251 --> 01:11:18,900
But if you bust your ass,

1152
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:23,550
you're going to make it on whatever
level you're going to fucking make it.

1153
01:11:23,551 --> 01:11:28,551
You surround yourself with positive
people and you don't fucking quit when

1154
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:31,140
somebody kicks you in the fucking chest,
you get back up again.

1155
01:11:31,141 --> 01:11:32,310
You don't walk right into his foot.

1156
01:11:32,311 --> 01:11:34,290
You go around finding
different fucking avenue,

1157
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:37,620
or maybe you build your own avenue,
you do whatever you're gonna fucking do.

1158
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:41,190
And everybody's got different
starting positions and all that shit,

1159
01:11:41,191 --> 01:11:44,910
and it isn't fucking fair. And there's
nothing you can fucking do about it. But,

1160
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:50,180
uh, you know, and there's some people who
don't get stuff because of who they are

1161
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:51,590
because they're, they're, they're so that,

1162
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:56,550
that they're fat or that they're fucking
in an Asian guy with one leg. Okay.

1163
01:11:56,551 --> 01:12:01,440
And he can't work at a Goddamn fucking
place where you get a fake Tan, you know?

1164
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:05,100
Yeah. That shit definitely fucking exists.
But you know, what are you gonna do?

1165
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:07,680
You know?
But you know what?

1166
01:12:07,681 --> 01:12:11,640
I think most people don't make it because
they're fucking pussies and they just

1167
01:12:11,641 --> 01:12:14,850
tap out, you know? And I'm
talking about fucking wipe.

1168
01:12:14,851 --> 01:12:17,610
I'm actually talking mostly white people
cause that's what I know, you know?

1169
01:12:17,611 --> 01:12:19,020
And I got, I got people, people I know,

1170
01:12:19,021 --> 01:12:23,310
they just fucking quit and they've got
all these fucking excuses why they can't

1171
01:12:23,311 --> 01:12:25,710
fucking do it. And it's
like, no, you, you quit,

1172
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:30,990
you got punched once in the face and
then you just fucking laid down and now

1173
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:33,420
you're going to fucking
blame everybody else. Right.

1174
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:36,630
Did that make any fucking sense?
I'm trying to say something positive here.

1175
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:40,380
Trying to be balanced where it's like,

1176
01:12:40,381 --> 01:12:44,790
I know you and like female comics are
always fucking complaining, but you know,

1177
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:46,640
I can't tell you the amount
of fucking times I would.

1178
01:12:46,641 --> 01:12:50,190
I would be auditioning for festivals and
the industry becoming up to me going,

1179
01:12:50,191 --> 01:12:52,800
we need funny women.
Where are the funny women?

1180
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:56,910
And then they would pick a fucking
woman just cause they needed one.

1181
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:00,600
Not because they were one of
the funnier fucking people.

1182
01:13:00,601 --> 01:13:04,610
I'm not saying that female comics
aren't funny, but I'm just saying there.

1183
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:08,670
There are examples. You know what?
You guys can all go fuck yourself.

1184
01:13:08,671 --> 01:13:11,730
I'm a balding redhead trying to get
into movies, all right? You know,

1185
01:13:11,731 --> 01:13:14,400
cry me a fucking river. I
don't give a shit, all right?

1186
01:13:14,401 --> 01:13:17,520
But I was wrong about the
doctor Laura thing. Okay?

1187
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:22,780
When I start a fucking group crying
about how there's no fucking redheaded

1188
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,910
action heroes out there. You know Jesus
Christ. What's that fucking movie?

1189
01:13:26,911 --> 01:13:28,380
That's the number one
movie in the country.

1190
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:32,580
They got 58 fucking action stars in there.
One of them can't be a redhead.

1191
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:38,050
Couldn't have called up David Caruso to
show his pasty white ass walking up to

1192
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:45,240
Arnold Schwartzenegger. Ah,
it gives a fuck. All right.
So there you go. That was,

1193
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:47,820
that was my,
that was my roundabout apology.

1194
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:50,970
Uh, no, seriously. I
really felt bad about that.

1195
01:13:50,971 --> 01:13:55,030
Felt like an ignorant ass at a rather
than just immediately come on and

1196
01:13:55,031 --> 01:13:56,650
apologize.
I left it up there for the week,

1197
01:13:56,651 --> 01:14:01,360
so I'd get my nice pounding from everybody
and uh, yeah. You know what I mean?

1198
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:03,610
I fuck around and said a lot of
fucked up shit, but I, you know,

1199
01:14:03,611 --> 01:14:06,580
I'm trying to start your week off right.
I'm not trying to Piss you off,

1200
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:10,000
although there's probably a lot of women
out there who had fucking disagree,

1201
01:14:10,001 --> 01:14:13,570
but you know, it's comedy. You
know, people, people get hurt.

1202
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:17,230
It's out fucking works.
This is the worst apology ever,

1203
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:19,450
but it's coming from the heart.
All rights. Go Fuck Yourself.

1204
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:22,840
That's how we got to end it. All
right. I grew up with no hugs,

1205
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:27,580
so if I'm trying to be fucking nice,
it has to end with go fuck yourself.

1206
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:32,980
Um, speaking of go fuck yourself.
Um, I just got back from Portland,

1207
01:14:32,981 --> 01:14:36,820
Oregon and I had a great time
up at the a helium comedy club,

1208
01:14:36,821 --> 01:14:40,780
the grand opening helium comedy club,
and a Portland,

1209
01:14:40,781 --> 01:14:44,200
Oregon is a city that I
have not worked in, um,

1210
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:49,420
in 10 years because there was no comedy
club for a guy in my situation to come

1211
01:14:49,421 --> 01:14:54,220
in there and work. Uh, I did work.

1212
01:14:54,221 --> 01:14:58,810
There was a local club there, but it
wasn't really a comedy club. It was,

1213
01:14:58,811 --> 01:15:01,330
but it wasn't like the club owners
is basically what he would do.

1214
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:05,050
He would paper the room,
which is a, the showbiz term.

1215
01:15:05,051 --> 01:15:07,060
He would just just call people up.

1216
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:09,910
And I talk about this last week I came
fucking remember he would just call

1217
01:15:09,911 --> 01:15:12,400
people up and just say,
you know,

1218
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:16,450
or have this whole team of telemarketers
call up people and tell them that they

1219
01:15:16,451 --> 01:15:17,650
want a comedy show.

1220
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:21,640
And he would just call enough people
where he would fill up his room every

1221
01:15:21,641 --> 01:15:26,120
fucking night of the week from Tuesday
through Sunday. And everybody cared.

1222
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:27,280
It got in for free.

1223
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,240
And then all he did was fucking just
throw food and drinks down their fucking

1224
01:15:31,241 --> 01:15:34,660
throats. And that's how he makes
his million. But meanwhile,

1225
01:15:34,661 --> 01:15:39,150
the comedian stands on stage in front
of a bunch of fucking drunk overeaten

1226
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,500
jackasses who could give
a fuck about the show.

1227
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:45,310
And you had to go up there on a Tuesday
night with a goddamn whipping a chair,

1228
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:49,420
two shows, Friday, three
shows, Saturday the guy would,

1229
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:51,350
he wouldn't even let you
talk to the waitstaff,

1230
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,920
you'd think if you put a
comedian through that bullshit,

1231
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,500
they can at least try to get fucking leg,
you know,

1232
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:58,900
try to get a little bit of action.

1233
01:15:58,901 --> 01:16:01,450
He fucking cock block young
like nine different levels.

1234
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:04,210
It's a fucking horrific gig
is what I'm telling you.

1235
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:07,690
And then the second you got a
TV credit and you said, hey,

1236
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:12,130
can I have an extra quarter?
The next time I fly across the country?

1237
01:16:12,131 --> 01:16:16,390
And then the guy that you just wouldn't
return your phone call. So he basically,

1238
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:20,740
other than up and coming guys would
just be booking horrific talents.

1239
01:16:20,741 --> 01:16:25,741
So Portland has been really starved
for any sort of national headlines.

1240
01:16:25,901 --> 01:16:28,870
So now there's a new club out there and
I was really excited to be the first guy

1241
01:16:28,871 --> 01:16:32,650
to come to town and, uh,
and have, uh, you know,

1242
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,360
work the comedy club.

1243
01:16:34,361 --> 01:16:38,020
And I had no idea how bad that other
club was until I talked to some of the

1244
01:16:38,021 --> 01:16:41,840
younger comics. This guy told me,
he walked in there to do a spot.

1245
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:43,090
He moved up from,
uh,

1246
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:49,000
from host to feature in that club owner.
Guy Calls him and he's like, look,

1247
01:16:49,001 --> 01:16:52,240
I make $1 million a
year just selling food.

1248
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,640
That's what he said.

1249
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:58,570
When you get on stage,

1250
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:03,400
no f bombs that just reads them the
fucking riot act. It's, it was horrible.

1251
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:05,920
It's a great business model.
He's made his money,

1252
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:08,890
but it's fucking horrible for
the development of Comedians.

1253
01:17:08,891 --> 01:17:10,970
He's sitting on their fucking chest.

1254
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:13,140
Okay.

1255
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:15,770
And that Dick's, he's not even letting
them get fucking lay. What did they,

1256
01:17:15,771 --> 01:17:20,010
you know, just asshole
fucking asshole. Um,

1257
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:24,330
so it's great that there's a new comedy
club out there and that the, you know,

1258
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:28,260
there's another place for these comics
to work and that they can actually see

1259
01:17:28,261 --> 01:17:29,130
national headlines.

1260
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:32,640
Cause that was a fucking big thrill for
me when I was back in Boston. So, uh,

1261
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:36,660
so if you live in the Portland area,
you know, if you're a lumberjack,

1262
01:17:36,661 --> 01:17:41,250
climbed down out of the fucking tree and
come on down, do a helium comedy club.

1263
01:17:41,251 --> 01:17:44,490
It's a great club. And uh, he's
got C's. Who's he got next week?

1264
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:48,660
He's got a
Jimmy Pardot

1265
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:52,910
is who he's got Jimmy Pardot. Uh, right.

1266
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:57,530
Is that what is what I think
there was one other person, um,

1267
01:17:57,890 --> 01:18:00,590
oh, Reggie watts. Reggie
rots on Wednesday.

1268
01:18:00,591 --> 01:18:05,150
And then Jimmy Pardot from the never
not funny podcast. Jesus Christ.

1269
01:18:05,151 --> 01:18:07,160
I'm losing my God damn memory.
I knew there was somebody else.

1270
01:18:07,161 --> 01:18:10,110
So go check out those
shows next week and uh,

1271
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:14,860
support a comedy club that actually
will book somebody who's funny and on

1272
01:18:14,861 --> 01:18:19,110
television. All right, low
plowing ahead here. Um,

1273
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:22,950
what's the next thing on the docket? I
really have, I don't have shit this week.

1274
01:18:23,730 --> 01:18:26,460
Do I? What am I? 17
minutes in? That's not bad.

1275
01:18:27,090 --> 01:18:30,390
You gonna fucking tap out
at 40 minutes yet. You know,

1276
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:33,780
you guys don't go home early every once
in awhile and just fake a fucking injury

1277
01:18:33,781 --> 01:18:38,070
at work. Try to pretend like a
forklift drove over here. Some shit.

1278
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,040
You know what I really wanted to do
was I wanted to look up that five hour

1279
01:18:41,041 --> 01:18:43,260
energy here on the Internet,

1280
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:48,660
five hour energy.
Now this is how I do my research now.

1281
01:18:48,661 --> 01:18:53,661
Five hour energy I think is a liquid
cocaine and I think it really fucks with

1282
01:18:55,291 --> 01:18:59,130
you yet. I think it's bad. So, um,

1283
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:03,150
rather than just look up five
hour energy consumer reports,

1284
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:08,150
I'm going to search five
hour energy unhealthy. See,

1285
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,870
and this is how most people do research.

1286
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:13,170
They already have their mind made up
and then they just read shit that agrees

1287
01:19:13,171 --> 01:19:15,150
with them. Yeah. You know,

1288
01:19:15,151 --> 01:19:19,470
according to a fuck face.com um,
I'm exactly right.

1289
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:24,820
Side effects of five hour energy drink
shots. Are they unhealthily unhealthy?

1290
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:29,700
Let's read this one. This is the first one
that came up. Side effects of fiber to,

1291
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:30,211
okay.

1292
01:19:30,211 --> 01:19:35,211
I was at lunch today and my friend was
trying to get someone to drink five hour

1293
01:19:35,281 --> 01:19:37,230
energy caffeine shot.
So I,

1294
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:42,350
I opened it and smelled it and
said I'd give it a shot anyways,

1295
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:46,530
I think you're supposed to mix them in
a drink. But I straight shrugs that,

1296
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:49,740
chugged it and almost gagged from
the taste. After I swallowed it,

1297
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:54,840
it took me like 15 minutes to get that
horrible taste. Uh, out of my mouth.

1298
01:19:54,841 --> 01:19:57,270
I tried eating food,
chewing gum, drinking,

1299
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:02,560
but the taste stayed in my mouth
for like 40 minutes. I felt sick.

1300
01:20:02,561 --> 01:20:06,190
Every time I thought about the taste, I
think the taste bothered me so much. Uh,

1301
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:06,730
Jesus,

1302
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:09,360
why you do or you're going to get to the
part where you had the heart attack so

1303
01:20:09,361 --> 01:20:12,940
I can feel like I'm right.
Take the taste,

1304
01:20:13,190 --> 01:20:17,460
bothered me so much caffeine.
But anyways, I'm shy.

1305
01:20:17,461 --> 01:20:19,560
So after the tastes and
the sickness wore off,

1306
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:25,100
I was feeling great all day and I felt
probably the happiest I have all school

1307
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:31,260
year because all my subtle tendencies
wore off and I acted more outgoing and

1308
01:20:31,261 --> 01:20:33,780
funny like I do around friends.

1309
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:37,140
They just turn this dude
into a fucking coke head.

1310
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:42,960
That's classic reason why people
do drugs. Helps me loosen up, man.

1311
01:20:42,961 --> 01:20:46,080
I could talk to the chicks.
Um,

1312
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,010
there's nothing on here.
Are you shitting me?

1313
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:56,520
Oh, gives a fuck. I just, you know,

1314
01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:01,170
why don't you get eight hours sleep? Why
don't you do, why did you start that?

1315
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:01,891
You know,

1316
01:21:01,891 --> 01:21:05,580
I had somebody else in another mother
call in or call in or write in going back

1317
01:21:05,581 --> 01:21:10,530
to that fucking that shit I said about
stay at home moms and once again they

1318
01:21:10,531 --> 01:21:13,800
were doing, she was, she was saying, I
totally agree with you. I understand.

1319
01:21:13,801 --> 01:21:14,850
You're absolutely right.

1320
01:21:14,851 --> 01:21:17,790
They have no right to be saying
it's the most difficult job ever.

1321
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:22,500
And then she wrote three paragraphs about
how difficult it is to be a mother and

1322
01:21:22,501 --> 01:21:26,520
to be worrying up and having the
responsibility of another life.

1323
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:28,650
And it's like I like, I don't, I get it.

1324
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:31,110
I know I don't totally get it cause
I don't have a kid. But you know

1325
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:35,260
enough already.
All right.

1326
01:21:35,261 --> 01:21:39,960
Like that other listeners said you
chose to be a mother. You know,

1327
01:21:39,961 --> 01:21:43,620
you're acting like a, all of a sudden
you've got like a fucking terminal disease

1328
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:47,930
and all you're doing is bringing up
the bad shit. What about when you have,

1329
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:50,450
you have a bad day and you come
home and that kid with, you know,

1330
01:21:50,451 --> 01:21:54,500
all that innocent just looks at you and
just thanks. You're bigger than life.

1331
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,860
What about that? Doesn't
that, that, that, you know,

1332
01:21:58,850 --> 01:22:02,840
wash away some of the spittle
on your shoulder blade?

1333
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:07,530
I don't fucking know. You know,
it's funny, actually ironic. It was,

1334
01:22:07,531 --> 01:22:10,950
I was just watching 60 minutes and they
have one of those guys on the fucking BP

1335
01:22:10,951 --> 01:22:13,680
oil rig and I said when
they jumped off of it,

1336
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:17,760
it was the equivalent of jumping off
a three story fucking brownstone.

1337
01:22:17,761 --> 01:22:21,450
Evidently it's the equivalent of
jumping off a 10 story fucking building.

1338
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:23,070
That's what they did.

1339
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:25,950
That was their choice standing there
in the middle of the Goddamn Ocean.

1340
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:30,620
Either I burn up or I jump into
the fucking oily water without, oh,

1341
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:35,490
it was brutal. Okay, so while
you mom's stand the fuck down,

1342
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:38,430
stop giving me shit.
I was just fucking joking around.

1343
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:43,040
I'm just gonna have to end up
apologizing to everybody here. You know,

1344
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:46,980
I had somebody run into me today from a
New Zealand just podcast is really going

1345
01:22:47,070 --> 01:22:49,290
to be random.
Somebody wrote it from a New Zealand.

1346
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:55,250
I was thinking about this topic that for
people and all these random countries

1347
01:22:55,561 --> 01:22:57,090
who listened to this podcast,

1348
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,170
I'm going to start nominating who I think
the coolest person from your countries

1349
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:06,070
and with new New Zealand, I
think it's a no brainer. It's

1350
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:09,100
Phil Rudd.
You don't get any cooler than that guy.

1351
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:15,350
He's played the exact same drum beat for
fucking 35 years and he's such a tough

1352
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:18,360
bastard that no one has the balls
to tell them to switch it up.

1353
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:20,070
Yeah.

1354
01:23:20,070 --> 01:23:23,850
You don't feel like, how about boom,
check, boom, check, check. You know,

1355
01:23:23,910 --> 01:23:27,560
how about that
fucking guy?

1356
01:23:28,890 --> 01:23:31,140
The whole fucking,
the whole goddamn album.

1357
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:36,670
I think he just goes in there right and
he just starts fucking play in that beat

1358
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,430
and then they just,
they just play the whole song,

1359
01:23:39,730 --> 01:23:44,320
the whole fucking album worth of songs.
And then when they're done they just,

1360
01:23:44,321 --> 01:23:48,600
they just started yet fail,
fail.

1361
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:53,720
It's over. We're done. Yeah.
We made another album. He just
said, oh, all right. Yeah,

1362
01:23:54,050 --> 01:23:58,730
let's just start breaking down
his kit. Oh, Geez. I got nothing.

1363
01:23:58,731 --> 01:24:00,200
I really riffing about Phil Rudd.

1364
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:05,180
There was some of the wars beatbox and
you're ever gonna fucking here. Um, oh,

1365
01:24:05,181 --> 01:24:07,940
here we go. You know what? I got to read
this right here. Now I've got something.

1366
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:12,650
This will take up a good three fucking
minutes. You know what? I liked it.

1367
01:24:12,651 --> 01:24:15,980
This podcast is this difficult. Now
you guys can relate to me. You know,

1368
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:18,500
you sitting there and you Goddamn
cubicles on a fucking Monday.

1369
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:21,530
Unless you're white. Of course
you're out on your yacht. You know,

1370
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:26,000
chatting it up with a Kennedy. Hey, when's
the stock market going to crash again?

1371
01:24:26,001 --> 01:24:30,020
Give me the heads up.
Don't tell the Puerto Ricans.

1372
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:34,790
That's what it's like.
That's exactly what it's like.

1373
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:39,860
There's not white people working farms,
slaves to corporations.

1374
01:24:43,790 --> 01:24:47,240
Ah, not at all. Not at all. All your
deal. You, you don't even have to get up.

1375
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:48,081
You don't have to get up.

1376
01:24:48,081 --> 01:24:51,650
I spent nine years in bed just because
I was white and they just fucking

1377
01:24:51,651 --> 01:24:54,350
hilarious.
I made more money then than when I worked.

1378
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:58,880
That's how great it is to be white.
It's so fucking easy.

1379
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,880
And thank God for people who aren't white,

1380
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:05,660
who've never been white to tell
me what it's like to be white.

1381
01:25:06,410 --> 01:25:07,460
It's fucking awesome.

1382
01:25:12,410 --> 01:25:16,820
Let me tell you something about being
white white guy. This is how good it is.

1383
01:25:17,150 --> 01:25:17,983
Oh yeah.

1384
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:22,340
What do you reincarnated was
your name frank and another life?

1385
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:26,940
Um, is that a white guy name? I don't
fucking know. All right. So anyway,

1386
01:25:26,941 --> 01:25:30,410
so I've pissed off a bunch of
people and uh, I just want to,

1387
01:25:30,411 --> 01:25:34,530
I just want to try to redeem myself and
show you that it's not all bad either.

1388
01:25:34,670 --> 01:25:38,560
It's not all bad. You know, I do inspire
some people. Uh, here's one for you.

1389
01:25:38,610 --> 01:25:42,590
Milk white thighs is the name of this.
This email,

1390
01:25:42,591 --> 01:25:46,100
somebody sent me a set bill. A
few things. The last five years,

1391
01:25:46,101 --> 01:25:49,370
I've been six feet tall,
240 pounds.

1392
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:53,180
Upon trying to work out with
no results and no willpower,

1393
01:25:53,450 --> 01:25:58,100
I usually lose five pounds,
give up and sit and eat shit.

1394
01:25:58,640 --> 01:25:59,031
However,

1395
01:25:59,031 --> 01:26:04,031
you talked on the podcast a few weeks
ago about Bill Clinton and Al sloshing

1396
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:05,330
around the White House.

1397
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:10,190
I believe I said sashaying around the
White House with their milky white hips.

1398
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:16,610
Um, I was in a quiet room with
about 50 people and blurted, blurt,

1399
01:26:16,611 --> 01:26:20,180
laughed out loud, laughed
loudly, blurt laughed loudly.

1400
01:26:20,270 --> 01:26:24,140
That's really worded strangely. You
burst out laughing. There we go.

1401
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,250
Ever since then. How will
it be sitting, watching TV,

1402
01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:31,760
looking at my treadmill
and I will say to myself,

1403
01:26:32,530 --> 01:26:36,950
slosh your ass up there and work off those
milky white hips or something to that

1404
01:26:36,951 --> 01:26:41,210
effect. It makes me laugh every time
and realize how pathetic I've been.

1405
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:46,510
It's been about three weeks of this
everyday and 45 minutes on the treadmill.

1406
01:26:46,610 --> 01:26:50,600
I'm down to 208 pounds.
Well,

1407
01:26:50,601 --> 01:26:55,070
on my way to my goal of
a hub of a buck 80 also,

1408
01:26:55,071 --> 01:26:57,020
I'm a dude and my name is Lindsey.

1409
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:59,660
I know you don't have a
lot of female listeners,

1410
01:26:59,661 --> 01:27:03,290
so if you ever feel like you need a
quote or just a woman's approval on

1411
01:27:03,291 --> 01:27:07,970
something, you do, feel free
to use my name and just say,
yeah, this chick Lindsay,

1412
01:27:07,971 --> 01:27:11,210
I know this chick,
Lindsay who takes it. Uh,

1413
01:27:11,211 --> 01:27:15,080
I'm more than willing to compromise my
sexuality for the furthering of your

1414
01:27:15,081 --> 01:27:17,120
career.
Um,

1415
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:22,040
I would buy five of anything
bill Burroughs endorsing.
All right. There you go.

1416
01:27:22,041 --> 01:27:26,360
There's a good email. Congratulations.
You're down to 208. Keep going.

1417
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:28,880
And, uh, I'm glad. You know,

1418
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:33,200
I'm glad I just didn't bring all
negativity to the podcast this past week.

1419
01:27:33,201 --> 01:27:36,800
I felt fucking horrible about that even
though I've been kind of a cost again

1420
01:27:36,801 --> 01:27:41,440
this week. That's what I do. You
know, you came back, didn't you?

1421
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:47,140
You know, I don't know any better.
I'm just a white guy laying in bed.

1422
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:54,100
I can't remember the last time
I've had disappointment in my life.

1423
01:27:55,390 --> 01:27:58,930
It just doesn't happen. Just
doesn't happen, you know, you know,

1424
01:27:58,931 --> 01:28:03,290
sometimes the sale on my schooner
will break and I'm just like, AH,

1425
01:28:03,370 --> 01:28:07,030
Jesus Christ. And then I call the
government and I say, Hey, can you uh,

1426
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:09,650
can you send me another one? They're like
white and what color are you? I said,

1427
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:14,610
why they guy? There you
go. Right on the way.

1428
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:19,140
You know, I agree with the first half of
the email. This guy I'm making fun of,

1429
01:28:19,141 --> 01:28:22,620
but I would love to send this guy
my fucking taxes. I really would.

1430
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:25,020
These motherfuckers,

1431
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:29,040
what a lot of people don't realize is
that rich people feel there's enough rich

1432
01:28:29,041 --> 01:28:31,560
people and they got all kinds of fucking,

1433
01:28:32,410 --> 01:28:36,020
they take a fucking pipe to a
goddamn knees every fucking quarter.

1434
01:28:36,030 --> 01:28:39,030
They make sure they can only be,

1435
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:43,350
they can only be a certain number or
a fucking rich people unless you just

1436
01:28:43,351 --> 01:28:46,650
invent some shit. Like,
uh, I dunno. I Dunno what

1437
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:51,780
if you come up with the technology
for the fucking iPod then even then,

1438
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:55,500
I mean they'll just, they'll just hire
you on as like a scientist. Right.

1439
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:58,500
I'm really getting to know over my
fucking head here. You know what I mean?

1440
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:01,560
If you come up with Facebook,
if you that.

1441
01:29:01,561 --> 01:29:03,870
I think that's the way now that you
can actually become fucking rich,

1442
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:08,520
but I'll tell you right now, it's not
fucking telling jokes. Fucking assholes.

1443
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:09,930
Yeah.

1444
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:14,900
Fucking assholes.
God Damn fucking quarter.

1445
01:29:14,901 --> 01:29:19,500
I gotta I gotta. Oh Gee, I
am. I am going to get into it.

1446
01:29:19,501 --> 01:29:22,050
I'm not going to fucking get it.
Just give me some me so fucking mad.

1447
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:25,670
You're telling me I think I'm
getting ahead. Look at me. Yeah,

1448
01:29:25,770 --> 01:29:29,120
I'm getting the hey fucking sit down.
That's what they do every quarter.

1449
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:32,820
You sit the fuck down.
You stay right where you're at bay.

1450
01:29:33,050 --> 01:29:38,030
Sit right where you're at.
That's what it is. Anybody else?

1451
01:29:38,031 --> 01:29:40,630
This isn't even a color thing.
Anybody else in the fucking middle class.

1452
01:29:41,530 --> 01:29:43,790
There you go.
Fucking rich pricks

1453
01:29:46,910 --> 01:29:51,140
fucking last goddamn eight years or
they're making a ton of fucking money and

1454
01:29:51,141 --> 01:29:53,870
then all of a sudden the shit hits the
fan and they run out of the Goddamn

1455
01:29:53,871 --> 01:29:57,260
restaurant. Leave everybody
else with the fucking check.

1456
01:29:58,660 --> 01:29:59,493
Yeah.

1457
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:03,860
Fucking unbelievable.
My ever going to get that fucking car.

1458
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:05,130
I'll tell you,

1459
01:30:05,130 --> 01:30:08,810
I got off the plane today and somebody
had the dodge challenger in the all white,

1460
01:30:08,811 --> 01:30:11,990
like the vanishing point guys ever
see that movie with that dude?

1461
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:15,650
Kuwalski he's got an all white charger.
So they did this tribute to,

1462
01:30:15,651 --> 01:30:20,270
it's all fucking white and the guy
had these fucking rims on it and uh,

1463
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:21,720
yeah,

1464
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:25,530
I just sat there drooling at my
girl's looking at me like, she's like,

1465
01:30:25,531 --> 01:30:29,940
Jesus Christ, you were obsessed
with that car. It's like, yeah,

1466
01:30:29,941 --> 01:30:30,870
you know I am.

1467
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:32,710
Yeah.

1468
01:30:32,710 --> 01:30:34,990
Well, you know, I'm standing
here. You just got off the plane.

1469
01:30:34,991 --> 01:30:37,870
You could say hello to me,
you know?

1470
01:30:38,870 --> 01:30:39,510
Yeah.

1471
01:30:39,510 --> 01:30:43,260
Oh, you know what that reminds me of. I
fucking went to go to this pizza place.

1472
01:30:43,261 --> 01:30:47,280
I really try to do fun things when I
was in Portland, try to be healthy.

1473
01:30:47,281 --> 01:30:51,660
I went for a fucking hike. I was
sticking with my smoothies, you know,

1474
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:55,890
dropping pounds here and uh,

1475
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:57,410
yeah.

1476
01:30:57,410 --> 01:31:00,530
Anyway, somebody tells me that in, in
Portland they have this fucking room.

1477
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:04,550
They got this pizza parlor where they
had the best God damn pizza and all the

1478
01:31:04,551 --> 01:31:08,060
fucking northwest. So this guy has
like this homemade goddamn doe,

1479
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:12,350
and he only makes so much of it every day.
And when he's done making the dough,

1480
01:31:12,530 --> 01:31:16,700
he's done making pizza. Go
Fuck Yourself. All right?

1481
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:22,340
So I'm like, you know, well shit, I gotta
try this pizza. So I go on the Internet,

1482
01:31:22,341 --> 01:31:24,890
I look up, I see where it is.
It's right on Hawthorne Street,

1483
01:31:26,410 --> 01:31:31,060
like 45th and Hawthorne, 46 in Hawthorne,
something like that, right? So I'm like,

1484
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:33,460
all right, I gotta go check this
fucking thing out. So I allow,

1485
01:31:33,490 --> 01:31:36,730
I get myself an hour and a half
before the show to get there,

1486
01:31:37,930 --> 01:31:42,400
to get a God damn pizza, right? It's
a fucking pizza. Okay. So I call up,

1487
01:31:42,401 --> 01:31:47,140
just told me to cut, just
to call this place. And uh,

1488
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:50,050
I called up the,
it rings like 11,

1489
01:31:50,051 --> 01:31:54,760
12 fucking times and nobody picks up.
So my guy,

1490
01:31:54,770 --> 01:31:56,660
you know what? They're probably
busy. No big deal. I got an hour.

1491
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:59,920
I'll get there with an hour and a half
before, right? I get a goddamn cab.

1492
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:03,490
I'm driving over there. Cab driver
goes out. Just to let you know,

1493
01:32:03,491 --> 01:32:05,920
this guy's kind of like the
pizza Nazis, like, like the,

1494
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:09,850
like the fucking a soup Nazi on Seinfeld.

1495
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:13,270
So I show up and I walk in. Lo
and behold, the place is packed,

1496
01:32:13,271 --> 01:32:18,130
but I see this little two top gets up,
waitresses cleaning off the table,

1497
01:32:18,131 --> 01:32:23,130
she walks away. So I go over and I
sit down, get re order the pizza,

1498
01:32:23,131 --> 01:32:26,400
I'm checking out where people are ordering
of getting excited is what I'm trying

1499
01:32:26,401 --> 01:32:29,850
to tell you. And then the waitress
comes over, she's like, um,

1500
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:35,040
were you over in the waiting room next
door or did you just like walk in here

1501
01:32:35,041 --> 01:32:39,930
and sit down? And I was like, um, I
just came in and sat down. She goes,

1502
01:32:39,931 --> 01:32:44,910
yeah, I'm, you have to like
fight in, um, next door.

1503
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:46,500
You know, those people, everything's,

1504
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:50,400
everything's a question you
have to like sign in next door.

1505
01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:55,590
And I'm like, oh, all right. I go, well,
how long is the wait? She's like, well,

1506
01:32:55,591 --> 01:32:59,730
I can't really like say it's, you
know, it's kind of busy at that point.

1507
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:00,990
He's like a quarter of, I go, well,

1508
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:04,770
I gotta show at eight to quarter to
7:00 AM I going to have time to order a

1509
01:33:04,771 --> 01:33:08,340
pizza and eat it? She's like, yeah, no,

1510
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:10,553
now.

1511
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:12,550
And um,

1512
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:17,440
and then that's when my blood starts
fucking boiling because I realized what I

1513
01:33:17,441 --> 01:33:19,480
just walked into.
You know what I walked into?

1514
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:22,330
I walked into the pizza version of pinks,

1515
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:25,120
hotdogs out here in fucking La,

1516
01:33:25,510 --> 01:33:30,510
the pizza version of Magnolia Bakery
in New York City or that fucking place.

1517
01:33:32,790 --> 01:33:34,690
We get the hot dogs in Chicago,

1518
01:33:36,430 --> 01:33:37,263
you know,

1519
01:33:38,430 --> 01:33:42,150
hour and 15 minutes to make a
fucking pizza. You can't do that.

1520
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,790
This guy sitting here acting like,
you know,

1521
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:49,180
like he's making some sort of gourmet
for now. I'll tell you right now,

1522
01:33:49,181 --> 01:33:54,010
that's my overrated for the fucking week.
Standing in line at any restaurant.

1523
01:33:54,011 --> 01:33:57,100
These, you know, the, the, the
breakfast place in your neighborhood,

1524
01:33:57,630 --> 01:33:59,050
your girlfriend's like,
oh my God,

1525
01:33:59,430 --> 01:34:04,430
the stuffed French toast is to die for
and you stand there and fucking line,

1526
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:09,580
never worth it. It's never
worth the hype. Okay?

1527
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:13,420
You learn anything from this podcast
other than I'm an ignorant asshole.

1528
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:18,130
Don't ever stand in line for
fucking food. Okay? And less some,

1529
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:21,970
there's a natural disaster.
The places flooded in this.

1530
01:34:22,130 --> 01:34:23,770
They're scooping out fucking pea soup.

1531
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:26,350
You know when you're putting
it into your baseball hat,

1532
01:34:26,351 --> 01:34:29,800
then you'll stand in line. Soup
kitchen. You stand in line,

1533
01:34:29,890 --> 01:34:33,040
but don't stand outside these fucking
places. It's stupid. It's never worth it.

1534
01:34:33,070 --> 01:34:35,740
You know fancy restaurants. You
don't stand outside. You call up,

1535
01:34:35,741 --> 01:34:36,940
you make a fucking reservation.

1536
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:39,660
But I'm not standing out there
like I'm waiting to fucking

1537
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:41,053
okay.

1538
01:34:41,930 --> 01:34:43,420
Do they even make goddamn sense?
You know what I mean?

1539
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:47,260
He's fucking people in New
York. They stand outside for
90 minutes for a cupcake,

1540
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,750
for fucking cupcake.
It's gone in three seconds.

1541
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:53,710
You know it's going to Piss me off.
Is some people in Portland. Okay.

1542
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:57,200
They're actually going to figure out
what pizza parlor I'm talking about and

1543
01:34:57,201 --> 01:34:58,430
then they're going to tile. Tell me, dude,

1544
01:34:58,431 --> 01:35:01,700
it's totally fucking worth at
these low self esteem Douche bags

1545
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:08,350
who just allow themselves to get totally
treated like absolute fucking shit for

1546
01:35:08,931 --> 01:35:11,810
pizza. Yeah. Sorry,

1547
01:35:11,811 --> 01:35:15,110
I can't make you a pizza within an hour
and 15 minutes. Well, you know what?

1548
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:17,490
Fuck you and your fucking pizza.

1549
01:35:17,491 --> 01:35:19,970
What do you think about that and
your number one God damn rating.

1550
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:23,720
I've got a pizza hut.
Eat their fucking slop.

1551
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:28,630
You got to kill him. He is that. I
know. I'm going to have to go back.

1552
01:35:28,631 --> 01:35:31,150
I have to try it.
People hyped it so much.

1553
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:35,740
That's what I'm really mad about is I
know as much as I just fucking talked

1554
01:35:35,741 --> 01:35:36,311
about that shit,

1555
01:35:36,311 --> 01:35:39,880
I'm going to have to go back down and go
get it and for all you guys wondering,

1556
01:35:39,881 --> 01:35:43,570
yelled at Magnolia. It's, it's a great
cupcake, but it's not that great.

1557
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:48,550
It's not that great to have to stand there
and listen to that awful conversation.

1558
01:35:50,030 --> 01:35:51,670
Now,
if people driving by looking at you,

1559
01:35:51,671 --> 01:35:53,760
trying to figure out what are
they standing in line for sure.

1560
01:35:55,190 --> 01:35:56,023
You know

1561
01:35:57,850 --> 01:35:59,860
it's the president.
They're doing a book signing.

1562
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:05,090
Is there a porn star there was going
to blow you at the front of the line.

1563
01:36:05,091 --> 01:36:08,480
Can I raise the stakes for something
funny within the last seven minutes?

1564
01:36:08,481 --> 01:36:11,660
All right. Fuck this. Fuck
this podcast. Here we go.

1565
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:16,240
Why don't I nominate some youtube
videos for the week? Everyone. Um,

1566
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:20,870
I have a ton of them and I'm going to
make the bold rex Ryan statement that I

1567
01:36:20,871 --> 01:36:23,150
think pretty God damn soon,
if not already,

1568
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:27,740
the Mlm podcast.com is going to have the
best fucking youtube video collection

1569
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:31,940
of youtube videos. All right. I mean,

1570
01:36:32,090 --> 01:36:33,710
cause you guys are on the cutting edge.

1571
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:37,160
A lot of these videos that you guys
send me, they only got like, you know,

1572
01:36:37,220 --> 01:36:39,350
10,000 to 40,000 fucking hit.

1573
01:36:39,351 --> 01:36:43,670
Some of them have like a hundred thousand
or so like that and even a few with a

1574
01:36:43,670 --> 01:36:45,050
million. But if they're really
funny, I don't give a shit,

1575
01:36:45,051 --> 01:36:46,910
but I think that we're on the
cutting edge of some shit.

1576
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:50,570
Like here's two that I found
that, you know, only, you know,

1577
01:36:51,650 --> 01:36:56,120
in the tens of thousands of hits. So
I'm assuming you haven't seen them. Uh,

1578
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:58,460
look up a prank of the century.

1579
01:36:59,690 --> 01:37:03,420
This woman puts on a mask and scares
the shit out of this other woman and,

1580
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:08,690
and it's, you gotta watch it, it's
fucking great. And then piss off

1581
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:14,630
pissed off. Cat freaks
out. Look up that one.

1582
01:37:16,050 --> 01:37:18,500
And we got a lot of people.
You guys like violent shit.

1583
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:21,470
I'm trying to categorize them now.
And by the way,

1584
01:37:21,471 --> 01:37:24,650
the MM podcast is the official fan page.
There's the Monday morning podcasts.

1585
01:37:24,651 --> 01:37:25,484
If you don't have to,
you know,

1586
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:28,670
it's a pain in the ass to go on youtube
and try to find six different videos,

1587
01:37:28,671 --> 01:37:32,210
right? Typing it in and all
that shit. You're going to
get caught. You're at work,

1588
01:37:32,211 --> 01:37:34,880
you're not supposed to be doing it.
But if he just subtly type in the MLM,

1589
01:37:34,881 --> 01:37:38,690
podcast.com and nobody fucking looking,
all of them are going to be right there.

1590
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:41,810
And you can watch one after another,
you know,

1591
01:37:41,870 --> 01:37:43,910
or you can make it last
the whole fucking day.

1592
01:37:44,330 --> 01:37:47,600
You can even drink that five hour fucking
energy and just start screaming at

1593
01:37:47,601 --> 01:37:52,570
your screen if you want. It's all
up to you. Um, so anyways, uh,

1594
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:56,370
here's a couple of for you fight
fans out here. I will start slow,

1595
01:37:56,730 --> 01:38:00,720
look up a choke slam.
Um,

1596
01:38:00,721 --> 01:38:02,190
I hope that's the name
of the fucking video.

1597
01:38:03,140 --> 01:38:06,960
This is referee reffing a
fight in this choke slam.

1598
01:38:07,950 --> 01:38:11,850
Look it up. All right. Um,

1599
01:38:12,140 --> 01:38:15,900
here's kind of a cute one. Says little
girl boxer. It's actually a boy.

1600
01:38:15,901 --> 01:38:19,470
His name's pretty boy. Bam, Bam. And
you've got to look at this fucking kid.

1601
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:21,630
This kid would kick the shit.

1602
01:38:21,631 --> 01:38:25,800
Just imagine this kid fighting
another fifth grader. Um,

1603
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:28,020
and this is the most insane one.

1604
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:34,160
Boston Street fight guy with bat does
damage Boston Street fight guy with bat as

1605
01:38:37,261 --> 01:38:42,210
in baseball bat does damage.
Um,

1606
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:46,200
what else do we got? Summer
discourteous, something ridiculous.

1607
01:38:46,201 --> 01:38:47,850
Swollen in south Philly.

1608
01:38:49,230 --> 01:38:52,830
It's a guy walking around like he's got
a fucking hard on having conversations

1609
01:38:52,831 --> 01:38:55,620
with people. Sort of an old
bit. I've seen it done before,

1610
01:38:55,621 --> 01:39:00,030
but this guy does a
great, um, wrestling fans.

1611
01:39:00,130 --> 01:39:04,650
We got two for you are much
your man on Coke and uh,

1612
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:08,040
ultimate warriors. Confession
is absolutely fucking brilliant.

1613
01:39:08,170 --> 01:39:12,000
You got to look at that one. And uh, Oh,

1614
01:39:12,001 --> 01:39:16,690
more violence office worker goes
insane. Second Angle. Never.

1615
01:39:17,150 --> 01:39:20,610
Natalie, there's some new
footage. Uh, what else?

1616
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:25,950
Oh, this is a great one.
Look up the turtle, man. This
one might be my favorite.

1617
01:39:26,850 --> 01:39:28,680
This guy's missing all these front teeth.

1618
01:39:28,710 --> 01:39:31,350
And when you find out how
he's missing his teeth,

1619
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:35,970
it's just one of the great stories
that he just alludes to it.

1620
01:39:35,971 --> 01:39:39,600
It's fucking awesome. It's just this
redneck who just fucking catches turtles.

1621
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:44,220
And, uh, I, I swear to God,

1622
01:39:44,221 --> 01:39:47,370
I would pay admission to sit on the
side of the pond and just watch this guy

1623
01:39:47,371 --> 01:39:51,360
catching turtles. It's fucking hilarious.
And I actually getting into covers,

1624
01:39:51,390 --> 01:39:54,540
we were talking about the worst
covers of all time. Here's a great,

1625
01:39:54,541 --> 01:39:57,600
one of the best covers I've ever
seen just as far as being creative.

1626
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:02,870
Look up a stairway to heaven, the
Beatniks, that's all one word, B,

1627
01:40:02,871 --> 01:40:07,230
e. A. T. N. I. X. It's fucking cool
as hell. It's really fucking cool.

1628
01:40:07,231 --> 01:40:12,060
They do stairway to heaven the way the
Beatles would do it. It's really fucking,

1629
01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:15,690
I dunno, it's really creative. Um,

1630
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:21,600
and speaking of movies,
here's one for you is, uh,

1631
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:24,150
I got in this conversation
with somebody on the Internet.

1632
01:40:24,151 --> 01:40:28,200
They sent me an email and they were
talking about how, uh, you know,

1633
01:40:28,201 --> 01:40:29,070
they're not married yet,

1634
01:40:29,071 --> 01:40:32,340
so they're kind of hanging out with people
who are younger than them so they get

1635
01:40:32,341 --> 01:40:35,370
a little bummed out when they make
references to movies that nobody's seen

1636
01:40:35,371 --> 01:40:39,030
before. So, uh, he started
showing him some of the classics,

1637
01:40:39,031 --> 01:40:41,640
like the dirty dozen and that type
of shit. And he asked me, you know,

1638
01:40:42,270 --> 01:40:44,340
what are some of the great fucking movies,
uh,

1639
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:49,140
I should recommend with then let it
to like music and that type of shit.

1640
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:54,550
And uh, here's a new topic for
is do you guys have like songs?

1641
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:57,420
You must have these, these fucking
songs that the second you hear him,

1642
01:40:57,421 --> 01:41:01,480
you can't hear the song without thinking
of the movie. You know what I mean?

1643
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:06,660
Cause you do here, I'll give you
a classic fucking example and uh,

1644
01:41:06,661 --> 01:41:10,210
I think even the broads will know
this one. Did I get rid of it?

1645
01:41:10,211 --> 01:41:13,720
I had it all fucking cued up.
I really am the worst.

1646
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,900
Can I ever do this?

1647
01:41:15,901 --> 01:41:20,100
This is why I started off in fucking
radio and then my career quickly ended

1648
01:41:20,850 --> 01:41:22,560
because I would do the whole beginning.

1649
01:41:23,310 --> 01:41:28,310
You're listening to 6:40 AM
WEC be a broadcast service.

1650
01:41:30,090 --> 01:41:32,880
The fucking whatever the fuck I
used to say. Hang on a second.

1651
01:41:32,881 --> 01:41:34,740
Let me get to youtube.
God dammit bill.

1652
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:36,333
Okay.

1653
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:40,150
And now there's a lull. See what happens.
You know what? I'll play the other one.

1654
01:41:40,630 --> 01:41:44,680
Well, no, I can't do that at the end.
And ability to do that shit. All right,

1655
01:41:44,681 --> 01:41:46,860
let me set the mic down. Hang
on a second. All right. Do you,

1656
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:49,540
why don't you act like you're
working for once. All right,

1657
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,790
now I'm yelling at you
because I fucked up.

1658
01:41:52,630 --> 01:41:54,610
What the hell's the name
of that fucking Saba.

1659
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:56,750
Oh yeah.

1660
01:41:56,910 --> 01:42:01,890
Something. Something, something.
Something. Um, air. It is. I got it.

1661
01:42:04,170 --> 01:42:09,170
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Oh,

1662
01:42:09,171 --> 01:42:11,450
you fucking condo. Come on. Come up.

1663
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:13,120
Yeah.

1664
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:14,350
Should I edit this out?

1665
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:18,910
You know what this is
like is when you fucking,

1666
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:22,300
someone just told you what their name
is and then somebody you know comes

1667
01:42:22,301 --> 01:42:25,900
walking in and you go to introduce them
and you have no fucking idea who they

1668
01:42:25,901 --> 01:42:29,170
are. That's how I'm speaking
right now. All right. What,

1669
01:42:29,171 --> 01:42:31,060
what movie does this remind you of?
Instantly?

1670
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:43,333
Come on.

1671
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:45,670
You know what? You know the movie,
right? I know. Most of you know though.

1672
01:42:45,671 --> 01:42:48,820
Even the broads, we'll get
it. Come on. You know this.

1673
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:53,500
I'll wait for the breakdown.
I'll wait for the breakdown of it.

1674
01:42:53,501 --> 01:42:54,334
Where the hell is it?

1675
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:00,350
Where the hell was it?
I had this whole fucking thing queued up.

1676
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:03,590
This part right here.
You don't remember this

1677
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:10,630
[inaudible]

1678
01:43:10,630 --> 01:43:13,180
I haven't did the sound effects.
Remember that reservoir dogs,

1679
01:43:13,181 --> 01:43:15,040
when he cuts the fucking dude's ear off.

1680
01:43:16,580 --> 01:43:20,330
I used to love that God damn song and I
couldn't listen to it for 10 years cause

1681
01:43:20,331 --> 01:43:21,740
every time I fucking heard it,

1682
01:43:21,950 --> 01:43:25,760
I just thought about Marvin Nash
getting his Goddamn ear cut off.

1683
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:29,630
God. Stop. Stop yelling at him.

1684
01:43:32,630 --> 01:43:34,740
Fucking what a,
what a great piece of acting

1685
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:41,400
by both of those guys who ever played
Marvin Nash and, uh, Mister Blonde.

1686
01:43:41,401 --> 01:43:45,870
I can never remember people's
fucking names. Yeah, we'll
call him Vince Gilligan,

1687
01:43:45,990 --> 01:43:50,100
I dunno is fucking date. And I want to
fuck that. I forget his name. You know,

1688
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:53,000
most guys to play psycho would
act like a fucking psycho.

1689
01:43:53,001 --> 01:43:57,710
How they think a psycho supposed to act,
you know, and just how fucking Cami was.

1690
01:43:58,670 --> 01:44:01,880
You know, that's what's really fucking
scary. Somebody cut in your ear,

1691
01:44:02,030 --> 01:44:04,160
I've gone and act like a fucking maniac.

1692
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:06,680
You'd almost start laughing
halfway through it. Like,

1693
01:44:06,681 --> 01:44:11,030
is this guy mocking being crazy? But
it's the calmness with which he does it.

1694
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:14,210
Here's another one for you.
These are really easy for like guy movie.

1695
01:44:14,211 --> 01:44:18,230
So I need some more, more suggestions.
I'm actually going to disguise this one.

1696
01:44:18,410 --> 01:44:23,410
I downloaded this song because of the
movie and I didn't realize that this

1697
01:44:23,451 --> 01:44:28,340
fucking Irish dude babbles telling some
fucking story for 20 minutes before they

1698
01:44:28,341 --> 01:44:31,250
get to the part that I
actually recognized. Uh,

1699
01:44:31,430 --> 01:44:33,440
let's see if you can guess this
one. Here we go. What movie

1700
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:35,583
goes to where

1701
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:42,800
the does with Joyce and lettuce,

1702
01:44:43,330 --> 01:44:44,800
right? You're like, what the fuck is this?

1703
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:55,070
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1704
01:44:55,070 --> 01:44:56,720
I didn't,
I didn't want to get blood on the floor.

1705
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:02,050
[inaudible]

1706
01:45:02,050 --> 01:45:02,883
mine,
you know it.

1707
01:45:05,150 --> 01:45:05,983
[inaudible]

1708
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:08,060
hello audio.
Tion

1709
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:13,520
that's a Donovan singing a Atlantis.
That was from a,

1710
01:45:13,521 --> 01:45:17,390
the Billy bad scene.
When they start kicking the shit.

1711
01:45:18,450 --> 01:45:19,283
Fucking Billy bet.

1712
01:45:19,310 --> 01:45:23,690
Is there anything better than that fucking
camera angle when they're doing that?

1713
01:45:24,130 --> 01:45:28,010
Pointing up at Robert De Niro's character.
Jimmy just fucking kicking him.

1714
01:45:29,030 --> 01:45:31,970
Rick flair. Couldn't do fake kicks
better than Robert Dinero. You know,

1715
01:45:32,410 --> 01:45:33,440
he just sitting there kicking him.

1716
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:38,600
See,
this was bad.

1717
01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:43,490
Billy batts was a made guy with
some real grease balls. Shit.

1718
01:45:43,940 --> 01:45:46,940
We did what we wanted.
We were wise guys. Right?

1719
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:51,470
What's the last one I got here? So
I, I, you know, as usual, you know,

1720
01:45:51,471 --> 01:45:55,340
whenever people ask you these questions,
I can't end up, I can't remember them.

1721
01:45:56,870 --> 01:45:59,840
Um, let's see. Here's one for you.

1722
01:45:59,841 --> 01:46:02,700
This is actually an interesting
one that's really fucking upset.

1723
01:46:02,740 --> 01:46:07,190
This is one from a movie that the dude
ended up selling. This is from cool hand,

1724
01:46:07,191 --> 01:46:11,630
Luke. All right, for those of
you have seen cool hand Luke,

1725
01:46:11,631 --> 01:46:14,130
if you haven't seen cool hand Luke,
you've got to fucking watch that movie.

1726
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:19,100
All right. And basically the guy who
did the score, uh, wrote this song.

1727
01:46:19,101 --> 01:46:23,090
There's a scene where they
have to tar this road and, uh,

1728
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:25,520
Paul Newman's character,
you know,

1729
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:29,900
rather than just sitting there being like,
this is a miserable fucking job.

1730
01:46:29,901 --> 01:46:34,460
He gets them all amped up that it's
supposed to take all fucking day,

1731
01:46:34,461 --> 01:46:38,110
but he gets these guys so fucking
amped up. They just, they just fucking,

1732
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:41,970
they just, it's like they took
five hour energy and before they,

1733
01:46:42,090 --> 01:46:44,650
they're just flying down the fucking
road and they're all laughing,

1734
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:45,920
having a great fucking time.

1735
01:46:46,010 --> 01:46:49,950
And they finished the road and they
actually have an afternoon off. Right?

1736
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:55,020
So it was like Paul Newman's way
of saying fuck you to the, to the,

1737
01:46:55,021 --> 01:46:57,750
to the, to the screws. Is that what
they called them back down to the,

1738
01:46:57,751 --> 01:47:01,200
to the guards. Right. So they
had to have this music. So they,

1739
01:47:01,201 --> 01:47:05,100
this guy wrote this score for this scene.
Uh,

1740
01:47:05,101 --> 01:47:07,830
but the problem was it
was perfect for the movie,

1741
01:47:08,190 --> 01:47:13,190
but the problem was years later he sold
it or I don't know how far along he sold

1742
01:47:13,621 --> 01:47:18,621
it and it got played so much in this
other shit that it actually kind of fucks

1743
01:47:18,811 --> 01:47:20,610
up the movie. This is, this is the score.

1744
01:47:20,970 --> 01:47:24,780
This is going to be for some older
people to actually understand this is the

1745
01:47:24,781 --> 01:47:27,270
music that they had for the ta.
It's called tar sequence. When they,

1746
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:29,970
when they tar the road
and they ended up selling,

1747
01:47:29,971 --> 01:47:32,850
the guy ended up selling
the song for something else.

1748
01:47:33,090 --> 01:47:37,800
Here it is just listening to this shit.
Ah,

1749
01:47:37,801 --> 01:47:41,790
you suck. God dammit. Fuck the, see.

1750
01:47:41,970 --> 01:47:45,990
This is why I got out of rain.
I used to do shit like that on the air.

1751
01:47:46,970 --> 01:47:51,000
That would be the worst break ever.
I am the fucking worst.

1752
01:47:51,001 --> 01:47:53,700
I want a great intro. I gave
that song. All right, here we go.

1753
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:56,393
Yeah,

1754
01:47:56,420 --> 01:47:58,460
this is the tar in the road.
Totally makes sense.

1755
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:08,273
Florida.

1756
01:48:18,710 --> 01:48:23,360
Good evening and welcome to the six
o'clock news. It was a four car accident.

1757
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:27,890
The mother fuckers sold it to
every six o'clock news station.

1758
01:48:28,910 --> 01:48:31,340
This was the classic with
you fucking old like me.

1759
01:48:31,341 --> 01:48:35,000
Anytime the fucking news came on,
this is the fucking song that they played.

1760
01:48:35,930 --> 01:48:36,730
This is back when,

1761
01:48:36,730 --> 01:48:41,300
when they actually had fucking journalists
telling you what the corporations

1762
01:48:41,301 --> 01:48:42,140
wanted you to know.

1763
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:51,790
[inaudible]

1764
01:48:51,790 --> 01:48:56,050
good evening. I'm Jake Johansen.
Why did I say Jay? I'm a your,

1765
01:48:57,040 --> 01:49:00,910
I was, that's how fucked up my brain is.
I was trying to think, uh, Chet Curtis.

1766
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:05,530
I was like, well, I can't say I can't
say Chet. That's an actual fucking name.

1767
01:49:05,531 --> 01:49:07,810
I don't name names. So then
I'll go, I'll go with Jake.

1768
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:10,960
And then for some reason I don't,
it just got crossed up and I said,

1769
01:49:11,590 --> 01:49:12,131
Jake Johann's I gave Jake,

1770
01:49:12,131 --> 01:49:17,131
Joe answered a fucking shout out the best
God Damn Comedians the last fucking 20

1771
01:49:17,291 --> 01:49:18,310
years from my money.

1772
01:49:20,070 --> 01:49:20,650
Yeah.

1773
01:49:20,650 --> 01:49:23,200
So anyways, yeah, it's called
out of the tar sequence.

1774
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:26,250
So that one actually doesn't remind
me of the, the, the, the fuck.

1775
01:49:26,290 --> 01:49:27,160
That's a reverse one.

1776
01:49:27,161 --> 01:49:30,160
I actually watched the movie
and I'm getting into that scene.

1777
01:49:30,161 --> 01:49:32,260
And then I think there's like all of a
sudden I'm going to start listening to

1778
01:49:32,261 --> 01:49:36,010
the news. So Jesus Christ, that was,

1779
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:40,870
that was probably the worst debut
of any segment. But you knew,

1780
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:43,840
you got to admit you were
definitely into it, right?

1781
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:48,130
I know you guys have suggestions.
Can you help me out? All right.

1782
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:52,600
I'm fucking burned out with this fucking
podcast trying to get ready to do other

1783
01:49:52,601 --> 01:49:57,130
shit and I'm just, you know, look at
me. I'm fucking supporting Nazis now.

1784
01:49:57,190 --> 01:50:00,590
Is that what I'm doing? Is that I'll
fucking tired. I am doctor Laura.

1785
01:50:00,870 --> 01:50:05,770
You're not a bad birthday. Fucking
moron. All right. Here's one for you.

1786
01:50:06,310 --> 01:50:08,200
You know what?
I'm going to actually do one.

1787
01:50:08,620 --> 01:50:13,060
I'm going to do one here for it to try
to make peace after my doctor Laura a

1788
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:20,280
Dr Laura comments. Here we go. Uh,

1789
01:50:20,340 --> 01:50:23,040
wait a minute. Wait a minute. I've
got to get a secretary for this shit.

1790
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:32,450
All right. Where the fuck are
we? Yeah, I fucking hate youtube.

1791
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:36,280
I don't want you douchebags doing the
fucking thing. I want the actual guy.

1792
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:42,400
Everybody doing a fucking remix.
Wait, hang on. Hang in there.

1793
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:46,773
Yeah,

1794
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:52,700
there it is. There we go. Alright,

1795
01:50:53,210 --> 01:50:57,860
now this one's mainly going to be
for, uh, the people that I offended

1796
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:03,950
last week, last week,
uh, with a fuck is it?

1797
01:51:05,630 --> 01:51:09,500
Come on now. All right, here we go.
Here we go. This isn't going to remind,

1798
01:51:10,610 --> 01:51:12,440
this isn't going to remind you of a movie.

1799
01:51:12,441 --> 01:51:16,730
This is going to remind you of a TV
show. What show was this? Hang on.

1800
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:20,570
What's the last one?
Come on. Wait a minute.

1801
01:51:20,571 --> 01:51:24,980
You fucking cunt. I
didn't hit pause. Did I?

1802
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:30,170
Hang on.
All right,

1803
01:51:30,171 --> 01:51:33,110
this is going to remind you of a TV show.
What TV show.

1804
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:53,020
I somehow missed that one that came out.
That is a, that's the Carlton Dance.

1805
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:57,280
I think I was too old for that one. I
kind of tapped out with sitcoms after, uh,

1806
01:51:57,340 --> 01:51:59,710
after why happy days
and I wanted the chairs.

1807
01:52:00,310 --> 01:52:04,930
I started boozing and actually
believed cheers. You know,

1808
01:52:04,990 --> 01:52:05,980
I believe that,
you know,

1809
01:52:05,981 --> 01:52:10,981
there was a bar like that and you come
in and just being an alcoholic was like

1810
01:52:11,050 --> 01:52:15,670
funny and fulfilling.
I guess there was the sadness.

1811
01:52:15,671 --> 01:52:20,350
He completely avoided his wife,
Vera. And they never showed her. Um,

1812
01:52:20,440 --> 01:52:22,780
anyways. You know what? I think that's
going to be the podcast for the week.

1813
01:52:22,781 --> 01:52:25,510
I have to, I got a tap out
here, man. This, this, uh,

1814
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:27,730
this is trying to do one on the road.

1815
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:30,820
The day after I come off the road
is really difficult. But, uh,

1816
01:52:31,090 --> 01:52:35,200
fortunately things have been
going well that I'm really busy,

1817
01:52:35,740 --> 01:52:37,780
so I guess that is a good fucking thing.
But you know,

1818
01:52:37,781 --> 01:52:39,790
you get used to this comedian lifestyle.

1819
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:43,630
Well you just get the fucking hang
out on a Monday. Now I actually, uh,

1820
01:52:44,290 --> 01:52:45,410
I have shit to do,

1821
01:52:46,610 --> 01:52:49,730
which is annoying.
It's not why I started being a comedian.

1822
01:52:49,731 --> 01:52:53,360
I started to be a comedian,
so I would not have shit to do,

1823
01:52:54,710 --> 01:52:55,543
you know,

1824
01:52:56,240 --> 01:52:59,720
wouldn't have a boss
to tell fucking jokes,

1825
01:52:59,721 --> 01:53:04,580
talk about my Dick and all 50 states
and whatnot. Believe it or not,

1826
01:53:04,581 --> 01:53:08,870
people, my neck stand up date
isn't until September 9th, uh,

1837
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:53,210

September 10th. Well, we

10th and the 11th. There we go.

1840
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:07,020
That's when I'm working there. Um,
and then starts the theater shit.

1841
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:09,510
I'm going to be at the egg in Albany,
New York.

1842
01:54:09,900 --> 01:54:13,500
All you people in upstate New York always
say, come to upstate New York, man.

1843
01:54:13,501 --> 01:54:15,570
What the fuck?
I'm going to be there.

1844
01:54:16,290 --> 01:54:19,320
I'm going to be at the egg in Albany,
New York.

1845
01:54:19,321 --> 01:54:23,280
And then the following day I'm going
to be at the center for the arts,

1846
01:54:23,550 --> 01:54:26,910
Buffalo, New York. Um,

1847
01:54:27,240 --> 01:54:28,620
so I'm finally coming to buffalo.

1848
01:54:28,621 --> 01:54:32,790
I'm actually hitting up a bunch of
towns that I haven't been to in fucking

1849
01:54:32,791 --> 01:54:35,820
forever. Uh, another city, a city.

1850
01:54:35,821 --> 01:54:39,000
I've never done standup in a full set.
I've done a guest set,

1851
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:43,740
but I've never gotten a gig out there.
I'm going to be at the, uh, pantageous

1852
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:49,740
Pantages pan on ages, whatever the
fuck it is, theater in Minneapolis,

1853
01:54:49,741 --> 01:54:53,310
Minnesota on October 22nd.

1854
01:54:53,970 --> 01:54:56,460
And then the following
day I'm going to be at

1855
01:54:58,350 --> 01:55:03,330
the Vic Theater in Chicago,
Illinois on, um, October 23rd.

1856
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:08,460
And uh, any other ones? I
got another theater date.

1857
01:55:08,490 --> 01:55:12,600
On November 19th.
I met the listener auditorium,

1858
01:55:12,601 --> 01:55:16,020
Washington DC and a,

1859
01:55:16,021 --> 01:55:20,340
the last theater I have is
the more theater in Seattle,

1860
01:55:20,341 --> 01:55:23,580
Washington on November 27th.
Uh,

1861
01:55:23,581 --> 01:55:27,960
you can go on to build bird.com and just
click on the links in the lower left

1862
01:55:27,961 --> 01:55:32,660
hand corner and you can
check out all that bullshit.

1863
01:55:32,670 --> 01:55:37,230
And, uh, hopefully you'll come out to
the shows. We'll see how it goes. Um,

1864
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:40,590
for those of you wondering if I'm just
going to try to do theaters exclusively,

1865
01:55:40,970 --> 01:55:43,710
um, no, I am not. I'm always
going to be doing the, the clubs.

1866
01:55:43,711 --> 01:55:47,910
I like the gym keeps you in shape.
You come in, you do five, six shows,

1867
01:55:48,330 --> 01:55:51,360
and then every once in awhile like,
uh, like Buffalo, I don't know.

1868
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:53,970
They don't really have like a
big time comedy club out there.

1869
01:55:54,390 --> 01:55:57,740
No disrespect to anybody out there.
So why you just come in,

1870
01:55:57,750 --> 01:56:01,380
you try to do a theater. Same
thing with Albany, you know,

1871
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:04,590
you start going to those really
smaller fucking towns, um,

1872
01:56:05,220 --> 01:56:08,790
or smaller comedy markets. And
then that's just when, you know,

1873
01:56:08,791 --> 01:56:12,750
the local comedy club is just the
name, you know, like knee slappers,

1874
01:56:13,770 --> 01:56:18,390
you know, um, God dammit, you're funny.

1875
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:24,330
Who's ready to laugh, you know, they
just got awful fucking names and uh,

1876
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:28,170
yeah. And they try to make
you stay in a comedy condo.

1877
01:56:28,171 --> 01:56:30,000
So that's why I always
avoided those things.

1878
01:56:30,001 --> 01:56:31,890
And I tried to stay in the
bigger markets where I could,

1879
01:56:31,891 --> 01:56:36,750
they actually put me in a hotel. I'm
like, you, I lie like my comforts. So,

1880
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:39,960
uh, that's, that's the big,
uh, my big tour coming up.

1881
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:44,790
And there's also a date there I missed in
Columbus, Ohio. That's a club date, uh,

1882
01:56:44,850 --> 01:56:48,090
November 12th, 13th, and 14th.
And the fucking, you know,

1883
01:56:48,091 --> 01:56:51,720
what kills me is how quick that's all
gonna go by and another year is going to

1884
01:56:51,721 --> 01:56:56,700
go by as well as, you know,
by the end of that tour, um,

1885
01:56:56,790 --> 01:56:59,610
football season will be three quarters
over. How fucking sad is that?

1886
01:56:59,611 --> 01:57:03,810
At least the regular season.
Uh, who do you like by the way?

1887
01:57:04,950 --> 01:57:07,140
Anybody?
Anybody for some predictions.

1888
01:57:08,310 --> 01:57:11,400
How about we try to do some predictions
and whoever comes to fucking closest

1889
01:57:11,730 --> 01:57:16,290
gets a, an autograph and
autographed DVD in my brand new DVD,

1890
01:57:16,291 --> 01:57:19,290
let it go. Because by then it'll be the
end of the season, I'll fucking said, Nah,

1891
01:57:19,291 --> 01:57:22,590
I'm not going to do that. Then
you won't fucking buy it. Right.

1892
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:26,820
I need to get you to buy it. Got,
damn it. I suck at marketing. Anyways,

1893
01:57:27,210 --> 01:57:30,810
that's a podcast for this week. It
was very disjointed. I, you know,

1894
01:57:31,050 --> 01:57:33,570
they can't all be gold.
You know,

1895
01:57:33,571 --> 01:57:36,870
even Peyton manning throws an interception
every once in awhile and the file

1896
01:57:36,871 --> 01:57:40,320
drive of a fucking Superbowl
doesn't he? Well, doesn't,

1897
01:57:40,321 --> 01:57:44,370
he actually saw what's his face? Uh,
drew Brees finally getting some props.

1898
01:57:44,820 --> 01:57:47,790
He came in there with John Gruden,
you know,

1899
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:50,320
John Grooms got that
unbelievable intensity that,

1900
01:57:50,340 --> 01:57:52,050
that vein down the middle of his forehead.

1901
01:57:52,230 --> 01:57:55,410
That's one of my favorite
announcers out there, or color men,

1902
01:57:55,411 --> 01:57:57,330
whatever the hell that guy's
doing that guys to shift.

1903
01:57:57,330 --> 01:58:00,410
There's nothing better than an
ex football player. And this is,

1904
01:58:00,430 --> 01:58:04,020
this is provided that they
have broadcasting skills.

1905
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:07,800
Someone either played the game,
coached the game and that type of shit.

1906
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:11,400
And then you get the classic
like broadcast or like a,

1907
01:58:11,430 --> 01:58:15,870
like an Al Michaels or something like
that to call the game. And then, uh,

1908
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:18,630
then you got your crew.
Thank you bill.

1909
01:58:18,631 --> 01:58:21,450
Thank you for breaking that down
as if we didn't fucking notice.

1910
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:23,560
Why don't you just admit,
Bill,

1911
01:58:23,670 --> 01:58:26,650
that you're just babbling at this point
to somehow try and make it to, Oh,

1912
01:58:26,651 --> 01:58:30,270
I'm up to 57 minutes. That qualifies.
I can tap out at this point.

1913
01:58:31,040 --> 01:58:33,810
Don't you guys leave sometimes
three minutes before five.

1914
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:36,180
So what did we learn this week?

1915
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:41,200
We learned that even on major topics
like race bill really doesn't do his

1916
01:58:41,201 --> 01:58:43,030
research.
Uh,

1917
01:58:43,031 --> 01:58:48,031
we learned that I had at why that I got
some fat guy with the milky white ties

1918
01:58:49,441 --> 01:58:52,890
to laugh at himself and he's lost 40
pounds. So I'm not totally a bad guy.

1919
01:58:53,850 --> 01:58:57,270
And uh, I guess from the troops come
back, send them a drink or get, get, um,

1920
01:58:57,450 --> 01:59:01,860
get him a blow job or shut your
face. And evidently they, they,

1921
01:59:01,861 --> 01:59:05,160
they feel the same way of the support.
The troop bumper stickers as I do.

1922
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:07,230
You like how I'm taking one marine,

1923
01:59:07,830 --> 01:59:10,110
his point of view and just saying
that that's everybody's well,

1924
01:59:10,111 --> 01:59:14,930
that's what the fuck I do. That's
what I do. Support the troops.

1925
01:59:15,230 --> 01:59:17,900
I always thought it was ridiculous.
What are those bumper stickers that said,

1926
01:59:17,901 --> 01:59:21,380
I support the troops? It's like,
well, why wouldn't you? What do you,

1927
01:59:21,381 --> 01:59:23,600
what are you rooting for the,
the other team.

1928
01:59:27,170 --> 01:59:32,000
So fucking obvious. I support the
troops. Ice Cream tastes good.

1929
01:59:34,090 --> 01:59:35,530
I like babies.
You know what?

1930
01:59:35,531 --> 01:59:38,170
He's gonna have all kinds
of obvious bumper stickers
on the back of your fucking

1931
01:59:38,171 --> 01:59:41,880
car. I saw a guy at a
big heart on, on his,

1932
01:59:41,881 --> 01:59:44,700
on his side of his house.
It said love our troops.

1933
01:59:44,940 --> 01:59:48,870
It just really gave me the creeps and
every time I see it I want to fucking rip

1934
01:59:48,871 --> 01:59:51,430
it down. Yeah, no, I,

1935
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:55,600
this other guy wrote me an angry fucking
email all about the politics about

1936
01:59:55,601 --> 01:59:57,940
sending the troops over there,
you know? And it's just like,

1937
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:02,140
like he was fucking dropping
all this knowledge, man,

1938
02:00:02,141 --> 02:00:06,430
about what's really going on
with the war man. You know,

1939
02:00:08,260 --> 02:00:12,010
like, I don't realize, like
I don't realize that shit,

1940
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:15,760
but I also realized that those guys
don't determine where the fuck they go.

1941
02:00:15,820 --> 02:00:19,720
All right. So I'll just try not to be a
Dick, you know, pick up in a dick enough,

1942
02:00:20,410 --> 02:00:22,780
haven't I?
I've gotta be honest with you.

1943
02:00:22,781 --> 02:00:25,120
I have no idea what I said
for the last 11 minutes,

1944
02:00:25,121 --> 02:00:29,140
but all I know is I recorded it and you're
listening to it. Okay. So who's worse?

1945
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:34,780
Me. You guys just shaking your heads right
now. Who's really losing his mind? Well,

1946
02:00:34,781 --> 02:00:38,290
maybe I am. Um, that's it.
So I got it. I got like two,

1947
02:00:38,291 --> 02:00:40,930
three weeks off on be hanging out.
Can we go?

1948
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:43,990
I'm doing a lot of spots down the
comedy store. If you're in Los Angeles,

1949
02:00:44,650 --> 02:00:47,440
gotta be working out my shit. If you want
to come down there and watch me bomb,

1950
02:00:47,770 --> 02:00:50,910
lean on the mic, stand and stare
at that. All weather carpet is,

1951
02:00:50,911 --> 02:00:55,870
I work out my bits, uh, pop in down
the comedy store and that's it. Thanks.

1952
02:00:55,871 --> 02:00:59,890
Everybody wrote in and uh,
and that is that.

1953
02:00:59,950 --> 02:01:01,180
I'll talk to you guys next week.

1954
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:21,133
[inaudible]

1955
02:01:39,340 --> 02:01:39,340
[inaudible].
