00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.010
&gt;&gt; Please welcome James McBride.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:21.040
[ Applause ]

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.900
&gt;&gt; James McBride: You like me,
you really like me [laughter].

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.980
Thank you.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.610
So nice to see so many
white people --

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.650
I mean, nice people
here today [laughter].

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.640
It's just wonderful.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.430
I should say that one of the people

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.400
who brought this National
Book Festival back was --

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.600
that is rarely mentioned when
talking about how we got here,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.210
is Laura Bush [assumed
spelling] so [applause].

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.410
Let it be known that a librarian
is -- brought us together.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.400
And with that her party return

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.480
to its former glamor
someday soon [laughter].

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.890
And I ain't kidding.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.940
In any case, I want to talk
for another four or five hours

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.670
about my new book [laughter]
that nobody read,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.740
and then I'll talk
about the [inaudible].

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.040
I'll spend a few minutes.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.490
Is the timekeeper nearby?

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.690
Okay, I'm going to spend like the
first five, eight minutes talking

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.820
about the James Brown book and
then I'll talk about The Color

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.060
of Water and, you know,
The Good Lord Bird,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.140
and then I'll open
the floor to questions

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.370
because I know I don't
have a lot of time.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.600
So a few years ago, well
not too long, my mother died

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.090
in 2010, January 9, 2010.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.870
And six months later my
ex-wife, at the time was my wife,

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.080
decided that she no longer
wanted to be married to moi.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.110 position:56%
So that painful episode was quite --

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.080
was really quite costly
in many ways,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.240 position:56%
particularly financially [laughter].

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.670
So -- well, emotionally as
well, no kidding, you know,

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.670
cross my heart, hope to die.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.390 position:56%
But, so what happened was, you know,
I was working on the John Brown book

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.590
at the time and I call a
call from somebody who was

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.990
from James Brown's family.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.400
Essentially I got a call from a
guy who knew a guy who knew a guy,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.870
and ended up meeting, you
know, a couple members

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.170
of James Brown's family

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.760
who basically just begged
me to take on this book.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.060
And I first turned it down.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.720
I said, it's just too much trouble
because James Brown left all

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.990 position:56%
of his money, his worth was between
100 and $150 million, he left it all

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.910
to educate poor black
and white children

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.210
in South Carolina and Georgia.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.510
That was 10 years ago [applause].

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.280
Well, you know, now you can
start crying after applauding,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.070 position:56%
because to that -- since -- that
was 10 years ago, December 25, 2006,

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.730
and more than 10 years
ago that happened.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.560
He laid his will out and
to date not a single dime

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.590
of that has gone to a single kid.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.090 position:56%
And that's because his will has been
tied up in court in South Carolina,

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.280
which is like a different
country really [laughter].

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.630
And so one of his relatives
really wanted to spring that out.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.480
They wanted free that money up to
-- essentially it was oldest son,

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.610
Terry, and his grandson, Forlando,
and so they asked me to take it on.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.910
At first I turned it down
and then I later agreed

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.030
to do it, and so I took it on.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.060
But what happened was I spent, you
know, I don't know, two and a half,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.200
almost three years fooling
around in South Carolina.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.170
It was very difficult because first

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.440
of all many books have been
written about James Brown.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.170
And, secondly, James
Brown is a very, very --

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.360
he is absolutely impossible
categorize for a lot reasons.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.260
But his life really is a metaphor
for how we can handle race

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.020
in America and why
we can't get along.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.680
Because here's a guy
who during the course

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.970
of his life really
revolutionized American music.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.110
And I'll just give you a
crash, sort of a cheap example

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.750
that musicians will
say, this is horrible.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.160
But this is the blues.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.630
Blues goes like this [musical
sounds] one chord [musical sounds]

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.840
one chord, then you go to the
fourth chord [musical sounds],

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.180
the fourth chord [musical
sounds], then you go back

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.690
to the one chord [musical sounds],
and guess you go to the five,

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.510
then you go to the fourth, then
you go to the one [musical sounds]

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.310
and then you do it again, right.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.940
Well, when you sing the blues --

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.750
when you play the blues
drummers play --

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.700
you know, if you're just
playing fatback 1950 blues,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.880
you're playing -- the drummer
is playing the hit two and four,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.870
he's going [musical sounds] and
he's playing that hit like that.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.750
What James Brown did in his
music was that instead of going

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.040
to the one, four, five,
which he did in altered tones

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.630
and in altered time, thanks to Pee
Wee Ellis and Fred Wesley and some

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.960
of his other musicians,
including Maceo Parker's brother,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.480
who teaches here in Washington,
D. I can't remember his name.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.420
But what he did was that he
started creating music with --

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.720
instead of the beat laying
on the two and the four,

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.510
it would fall on the one of the
third bar, so it would go --

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:12.050
[ Musical Sounds ]

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:20.760
And so that sort of rise and lilt
was actually previously unknown

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.930
in the R and B world.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.380
And it sounds like a small
thing, but I remember when one

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.160
of the great jazz drummers
that played Charlie Parker went

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.290
to South Africa --
went to [inaudible].

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.170
I heard this story from
the [inaudible] musician.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.470 position:56%
I can't remember the drummer's name.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.770
He's still alive.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.620
But he went to play and he was
playing with an African troop,

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.400
and there was an, you know,
African troop like 10, 12 drummers

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.850
and they were playing together and
they were going [musical sounds],

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.650
and this guy had his
set out, and this is one

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.080
of the greatest jazz drummers.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.470
I can't remember his
name at the moment

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.820 position:56%
because there's so many of you here.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.830
But -- and so the leader
nodded to him

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.450
to tell him to come in on the one.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.390
And this guy, he was listening and
three times he tried to come in

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.710
and the third he just couldn't
so he threw his sticks up

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.140
and laughed and just got up.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.550
And the drummer, the leader
drummer said, you know,

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.460
he motioned to the drummers
and he backed them off

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.550
and they showed him
where the one was.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.310
And then he got in to where
the one was, he just went crazy

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:25.410
because he found this freedom
in the sophisticated syncopation

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.790
of what African drummers
are capable of doing.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.630
What James Brown did was
he managed to take his --

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.910 position:56%
the business of rhythm -- not James
Brown, James Brown and the musicians

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.360
in his band, most of whom by
the way were from the south,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.590
they took this confined element
of the one, four, five blues

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.840
and using just the one chord,
staying on the one chord,

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.640
they found ways to create a rhythm

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.760
that we still here
today in hip hop music.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:58.950 position:56%
Another one who did it to great
effect was Grover Washington Junior.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.210
When you hear this [musical sounds]
that was created by a saxophonist

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.880
by Philadelphia named
Grover Washington Junior.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.540 position:56%
But it wasn't as widespread as James
Brown's music, but it's still heard

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.840
in a lot of hip hop music.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.350
And to show you how
advanced James Brown was

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.510
and to show you how much
musicians really respected him,

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.490
I asked Grover -- because I
worked with Grover Washington

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.570
on a couple songs, I played piano
in a couple of songs in the studio,

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.980
and I asked him, I said, how come
you never played with James Brown?

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.720
Because Grover is a
funky saxophone player.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.030
He said, he laughed.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.890
He said, James Brown, he said I
wasn't funky enough [laughter].

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.700
And Grover Washington, of
course, was plenty funky.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.800
But James Brown's musicians
created a sound that is --

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.080
that is now known, you
know, around the world.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.470
And the irony is that James
Brown never even made the cover

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.570
of Rolling Stone Magazine
until he died.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.490
He was always seen as like the
scream at the end of the dial.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.960
But his music accomplished
everything.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.480
He recorded with Alva Nelson,
who was a pioneer jazz arranger.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.120
He recorded jazz songs, blues.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:06.700 position:56%
His career encompassed the entire --
a gigantic spectrum of musical life.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.020
And so his catalogue is
worth a lot of money.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.080
But, unfortunately, his
personal life was a shambles.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:17.390 position:56%
And for that reason his will and
his estate has been tied up in court

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.690
in South Carolina for 10 years.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:21.700
And ironically the only
person that has been following

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:26.780 position:56%
up James Brown's will and -- will
and his estate, and you can read all

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.460
about it, is a 63 year old,
white grandmother from Newberry,

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.760
South Carolina named Sue Summer.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.680
And the authorities down there,
and when I say the authorities,

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.600
the lawyers, the [inaudible]
of powerful attorneys,

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:43.720
including the attorney general and
the other judges that are involved,

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.430
they all have a little hand in
this, because it's all, you know,

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.340
I give you a little,
you give me a little.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.640
You know how it works.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.200
This is Washington, D.C. They
tried to lock her up twice.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:09:00.500 position:56%
You know, the freedom -- she drops
a lawsuit for freedom of information

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.350
and they try to get her
notes and they've threatened

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:04.700
to put her in jail two times.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.060
One time they delivered a subpoena
while she was putting her two year

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.470
old grandmother --
grandchild to sleep.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:14.450
And so that's -- you know, what
really needs to happen in the case

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.630
of James Brown is that
the Department of Justice,

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:20.680
or some federal agency, needs to
move into South Carolina and say,

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.170
this is what the guy wanted
and why is it not happening?

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.600
And if that doesn't happen
it's just going to continue

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.580
because it's a gigantic
cow that can be milked.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.430
They're just milking the estate.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.830
They drop a law -- this
one has to read the book.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.410
He's charging because
he's got to read the books

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:35.750
on James Brown so he charge.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:39.020
This one he -- they need to analyze
this so they get this law firm.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:43.670
And it's just -- it changed my
perspective about the world.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:47.460 position:56%
You know, my mother was -- my mother
was a person who really marveled

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.430
at stuff that was -- that was
like -- that she would marvel,

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.110
because she really -- like she
really enjoyed having a car.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.300
She just thought that was
like the coolest thing.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.040
Like if you just give her a
new car there's nothing --

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.680
you know, when The Color of Water
became a big success I just bought

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.980
her a car and she thought
that I had just

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.010
like given her the
United States treasury.

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:07.440 position:56%
Really. But she had -- you know,
she had this innocence and a quality

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.420
of wonder about things that
all of her children had.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.700
And it's in part because I
did this James Brown book.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.780
It robbed me of that
sparkle for a while.

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.500
It's come back now, only
because I haven't read the book

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.400
and I don't look at
it no more [laughter].

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.250
But it's hard to think that
people will allow such --

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.560
you know, such depravity to go on.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.280
Just, you know, guys in
suits with nice shoes

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.240
and ties just ripping this guy off.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.580
It's just -- it's terrible.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.120
And the irony is that the children

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.860
of South Carolina are among
the poorest in this country.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.160
The other thing to remember is

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.080
that James Brown really
is not so much a child.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.330
You know, he's portrayed in the
media as a guy who grew up in --

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.400
you know, if you saw that movie
which was about 40% fiction,

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.430 position:56%
you know, he grew up in a cabin
and, you know, I'm a little bit done

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.130
with the whole business of black
folks, or poor white folks growing

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.450
up in cabins and just sitting
there, you know, holding --

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.780
eating grits and I mean
[inaudible], you know.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.960
Aren't some of them shy or some of
them are allergic to this or that

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.260
or the other, and some of them --

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.650
don't the brother pick
on the sister.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.760
I mean aren't they
normal to some degree?

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.920
Please. Well, what happened with
James Brown was his family was

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.590
from a section of South
Carolina called -- where the --

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:21.410
where the federal government,
along with GE and General --

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.380
GE and Dupont Company decided

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.210
to create something called the
Savannah River nuclear site.

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.340
And what they did was they chose
an area where there was a river,

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.200
where there was -- where there
were not a lot of people with power

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.160
and they just simply moved six
towns, 300 square miles of area.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.670
They just made all the people move

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:42.390
and they created the Savannah
River nuclear site, which is really

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.190
where they create bombs,
where they process plutonium

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.350
and uranium to make nuclear bombs.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:49.680
And that's how James
Brown became displaced.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.320
So when you see him in the cabin
in the woods he was in the cabin

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.940
in the woods because his family
was a family of sharecroppers

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.910
that had lived there
for several generations.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:00.910
That entire area of all those poor
people, including white farmers

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:05.440
and businesses and hundreds and
dozens -- hundreds of businesses,

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.770
post offices, schools,
everything, they were moved.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.570
And this happened in 1951.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.580
And while there's record of
-- in fact, Look Magazine --

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.880
Life Magazine bit off
a really telling --

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.990
you know, touching story about
a school teacher who's class had

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.600
to move, building moved,
and children watched it go,

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.920
and they swore they were -- you
know, they were staying there.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.760
Their grandfather was
buried there and so forth.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.380
There wasn't a peep of a noise
made about 8000 some odd share --

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.770
black sharecroppers
who were displaced.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:36.790
And they -- the majority of
people who were displaced

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:42.430 position:56%
by this nuclear -- this nuclear bomb
making facility were poor blacks

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.790
from that area, and James
Brown's family was among them.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.780
So in many ways he's a
child of the nuclear age.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.460
And then, of course,
he became a great star

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:54.430
and he created this
revolutionary sounds.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:55.730
And that's it.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.870 position:56%
And the book is basically my journey
to discover James Brown in a way

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.890
that people haven't done before.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:02.980
So it's not a biography like, you
know, how you go to the book store

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.500
and you read a biography
and then you go to the back

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.980
to see how the guy died [laughter]?

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.020
It's not one of those
types of books.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:12.000
Basically I talked to people
who knew him very well

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.870
and show the world from their
perspective, like Miss Emma --

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:19.750
Miss Emma Austin who knew James
Brown for 40 some odd years.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.580
And these -- I'm talking
about bright,

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:28.280
deep people who really understood
him, Sue Summer, of course,

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.210
Mr. Charles Bobbit, who was --
managed James Brown for years

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.140
and also managed Michael Jackson.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.870
And, of course, Pee Wee Ellis.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.530
Pee Wee Ellis is the guy
who wrote Cold Sweat.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.900
He wrote a lot of jazz standards.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.270
For those of you who
are jazz musicians,

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:44.550
if you know who Jaco
Pastorius is, a bassist.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:47.880
Jaco Pastorius has a really
famous song called Chicken,

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.780
which everybody thinks
Jaco Pastorius wrote

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.120
but he did not write it.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.420
Pee Wee Ellis wrote it.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.880
Pee Wee Ellis is an extraordinarily
gifted tenor saxophonist,

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.180
who studied with Sonny Rollins

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.840
and entered James Brown's
band in around 1964.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.990
And if you hear James Brown's
music after 1964 that's

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:05.350
where he makes this big evolution.

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:07.660
And that's because James Brown
would go into his rehearsal

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.130
and he would say, [inaudible]
I want to do that like that.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:12.870
And Pee Wee would just
translate it to the musicians.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:14.720
You know, when I was a kid we
used to make fun of James Brown.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.000
You know, I'll be James
Brown, you be the translator.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.300
[inaudible].

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.980
James Brown said that
you have to go over

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.280
and give me some --
[inaudible] [laughter].

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:28.830
But he was enormously talented.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.650
He was a great artist.

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:33.440
And we forgive a lot of our artists
for what they do, but we can't seem

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.740
to forgive James Brown
for what he's done.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.490
Because his marriages were a mess.

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.900 position:56%
At the end of his life he had drug
-- you know, the guy never did drugs

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.050 position:56%
or drank or smoked most of his life.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.940
And at the end of his life
he did all of those things.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.750
He certainly did drugs.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.590
And the reason why
is because he saw --

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:55.750
he had seen that he just
destroyed so much that --

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:58.480
behind him, and he wanted
so much for his community.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.610
This is a guy who lived, you know,

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:03.640
10 miles from where he
was born after he died.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.310
When James Brown died
he could see the towers

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:09.570
of the Savannah River nuclear
site from his front porch.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.370
And he used to tell Charles Bobbit,
his manager, he said, you know,

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.510
look at the -- you see
them towers, Mr. Bobbit,

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.440
he said, that's the government.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.110
They're listening to me.

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:19.830
They're listening through my teeth.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:24.470
You know, he lost his touch
with reality in so many ways.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:28.920 position:56%
But at bottom, despite the fact that
his band disliked him intensely,

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:35.220 position:56%
and despite the fact that he did not
love women, James Brown loved music.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.830
He didn't love women at all.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.720
He wasn't capable of
truly loving a woman.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:44.270
Despite all that, I don't know of
any other star that I can think

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:48.270
of that has left every penny he
made to educate poor children

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:50.750
in his state and the
neighboring state.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.120
That's a very unusual thing.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.290
And it's because he felt
at the end of his life

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:58.120
that we had not finished
the job, and frankly you

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.010
and I know that he's right.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:06.280 position:56%
So from -- on that somber note, I'll
now tell you some Milton Berle jokes

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.580
and we'll just all [laughter].

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.940
No, are we passed the eight
minute mark or whatever?

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.910
Oh, the timekeeper was
hypnotized [laughter].

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.630
She just -- well, a few notes
about The Good Lord Bird.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.290
The Color of Water, first.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.060
I explained to you that
my mother died in 2010.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.360
She lived a very good life.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.180
She was 88 years old.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.850
You know, she died at home.

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:33.770
She waited until my -- all
the kids came before she died.

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.910
Like my brother, Hunter,
had just gotten married.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:39.250
She waited for him to get married
and he went -- he got married.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:41.970
He went to Puerto Rico or something
like that and she, you know,

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.000
it was clear that she was dying.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.190
And so she waited until he
came back home and he saw her

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.120
and then she passed away.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.290
She was actually -- I mean,
she was -- she was pretty --

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:52.800
she was planning to see that
movie, what's that movie --

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.490
what's that movie with the
cartoons, the cartoon characters

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:58.270
and the real characters together?

00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:59.570
It begins with an a.

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:00.870
[inaudible]

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.170
Huh?

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:03.470
[ Inaudible ]

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:04.770
No, not Roger Rabbit.

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:06.070
Yeah [laughter].

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:07.370
No, it's some movie.

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:08.670
She was --

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:09.970
[ Inaudible ]

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:11.710
Avatar. Yeah, she was planning to
see Avatar like the week she died.

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:13.520
Like, she was like, well,
we're going to go see Avatar.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.320
I'm like, I don't think so mom.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:22.220
But, you know, it was --
it was horribly difficult.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:26.680
She's buried in North Carolina
in the colored cemetery there

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.120
because when my father

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.590 position:56%
and my grandparents got buried they
were buried in the colored cemetery,

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:34.930
which is now closed to,
you know, to all newcomers.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.090
So even in death my mother was
like, you know, she integrated.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.380
She's like the only white
person there [laughter].

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.190
I was like, oh boy.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.000
But, you know, when I
pulled up to that cemetery

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.870
and I saw her coffin I just
-- it was like surreal.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.990
I said, this is not really,
you know -- but it was real.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.520
But I'm grateful to her.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.530
And, you know, it's
funny because yesterday,

00:17:55.530 --> 00:18:00.160
or Thursday I got the
National Medal of --

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.780
National Humanities Medal from
President Obama [inaudible].

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:13.360
I got it from him so [applause].

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.810
Well, I didn't mention it
so you could, you know,

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.140
I mean there's a lot of
people who are more qualified.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.440
But, you know, they called me.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.020
I said, okay, I'll take it.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.910
But I was -- you know, I was
sitting like right in the front

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:27.080
and I saw him talking and I said --

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:32.090
I said to myself, I wish my
mother could see this, you know.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.780
And I bet you -- I said to
myself, I bet you he says

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.890
that every once in
a while, you know.

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:38.570
He's a gracious dude, man.

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:40.860
He knows -- you could see
like when he did it --

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.300
you could see he does this a lot,
but that he gets a little pleasure

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.180
out of doing it every time.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.920
I know politicians are very skilled
at saying, hey, how's the kids?

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.800 position:56%
But you can see he really enjoys it.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.900 position:56%
And people just -- they just -- they
just love him in the White House.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.970
I mean, they really respect him.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:57.990
And we're going to -- you
know, we're not going to miss

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:00.870
because he said himself,
I'm not going anywhere.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:04.330
You know, the world's not going
to end after November 9, you know,

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:05.630
unless Donald Trump wins.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:09.340
But, you know, I really
feel [laughter].

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:13.290
No, I'm just -- I'm just kidding,
I'm just kidding [laughter].

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:19.460
Look, I just finished reading
William Shirer's book, The Rise

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.990
and Fall of the Third
Reich, and the parallels

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:24.730
between Adolf Hitler's rise

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.900
and Donald Trump's rise
are truly disturbing.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.630
William Shirer was a truly
good -- really great writer.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.990
And by the way, for those of you
who are interested in writing,

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:35.750
he wasn't really -- he
was a radio reporter.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:39.030
But the reason why the book is so
good in part is because, I mean,

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:43.110
it takes the linear approach to
the -- you know, to this event,

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:46.010
to this -- you know, to this
evil genius, but it also --

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.030
the reporting is so deep.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.180
The reporting on the
book is so deep.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.670
Moving to The Good Lord Bird,

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:55.030
I must have read maybe 25
books about John Brown.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:20:01.060
I initially wanted to write
a book about Abraham Lincoln.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:04.090
But then, you know, I just
-- I just couldn't do it.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:07.770
I mean, it's been done
so well before, you know.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.710
And then I wanted to write
about slavery in a way

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:12.880
that made people laugh and that
brought -- because, you know,

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.460
Americans are very funny people.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:15.880
Like we're really good people.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.820
I mean, I know all of you ain't,

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.360
but most of you [laughter]
are very, very good people.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.760
No, but we like to -- I wanted
to write about slavery in a way

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:28.900
that would show people what it
was like without making them feel

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.040
like they're taking their medicine.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.000
Because every time I read one
of these books about, you know,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.230
what happens in -- not every time
but, you know, you read these books

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:39.720
about black history and you go,
I know what's going to happen.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.510
You know, why do I not care?

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:42.810
Let me see.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.110
You know, did the Knick's win?

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:47.920
I mean, because you know -- you
know, you kind of know what --

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.930
and that's not really a way to
tell a story, because what you have

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:54.090
to really tell is like,
okay, the Iraq war went on.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:55.440
We were all here.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.990
Everybody was here when all this --

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.460
you know, when all this heavy
policing business went on.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.350
And, you know, you [inaudible]
and the yellow journalism,

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.940
you have to salute the flag
and pretend you -- you know.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:06.740
How many people actually
stood up and said, you know?

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.290
I mean, Terry Gross
-- other than Terry?

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:11.920
How many people other than
Terry Gross said, you know?

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.690
So I wanted to write a book to
show people how powerful slavery is

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:19.480
and how slavery makes
slaves of us all.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.660
One of the good things about
this era in which we live is

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.780
that white people have finally come
to the realization, many, not all

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.280
but many have come
to the realization

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.870
that if we don't solve this
problem of racism we really are

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:33.470
in for -- in for a long day.

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:35.920
I remember when I was in college
we'd have these talks about racism.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.670
We'd meet about something and
it would be like eight blacks,

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.550
two whites, and we'd have a
long talk and then everyone,

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.430
but now it's not that way.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:46.950
Now more white people are
seeing what the deal is.

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:50.240
In any case, the only reason
I wrote about John Brown's --

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.780
you know, I wrote the book,
create a create of the onion was

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:57.210
because I didn't think I could
write about a girl really.

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:59.310
I just didn't feel
qualified to write about it

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.810
from a girl's perspective.

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:02.300
So I said, well, if
it's a boy pretending

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.560
to be a girl then I won't
look so bad [laughter].

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.000
So I did that.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.940
And then I just -- I love
what John Brown tried to do.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:13.390
I love it when someone stands up
and says this is what I represent.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.920
And it's really -- you know, it
was beyond malevolence for him.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.910
He really felt in his heart
that black people were equal.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:24.490
And, you know, that really
must have made him seem crazy.

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:27.390
And the historians who have
written about the period,

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.700
at least until the
last 10 years or so,

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.340
treated John Brown
like he was crazy.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:34.510
And he was probably was a little
bit dysfunctional or had some sort

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:36.390
of schizophrenia, you
know, something.

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:38.240
We all got a little taste
of something [laughter].

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.770
So anyway, I just wanted
to make it funny.

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:43.260
And I'm so glad that
it reached people.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.660
And it's just been a delight.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.210
It's been a really nice ride.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.360
Well, we have to open the
floor to questions now.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.770
So, you know, feel
free to ask questions.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:55.410
And, if you have them, you know,
you can ask any question you want.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:59.390
You know, I'll be happy to try
to answer any questions you have.

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:03.650
IS that the mic guy
or a question guy?

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:04.950
Okay, okay.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:06.250
Yes? You have a question?

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:10.510
Oh okay. Well, all right, you
go ahead and I'll repeat it.

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:16.540
[ Inaudible ]

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.960
Okay, the question was, James
Brown was an entrepreneur.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.830
He had a radio station
and knew a lot about that.

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:24.450
He was an entrepreneur, but
he wasn't a very good one.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:28.120
He had three radio stations,
one in Baltimore and two in --

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.000
one in Augusta and one
I think in Tennessee.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.660
But he really wasn't that
good of a businessman.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.360
He didn't know how
to run a business.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.570
He didn't know how to
delegate authority.

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:39.120
So, and he wasn't a
great businessman.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.420
Yes?

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.890
&gt;&gt; Hi, I was going to ask
you to speak a little bit

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:47.730
about how you came to
write Song Yet Sung.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.030
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Okay.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:51.190
&gt;&gt; And who are some of
your favorite writers?

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:52.490
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Okay, well --

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:53.790
&gt;&gt; Two questions.

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:55.110
&gt;&gt; James McBride: I wrote
Song Yet Sung because I was --

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:58.750
became a fan of Harriet Tubman
and wanted to dramatize her life

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:01.550
in a way that was -- I
thought was interesting.

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:05.650
And also, I wanted to -- I wanted
to kind of have a perspective

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:09.350
of if a slave woke up now and
heard some of the violence

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:13.200
in today's hip hop music,
so called hip hop music,

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.190
what would he or she think?

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:17.710
So that kind was -- that
was the impetus to do it.

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:22.470 position:56%
Some of my favorite writers are the
normal ones, you know, Toni Morrison

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:25.330
and Faulkner and all
the -- I read everybody.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:28.270
I read a lot of history books.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:32.020
Leon Litwack is a favorite of mine.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:38.020
He wrote Been in the Storm so Long
and, I think, Trouble in Mind.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.690
I just told you about
William Shirer.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:44.190
I read mostly history books.

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.200
Okay, yes, next question.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.570
&gt;&gt; First of all I just want to
thank you for The Color of Water.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.940
It was very impactful for me in
my life and I want to thank you

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.650
for telling your story to us.

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.020
Secondly, I didn't know
a lot about James Brown.

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.920 position:56%
But as you're talking it reminded me

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.690
of having read Charles
Dickens' The Bleak House.

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:05.990
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Uh-huh.

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:08.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And also Franz Kafka's The Trial.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:12.340
And I'm wondering trying to
connect these different worlds

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:16.230
and different periods of history
whether there's some universal link

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:20.500
between what James Brown went
through and is going through now

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.260
with his estate and what it
tells us about human nature?

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:28.040 position:56%
I just throw it out there because as
you're talking about it, it just --

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.770
you know, things were
going off in my head.

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:31.070
So --

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.370
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Well.

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:34.680
&gt;&gt; What do you think
James Brown's experience

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.280
with his estate tells us
about our human nature?

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:43.690
&gt;&gt; James McBride: That's
a very good question.

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:47.230
We, as a society that have --
we have become so litigious.

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:48.530
Is that the right word?

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:49.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.130
&gt;&gt;

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:52.430
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Sorry,
attorneys here, I know a third

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:53.730
of you are attorneys and I
truly apologize [laughter].

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:57.810
I am not trying to --
everything I say I don't mean

00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:02.410
and I take it back before
I say it [laughter].

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:06.130
But what happened -- what has
happened is that we are society

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:09.220
where -- look, in a society where
you rob people of their culture,

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:16.880
when you take people's cultural
richness and then sell cereal

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:23.380
with it and beer and soft drinks
to make money, the result is going

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.820
to be happened to James
Brown's estate.

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:30.590
Where people try to sue us so they
can get a new car and better house.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:35.050
And, I mean, it's part
in parcel for a life

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:36.470
that happens in the music business.

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:41.330
I covered Michael Jackson in 1984
when he was doing his victory tour.

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:42.630
We came here.

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:43.930
We came to Robert Kennedy Stadium.

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:45.600
Man, you should have seen
him dance in those --

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.730
I mean, he was just unconscious.

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:54.080
And he was surrounded by a bunch
of, you know, people who were --

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.380
just didn't care about
him, you know.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.490
People cared -- Don
King was one of those

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:01.990
who sucked off the
cow in those days.

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:04.960
The only one who cared about
him really were his brothers

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.260
and his mother.

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.860
I have tremendous respect
for Michael Jackson's mother.

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.440
I don't talk about her
publicly, but Mrs. --

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.680
Katherine is a very good mother.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:17.800
She raised, what, 10 kids in
Hollywood and they stuck together.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.640
I think she did a very good job.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:25.370
So the short answer to the
young lady's question is,

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:30.960
and she's very young,
you're young, you are young,

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.530
is that people will do evil things.

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:37.660 position:56%
I think it's not so much what people
do, it's our response to their evil

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:42.130
that counts because
we can't control them.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:45.500
I hope that answers your
question at least a little bit.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.800
Yes?

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.250
&gt;&gt; Okay, hi, I'm Naomi
[assumed spelling]

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:52.190
and I want -- I have two questions.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:55.720
The first is your mom was a --

00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:00.470 position:56%
I don't think she was a Holocaust
survivor but she came from that part

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:03.160
of the world that was
persecuted, right?

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.460
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Yeah.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.330
&gt;&gt; And I know that she converted.

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:07.630
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Right.

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:08.930
&gt;&gt; You had a great book.

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:10.230
My mom loves that book.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.750
My mom is a Holocaust survivor,
and I wanted to thank you for that.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.620
But did she at all identify
herself with being Jewish

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:20.000
or formally Jewish, or did she just
basically pack that away and --

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.500
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Well, you know,
you said identify yourself with --

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:27.070
it's not a real easy word to
really -- you know, what's Jew?

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:29.180
You know. What's black?

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.780
I think -- I'll put it this way.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.780
When my mother converted
Christianity she thought she had

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:37.940
walked away from Judaism forever.

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:39.240
And in many ways she had.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.540
She never turned back.

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:43.320
But then on the other hand,
my sisters, a couple of them,

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.620
were interested in Judaism.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:47.360
She encouraged them
to study Judaism.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.470
And my -- a couple of
my nephews as well.

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.830
She said, look, it didn't work for
me but it's a beautiful religion.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:55.510 position:56%
That's about as close -- I mean, she
got -- she got to know her sister.

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:57.960
She came -- she came
full circle in terms

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.650 position:56%
of her bitterness towards Judaism
because she saw it through the prism

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:03.240
of her father's brutality.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.160
But me, personally,
just so you know,

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.400
I really couldn't care less
which religion you are.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.030
I mean, I was raised in the
Baptist Church and I, you know --

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:12.910
but you won't see me
going to see, you know,

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:15.850
some of these maker preachers
taking poor people's money

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:17.150
like some of these numbskulls.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:18.660
You won't see me doing that.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.970
I think if a person is a
Muslim or Hindu or Buddhist,

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:23.600
it's all the same, you know.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.800
Love somebody, it doesn't
really matter.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:29.220
If you're -- listen, religion
is ripping us apart now.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.040
It's ripping the world apart,
because people run around claiming

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.870
to be Muslim and they're not
Muslims, they claim to be Muslims,

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:38.040
are murdering innocent people.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.780
John Brown was a Christian.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.530
He claimed he was a Christian, and
some people called him a terrorist.

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:44.790
But he didn't kill
innocent children.

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:47.300
He fought people who were his size.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:51.270
So we have to be careful with
this whole business of religion.

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:53.390
You can't use it as a baseball bat.

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:56.150
But it was a very good question,
madam, and I hope I answered it.

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:58.580
&gt;&gt; The one I really want
to ask you about was --

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.770
&gt;&gt; One question.

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:02.070
&gt;&gt; Song Yet Sung.

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:03.370
Can I ask you one question
about that?

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:04.670
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Go ahead.

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:05.970
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:08.320
You did a lot of your
research in Dorchester County

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:14.300
and I did the whole Underground
Railroad tour and it was amazing.

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:15.690
I have a place on Tilghman Island.

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:17.260
Were you able to get there?

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.880
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Yeah, I
got to Tilghman Island, yeah.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.310
You know, very nice,
very nice [laughter].

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:28.280
Yeah, you know, I never saw that
area from the prism of today,

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:33.110
I always saw it from
the prism of 1850 so --

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:34.710
but I did see, I did enjoy it.

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:36.750
Very beautiful area.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.030
Should I go to that side now?

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:40.350
Go ahead, please.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:43.770
&gt;&gt; Hi, I recently read The
Good Lord Bird for a book club

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:47.750
and I was actually very
surprised by how funny it was.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:49.340
And I wanted to thank you for that

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:52.700
because I think it made the reading
experience much more enjoyable

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.000
for me.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.880
It's a very heavy topic, of
course, but I think the little bits

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.850
of humor really sort of, you
know, it helped to tell it

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:04.310
in a way I thought that
was new and different.

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:06.120
But I will say it made
a lot of the members

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.780
of my book club very
uncomfortable in some areas,

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.450
particularly with the Frederick
Douglass [inaudible] but,

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:12.750
you know --

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.690
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Well, I had --
I just -- it was just so funny.

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:16.490
That's the only reason
I made Frederick --

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:20.040
the Frederick Douglass thing
[inaudible] it was just so funny.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.080
I couldn't -- I couldn't
resist [laughter].

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.680
&gt;&gt; Well my question is,
you talked about Onion,

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.170
which of course is our
main character in the book,

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:31.860
and Onion is a boy who's
mistaken as a girl and you talked

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:34.300
about not feeling qualified
to tell the story

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.260
from the perspective of a girl.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:39.680
And I wonder why you were
interested in telling it

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.010 position:56%
from that perspective to begin with?

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:42.320
What was sort of your
thinking behind it?

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.800
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Oh, well,
that's a good question.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:49.060 position:56%
Because during slavery, and even now
in American society, black women,

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:52.970
they live in a place that is
-- they're like dinosaurs.

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:54.490
They walk alone.

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:56.850
They're really at the
bottom of everything.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:59.820
I mean, I'm not trying to put words
into the mouth of black women here,

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:04.120
so if I say it wrong, I
truly apologize [inaudible].

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:08.430
But -- so I wanted the world of
slavery seen from the prism of a --

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:11.790
of a little black girl,
because they were the ones

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:13.910
who were the least powerful.

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:16.510
But I didn't feel qualified
to write about it.

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:18.010
Like, you know, I don't
know how to do hair.

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.960
I don't understand -- I don't
understand the power of hair

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.470
and how you look, you know.

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:26.240
As you can see, what does
hair mean to me [laughter]?

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:29.430
Hair means nothing to
me, nothing my friend.

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:34.100
So that's why I -- that's
why I chose that approach.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.400
Yes?

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.890
&gt;&gt; I, too, am from
[inaudible] County

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:42.110
and your synopsis was very succinct
regarding the Savannah River site

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:43.980
and all the other things
going on there.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.690
My question to you
has to do with your --

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:50.400
I guess your reading history.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.360
Are there particular books
that influenced you and,

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.840
if so, in what way or how?

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.350
Is there a particular
book or books that stand

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:59.600
out in your mind, thank
you, as a reader?

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.560
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Okay, that's a
good -- that's a good question.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.860
Not really [laughter].

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:10.210
No, only because I read so much.

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:13.740 position:56%
And everything -- I can generally
remember the last thing I ever read,

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:18.470
you know, which in this case was
the -- William Shirer's book.

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:21.560
You learn when you're a writer,
and you've been a journalist,

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.570
that you have to read between
the lines and that there's no

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:26.680
such thing as real subjectivity.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.690
Even William Shirer's book kind of
short shrifts the whole business

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:33.610
of what was happening to the
Jews during Hitler's rise,

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:35.310
because Hitler was
brutal towards the Jews

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:38.670 position:56%
from the very beginning [inaudible].

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:44.640
And he -- and I don't know really
what his true response to it was

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.310
when he was in Berlin, because I
just have a hard time believing

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:50.710
anybody who walking around
Berlin did not see the brutality

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:52.890
that was happening
to the Jews there.

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:55.370
So you learn to read
between the lines.

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:57.120
That's the short answer
to your question.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.810
But I don't have a specific
book that -- I do --

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:03.140
some of the William
Still slave narratives --

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:05.360
some of the slave narratives in --

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.360
from William Still still
sticks in my heart.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.660
You know, the first person
that counts is slaves,

00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:13.000
African Americans talking
about this,

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.240
the lives of slaves
stick in my heart.

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.540
But no specific book.

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.800
Did that answer your question?

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:25.250
&gt;&gt; Yes, I guess at the heart
I'm curious why you decided

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:26.550
to become an author?

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:27.850
What [inaudible]?

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:29.150
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Go to the
mic, I'm sorry I can't hear you.

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:31.270
&gt;&gt; Sorry, I guess I'm curious
as to what drove you to write?

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:33.000
I mean, what was it
that made you so --

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.240
&gt;&gt; James McBride: That
particular book or in general?

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.540
&gt;&gt; In general?

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:39.270
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Well,
let me think now.

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:41.360
What drives me to write?

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.660
Let's see [laughter].

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:46.420
I don't know.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:48.510
It's a very difficult question.

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:56.040
[ Laughter ]

00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:00.340 position:56%
Very tough, very difficult question.

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:02.000
Try to [swooshing noise].

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.460
Look, you know, when I was working
as a journalist I used to say

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:10.320
to myself, I can't tell
the whole story here.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.070
You know, you go -- my first -- one
of my first stories was about --

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:15.720
was about a warehouse fire
in Wilmington, Delaware.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.020
I was a [inaudible] reporter.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.320
I just finished Columbia
and I went to --

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.880
I was a cop report in Wilmington
News Journal and they went me

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.490
out to do a fire about --
like just a normal house fire.

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:25.280
You know, and I stood
there with my pad

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.050
and I'm watching the
house burn down.

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:28.360
I'm talking to the cops.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.260
Oh man, this is a -- you
know, four -- how many?

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.610
Okay, four alarm fire.

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:35.470
And I went back and I wrote like a
10 inch story and I said to myself,

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:37.410
this is not really what happened.

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:38.710
You know, something else happened.

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:40.440
Like maybe the landlord
didn't pay the --

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.690
or maybe the tenant just
got drunk, or the --

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:45.630
you know, something
-- there's more here.

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:48.360
And as I got older the
story just kept getting --

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.480
I just began to see the stories
getting bigger and bigger

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:55.120
and then there was no creative
way as a journalist to tell it.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.810
And so when I was about maybe 28,

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:58.830
29 years old I was working
at The Post, I quit.

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:00.260
I just quit.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:01.630
I moved to New York.

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:04.040
I was overwhelmed and
I just played saxophone

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:06.710
and wrote music for nine years.

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:08.450
I played with a, you
know -- I played with --

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:12.200 position:56%
I wrote songs for Grover Washington,
Anita Baker, and wrote songs

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.630
for Barney and I wrote a
couple musicals that failed.

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:16.810
Yeah, I wrote -- I wish I
wrote the I Love You song.

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:20.810
I wouldn't even be here,
okay [laughter] so.

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:25.130 position:56%
I would not even be here, all right.

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:26.610
But I did not write that.

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:30.560
And then -- and during that
time I wrote The Color of Water.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.430
I wrote it in -- while I was, you
know, playing Jimmy Scott's band

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:36.230
in the back of vans with guys
smoking weed and, you know,

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:39.400
and I never told anybody that
I was writing about my mother.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.970
You know, I never told
anybody I was doing anything.

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:44.880
I just was like so happy to get
the gig I would just be quiet.

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.730
And then I -- you know, the
book came out and it just --

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:50.030
it didn't sell right away.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:51.330
It wasn't like an instant --

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:55.040
in fact, it was reviewed with every
other, you know, poor mix race,

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.080
mulatto book that showed
up that month.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:02.270
You know, Divided Soul,
Bagels and Chicken [laughter],

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:03.840
you know, Color of Water.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.330
It was all this, you know.

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:08.220
But what happened was women
started reading it, you know,

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:12.330
young Jewish women aged like,
you know 20 to 80, young,

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:15.190
and they just started putting it
in their book clubs and then --

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:16.530
you haven't lived until you've been

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:18.900
to like a coffee [inaudible]
book club in Teaneck,

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.500
New Jersey [laughter], really.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:27.780
And they say, let's check his
teeth, let's check his teeth.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.080
Okay [laughter].

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.380
Yes, sir?

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:33.620
&gt;&gt; First of all, I'm sorry.

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.690
First of all, you are
a mesmerizing speaker,

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:38.340
[inaudible] word mesmerizing.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.440
I tried to take notes.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:45.360
I just got wrapped up in what you
were saying, but my question is,

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:53.680
as far as I know, in one of
our books, Miracle of Ste.

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:57.630
Anna, was made into a movie.

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:58.930
What did you think of it?

00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:02.040
Do you think it was
true to the book?

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.780
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Yes,
true as it could be.

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.090
I mean, you only have two hours.

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:08.780
In this case two hours and
46 minutes to, you know,

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.460
because Spike Lee does
what he feels like doing.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.830
I thought it was pretty true to it.

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:16.160
I'm not one of those
writers that say, you know,

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.980
they cut my characters, you know.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:21.840
I'm so happy they're
doing it that, you know,

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.370
I'm not real picky about it.

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:27.510
So I was glad that the movie at
least, you know, reflected --

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:30.690
you know, accurately reflected
the general push of the book.

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:33.580
I was disappointed, of course,
when it was a flop but --

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.930
you know, and I'm sure
all of you have seen it.

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:37.230
And I'm glad, I really am.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:42.550
This is my heart, my heart which
is -- I'm crying, I'm crying.

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:46.340
But -- so it's all right.

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:49.120
I mean, I have the
greatest job in the world.

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:52.790
I mean, you know, I get to
write -- I get to put, you know,

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:57.050
words on the page and people
actually like pay me for it.

00:38:57.050 --> 00:39:00.210
So I'm not -- so I
wasn't disappointed.

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:01.510
All righty.

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:02.810
Over here, sir?

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:04.110
&gt;&gt; Yes, thanks very much.

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:06.600
Bringing you back to The
Color of Water and what one

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:11.310
of the previous persons said about
what moved you to write the book,

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:14.560 position:56%
you just seemed to, a moment ago
saying, you know, I was in New York,

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.090
I was playing jazz, and I started
to write this book about my mom.

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:20.610
I don't think there's
a person in this room

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:22.670
who wasn't moved by that book.

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:24.760
So what was it that
moved you to say,

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.990
I got to put this down on paper.

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:30.670
I got to tell this story
of my mom and how she --

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:32.800
&gt;&gt; James McBride: That's a
good -- I mean, fair enough.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.120
I -- at one point in New York --

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:37.170
when I was in New York
I was in Fort Greene.

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:41.570
That's one of the great -- you
know, [inaudible] Spike Lee,

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:44.120
these guys were all walking
around, you know, [inaudible],

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.510
I didn't know any of
these people by the way.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.580 position:56%
I've always walked alone [laughter].

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:53.370
But I was teaching
English to Polish refugees

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:56.400
in a place called St. Stanislaus,

00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:00.060
which was a Catholic
Church in Williamsburg.

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:02.510
And the guy who ran
it was a Catholic guy.

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:03.840
I forget -- his first
name was Raymond.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.140
I forgot his land name.

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:07.450
And the sister who ran it
was kind enough to hire me.

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:10.040
Now, I went from the Washington
Post from being a star report,

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:13.140 position:56%
going to the White House, Regan,
you know, writing my little stories,

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:14.810
and then just teaching
-- standing in front

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:19.300
of like 30 students
teaching English.

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.750
And these were hardworking Polish
people, really hardworking,

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:24.840
who came to America
fresh off the boat.

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.980
You know, that's not -- that's kind
of a pejorative term but, you know,

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:30.620 position:56%
that's a derogatory way of
describing their journey to America.

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.270
But they just arrived.

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:33.620
Most of them were cleaning houses.

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:35.940
Some of them were very educated.

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:40.450
And somehow or another the whole
business of Jewish people came up.

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:42.960
I can't remember, I guess
I was teaching a class,

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:46.070
and the response was, you
know, someone cracked a job

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:50.070
and then it was like -- and I
said to myself like, you know,

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:52.130
what difference does it --
I mean, what -- you know.

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:55.710
And we talked about a little bit,
and I was a little bit disappointed

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:57.830
in some of the responses
to the whole business

00:40:57.830 --> 00:40:59.710
of what Jews are supposed to be.

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:08.370
Now this is in 19 what '88 or
'89, and in some ways it was more

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:11.990
of like what was not
said than what was said.

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:14.750
And that got me to
thinking and then I just --

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:17.080
you know, you live in
-- you live in New York.

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.930
You see the Hasidic
Jewish community,

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:21.660
which is basically a
very shy group of people.

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.880
I mean, they're seen as
like these, you know --

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.390
I don't know how people see
the Hasid's in New York.

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:28.060
But, you know, when
someone complains to me

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:31.220
about the Hasidic people buying
a house, buying an apartment,

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:34.010
and breaking it up into apartments,
buying a building and breaking it

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:36.020
up into apartments and
charging you lots of rent,

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:38.350
all of a sudden it's
like a Jewish thing.

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:41.690
Now if a guy from Greece does that,
well he's just a bum landlord.

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:44.380
But I mean most of these
guys, it's not like they're

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:46.550
like Donald Trump ripping
up parts of the city

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:49.300
and like these giant
developers and selling, you know,

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.880
apartments on Columbus
Square for 30 million

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.280
to some Turk or some Russian.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.650
I mean, they're hustling
and trying to make it.

00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:59.410
So I just kind of just
evolved into the sensibility

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:00.710
of what difference does it make?

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:03.990
And then I just started thinking
about maybe I'm thinking this

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:06.600
because I'm Jewish
myself [laughter].

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:10.650
No, I just -- I just started
to come into this sensibility

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:17.040
of what it must be like to be truly
Jewish in New York at that time.

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:19.170
And so I went -- started going
home and talking to my mother

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:20.470
about where she came from.

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:23.770
And she resisted, and the most she
resisted the more curious I became.

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:27.490
And then when I went to Suffolk,
Virginia and heard the old Jews

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:30.520
from Suffolk talk about what
life was for Jews in the 1930's

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:35.110
in Suffolk, I really, really
-- I really came to it.

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:36.810
And I said this journey
is no different

00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:38.820
than that of African Americans.

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:41.850
In the skin color, yes, but
the journey is the same.

00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:43.810
And it's the journey --
and I'll close by saying

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:47.050
that journey is the same
for Italians, and Irish,

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:50.960
and it's the same for Mexicans,
and Ecuadorians, and Indian people,

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.730
Pakistani people, Chinese,
Asian, Korean, it's the same.

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:57.470
And if we are foolish enough
to close our doors to people

00:42:57.470 --> 00:43:01.150
who don't look like us, we are
closing the door to tomorrow.

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:02.450
I will close with that [applause].

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:03.750
Thank you very much [applause].

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:10.230
