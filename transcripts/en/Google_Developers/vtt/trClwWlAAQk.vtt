MIHAI IONESCU: Hello.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.030
Welcome to our special
edition office

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.780
hours on Google Checkout.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.040
My name is Mihai Ionescu.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.840
I'm a developer advocate
on Google Wallet.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.540
And following our recent
announcement about Google

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.700
Checkout retirement, we wanted
to give developers and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.060
merchants more information
about the process, more

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.400
details, and answer any
relevant questions.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.360
With me today we have Justin
Lawyer, Senior Product Manager

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.350
on Google Wallet and Michael
Hogan, Payments Operation

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.880
Specialist on Wallet.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.680
So let's get started.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.940
First Justin will walk you
through the major things you

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.360
should know, and then
we'll answer

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.280
questions from the moderator.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.760
So let's switch to
the slidedeck.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.580
JUSTIN LAWYER: So we have a
quick presentation here to

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.070
help you understand what this
retirement means for you as a

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.430
Google Checkout merchant.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.650
So the first things we want
everybody to understand is

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.620
there are three things.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.510
First, you can still process
payments through Google

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.590
Checkout for the next
six months.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.360
You'll be able to charge orders
until November 20.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.800
The second thing we'd like you
to understand is that we've

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.910
partnered with best of breed
e-commerce solutions partners

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.220
to be able to help you with the
transition to help make

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.390
that a more seamless
experience for you.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.790
The third thing that we want
to make sure that you

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.060
understand is that you can
contact us at any time during

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.680
this migration for questions
and to help answer any

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.560
questions that you have.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.390
For the agenda today we first
wanted to clarify.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.530
We've heard a number of
questions about what is Google

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.950
Wallet versus Google Checkout
and so we want to [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.240
And then December 20 is the
last day for merchants

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.530
initiate refunds for those
Checkout orders.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.850
For the migration options
there are basically two

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.590
classes of options for
you as a merchant.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.770
If you choose to use Google
Wallet Instant Buy, that is an

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.820
offering for you that offers an
optimized mobile solution.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.229
And you will need to have
a separate payment

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.810
processor for you.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.300
If you are using digital
goods you can

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.250
migrate to that offering.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.710
If you would choose to use one
of our partners you can

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.060
migrate to Braintree for payment
processing or any

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.840
other processor that
you choose.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.710
They're offering discounted
processing for you.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.690
Shopify has discounted plans
if people would like hosted

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.650
storefront.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.500
And FreshBooks is offering an
online invoicing solution for

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.750
anybody that needs invoicing.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.470
For the next part of the agenda
there were a number of

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.340
questions about digital
goods merchants

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.020
using Google Checkout.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.190
So first of all, we want to
basically clarify that sales

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.780
of digital goods are
largely unaffected.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.900
Users of Google Play, Google
Web Store, the Offers

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.680
Marketplace, and the Google
Wallet for digital goods, the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.620
only change that they will
really see is they will be

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.280
using the new Google Wallet
Merchant Center.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.430
So that will basically be
fairly transparent.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.620
For those merchants using Google
Play or other Google

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.670
properties that are also using
the Google Checkout

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.070
notifications and order report
APIs, they will need to

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.010
migrate to the replacement.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.930
MIHAI IONESCU: Thank
you Justin.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.410
So now let's get to the fun
part, answering questions from

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.720
the moderator.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.150
I have the list in front of me
here and I'll go through the

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.380
question and then find someone
who knows the best answer.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.120
So let's start with
the first one.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.870
The first question is, didn't
Google migrate all Google

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.040
Checkout users to Google
Wallet in 2011?

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.100
So Justin, I think you
briefly covered

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.200
it, but can you elaborate?

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.300
JUSTIN LAWYER: So this is
a very good question.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.510
We get asked this frequently,
actually.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.110
And yes, in 2011 we migrated
all buyers on Google to a

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.910
single Google Wallet
unified experience.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.580
So that way all buyers have the
exact same experience and

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.870
they knew what to expect
whenever they saw the pay with

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.120
Google button.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:22.400
The merchant solutions, whether
that was Google Wallet

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.350
for digital goods or Checkout
or Google Play were distinct

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.460
and different for
each of those.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.150
And so those were continuing
under their different names.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.890
MIHAI IONESCU: OK.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.100
Next question is about the
Google Checkout API, so I

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.500
think I'll take that one.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.860
It's my area.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.660
The question is, I have a Google
Checkout API which

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.630
gives me notifications to
unlock digital goods.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.520
I made no changes to my code
when Checkout became Wallet.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.940
It still works.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.020
From my perspective, Wallet is
just a risk in Checkout.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.570
So the question kind of relates
a little bit to what

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.700
Justin just talked about.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.200
From the developer's description
here I take it

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.000
that he or she is using the
digital delivery option on

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.830
Google Checkout, which
is a nice API.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.270
Unfortunately, that will
go away when we

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.940
retire Google Checkout.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.020
The good news is there
is a replacement.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.030
We have the Google Wallet for
digital goods API, which is

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:29.550
very nicely suited to deliver
digital content, digital goods

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.640
to your customers.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.150
You will need to do a little
bit of programming on your

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.410
website because it sounds like
you're nicely integrated and

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.720
you're probably using some key
to unlock digital goods.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.180
So the digital goods API, it's
a nice processing option for

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.500
you and with a little bit of
work on the website you should

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.250
be good to go and have
a nice replacement.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.040
There are also alternatives
out there.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.640
You can look at Braintree, which
has also a nice solution

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.090
for digital goods.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.800
So keep sending us questions
if you have trouble.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.040
But I think with just a few
days of work you should be

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.660
able to nicely switch
to the new solution.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:12.916
OK, the next question.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.840
What are the discounted
transactions

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.800
fees from Google partners?

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.310
I'll take this one.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.310
So we announced a few days ago
that Checkout will be retired

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.100
and in that announcement we
also provided options for

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.550
existing merchants
and developers.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.410
And out of those I want to
emphasize Braintree, which is

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.250
one of our partners, which is
offering very substantial

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.100
discounts, especially if you
have large volume sales.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.290
Do we have it on the website?

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.270
Can we switch to the
Braintree website?

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:54.244
And the entry level rates
are 2.7% plus--

00:06:54.244 --> 00:06:55.560
I think the Braintree
website--

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.470
MICHAEL HOGAN: $0.30.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.730
MIHAI IONESCU: Yep.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.200
The Braintree website we have
links from the Merchant Center

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.070
and we can go to each one of our
partners and sign up for

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.500
their special rates.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.660
So Braintree has 2.7%
plus $0.30 that is

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.340
the entry level rate.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:19.680
Then Shopify, which offer
entire hosted storage

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.960
solution, offers 20%
off of their plans.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.350
Or if you're using invoice
primarily you may want to

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.190
consider FreshBooks, which
has a 60 day free trial.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:34.570
So lots of options for you
depending on the specific

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.910
processing, platform, and
specific processing

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.210
needs that you have.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.060
So to recap, go to the Merchant
Center and you'll

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.464
have all the information
there.

00:07:45.464 --> 00:07:47.430
All right, next question.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.850
I'll give it to someone else.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:54.290
Is Google Wallet Instant Buy the
only other Google provided

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.910
option for receiving and
processing payments?

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.320
How costs will differ between
the two products?

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.065
So Michael, you're the
expert in this area.

00:08:04.065 --> 00:08:04.880
Can you elaborate?

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.010
MICHAEL HOGAN: So we do have
another product, Google Offer

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.160
Digital Goods that's
exclusively for

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.410
digital goods merchants.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.800
It's a web based solution and
we have actually pretty

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.780
competitive pricing.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.160
So it's 5% per transaction
or 1.9% plus $0.30 per

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.230
transaction, whichever
is cheaper.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.980
MIHAI IONESCU: Whichever
is better.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:23.340
Yep.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.520
MICHAEL HOGAN: I am glad you
brought up the question about

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.560
instant buy.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.070
It's a great product but
certainly isn't a one to one

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.190
replacement for Google
Checkout.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.350
Instant buy partners are
required to have their own

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:36.210
processing capabilities.

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.570
So for that reason it's not a
great fit for a lot of Google

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:40.590
Checkout merchants.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.400
Also for that reason it's
a free service.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.340
Any sort of fees associated
would be with their

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.640
proprietary credit
card processor.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.070
And we just offer the
service for free.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.890
MIHAI IONESCU: So there are
multiple options out there

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.630
from what you're telling me.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.980
If you have digital goods you
can just switch to Google

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.170
Wallet for digital goods and
use our very competitive

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.310
pricing structure.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:08.120
Or if you have a payment process
or if you plan to use

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.140
any payment processor Google
Wallet Instant

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.410
Buy is a good option.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:17.000
It's free from Google and then
you will be charged whatever

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.593
your payment processor
charges you.

00:09:18.593 --> 00:09:18.976
MICHAEL HOGAN: Absolutely.

00:09:18.976 --> 00:09:21.290
MIHAI IONESCU: And you can use
Braintree, for example.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.130
MICHAEL HOGAN: Yep.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:23.410
MIHAI IONESCU: Great.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.590
Thank you, Michael.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.160
Let's move on.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.520
Next question.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.990
The question is, merchant
retailer of electronic

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.320
physical goods.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.110
Will we be able to use Google
Wallet as a payment process in

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.000
place of Google Checkout?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.850
So Michael, I think that's
also down your alley.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.530
MICHAEL HOGAN: Happy to
take this question.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:44.940
No.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.650
The answer is that we no longer
offer a solution for

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:50.220
processing of physical goods
or accepting payments for

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.180
physical goods or services.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.170
For that reason we've chosen
these three partners.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.730
They're well regarded in the
payments industry and so if

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.610
payment processing needs to
be replaced, for example,

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.480
Braintree payments is
a great solution.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.230
MIHAI IONESCU: OK.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:08.710
But in particular this retailer
they could use Google

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:13.440
Instant Buy and then have their
own payment processor or

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.100
Braintree process
the payments.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.460
MICHAEL HOGAN: So long as they
have a payment processor like

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.300
Braintree in place, then they're
encouraged to use

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.400
Instant Buy.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.990
And we'll be able to
take Google Wallet.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.850
MIHAI IONESCU: To clarify a
little bit for people who are

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:32.460
not familiar with how Google
Instant Buy works, customers

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.790
could use Google Wallet to
purchase your physical goods.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.270
However, you as a merchant we
will not be processing the

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:40.930
payments for you.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:45.850
Instead we will give you virtual
on time credit card

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.680
that you would need then
to charge with

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.070
your payment processor.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:53.390
So it's very convenient because
you have access to our

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:57.070
large user base and all
the customers who are

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.410
using Google Wallet.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:02.970
However, there's an extra step
which actually gives you more

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.230
flexibility.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.990
You will be able to charge the
credit card directly with your

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:13.770
preferred payment processor and
then use the cast majority

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.400
of APIs available to do
additional post processing

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.730
that are available from your
payment processors.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.200
MICHAEL HOGAN: I think it's good
to point out the benefit

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.250
here too is order processing
payouts.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.720
Google is no longer involved
there which sort of makes

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.490
things a little bit simpler
for the merchant.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:31.670
MIHAI IONESCU: So very
important point.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.470
Thank you for clarifying.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:40.590
All right, one more question
related to payment options.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:45.220
The question is, as a provider
of e-learning taking courses

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.520
where Google Checkout is our
primary payment option, what

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.090
options do we have ones Google
Checkout ceases?

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:55.700
Our ability to receive payment
simply expires or do we move

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.130
to Google Wallet?

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:03.020
So from the question it sounds
like currently you are selling

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.170
digital content or digital goods
and you're using one of

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.070
the Google Checkout APIs.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:12.700
Probably digital deliver API.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.720
I think we addressed
this in a previous

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.850
question and in the slides.

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:20.420
The best solution for you is
to consider migrating to an

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:24.440
API that is specifically
designed for digital goods.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.170
On the Google Wallet side we
have Google Wallet for digital

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:31.470
goods, which will offer you
similar capabilities and will

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.390
also the processing for you.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:38.100
Alternatively, you can shop
around and there are quite a

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.480
few good solutions out there.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.670
Again I'm pointing to Braintree,
which has a nice

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.740
digital goods solution.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:50.020
So there are options for you but
you will have to move off

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.840
the Google Checkout API
in the six month time

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.550
frame we gave you.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:13:00.850
OK, one additional question,
which is also API related so I

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:03.180
will take this one as well.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:07.190
Which API provided by Google
proves best in the scenario

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:11.180
where the merchant needs
to provide facility for

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.290
subscription based statement
and also support modifying

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:17.170
subscriptions and give a
postback call with every

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:19.390
recurring billing?

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:23.760
Sounds like a very particular
and more complex

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.350
case you have here.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:28.720
So we don't know exactly the
specifics of your business.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.140
But talking generally about
subscriptions, we do have

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.540
options and we can also
recommend to you other

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.290
possible solutions.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:43.350
So depending on the complexity
of your app and the platform

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:46.670
where you're selling the
subscriptions, you can have

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.700
Android in app billing, which
offers subscriptions.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.780
You can charge directly
from within your

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.440
native Android app.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.990
On the web we have Google for
Digital Goods which has a

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:59.700
subscription component.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.520
And you can also switch
to that one.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.830
And of course there
are third parties.

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:08.700
And we mentioned before,
Braintree has recurring

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.760
billing solution.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.890
You can switch to that
one as well.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:17.090
So again, look around and choose
the best API that fits

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:22.500
your particular case and the
complexity of your situation.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.640
All right, are we
done with APIs?

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.350
OK, let's take a question
that's not API related.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.410
What will happen to my merchant
ratings after the

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:33.490
Google shut down?

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.130
So I think Michael you're
the best to answer that.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.270
MICHAEL HOGAN: Sure.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.770
So Google ratings primarily
applies are

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.370
using Google Shopping.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.520
And they have a life
of one year.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.240
So as ratings stop they will
live out their, I guess,

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.260
lifespan for the rest of
the year and then will

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.760
begin to fall off.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.000
We do have other ratings that
feed into that system.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.685
Bizrate, Pricegrabber, and those
will continue to be fed

00:14:58.685 --> 00:15:00.170
into the Google Shopping
system.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:00.620
MIHAI IONESCU: OK.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.460
So your ratings will be
available for one year and

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.210
then once Checkout is out
they will go away.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.340
MICHAEL HOGAN: Yep.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.810
MIHAI IONESCU: All right.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.100
OK, another API and subscription
question, so

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:12.840
that'll be me.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.190
The question is, how can
I maintain my customer

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:20.260
subscriptions after Google
Checkout is closed?

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.970
So if you're using the Google
Checkout subscription API that

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.690
API will go away
in six months.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:30.160
So you will have to move off the
subscription, the Checkout

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.860
subscriptions API to another
platform, to other equivalent

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.340
subscription solution.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:42.910
If you're selling digital goods
or services, we do have

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:46.850
the Google Wallet for Digital
Goods API, which is a good

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.180
replacement.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:53.980
If you're doing this on mobile,
let's say Android

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:57.210
native apps, then we have
Google inn app billing.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:03.610
Any other scenarios or
combinations of the two, you

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.790
can use both of them or you
can consider third parties

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:07.830
like Braintree.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:11.270
So somehow a similar and a
repeat answer to a previous

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:17.280
question but the main point is
you will have to migrate your

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.280
existing customers to a new
subscription platform and

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.660
restart the subscriptions.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.350
JUSTIN LAWYER: I might add that
if you have questions

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.030
about this, feel free to call
our number and we can help you

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.700
through that process.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:31.210
MIHAI IONESCU: Yes so make sure
you note down the contact

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:31.976
information.

00:16:31.976 --> 00:16:35.840
I'll rewind the video
and it's--

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.060
JUSTIN LAWYER: It's also
in the help center.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.830
MIHAI IONESCU: And it's also
in the help center.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:39.240
Think you.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.030
Thank you, Justin.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:49.710
All right, one next question
is about the mobile

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:50.690
experience.

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:53.220
So the question is, last year
Google Checkout stopped

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.030
serving mobile optimized
pages.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:59.400
What is the best way to have
a mobile optimized checkout

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.050
experience on my
mobile web app?

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:05.000
So the important thing to
note here is that it is

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
a mobile web app.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.440
So Mike, I think you know
more about this.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.670
MICHAEL HOGAN: So we built
Google Wallet Instant Buy to

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:15.630
be a beautiful experience
on mobile.

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:18.750
For that reason it's easing
check out both in app and on a

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:19.940
mobile site.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.780
But again, can't emphasize this
point enough, merchants

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.030
must have ability to process
their own credit cards to be

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.970
eligible for this tool.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:30.260
So if you're looking for mobile
and have that ability,

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.780
have a PCI compliant credit card
processor, then this is

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.450
definitely a solution for you.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.460
MIHAI IONESCU: So, Instant Buy
it's a nice replacement that

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:45.130
works as well on both your
desktop and your mobile web.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:47.200
And the experience
is seamless.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.510
So if you have a web store
then you can have your

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:56.040
customers buy either in the
browser on the desktop or from

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.820
their mobile phone and the
experience will seamless.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.530
MICHAEL HOGAN: Exactly.

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:01.880
MIHAI IONESCU: All right.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.510
OK, one more for Mike.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:08.840
It's an API related question
but you are the

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:09.640
best to answer it.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.750
And the question is, when might
the Instant Buy API be

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.965
generally available even
just for Sandbox?

00:18:15.965 --> 00:18:16.290
MICHAEL HOGAN: Sure.

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.910
So we're opening Sandbox to a
limited beta soon in the next

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:21.770
couple weeks.

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:24.700
As soon as we really have felt
that out and made sure we have

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.090
a great experience
for all users,

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:27.710
we'll open it up publicly.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:33.060
And we'll make sure anyone who
fills out our interest form at

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:38.510
getinstantbuy.withgoogle.com
will be informed of all of

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:39.780
these steps as they
take place.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.080
MIHAI IONESCU: Great.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.710
So that's great news for
developers and people who want

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:44.115
to try Instant Buy.

00:18:44.115 --> 00:18:47.210
Will have Sandbox
to play with.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:50.090
And do we have--

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.430
so it's Get Instant Buy?

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:53.680
MICHAEL HOGAN:
Getinstantbuy.withgoogle.com.

00:18:55.631 --> 00:18:57.790
MIHAI IONESCU: And there's
a sign up form.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:58.760
Just go there.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.150
JUSTIN LAWYER: So it's
a really easy url.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:07.630
MIHAI IONESCU: All right,
questions keep coming.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:09.990
All right, Mike, you're
on a roll so I'll

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:11.410
give this on to you.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:16.350
So the question is, will there
be a new Merchant Center for

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:19.780
merchants using Google Wallet
for the digital goods API?

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.900
Is then is, will there be a way
to support cancellation of

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.810
subscriptions, refunds,
and charge backs?

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:28.690
MICHAEL HOGAN: And the
answer is yes.

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:30.260
We have great news
on this front.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.140
So we've rolled out a
new merchant center.

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.500
It's actually for purely in app
merchants-- or excuse me,

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.850
for purely digital
goods merchants.

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:38.470
It's already being used.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.760
We're rolling out to
Android right now.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.260
And that includes
a subscription

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:45.420
orders details page.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.820
So before you'd have to back
track all the way through the

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.810
Merchant Center to find the
original subscription in order

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:52.100
to cancel that order.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.140
Now all of the subscription
information is housed on one

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.440
order details page so you can
see all of the charges made

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.200
through the months or years
and cancel it if

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:01.890
need be right away.

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:06.680
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah, I can vouch
for from a ease of use

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.100
point of view.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.050
The new Merchant Center is
much better than the

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:13.150
equivalent Google Checkout
Merchant Center for

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:13.990
subscriptions.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.390
MICHAEL HOGAN: Absolutely.

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.080
MIHAI IONESCU: It's so much
easier to see where the

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.220
subscription is coming, how to
cancel it, how to refund.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.000
Yeah, so definitely
it's there.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.200
If you're a digital goods API
user or merchant you already

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.770
have it and it's going to be
rolling out to Android

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.610
merchants as we speak.

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:30.985
MICHAEL HOGAN: Yep.

00:20:30.985 --> 00:20:33.430
Absolutely.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:35.100
MIHAI IONESCU: Next question.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.800
API question, so
I will take it.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.820
The question is,
will the entire

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.890
Checkout API be retired?

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:45.780
There are some Checkout APIs
in the level two, which is

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:50.030
order processing, that seems
useful for other Google Wallet

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:55.920
APIs that are blocking such
features such as cancellation

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.940
and notification call backs,
notification history queries,

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.630
so on and so forth.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.300
And this is a very
good question

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.860
and a very good point.

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:11.140
And it clearly this developer
is using the level two APIs

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.820
which are complex APIs and is
looking to do post order

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.683
processing and some very
complex operations.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:22.610
To answer the question,
the entire

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:24.510
Checkout API will go away.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:28.080
So if you are using any of those
APIs you will need to

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.230
find a replacement depending on
the particular API you're

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.900
switching to.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:37.610
The good news is that we will
be rolling out new APIs new

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:42.950
replacement for this before
Checkout completely retired.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:46.780
So you will be able to
seamlessly transition to a

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:51.970
similar experience on your
server side and make your life

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:52.650
much easier.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.730
JUSTIN LAWYER: In particular
Android Play developers,

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.220
there's one in the works
right now and it

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:57.370
will shortly be released.

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:57.810
MIHAI IONESCU: Great.

00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:01.190
Great, so good news for
Android developers.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.140
If you're using any of the
existing Checkout APIs you

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.450
will soon have a replacement.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:11.350
All right, are we done
with API questions?

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:13.540
OK, one that's not
an API question.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:17.500
As a nonprofit how can we
continue to accept donations

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.100
through Google Wallet.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:19.930
Addressing.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.610
JUSTIN LAWYER: So this
is a good question.

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:24.680
Google Checkout will
unfortunately be completely

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:28.330
turning off support of donations
after November 20.

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:31.600
So if you're either a 501(c)(3)
needing to do

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:36.110
donations or if you're a
political group needing to do

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.900
contributions that way
we suggest you

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.080
get a different processor.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.630
Braintree actually
does support both

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:44.000
of those use cases.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
If you like the buyers to be
able to use Google Wallet to

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.660
pay for that, you can use Google
Instant Buy and that

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.850
way we can provide the one time
use card and then you can

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:55.924
process it through Braintree
or any other processor that

00:22:55.924 --> 00:22:56.798
you would like.

00:22:56.798 --> 00:22:58.048
MIHAI IONESCU: Great.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:02.710
OK, Justin, your turn.

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:04.600
Another question for you.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.970
The question is about
the worldwide

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.470
availability of Checkout.

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:13.370
And it's will you offer
a new API for

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:15.060
Google Wallet worldwide?

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.920
Current Google Checkout API
cannot be used from most

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.270
countries other than
the US and UK.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:23.350
JUSTIN LAWYER: Yes, this is
a very good question.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:24.860
The answer kind of depends
on how you're

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:29.055
using Google for payments.

00:23:29.055 --> 00:23:32.240
If you're selling digital goods
on Google, for instance,

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.480
through Google Play, we support
161 buyer countries,

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.440
so quite a few.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.940
And we have 32 seller
countries.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.410
If you're a Google Wallet for
digital goods merchant, we

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:46.800
have 18 seller countries, nine
different currencies, and also

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.740
161 buyer countries.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.430
If you are using Google Instant
Buy, since that is a

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:55.330
limited beta at this point it
only supports US buyers and US

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:59.000
sellers and we're actively
looking at how do we roll that

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.620
out traditional countries
as the beta finished up.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:09.130
MIHAI IONESCU: So I think the
point of your answer is that

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:12.520
using some of the new Google
APIs you actually have access

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:17.450
to more options and more buyers
and more currencies

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:18.830
that you would have
had in Checkout.

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:19.030
JUSTIN LAWYER: Yeah.

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:21.130
Google Checkout, for instance,
only supported two seller

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:22.770
countries, US and UK.

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:25.250
And if you are a digital
merchant switching to Google

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:28.460
Wallet for digital goods for
instance, that would be 18

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.040
seller countries.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.140
So you'd be expanding your
footprint of where you can

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.590
actually sell.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:37.700
MIHAI IONESCU: And Instant Buy
will gain more traction and

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.920
you'll have more options
there too.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.380
OK, next question.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.450
It's about Merchant Center.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.430
The question is, will it be
possible with the new Wallet

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:52.490
Merchant Center to sell apps
on Google Play from more

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:55.790
countries that are not supported
by Google Checkout?

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:57.965
So related to the previous
question, I guess, but Mike

00:24:57.965 --> 00:24:59.520
you know more about this.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:24:59.950
MICHAEL HOGAN: Sure.

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:03.480
We're evaluating and expanding
to new countries all the time

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.585
but we don't have anything
to announce at this time.

00:25:06.585 --> 00:25:06.880
MIHAI IONESCU: OK.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:11.430
So you're still having the
18 countries and lots of

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:14.290
currencies and we're adding--

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:17.140
MICHAEL HOGAN: Additional
countries constantly.

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:18.740
MIHAI IONESCU: OK.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.870
So we're getting close
to the end.

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:24.170
One more question and I
will take this one.

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:27.900
And the question is about the
Google Checkout store gadget.

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:31.610
What is the transition path for
users of Google Checkout

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:33.260
Store gadget?

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:39.050
So the Checkout Store gadget
offer the nice one stop

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:44.460
solution for merchants
with no or very

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:47.600
limited programming skills.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:52.780
And it was very popular and used
by quite a few merchants.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:57.770
Once Google Checkout is retired,
the best option for

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:02.560
such merchant will be Shopify,
which offers discounted plans

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.620
for, again, a one in all
hosted storefront.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.930
So the transition and the
experience from a merchant

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:13.310
perspective and managing your
store should be similar.

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:17.540
So I encourage everyone who uses
the Checkout Store gadget

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.810
to have a look at Shopify.

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:22.790
All right, so with this
I think we got to

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:23.990
the end of the questions.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:26.880
If there are questions that we
missed we'll try to address

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:31.580
them in further office
hour session.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:36.580
Thank you, Justin, and thank
Michael for providing

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:40.750
additional details about the
Google retirement plan.

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:47.610
And please contact us with any
issues, any questions, and

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:49.600
we'll see you next time.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.850
Bye.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:28:28.988
