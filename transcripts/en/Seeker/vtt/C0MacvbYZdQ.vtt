TRACE DOMINQUEZ: Hey
guys, Trace here.

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.130
And today we're going
to be doing something

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.100
a little bit different.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.610
Some of you may
recognize this set up.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.980
We used to do a show
called DNews Plus,

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.230
and it was a show
where essentially we'd

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.910
come across topics and we
didn't have enough time

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.910
to talk about them in our
regular Seeker videos.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.950
Or maybe I just got
really excited about it,

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.810
and wanted to talk about
it for a long time.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.680
So that was what
DNews Plus was for.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.260
But a while ago we put
DNews Plus on hiatus,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.970
and since then
we've become Seeker.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.420
So welcome to Seeker Plus.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.240
We're going to spend a little
while talking about something

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.630
that we discovered that we
just couldn't wait to tell you

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.860
a whole bunch of stuff about.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.210
There's no B-roll.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.500
There's no music.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.220
It's just you and me and
my notes and some science.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.050
So let's kick into it.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.940
Today we're going to
talk infrared light.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.690
Because you know, there's talk
lately about infrared light

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.360
replacing Wi-Fi.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.000
Infrared light replacing
Wi-Fi, can you believe that?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.486
I know, it's shocking.

00:00:58.486 --> 00:01:00.360
So that got us thinking,
how would that work?

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.540
And then we you
started thinking, what

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.179
is infrared light all about?

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:05.470
You hear about it all the time.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.920
It's used in a variety
of different applications

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.070
across the things that you
do on a day to day basis,

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.930
and you probably never
even think about it.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.300
Light is everywhere.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.560
You know this, I know this.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.910
The only reason you
can see me right now

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.980
is because light is
coming out of your device,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.000
and there are
lights in this room,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.720
and the camera is
picking up light.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.750
Light is everywhere.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.210
It's very important.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.630
Light is just electromagnetic
radiation, just little

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.207
bits of energy that it can
be picked up by your eyeballs

00:01:36.207 --> 00:01:37.790
or by the camera and
are being emitted

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.260
by all sorts of
different things.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.290
That energy travels
through space in waves,

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.330
things like radio
waves and microwaves

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.320
and x-rays and UV light and
visible light are all light.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.160
They're all in the
electromagnetic or EM spectrum.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.440
And they're all
based on wavelength.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.230
We divide them up
into different groups.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.234
Because that's what
humans love doing,

00:01:59.234 --> 00:02:00.650
is dividing things
up into groups.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.670
But the EM spectrum
is just that, it's

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.920
a spectrum of different light.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.710
And we've just picked, these are
the ones that we like the best.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.330
Visible light isn't
the best light,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.220
it's just the light that our
eyeballs have chosen to see.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.590
"Chosen" to see.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.260
We interpret visible
light with color.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.780
The shortest of those
wavelengths of light

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.870
are violet, and the
longest are red.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.430
So knowing this gets you to
how infrared was discovered.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.280
A German dude moved
to England in 1757.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.880
His name, Sir Frederick
William Herschel.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.530
He built telescopes
and eventually he

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.970
discovered Uranus.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.450
In 1800, he directed
sunlight through a prism

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.695
and it made a rainbow.

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:43.850
Ah, pretty.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.430
You can do this at home if
you happen to have a prism.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.240
He measured the temperatures
of each of the colors.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.990
Probably wouldn't have
thought to do that,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.760
but this guy thought of it.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.680
And he found that
the temperatures

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.620
increased from violet to red.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.920
Violet was cooler,
red was warmer.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.090
That's interesting, right.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.780
But then he saw that it
was even higher if he moved

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.130
a little bit further past red.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.330
It was warmer.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.170
So there was something
there that he couldn't see.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.420
There was no light
in that rainbow,

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.270
but the thermometer was
still picking something up.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.590
Cool right?

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.600
Infrared light is
what was there.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.370
He discovered this
thing called infrared.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.030
It's on the other side of red.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.340
It's the first time
someone had found light

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.440
that we could not see.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.130
Now the European Space Agency
has named their infrared space

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.430
observatory after Herschel.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.480
Pretty cool.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.090
Infrared light is
next to visible light

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.500
on the electromagnetic scale.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.150
It's on the reddish side.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.610
Infra meaning below red.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.580
Red of course,
meaning red, infrared.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.450
OK, you got it.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.090
So infrared light is
just wavelengths of light

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.970
that are longer or
have a more distance

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.130
between the peaks of
the waves and then

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.480
one side of the visible light.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.670
Ultraviolet, UV light,
makes sense, right,

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.270
on the other side of violet.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.680
Pretty cool.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.490
Everything gives off
infrared radiation.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.150
You are, I am, your kitty cat
is, everything is giving off

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.230
infrared radiation.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.269
Unless your thing
is absolute zero.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.317
If your cat is
absolute zero though,

00:04:20.317 --> 00:04:22.150
that probably wouldn't
be good for your cat.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.950
That's where all the molecules
in the thing stop moving.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.340
It's the coldest possible
temperature that we know of.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:34.260
It's negative 273.15 Celsius,
negative about 460 degrees

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.190
Fahrenheit.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.680
The hotter something is,
the more molecules and atoms

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.750
are going to move
inside of that, right.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.520
Boiling water, those
water molecules

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.200
are just zooming
around in there.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.320
Frozen water, they're just kind
of vibrating, not really moving

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.050
at all.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.250
So the more something
heats up, the more motion

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.400
it has inside of it.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.220
And that produces
infrared radiation.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.270
But things that are cold,
even though they're not moving

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.040
as much, are still moving.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.560
So they're giving off
infrared radiation.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.590
Ice cubes give off
infrared radiation.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.060
And if something
is not hot enough

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.780
to give off any light at all,
it can still be giving off

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.630
infrared radiation.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.800
And you can feel
that because you

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.420
can feel infrared radiation in
the same way that Herschel did.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.672
It's heat.

00:05:19.672 --> 00:05:21.630
One example we found on
a website that we liked

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.640
was charcoal.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.400
It doesn't have to be
glowing to be hot, right.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.670
If you put your hand near
charcoal you can feel its heat.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.480
That's infrared radiation.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.454
This is something I
learned very early on.

00:05:33.454 --> 00:05:34.370
Some of you know this.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.760
I am a blacksmith.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.370
So I hit metal with a
hammer, and sometimes

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.870
that metal is not glowing.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.770
It doesn't start glowing until
like the 1,300 degree range.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.499
But if it's 900 degrees or
1,000 degrees, it's still hot,

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:48.790
and you don't want to touch it.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.030
But you can feel the
infrared radiation coming off

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.800
of the steel.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.540
So infrared is everywhere.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.450
You can't see it,
but you can feel it.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.810
And hot things emit a lot of it.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.840
But just knowing that
is kind of a fun fact

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.490
that you can tell
people at a party.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.220
But Seeker Plus, that's
not what we're all about.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.210
We're all about let's
push it past that, right.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.470
How do we use this knowledge?

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.170
What can we do with
infrared light?

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.220
It gives off heat.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.460
So we can use infrared
to measure how much heat

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.470
is being emitted by
something, as long

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.630
as we build a camera
that can read it

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.490
or we can feel it somehow.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.610
An obvious thing comes to
mind like thermographic images

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.810
and night vision.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.610
That is using infrared heat.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.640
So you have this special
camera that picks up

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.710
the infrared
wavelengths of light,

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.330
and then it can
display them for you.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.620
And we've seen those images.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.600
They look super trippy.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.440
It picks up the
heat off of objects.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.905
So different parts of
a body, for example,

00:06:47.905 --> 00:06:49.280
are going to be
hotter or cooler.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.410
And the background is
blue and the hot things

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.270
are white and red
and yellow, you know.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.620
It's really, really cool.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.220
And even at night, people
are giving off warmth.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.990
So you can use
those to spot things

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:05.510
like prey or other humans or
even something someone touched

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.300
a while ago that hasn't
cooled off yet enough.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.560
Very important.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.060
And there are also
electronics that

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.090
can create images using infrared
light using special lenses

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.540
and sensors to enhance
what you and I just

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.100
can't see with our sad
little evolved eyes here.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.464
Infrared light is also
used in astronomy,

00:07:24.464 --> 00:07:25.880
because it can
pick up things that

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.100
are too cold to emit light.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.710
Because as things cool
off and that motion stops,

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.390
sometimes they're
not energized enough

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.240
to release light
that we can see.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.140
So infrared is a way to
see those things still.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.806
Also, because those
wavelengths are so long,

00:07:42.806 --> 00:07:46.670
longer than even red light,
it can cut through things

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.040
that regular light
would be blocked by.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.690
So let me give
you a quick aside.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.570
The reason the sky is blue is
because blue light scatters

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.300
more easily than any other
type of light, right.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.680
So the light hits
the atmosphere,

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.280
it scatters all over the place.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.140
But when the moon goes
low on the horizon

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.710
and it turns orange,
that's the red light

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.660
not being scattered as much.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.220
Infrared would
mean that it would

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.570
scatter even less than that.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.955
So that means that there's
a nebula in between you

00:08:11.955 --> 00:08:14.580
and something, you might be able
to see parts of it in infrared

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.580
if you know, it's a
very small nebula.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.646
But really, if it's just dust
and gas and things in the way.

00:08:19.646 --> 00:08:21.020
So there are
wavelengths that can

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.020
cut through some of those
things that are blocking you

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.280
from seeing them out in space.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.696
And astronomers
know this, so they

00:08:26.696 --> 00:08:29.870
can utilize these methods
to see those things.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.539
Infrared wavelengths
get absorbed, however,

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:35.857
in the lower
atmosphere, which sucks.

00:08:35.857 --> 00:08:37.940
So you have to go above
it like into the mountains

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.520
or into an airplane
or into space.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.169
And that way the
infrared light doesn't

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:45.590
get screwed up before it
can get to your telescope.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.170
You can also send up
infrared space telescopes

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.900
like we did in 1983 with IRAS.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.060
It's an Infrared
Astronomical Satellite,

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.056
and it mapped the entire
sky in infrared wavelengths,

00:08:56.056 --> 00:08:56.930
which is pretty cool.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:00.000
They found six new comets,
the core of our own galaxy,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and evidence that there
might be other planetary

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.380
systems around stars.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.210
This was in 1983.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.860
Really awesome stuff.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.800
It's also used to study
the earliest things that we

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.570
know of in our universe.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.430
So galaxies that
are far, far away

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:16.590
and that are moving away
from us that are pretty cool,

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.200
have cooled off.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.380
We can still see those
with infrared light, right.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.540
But there's this thing that
astronomers know about,

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.250
and maybe you've heard about
as well, called red shifting.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.670
Which means things
that are far away

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:32.780
and that are moving really fast
shift toward the red spectrum.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.040
Because the light that
they emit gets longer.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.580
It gets stretched out.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.910
Which means it's shifting
toward red, red shifting.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.650
The best way to see
that, of course, also

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.120
an infrared telescope.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.720
Basically, infrared astronomers
get to see what the rest of us

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.070
can't see with our eyes.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.360
It's really, really cool.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.490
Speaking also of
satellites, weather images

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.190
taken by satellites are
often measured in infrared,

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.930
because you can get
pockets of heat.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.400
You don't have to
look at clouds.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.310
You can see air movement and
measure the different amounts

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.960
of heat coming out of that air.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.000
You can also take the
temperatures of clouds

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.490
and get hot and cold
places within those clouds.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.590
You can also see if the
cloud is producing rain,

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:12.740
because colder clouds
are raining harder, which

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.000
is pretty interesting, right.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.430
The satellite just
has to say, oh,

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.138
that one's a little
colder than this one.

00:10:17.138 --> 00:10:19.310
Must be raining
harder over there.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.560
If there are no clouds at
all, the weather satellite

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.510
isn't useless, it
can take measurements

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.214
of the surface temperatures.

00:10:25.214 --> 00:10:26.630
And in different
places it's going

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:27.921
to have different temperatures.

00:10:27.921 --> 00:10:30.740
This is how we know
that say trees maybe

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.400
reflect less heat than
something like an urban area.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.230
And these are just a
couple of examples.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.950
Infrared is, speaking of trees,
used to detect forest fires.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.780
It's used to heat saunas.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.250
It can penetrate
through paintings

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.930
and reveal what
is underneath them

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.720
so we can see if a painter
used the canvas more than once.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.695
Which a lot of
really old paintings,

00:10:49.695 --> 00:10:50.570
that's what they did.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.760
It can be used by your
remote control device

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.404
when you point it
at your television

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:55.820
and tell it to
change the channel,

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.040
it flashes an infrared
light across the room

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.840
that your TV picks up.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.860
Really, really neat.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.320
They're even using infrared
in the medical field

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.030
to detect things
like breast cancer,

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.920
or helping with skin disorders.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.075
And Google shows a lot
of light therapy results,

00:11:09.075 --> 00:11:11.450
although there's not really
any credible sources on that.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.580
Some people sit
under infrared light

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.230
because they say
it helps them feel

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.070
better, which is interesting.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.000
Infrared radiation sounds scary.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.850
But it's not radiation
like nuclear radiation,

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.270
it's light radiation, right.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.039
That said, infrared, even
though it's just heat

00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:29.830
and you're just giving
it off all the time.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:32.290
I mean, unless you're sitting
in a 98.6 degree room,

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:35.860
you're giving off infrared
radiation into the room.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.850
It can still be dangerous,
because you can't see it.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:43.120
If someone were to shine a
really bright infrared light,

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.200
and I'm putting
"bright" in quotes here.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.490
So if you put bright infrared
light into your eyeball,

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.620
normally bright
lights cause something

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.970
called blink aversion.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.580
You blink to protect
the inside of your eye.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.830
Infrared light you can't see it.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.260
So you can damage
your eye with that.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.240
So one, don't do that.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.290
But two, really interesting
and also kind of strange.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.290
The thing about not being
able to see it though,

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:07.720
is a little
disappointing, right.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.346
Because you know it's there.

00:12:09.346 --> 00:12:10.720
Like I want to be
able to see it.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.054
I want to see infrared light.

00:12:12.054 --> 00:12:12.970
Wouldn't that be cool?

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.345
You could see all of these
little things flitting around.

00:12:15.345 --> 00:12:18.580
You could see temperatures, and
you could see pockets of air.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.050
That would be so cool.

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:23.080
But even though we can't see
it, which is disappointing,

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.300
there was this one
specific science experiment

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.120
which shows that we
might be able to detect,

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.070
which is really cool.

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:33.970
One experiment shot
infrared photons at an eye.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.730
And if two photons hit the same
receptor one after another,

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:39.730
it created a photon
of visible light.

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:44.000
But that light was
not red it was green.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.560
Which is weird.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.460
Science is cool.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.940
Anyway, we can't
really see infrared,

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.200
and neither can most animals.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.650
But snakes, they can
sense infrared waves

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:56.750
with pits in their mouth.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:00.230
Vampire bats and bedbugs,
they can sense infrared.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.870
And some animals can
see ultraviolet, again,

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.890
the other side of the spectrum.

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:08.660
But that's kind of like a whole
other episode of Seeker Plus.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.220
So that's infrared.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.920
We had so much fun
looking into this.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.710
It's the heat that's given off
by everything that we can't

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:18.304
see except one specific
incidence, in which case

00:13:18.304 --> 00:13:19.970
then it was kind of
green which is weird

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.053
and a little mind blowing.

00:13:21.053 --> 00:13:24.200
But we use it to predict weather
and learn about the universe

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.860
and turn on our TV and see if
Picasso screwed up his painting

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.630
and started over,
which is great.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.940
Because sometimes
we all screw up.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.336
Thanks so much for watching
this Seeker Plus episode.

00:13:34.336 --> 00:13:36.710
Let us know down in the comments
if you like this format,

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:38.690
because we're trying
all sorts of cool things

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.065
with this new
Seeker re-branding.

00:13:40.065 --> 00:13:41.773
And we really want to
know your thoughts.

00:13:41.773 --> 00:13:43.070
I've got all of your comments.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.060
I keep reading them
every single day.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.300
And thank you so much
for subscribing to us

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.210
and sticking around and
watching this episode.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:51.512
So tell us, what did you think?

00:13:51.512 --> 00:13:53.720
And also tell us if we missed
anything about infrared

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.210
that you think is really cool
that we should also think

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:57.260
is really cool.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:01.460
Because maybe we'll use that in
future episodes of Seeker Plus.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.910
Light is cool.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.160
It's real-- well, and
sometimes it's hot.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.534
It's complicated.

00:14:06.534 --> 00:14:07.700
Anyway, thanks for watching.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.570
Come find me on
Twitter @TraceDominquz.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.780
Come find us at Seeker.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.630
See you next time.
