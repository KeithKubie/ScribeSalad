00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.849
we our players have already shown

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859
we our players have already shown
 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.570
we our players have already shown
clearly that designs which fold in

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580
clearly that designs which fold in
 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.209
clearly that designs which fold in
principle don't fold in practice so

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219
principle don't fold in practice so
 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.439
principle don't fold in practice so
they've been very good at folding

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:15.449
they've been very good at folding
 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.620
they've been very good at folding
incorrect RNAs and excitingly enough

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630
incorrect RNAs and excitingly enough
 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.070
incorrect RNAs and excitingly enough
some of our players have designed RNAs

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080
some of our players have designed RNAs
 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.160
some of our players have designed RNAs
which actually do fold correctly in

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170
which actually do fold correctly in
 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.450
which actually do fold correctly in
practice that is to say in the lab and

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460
practice that is to say in the lab and
 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.910
practice that is to say in the lab and
so now the community is sort of abuzz

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920
so now the community is sort of abuzz
 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.639
so now the community is sort of abuzz
about why those folded properly and

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649
about why those folded properly and
 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.439
about why those folded properly and
trying to generate hypotheses that

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449
trying to generate hypotheses that
 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:38.360
trying to generate hypotheses that
explain that and then synthesize more

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370
explain that and then synthesize more
 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.479
explain that and then synthesize more
RNAs which actually do fold properly so

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489
RNAs which actually do fold properly so
 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.690
RNAs which actually do fold properly so
they've really it's a game but they've

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700
they've really it's a game but they've
 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.490
they've really it's a game but they've
taken to this just like a scientific

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500
taken to this just like a scientific
 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.299
taken to this just like a scientific
community and in fact online when they

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309
community and in fact online when they
 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.340
community and in fact online when they
communicate with one another they're

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
communicate with one another they're
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.959
communicate with one another they're
generating knowledge they're discussing

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969
generating knowledge they're discussing
 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.940
generating knowledge they're discussing
hypotheses and they've built in some

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950
hypotheses and they've built in some
 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.369
hypotheses and they've built in some
sense their own scientific community

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379
sense their own scientific community
 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.510
sense their own scientific community
around this game and we hope to emerge

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520
around this game and we hope to emerge
 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.219
around this game and we hope to emerge
these ideas ultimately with the full

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229
these ideas ultimately with the full
 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.600
these ideas ultimately with the full
scientific community by submitting

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
scientific community by submitting
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.450
scientific community by submitting
papers based on what the community is

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460
papers based on what the community is
 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.149
papers based on what the community is
doing so the scientific community at

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159
doing so the scientific community at
 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.350
doing so the scientific community at
large is first of all invited to play

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360
large is first of all invited to play
 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.609
large is first of all invited to play
although our some of our players are

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619
although our some of our players are
 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.190
although our some of our players are
pretty good and also we're discussing

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
pretty good and also we're discussing
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.380
pretty good and also we're discussing
ways in which we can take problems chart

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390
ways in which we can take problems chart
 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.640
ways in which we can take problems chart
of interest to other research groups and

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650
of interest to other research groups and
 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.370
of interest to other research groups and
apply them in the game so that in some

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380
apply them in the game so that in some
 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.289
apply them in the game so that in some
sense a scientist can come to us and say

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299
sense a scientist can come to us and say
 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.690
sense a scientist can come to us and say
I would love to have 10,000 people look

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700
I would love to have 10,000 people look
 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.870
I would love to have 10,000 people look
at my problem can you make that happen

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880
at my problem can you make that happen
 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.310
at my problem can you make that happen
and so I mean that's one of the really

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320
and so I mean that's one of the really
 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.700
and so I mean that's one of the really
exciting completely new possibilities

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710
exciting completely new possibilities
 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.249
exciting completely new possibilities
that we're exploring that the Internet's

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259
that we're exploring that the Internet's
 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.380
that we're exploring that the Internet's
making possible which is how can we

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390
making possible which is how can we
 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.590
making possible which is how can we
apply a hundred thousand people to one

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
apply a hundred thousand people to one
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.070
apply a hundred thousand people to one
