00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:08.830
Argh, stupid small phone, stupid
small buttons, stupid big fingers.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.190
Pete, why are developers
trying to torture me?

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.620
&gt;&gt; Well, they're not really
trying to torture you.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.050
&gt;&gt; Well, it really seems like
it when the buttons are so

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.430
small that they barely take
up a pixel on the screen.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's true.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.920
Tap targets or anything that a user
might touch, tap, click, or try and

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.890
do input on, need to be big enough and
easy to hit.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.840
And spaced so that you're not going to
accidentally hit two at the same time.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.980
With a mouse, users can
be perfectly accurate.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.570
Our fingers, on the other hand, and
sorry about that pun, it was bad.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.150
But our fingers are about
ten millimeters wide, or

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.580
half an inch, which works out
to be about 40 CSS pixels.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.190
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.650
So buttons should be at
least 40 by 40 pixels.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.290
Well, instead of doing 40 by 40,

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.020
you should make them 48 pixels
wide by 48 pixels tall.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.519
That makes sure that there's enough
room between the elements, for

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.950
those of us who have fat fingers and
fat thumbs.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:09.540
Yeah.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.270
It's okay to make some tap
targets a little bit smaller.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.910
But make sure there's at least 40 pixels
of room between any of your top targets,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.460
to make sure that users
don't hit two buttons or

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.750
two elements at the same time, or
miss it completely.
