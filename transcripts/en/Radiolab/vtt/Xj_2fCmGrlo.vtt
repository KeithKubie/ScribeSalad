1
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.800
Next up buddies. You're Molly Webster and Carmen.

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.920
All right. Um, okay. Just for a lunch in. But yeah,

3
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.300
so science and

4
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.670
Yay. This is my new thing with my sisters.

5
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:27.600
I just always go hashtag science cause they get really sick of me trying to

6
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:29.450
teach the kids sciencey lessons.

7
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.240
It's Hashtag science it. Okay.

8
00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:38.241
So one of the biggest mysteries in biology is how old am I that that doesn't

9
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:44.064
seem like a mystery.

10
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.610
Well I mean like obviously I'm Molly Webster who's 32 years old who has lived

11
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.730
you know through 32 birthdays I guess. Yeah.

12
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.770
But this is a question of like we know that some cells in our body regenerate

13
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.970
and so it's like how old are those cells? Like how old is my heart right now?

14
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.450
Or like how old my eyeball or how old is my nose? Spleen,

15
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.910
the northwest corner of my kidney. Hmm.

16
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.640
Is this like like a m you know, if I'm three years old now I'm 33 years old.

17
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.550
Are the cells in the 33 year old, are they the same as any of them?

18
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:19.800
The same as the one when I was three. Is that the question? Yeah,

19
00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:23.190
that's one of the questions. Are any of them the same? If they're not the same,

20
00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:25.980
then how often do they change? Because if you understand that,

21
00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:28.470
then you might be able to like solve injuries,

22
00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:33.330
help people heal faster or fix diseases where cells are,

23
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.840
you know,

24
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.840
messed up like psoriasis or anemia or als or something like that.

25
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.550
But also it just seems so cool to be able to be like,

26
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.640
oh that chunk of my heart is from 1997 yes.

27
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.510
Yet other chunk of my heart is from 1983 yes. Like that.

28
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.400
I would love to know that at the Party of Robert,

29
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.900
I would want to meet the original Robert Cells.

30
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.100
So if there's anybody who's been here since 1947 I'd love to just say hello and

31
00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:04.020
if you just joined me in 2015 well that's nice.

32
00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:05.790
I mean like it would be super cool.

33
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.480
So one of the questions they've had for a long time is,

34
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.130
is there a way that we can try to date cells?

35
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.941
And so they're like, well,

36
00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:18.060
we can't really send anything into the body because that can be toxic.

37
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.940
So the answer for a long time had been no,

38
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.740
and then 2002 ish, this little idea pops up

39
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.240
and it's something called the bomb pop.

40
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.363
<v 1>Yes.</v>

41
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.430
<v 0>B o m. B. B o, m B, and then pulse p.</v>

42
00:02:36.431 --> 00:02:40.170
U. L. S. E. Bomb. Pulse. Yeah. To explain,

43
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.500
<v 1>I threw it too</v>

44
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.810
<v 0>in the 1940s and fifties we all know this. We</v>

45
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.020
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

46
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.970
<v 0>just it. A lot of atomic bomb.</v>

47
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.033
<v 1>Any huge</v>

48
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.810
<v 0>first test was in 1945 trinity tests, New Mexico a few weeks later.</v>

49
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.420
Little note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki

50
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.920
where you shall continue to use it. So then as World War II comes to an end,

51
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.020
the rest of the world just tries to catch up to the u s bomb or

52
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.410
the Russians. Then after the Russians,

53
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.960
British, French,

54
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.170
the whole cold war basically just continues to unfold. Cool.

55
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.070
All in all over 400 atomic tests.

56
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.340
When off above ground between 19 1945 and 1963 just imagine if only one atom

57
00:03:45.531 --> 00:03:47.480
bomb were to be dropped on an American city,

58
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.810
thousands of persons would be killed instantly. It was a sucky time. Well,

59
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.330
hashtags Zions there one good thing potentially one good thing popped out and

60
00:03:59.351 --> 00:04:03.580
that is an answer to the question of how old are we that somehow came out of the

61
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.800
balm toast. Yeah. How, um, let me explain, do it.

62
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.240
So with every one of those detonations when atomic bomb goes off that would

63
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.210
shoot a whole bunch of stuff up into the atmosphere.

64
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.620
All of these like radioactive elements like CCM and Tony m and all these things.

65
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.960
But also that explosion shoots up a bunch of neutrons and the new tron will

66
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.230
Prasher into nitrogen that's floating in our atmosphere and create c 14,

67
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.010
which is a very special type of carbon.

68
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.040
It has two extra particles in it now is all that bad radioactive stuff starts

69
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:40.840
falling out of the atmosphere back to the ground.

70
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.010
See 14 doesn't fall out of the sky and it just sort of floats there.

71
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.040
And what happened is over time the wind currents carried c 14 from these test

72
00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:57.220
sites and just spread it all over the planet.

73
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.790
And this Si 14 which is just totally like normal carbon non-harmful.

74
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.080
It just bonds with oxygen and it gets sucked up into plants.

75
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.490
And then animals eat the plants and then we eat the animals or we eat the plants

76
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.150
and then suddenly the see 14 is in us.

77
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.230
So we all have like a little bit of the atomic age in us. Wait,

78
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.640
I wasn't even born in 1963 so w why would it be in me?

79
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.350
That is the cool thing because it hangs out in the air for a long time. So it's,

80
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.280
it's actually still up there. But why does this have anything to do with dating?

81
00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:35.820
Anything? Yes, I'm about to tell you that. Hey, are you there? Hi. Yes I am.

82
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.290
Yeah, her fic,

83
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.670
I'm a senior scientist at Lawrence Livermore national lab,

84
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.200
[inaudible] professor of stem cell research at the Karolinska Institute in

85
00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:46.680
Stockholm.

86
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.860
So in the early two thousands Yoanis is staring down this question of like,

87
00:05:49.861 --> 00:05:51.690
how do I date cells?

88
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.050
And at a certain point he gets together with Bruce because he comes up with this

89
00:05:55.051 --> 00:05:58.370
idea, which is just, Oh, maybe we just look up.

90
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.920
<v 2>So Derek, there's some groups in Europe.</v>

91
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.760
There's one in particular that's been measuring the atmosphere every two weeks

92
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:08.960
since the late 1950s it's an incredible data record.

93
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.631
<v 0>Bruce says,</v>

94
00:06:09.631 --> 00:06:13.020
what the scientists have done is they've taken all of these measurements and

95
00:06:13.021 --> 00:06:16.740
they put them into one chart so you can see the amount of [inaudible] in the

96
00:06:16.741 --> 00:06:17.880
atmosphere over time.

97
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.960
<v 2>So we, we have this basically a basically a calendar and I could,</v>

98
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.200
I could send you a picture so you can see what, see what the graph looks like.

99
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.280
<v 0>Yeah, I'd love to see a picture. What you see on that graph is this,</v>

100
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.470
according to Yoanis two 1950

101
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.600
<v 3>the five it's a pretty flat line with very little variation that's on suddenly</v>

102
00:06:36.931 --> 00:06:39.420
in 1955 with all the bomb tests,

103
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.180
there's a very sharp increase,

104
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.880
<v 2>a lot of carbon 14 very dramatic increase. That's why they call it a pulse.</v>

105
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.910
<v 0>And that increase goes all the way up to 1963 when</v>

106
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.770
<v 4>the Kremlin portraits of communist doctrine is attending Avanade storic event.</v>

107
00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.770
<v 0>When the u s the U K and Soviet Union agreed to stop exploding atomic bombs</v>

108
00:06:59.771 --> 00:07:00.440
above ground,

109
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.980
<v 4>what's the signing of an atom test ban after that?</v>

110
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.950
There's a gradual decline.

111
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.050
<v 0>You know, they're just measuring it all the way down so they can just say, oh,</v>

112
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:15.590
like here's where it was and [inaudible] [inaudible] 80 years where it was in

113
00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:20.591
99020002010 this right here is the coolest part because the amount of

114
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:28.450
[inaudible] in the atmosphere at any given moment is directly reflected in our

115
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.020
cells, right? So if there's like that much,

116
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.820
see 14 in the atmosphere in September,

117
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.820
1972 then that is going to be mirrored in cells that were born in September,

118
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:48.440
1972 so it is like this totally perfect birthday calendar.

119
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.850
We can see approximately how long have they been there for 10 years or 20 years

120
00:07:52.851 --> 00:07:55.400
or 30 years. It's like once this idea got out,

121
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.940
every like scientists all over the world are like, Oh yeah,

122
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.220
<v 5>oh, give me your attention. There's been a new invention.</v>

123
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.770
<v 2>It didn't take long to see that this might be something cool to do.</v>

124
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:11.340
<v 5>It came about because they made a big atomic bomb.</v>

125
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.040
<v 0>So just to give you a quick sense of some of the work that came out of this.</v>

126
00:08:14.041 --> 00:08:15.750
I spoke to one scientists.

127
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.020
I'm Kirsty Spalding and I work at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.

128
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.990
She was working with Eunice and they figured out how to use c 40

129
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.660
in brains. I mean, first of all, the basic question was,

130
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.830
can adult humans make new neurons? She says that for like a hundred years,

131
00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:34.460
the dogma had always been that the neurons we're born with are the ones we die

132
00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:35.120
with.

133
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.360
The problem was she had no way to investigate this and she couldn't use it in

134
00:08:38.361 --> 00:08:39.200
humans,

135
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.770
even if they were dead humans until she figured out a technique where she could

136
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.580
like extract brain cells and see how much the 14 was in there. Yeah, exactly.

137
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.300
And it turns out the next best thing to human, here's a horse,

138
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.570
because horses can live for quite some years, decades.

139
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:57.420
So every second Tuesday I would go out to the local Alberta,

140
00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.490
the local slaughter house, an hour away,

141
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.640
and I mean I was a vegetarian surrounded by caucuses and they would bring the

142
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:08.550
horses head out to me and I had to figure out how to get the brain out of its

143
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:12.600
head and what you actually had to like cut,

144
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.350
open the skull and get to the brain yourself. I mean, the second time I went,

145
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:21.120
I took my boyfriend with me because I was like, I can't do this. Physically,

146
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.800
they actually had a circular saw and I actually discovered that the, the skull,

147
00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.240
the bone across the top, the nose of the horses is quite thin.

148
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:35.220
So that was a much easier access point. This is really gross discussion.

149
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:40.500
Did you ever see your research going that way? No, absolutely not. Not at all.

150
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.060
But what she saw when she finally moved her research from Horseheads to humans

151
00:09:45.061 --> 00:09:49.920
was turnover. We found quite robust levels of new neurons in adulthood.

152
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.670
Once the onuses team showed that this worked,

153
00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:01.510
scientists got excited and people started to date things and not just cells.

154
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.840
So can I tell you the ages? Okay.

155
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:12.290
The baseline ages we knew before c 14 was that skin was like 14 days old.

156
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:18.180
1440. Oh that's only for 28 days. Yeah. So like two weeks. Um,

157
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.700
the surface level of your gut.

158
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:26.010
The like the skin on your gut I guess was five days. Five days.

159
00:10:26.011 --> 00:10:28.230
That's even shorter than skin does.

160
00:10:28.231 --> 00:10:31.850
That's like the surface of the intestine or the surface of the, yeah,

161
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:34.740
the lining. That's like, cause that's everything.

162
00:10:34.741 --> 00:10:37.950
Scraping all that food going down. So though that doesn't surprise me.

163
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.930
And then with see 14, the,

164
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.170
the deeper muscly part of the intestine,

165
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:48.210
the average is 15.1 years. 15.1 years.

166
00:10:48.211 --> 00:10:51.750
Oh, big difference. Weight, 15.9, 15.9 years old.

167
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.020
Fat Cells was another one that they did. Uh, 10 years old. 10 years old.

168
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.500
Yeah. Interesting. Why would a festival need to last that long?

169
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:05.220
10 Years Towards your youth?

170
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.000
Do they have any idea? They don't know. Huh? Do they know that? Like,

171
00:11:12.001 --> 00:11:16.680
what would be one of the oldest part of us, your um, your cortex,

172
00:11:16.681 --> 00:11:17.870
which is, uh,

173
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:22.200
like the part of your brand that does like abstract thinking or your voluntary

174
00:11:22.201 --> 00:11:26.640
movements that's as old as you are. Really? Huh.

175
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.060
So if you want to know one of the oldest parts of you,

176
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:35.150
the oldest cell is probably in your part of your brain and it'll be like your

177
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.010
cortical neuron will that fits.

178
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.790
If I think of myself as the stories I tell myself,

179
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.660
like when you get Alzheimer's and you lose your stories and you lose your mind,

180
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:46.470
people say,

181
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.980
but the interesting thing though is the hippocampus is where you keep all your

182
00:11:49.981 --> 00:11:50.850
memories.

183
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:56.180
And they saw that your hippocampus does make a bunch of new neurons.

184
00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.560
Yes. So in the hippocampus, that's Yunus Friesen. Again,

185
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:04.970
the oats gets approximately 1400 new hippocampal neurons per day.

186
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.970
Really? Yeah. And then each of those neurons will live like 20, maybe 30 years.

187
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:13.480
So does that mean that the part of Robert's brain where he keeps the stories,

188
00:12:13.481 --> 00:12:18.370
he tells himself that part is being made new every 20 or 30 years? Yeah.

189
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:23.020
It's a strange thing that like your oldest stories could be stored in baby

190
00:12:23.021 --> 00:12:27.310
little neurons. It is weird. Yeah. I remembered going to

191
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:31.780
<v 6>Kyoto and it's like the oldest most beautiful temple in Kyoto.</v>

192
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:37.270
It has exactly the form that it had, you know,

193
00:12:37.271 --> 00:12:38.530
hundreds of years ago.

194
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:43.980
But when you walk in the the walls and the floors and the roofing and they've

195
00:12:45.071 --> 00:12:48.400
been restored, they've been restored actually over and over again.

196
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.300
Cause in Japan what they call old is the form.

197
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:57.390
It's the shape of the building you go to happens though and you go up to the

198
00:12:57.491 --> 00:13:02.200
Acropolis and you stand in the Parthenon there you're standing in the very

199
00:13:02.201 --> 00:13:06.520
temple that Perricone stood in. It's the same place. Exactly.

200
00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.770
Same materials. So I can,

201
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:13.330
in Greece they believe that the original stuff is the,

202
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.720
is what you preserve. And in Japan they don't, they think it's just the form.

203
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.990
And I was thinking of this thing you're doing is sort of a little bit like that.

204
00:13:19.991 --> 00:13:23.590
Like I was thinking, I'm much more Greek than I am Japanese

205
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:28.440
<v 0>cause I wanna know like what my original cells are if they where they are in me.</v>

206
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.900
Yeah. But my question is, Maxine meant more basic.

207
00:13:30.901 --> 00:13:35.790
It's like why does part of me get to re reborn in the other parts of me don't

208
00:13:35.791 --> 00:13:40.230
like why not all of me get to be reborn? Because if all of you is being reborn,

209
00:13:40.231 --> 00:13:42.830
you would just crumble into dust. No. Why not?

210
00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.060
Why is only certain parts get to regenerate?

211
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.280
It's interesting because they don't know. They said the next,

212
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.640
they said basically this question of how old is a cell?

213
00:13:50.641 --> 00:13:52.980
They said no one was asking. Everyone wondered this,

214
00:13:52.981 --> 00:13:56.430
but no one was asking this question because they never had the tools to ask it.

215
00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.940
So now they're just starting to ask those questions. It's,

216
00:13:58.950 --> 00:13:59.880
but there's a problem.

217
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:01.493
<v 7>Okay.</v>

218
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.840
<v 0>This balm pulse that we've been depended on in the last decade to start</v>

219
00:14:08.841 --> 00:14:12.890
answering all these questions is going away. Really every day a little more.

220
00:14:12.891 --> 00:14:16.850
That c 14 gets sucked out of the air. So how much time do we have left?

221
00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.450
15 years. It's gone by 2030 give or take. Yeah.

222
00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:24.740
So we need to get questions answered now because we really are working against

223
00:14:24.741 --> 00:14:26.480
the clock for many things we want to look at.

224
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:29.510
I talked to this Alzheimer's researcher who was trying to figure out like the

225
00:14:29.511 --> 00:14:31.130
chronology of the disease,

226
00:14:31.131 --> 00:14:34.850
like when certain like pathologies form in the brain and he was kind of just

227
00:14:34.851 --> 00:14:36.890
like, I just wish I had a little more time

228
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:40.150
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

229
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.530
<v 0>and when I think about this,</v>

230
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.170
like I was thinking about this on the subway this morning,

231
00:14:44.171 --> 00:14:47.440
like I was looking around and I was thinking, you know, I'm on the l train,

232
00:14:47.441 --> 00:14:51.810
it's a bunch of like 30 year old kids or something and I was like these and

233
00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.130
they're all reading or something,

234
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:58.210
drinking their expensive lattes and like these people are so far away from

235
00:14:58.671 --> 00:15:02.180
thinking about the Cold War or atomic bombs or anything like that.

236
00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:07.190
And they're all walking around with like the secret signal from the atomic

237
00:15:07.191 --> 00:15:09.080
period inside of them.

238
00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.490
And then that little signal is like binging out like knowledge about their

239
00:15:13.491 --> 00:15:16.910
shoulder and their elbow and their liver and the west side of the liver and the

240
00:15:16.911 --> 00:15:20.420
east side of the liver and like different parts of their heart and the fact that

241
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:24.830
it's now going away and how like someone born in

242
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:32.060
2040 too is just going to be really boring and like we know they're not going to

243
00:15:33.071 --> 00:15:35.460
have any insights into who they are yet.

244
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.670
Sort of makes me inclined to very peacefully want to

245
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.030
exploding another atomic bomb. What? No, no,

246
00:15:45.031 --> 00:15:50.031
no one know why you forget all the poisons that that is not a benign event.

247
00:15:50.641 --> 00:15:55.641
That's sort of an experimental pick her up or that is extra extra stuff till the

248
00:15:56.701 --> 00:16:00.890
air fill my dream. I have to kill your jingle. Dumb, dumb dream.

Oh my God.

256
00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:38.800
Alone low than that kind of journalistic

<v 9>I'd go blind watching you burn magnesium.</v>

263
00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.920
Iodine is cute the way it sublimated and yes,

264
00:17:14.921 --> 00:17:17.500
I'll put lithium in water to watch it scoot about,

265
00:17:17.501 --> 00:17:21.550
but my heart belongs to you. Magnesium,

266
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:24.500
the hot white flame,

the abandoned the slowness of you becoming your own fuse.

268
00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:34.140
Mercury is beautiful. Yes, but it's you.

269

Nothing of yourself behind.

<v 0>We are flying over Greenland. Yeah, elbow is too close.</v>

274
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.550

<v 10>armrest down there.</v>

276
00:17:52.741 --> 00:17:57.210
They are excavating uranium from beneath the Arctic ice and selling

277
00:17:57.211 --> 00:17:58.320
indiscriminately.

278
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:04.100
Though from here I can only see the white of ice sheets in glacier topped

279
00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:05.370
mountains.

280
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:09.900
This is an island of fishing rigs and colorful houses,

281
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.080
cod and cat fish, stew and tomato cream.

282
00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:19.030
Once I thought every isotope in me is radio active.

283
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.760
I make the people who love me sick.

284
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.980
This is a teenage way of thinking.

285
00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:27.573
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

286

<v 10>Wait,</v>

you have uncovered a glowing spark in the pristine frozen places within me.
