00:00:00.227 --> 00:00:02.509
- [Voiceover] What I'd like to
introduce you to in this video

00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:07.483
is the idea of a Linear Equation.

00:00:08.493 --> 00:00:11.206
And just to start ourselves out,

00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:14.260
let's look at some examples
of linear equations.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.280
So, for example the equation

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.704
y is equal to two x minus three,

00:00:19.704 --> 00:00:22.607
this is a linear equation.

00:00:22.607 --> 00:00:25.439
Now why do we call it a linear equation?

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.850
Well if you were to take
the set of all of the

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.903
xy pairs that satisfy this equation

00:00:30.903 --> 00:00:33.387
and if you were to graph
them on the coordinate plane,

00:00:33.387 --> 00:00:35.709
you would actually get a line.

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:37.764
That's why it's called a linear equation.

00:00:37.764 --> 00:00:39.946
And let's actually feel
good about that statement.

00:00:39.946 --> 00:00:43.589
Let's see, let's plot some of the xy pairs

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:46.283
that satisfy this equation
and then feel good

00:00:46.283 --> 00:00:48.639
that it does indeed generate a line.

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:50.436
So, I'm just gonna pick some x values and

00:00:50.436 --> 00:00:53.617
make it easy to calculate
the corresponding y values.

00:00:53.617 --> 00:00:55.672
So, if x is equal to zero

00:00:55.672 --> 00:00:58.771
y is gonna be two times zero minus three

00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:00.652
which is negative three.

00:01:00.652 --> 00:01:03.090
And on our coordinate plane here that's--

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.773
we're gonna move zero in the x direction,

00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:06.154
zero in the horizontal direction

00:01:06.154 --> 00:01:08.168
and we're gonna go down three
in the vertical direction,

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:09.178
in the y direction.

00:01:09.178 --> 00:01:11.406
So, that's that point there.

00:01:11.406 --> 00:01:14.611
If x is equal to one, what is y equal to?

00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:19.611
Well two times one is two,
minus three is negative one.

00:01:19.707 --> 00:01:22.110
So we move positive one in the x direction

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.790
and negative one, or down
one, in the y direction.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.772
Now let's see, if x is
equal to two what is y?

00:01:29.772 --> 00:01:33.231
Two times two is four, minus three is one.

00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:37.654
When x is equal to two y is equal to one.

00:01:37.654 --> 00:01:38.955
And hopefully you're seeing now

00:01:38.955 --> 00:01:40.275
that if I were to keep going,

00:01:40.275 --> 00:01:41.690
and I encourage you though if you want

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.541
pause the video and try x equals three

00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:45.284
or x equals negative one and keep going.

00:01:45.284 --> 00:01:48.737
You will see that this is
going to generate a line.

00:01:48.737 --> 00:01:50.305
And in fact, let me connect these dots

00:01:50.305 --> 00:01:53.903
and you will see the line
that I'm talking about.

00:01:53.903 --> 00:01:57.177
So, let me see if I can draw,

00:01:57.177 --> 00:01:59.023
I'm gonna use the line tool here.

00:01:59.023 --> 00:02:02.483
Try to connect the dots
as neatly as I can.

00:02:02.483 --> 00:02:03.342
There you go.

00:02:03.342 --> 00:02:06.035
This line that I have just drawn,

00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:08.438
this is the graph,

00:02:08.438 --> 00:02:12.803
this is the graph of y is
equal to two x minus three.

00:02:12.803 --> 00:02:15.519
So if you were to graph all
of the xy pairs that satisfy

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.782
this equation you are gonna get this line.

00:02:18.782 --> 00:02:20.360
And you might be saying,
"Hey wait wait, hold on Sal,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.079
you just tried some particular points,

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.474
why don't I just get a bunch of points,

00:02:23.474 --> 00:02:24.830
how do I actually get a line?"

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.165
Well, I just tried,

00:02:26.165 --> 00:02:29.214
over here I just tried
integer values of x.

00:02:29.214 --> 00:02:31.609
But you can try any value in
between here, all of these,

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.304
it's actually a pretty unique concept.

00:02:33.304 --> 00:02:36.067
Any value of x that you input into this,

00:02:36.067 --> 00:02:38.273
you find the corresponding value for y,

00:02:38.273 --> 00:02:40.432
it will sit on this line.

00:02:40.432 --> 00:02:41.906
So for example,

00:02:41.906 --> 00:02:43.694
for example,

00:02:43.694 --> 00:02:47.270
if we were to take x is equal to,

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.588
actually let's say x is
equal to negative point five.

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:53.887
So if x is equal to negative point five

00:02:53.887 --> 00:02:55.291
if we look at the line

00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:57.903
when x is equal to negative point five

00:02:57.903 --> 00:02:59.424
it looks like

00:02:59.424 --> 00:03:04.424
it looks like y is equal to negative four.

00:03:04.671 --> 00:03:06.575
And that looks like that sits on the line.

00:03:06.575 --> 00:03:07.647
Well let's verify that.

00:03:07.647 --> 00:03:09.305
If x is equal to negative,

00:03:09.305 --> 00:03:11.859
I'll write that as negative one half,

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.577
then what is y equal to?

00:03:13.577 --> 00:03:16.515
Let's see, two times negative one half,

00:03:16.515 --> 00:03:17.102
I'll just write it out,

00:03:17.102 --> 00:03:18.344
two times negative--

00:03:18.344 --> 00:03:23.344
two times negative one half minus three.

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:25.379
Well this says two times
negative one half is

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.141
negative one minus three
is indeed negative four

00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:31.660
it is indeed negative four.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.060
So you can literally take any, any--

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.869
for any x value that you put here

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:37.309
and the corresponding y value

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:39.062
it is going to sit on the line.

00:03:39.062 --> 00:03:41.883
This point right over
here represents a solution

00:03:41.883 --> 00:03:43.707
to this linear equation.

00:03:43.707 --> 00:03:45.506
Let me do this in a color you can see.

00:03:45.506 --> 00:03:47.489
So this point represents a
solution to a linear equation.

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.245
This point represents a
solution to a linear equation.

00:03:50.245 --> 00:03:53.786
This point is not a solution
to a linear equation.

00:03:53.786 --> 00:03:55.621
So if ex is equal to five

00:03:55.621 --> 00:03:58.441
then y is not gonna be equal to three.

00:03:58.441 --> 00:04:00.623
If x is gonna be equal to
five you go to the line to see

00:04:00.623 --> 00:04:02.674
what the solution to
the linear equation is.

00:04:02.674 --> 00:04:07.097
If x is five this shows us
that y is going to be seven.

00:04:07.097 --> 00:04:08.261
And it's indeed--

00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:09.654
that's indeed the case.

00:04:09.654 --> 00:04:12.638
Two times five is ten,
minus three is seven.

00:04:12.638 --> 00:04:13.393
The point--

00:04:13.393 --> 00:04:17.618
the point five comma seven is on,

00:04:17.618 --> 00:04:19.292
or it satisfies this linear equation.

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:21.715
So if you take all of the
xy pairs that satisfy it,

00:04:21.715 --> 00:04:22.910
you get a line.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.289
That is why it is called
a linear equation.

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.507
Now, this isn't the only
way that we could write

00:04:27.507 --> 00:04:28.057
a linear equation.

00:04:28.057 --> 00:04:30.657
You could write a linear equation like--

00:04:30.657 --> 00:04:32.375
let me do this in a new color.

00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:34.291
You could write a linear
equation like this:

00:04:34.291 --> 00:04:38.618
Four x minus three y is equal to twelve.

00:04:38.618 --> 00:04:42.315
This also is a linear equation.

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:46.513
And we can see that if we
were to graph the xy pairs

00:04:46.513 --> 00:04:49.090
that satisfy this we would
once again get a line.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.495
X and y.

00:04:50.495 --> 00:04:53.176
If x is equal to zero,

00:04:53.176 --> 00:04:54.270
then this goes away and

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.253
you have negative three
y is equal to twelve.

00:04:57.253 --> 00:04:59.650
Let's see, if negative
three y equals twelve

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.306
then y would be equal to negative four.

00:05:03.306 --> 00:05:05.907
Nega-- zero comma negative four.

00:05:05.907 --> 00:05:06.766
You can verify that.

00:05:06.766 --> 00:05:09.832
Four times zero minus
three times negative four

00:05:09.832 --> 00:05:12.547
well that's gonna be
equal to positive twelve.

00:05:12.547 --> 00:05:15.508
And let's see, if y were to equal zero,

00:05:15.508 --> 00:05:17.005
if y were to equal zero

00:05:17.005 --> 00:05:19.884
then this is gonna be four
times x is equal to twelve,

00:05:19.884 --> 00:05:21.509
well then x is equal to three.

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:25.201
And so you have the point
zero comma negative four,

00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:29.445
zero comma negative four on this line,

00:05:29.445 --> 00:05:33.776
and you have the point three
comma zero on this line.

00:05:33.776 --> 00:05:36.318
Three comma zero.

00:05:36.318 --> 00:05:37.432
Did I do that right?

00:05:37.432 --> 00:05:37.682
Yep.

00:05:37.682 --> 00:05:41.506
So zero comma negative four
and then three comma zero.

00:05:41.506 --> 00:05:44.304
These are going to be on this line.

00:05:44.304 --> 00:05:47.624
Three comma zero is also on this line.

00:05:47.624 --> 00:05:50.863
So this is, this line is
going to look something like--

00:05:50.863 --> 00:05:53.452
something like, I'll
just try to hand draw it.

00:05:53.452 --> 00:05:56.412
Something like that.

00:05:56.412 --> 00:05:59.024
So once again, all of the xy--

00:05:59.024 --> 00:06:02.089
all of the xy pairs that satisfy this,

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:04.934
if you were to plot them
out it forms a line.

00:06:04.934 --> 00:06:07.259
Now what are some examples,
maybe you're saying

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:09.976
"Wait, wait, wait, isn't any
equation a linear equation?"

00:06:09.976 --> 00:06:12.681
And the simple answer is
"No, not any equation is

00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:13.354
a linear equation."

00:06:13.354 --> 00:06:15.943
I'll give you some examples
of non-linear equations.

00:06:15.943 --> 00:06:18.044
So a non--

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:20.122
non-linear,

00:06:20.122 --> 00:06:22.920
whoops let me write a
little bit neater than that.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.575
Non-linear equations.

00:06:27.575 --> 00:06:29.054
Well, those could include something like

00:06:29.054 --> 00:06:31.109
y is equal to x-squared.

00:06:31.109 --> 00:06:31.821
If you graph this

00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:34.642
you will see that this
is going to be a curve.

00:06:34.642 --> 00:06:39.146
it could be something like x
times y is equal to twelve.

00:06:39.146 --> 00:06:41.236
This is also not going to be a line.

00:06:41.236 --> 00:06:46.236
Or it could be something
like five over x plus y

00:06:46.785 --> 00:06:48.724
is equal to ten.

00:06:48.724 --> 00:06:52.415
This also is not going to be a line.

00:06:52.415 --> 00:06:54.222
So now, and at some point you could--

00:06:54.222 --> 00:06:55.778
I encourage you to try
to graph these things,

00:06:55.778 --> 00:06:57.415
they're actually quite interesting.

00:06:57.415 --> 00:07:00.735
But given that we've now seen
examples of linear equations

00:07:00.735 --> 00:07:03.057
and non-linear equations,

00:07:03.057 --> 00:07:04.933
let's see if we can come
up with a definition for

00:07:04.933 --> 00:07:05.757
linear equations.

00:07:05.757 --> 00:07:07.649
One way to think about is it's an equation

00:07:07.649 --> 00:07:09.751
that if you were to graph
all of the x and y pairs that

00:07:09.751 --> 00:07:11.028
satisfy this equation,

00:07:11.028 --> 00:07:12.316
you'll get a line.

00:07:12.316 --> 00:07:13.415
And that's actually
literally where the word

00:07:13.415 --> 00:07:15.191
linear equation comes from.

00:07:15.191 --> 00:07:16.805
But another way to think about it is

00:07:16.805 --> 00:07:18.407
it's going to be an equation where

00:07:18.407 --> 00:07:21.146
every term is either
going to be a constant,

00:07:21.146 --> 00:07:23.054
so for example, twelve is a constant.

00:07:23.054 --> 00:07:24.967
It's not going to change
based on the value of

00:07:24.967 --> 00:07:27.232
some variable, twelve is twelve.

00:07:27.232 --> 00:07:29.495
Or negative three is negative three.

00:07:29.495 --> 00:07:31.550
So every term is either
going to be a constant

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.416
or it's going to be a
constant times a variable

00:07:35.416 --> 00:07:37.111
raised to the first power.

00:07:37.111 --> 00:07:40.710
So this is the constant two
times x to the first power.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.670
This is the variable y
raised to the first power.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.131
You could say that bceause
this is just one y.

00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:48.476
We're not dividing by x or y,

00:07:48.476 --> 00:07:49.950
we're not multiplying,

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.853
we don't have a term that
has x to the second power,

00:07:52.853 --> 00:07:55.374
or x to the third power,
or y to the fifth power.

00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:57.568
We just have y to the first power,

00:07:57.568 --> 00:07:58.671
we have x to the first power.

00:07:58.671 --> 00:08:00.579
We're not multiplying x and y together

00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:02.227
like we did over here.

00:08:02.227 --> 00:08:03.226
So if every--

00:08:03.226 --> 00:08:05.164
if every term in your equation,

00:08:05.164 --> 00:08:06.363
on either side of the equation,

00:08:06.363 --> 00:08:10.566
is either a constant or its
just some number times x,

00:08:10.566 --> 00:08:13.406
just x to the first power
or some number times y,

00:08:13.406 --> 00:08:15.554
and you're not multiplying
your x's and y's together

00:08:15.554 --> 00:08:18.903
you are dealing with a linear equation.
