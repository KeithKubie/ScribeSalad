00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.720
ALEXIS: Hello, everyone.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.100
I'm here again with Francois.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.855
Hi, Francois.

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:14.045
FRANCOIS: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:00:14.045 --> 00:00:15.770
ALEXIS: Not bad.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.300
So we're here today to
talk about extensions

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.140
versus Chrome applications.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.190
There are subtle or
important differences

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.200
that we think you
should be aware of.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.960
And Francois will
help you and me

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.740
understand what those
differences are.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.490
So Francois, let's start
probably with extensions.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.990
They were the ones that
were the first ones around.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.540
And as the name
implies, they were

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.785
extensions to the browsers.

00:00:38.785 --> 00:00:39.410
FRANCOIS: Yeah.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.420
ALEXIS: Tell us more about
what they really are.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.010
FRANCOIS: So
basically, extensions

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.610
extend functionality
for the Chrome browser.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.500
They have no UI
at all, actually.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.740
For instance, let's take
this Gmail extension,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.340
which is the browser action.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.650
You can see it all the time.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.640
ALEXIS: It's associated with
the browser instance itself.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.056
FRANCOIS: Next to
the Chrome menu.

00:01:05.056 --> 00:01:06.740
ALEXIS: Not for a given page.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.180
FRANCOIS: Next one
is the RSS extension.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.950
Pretty simple.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.460
you will see this icon only when
the web page has an RSS feed.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.640
ALEXIS: OK.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.199
FRANCOIS: And so this is
a kind of UI you can get,

00:01:20.199 --> 00:01:21.740
or sometimes you
don't have anything.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.557
Like for instance, AdBlock.

00:01:23.557 --> 00:01:24.140
ALEXIS: Right.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.556
FRANCOIS: It works
under the hood,

00:01:25.556 --> 00:01:29.270
and gets all the
requests, and filters out

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.887
all the ads, for instance.

00:01:30.887 --> 00:01:31.470
ALEXIS: Right.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.690
So I suppose here, what
you want is something

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.680
that extends the
functionality of a browser,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.210
but is not a full
fledged application.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.740
If you want to do a full
fledged application,

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.570
there at these two
types of applications

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.140
that people can consider.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.050
The first one is called
hosted applications.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.480
So these are just
typical websites,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.150
but with a little
bit of metadata.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.700
Tell us more about what this is.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.340
FRANCOIS: Yeah.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.260
A hosted app is a
regular web page,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.260
so it works online,
plus some metadata,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.570
like some permissions
that have been

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.690
granted to the application.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.226
So let's take, for
instance, Google Drive.

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:10.370
Google Drive is a perfect
example of a nice hosted app.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.440
It has the storage permission,
the notification permission,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.960
the clipboard permission.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.080
And basically, once
you know you've

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.860
got this permission
for free, you

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.340
won't be prompted
by Chrome, OK, do

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.830
you want to, blah, blah, blah.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.420
ALEXIS: But as a user, I develop
the application just once.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.200
The experience of the user
is a little bit different,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.020
in the sense that
the user is not

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.710
prompted every time for
the specific permissions

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.270
if it's a hosted application.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.580
So as you said, this is
for online applications.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.390
So clearly a hosted application
lives in the browser

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.660
and works online.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.030
Which brings us to the third
type of extension in general.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.530
But those are packaged
extensions, or Chrome apps.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.046
One thing that makes them
different from the others

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:00.420
is the fact that
they're offline.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.378
But there's more to it.

00:03:01.378 --> 00:03:02.380
Tell us more.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.060
FRANCOIS: So those
are my favorite,

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.370
and they deserve more
than two minutes for sure.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.379
We'll do another video, I hope,
if you let me do one, please.

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.920
ALEXIS: Sure.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.000
FRANCOIS: OK, so in a
nutshell, a Chrome packaged app

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.550
is a native application, built
with web technology, HTML5,

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.150
CSS feed, JavaScript.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.140
It has a very, very strong
content security policy.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.500
If you don't know what is a CSP,
please Google Mike West CSP,

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.040
and you will find tons of
YouTube videos for that.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.710
That's really
important if you are

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.900
running a website right now.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.020
You need to implement a CSP.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.187
ALEXIS: So web sites
included, right?

00:03:42.187 --> 00:03:42.770
FRANCOIS: Yes.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.180
ALEXIS: This is not specific
to Chrome apps, extensions,

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.220
this is web.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.380
And it's really something
you should look into.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.320
FRANCOIS: So CSP,
very strong CSP.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.040
And also you know they're
working offline, which

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.320
is very important, which means
when you download and install

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.520
a Chrome packaged app, it
comes with all the assets.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.980
CSS, JavaScript, images,
blah, blah, blah.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.720
And then, my favorite feature,
even though the web is great,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.450
there is still some
stuff we can't do,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.410
and that's why we
have the Chrome APIs.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.370
And with those APIs, we
can access hardware devices

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.440
with USB, Bluetooth.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.150
We can also play with
sockets, like raw sockets.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.655
It's really, really cool.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.989
Yeah, we need to talk--

00:04:30.989 --> 00:04:32.780
ALEXIS: Yeah, we'll
get a chance, probably.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.150
There is content online
already about chrome apps,

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.180
but we'll certainly talk more
about this in another episode.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.710
What all of these
have in common,

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.630
so extensions and both
types of applications,

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.670
is that they're written in
the same set of technologies,

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.860
as you said, HTML5.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.750
Tell us more about the
way you can develop them,

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.090
deploy them, package them.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.177
Is it the same for
all of those as well?

00:04:59.177 --> 00:05:01.260
FRANCOIS: For Chrome
packaged apps and extensions,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.220
it's pretty easy.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.380
If you have Chrome,
you have all the tools

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.100
you need to start creating one.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.740
You just go to Chrome colon
slash slash extension,

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.420
and you check the
Developer Mode.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.407
We actually showed that
in the previous video.

00:05:14.407 --> 00:05:15.740
ALEXIS: The previous video, yes.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.690
FRANCOIS: You click on the
Load Unpacked Extension.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.648
You select your folder,
and bang, here you are.

00:05:19.648 --> 00:05:23.265
You can start to debug and
develop your real extension

00:05:23.265 --> 00:05:25.610
or application.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.650
And if you want to deploy
it now, it's pretty easy.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.300
You just zip it, upload it
to the Chrome Web Store,

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.680
and in a matter of
minutes, here you go.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.390
ALEXIS: So what you're saying,
is the technology is the same,

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.520
packaging technologies
are the same,

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.440
and there's one place to
deploy all of those extensions

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.110
and apps.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.860
That's the Chrome
Store, which by the way,

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.570
now supports a number
of new features

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.549
for monetizing your work.

00:05:51.549 --> 00:05:52.090
That's great.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.870
Maybe we should look into some
applications or some examples.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.350
FRANCOIS: Let me show you some.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.090
So let's play a little game.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.040
What is it?

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.449
Is it an extension, a
hosted app, a packaged app?

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.740
ALEXIS: So we're looking at
something on the Chromebook

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.080
here, and this looks very much
like a packaged application.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.230
FRANCOIS: It is, it's
actually the text application.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.470
One little hint, you
can see the icon.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.110
That means it's an application.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.060
Still a package.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.360
But you guessed it,
it's a packaged app.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.826
Next one.

00:06:22.826 --> 00:06:24.200
ALEXIS: That looks
very familiar.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.520
I would say this is
a hosted application.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.789
FRANCOIS: Why?

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:30.830
ALEXIS: Well, it could be
a packaged application,

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.310
it could be stand-alone,
but I don't know.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.200
I had to make an educated guess.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.654
FRANCOIS: Ok, so this is the
hosted app for Google Maps.

00:06:38.654 --> 00:06:41.070
But yeah, like you say, it
could be a Chrome packaged app.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.020
This is a classic
UI for a hosted app,

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.910
or for a packaged app.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.820
What about this one?

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.070
ALEXIS: Could be a hosted app.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.486
It doesn't look
like an extension,

00:06:55.486 --> 00:06:57.740
because it seems to do a
whole lot more than just

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.080
extend the browser capability.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.602
Stand-alone, I don't
know, packaged app.

00:07:02.602 --> 00:07:03.810
FRANCOIS: Packaged app, yeah.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.820
This application is
called CRC, and whoa,

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.000
this is a RSC client written
with web technologies.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.590
So basically this guy just
[? reapplied ?] GDRC protocol.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.257
This is pretty cool.

00:07:16.257 --> 00:07:16.840
ALEXIS: Great.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.300
So maybe something we could
talk about here at this point

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.850
is, where do all those live.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.700
How can I manage those, look at
versions, install, uninstall?

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.930
Tell me more about this.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.530
FRANCOIS: Pretty easy, actually.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.290
If you go to Chrome dot
slash slash extensions,

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.621
you will see all your extensions
and your applications.

00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:37.120
ALEXIS: OK.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.510
FRANCOIS: Though the
name is not great here.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:43.490
But you can also use the
Chrome app called Chrome Apps

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.960
Developer Tool, and it will list
all the applications in one tab

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.964
and all the extensions
in the other one.

00:07:50.964 --> 00:07:51.643
ALEXIS: All the extensions.

00:07:51.643 --> 00:07:52.143
Great.

00:07:52.143 --> 00:07:55.950
And of course, all
applications can

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.290
be found on the App Launcher.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:57.880
FRANCOIS: Yes.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.516
ALEXIS: And maybe there's
a hint on which is which.

00:08:01.516 --> 00:08:02.140
FRANCOIS: Yeah.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.460
So you get all the
applications here,

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.710
but how do you know if it's
a hosted app or a packaged

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:07.770
app for sure?

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:12.370
Just right click on Application,
and if you see Open In New Tab,

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.480
Open In New Window,
Open Maximized,

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.750
this is a hosted app.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.850
If not, this is a packaged app.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.090
ALEXIS: OK, great.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.984
Well, I think that's
all the time we have.

00:08:21.984 --> 00:08:22.900
FRANCOIS: Yeah, sorry.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.650
ALEXIS: This was
very quick, again.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.210
We will spend more time
on Chrome packaged apps.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:27.380
FRANCOIS: Hopefully.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.090
ALEXIS: There is some
great stuff there.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:30.870
But in the meantime,
thanks for watching,

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.240
and we'll be seeing
you in another episode.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.450
Thank you, Francois.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:36.370
FRANCOIS: Thanks.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:37.920
ALEXIS: Cheers.
