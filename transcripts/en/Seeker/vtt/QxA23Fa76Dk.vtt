00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.920
Many of us watch TV or play games on our phones
at night to unwind and switch into rest mode.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.269
But more and more research says watching TV
in bed or falling asleep in front of the TV

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.089
is really bad for your health.

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:15.240
With all the streaming services releasing
full seasons as once, it’s easy to get sucked

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.570
in and say “just one more” until suddenly
it’s 3am and you’ve spent half your sleep

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.089
hours yelling at Dustin and the Demogorgon!

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.400
Then, when you DO finally crawl into bed,
you probably toss and turn and can’t sleep.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.999
Because not only are you staying up and getting
all riled up, but the light coming out of

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.510
the TV itself is secretly messing with your
body clock!

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.130
Humans naturally have a roughly 24-hour circadian
cycle — for night owls it’s a little longer

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.330
and for early birds it’s a little shorter.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.470
For humans, the cycle is highly influenced
by light -- evolution tells us that when it’s

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.270
light out we’re awake and when it’s dark
we sleep -- which makes light a driver of

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.240
our body clock.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.220
Electric lighting has kinda knocked that out
of whack, and the devices we use have an even

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.220
stronger effect.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.861
So, why you can’t sleep after Leslie Knope’s
recall, isn’t just your frustration, but

00:01:02.861 --> 00:01:06.880
also specifically the type of light TVs emit.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.220
TVs are mainly LCDs or LEDs, which emit a
lot of high-frequency blue wavelengths of

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.220
light.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.160
Blue wavelengths boost attention and reaction
times, but but blue also has the strongest

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.330
ability to offset our body clocks.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.840
A certain type of photoreceptor cell in our
eyes called melanopsin retinal ganglion, send

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.930
signals to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, essentially
the brain’s master clock.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.990
Blue light tricks it into thinking it’s
daytime.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.180
When hit with blue, the SCN suppresses secretion
of the hormone melatonin that helps us sleep,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.910
and affects a host of other factors.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.800
And it’s not just TVs!

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.590
Tablets, phones and laptops all have this
same blue problem.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.920
As more and more of us take our phones to
bed and text or check Instagram late at night,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.810
we’re getting the same blue light effects.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.880
I know a lot of people use TV or scrolling
social media to relax your brains; it is one

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.840
of the most passive activities we can do.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.010
But even though it’s good for relaxing,
it’s not good for falling asleep.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.620
Blue light can delay your REM cycle enough
to disrupt sleep, and if you’re staying

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.280
up later to watch TV, the little sleep you
are getting is going to be worse quality,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.429
which can lead to a bunch of other problems.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.109
And sadly, our devices aren’t the only culprits.

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:17.360
Energy-efficient lighting also emits more
blue wavelength light which raises a separate

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.970
environmental concern at odds with personal
health.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.980
The solution could be as simple as the right
protection against blue light for night owls,

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.540
filters that cut blue light in favor of a
reddish tint which you can get for your phone,

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.769
or you could just do my favorite thing…
reading a real, paper book before bed.

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.769

to Seeker, and if you’re curious about what

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.430
happens when those TV binges go on, Jules
has the details on what sleep deprivation

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.500
does in this video.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.660
And in case you were wondering, watching TV
on your laptop in bed is just as bad, not a loop hole.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.800
Thanks again for watching.
