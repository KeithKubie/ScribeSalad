is<00:07:35.070><c> a</c><00:07:35.100><c> terrible</c><00:07:35.430><c> terrible</c><00:07:36.150><c> idea</c><00:07:36.510><c> and</c><00:07:38.450><c> there's</c>

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:39.450 align:start position:0%
is a terrible terrible idea and there's
 

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
is a terrible terrible idea and there's
