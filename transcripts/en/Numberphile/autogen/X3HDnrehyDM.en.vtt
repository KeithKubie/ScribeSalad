they are not being witnessed by humans

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560
they are not being witnessed by humans
 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.639
they are not being witnessed by humans
and the way that they play it you can

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649
and the way that they play it you can
 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.530
and the way that they play it you can
imagine that these are lily pads and

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540
imagine that these are lily pads and
 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:19.820
imagine that these are lily pads and
there's five frogs five frogs that want

one extra rule you cannot jump frogs
 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.200
one extra rule you cannot jump frogs
onto an empty lily pad so I could jump

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210
onto an empty lily pad so I could jump
 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.960
onto an empty lily pad so I could jump
one frog there I could jump one frog

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970

this is an empty lily pad so you can't

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500
this is an empty lily pad so you can't
 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.710
this is an empty lily pad so you can't
do that so this is an example of a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720
do that so this is an example of a
 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.770
do that so this is an example of a
failure can we manage to do this with

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780
failure can we manage to do this with
 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.800
failure can we manage to do this with
six frogs six lily pads can we manage to

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810
six frogs six lily pads can we manage to
 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.940
six frogs six lily pads can we manage to
do this with n frogs on em Willy pads so

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950
do this with n frogs on em Willy pads so
 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.340
do this with n frogs on em Willy pads so
this is a puzzle that doesn't have an

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350
this is a puzzle that doesn't have an
 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.800
this is a puzzle that doesn't have an
obvious answer before we solve six I

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
obvious answer before we solve six I
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.630
obvious answer before we solve six I
want you to imagine you've only got two

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640
want you to imagine you've only got two
 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.950
want you to imagine you've only got two
lily pads and two frogs

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960
lily pads and two frogs
 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.980
lily pads and two frogs
well that's easy to solve so now we're

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990
well that's easy to solve so now we're
 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.260
well that's easy to solve so now we're
going to use that and I'm going to split

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270
going to use that and I'm going to split
 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.450
going to use that and I'm going to split
this into two I'm first of all going to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460
this into two I'm first of all going to
 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.190
this into two I'm first of all going to
solve the left and then I'm going to

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200
solve the left and then I'm going to
 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:57.179
solve the left and then I'm going to
solve the right in exactly the same way

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189
 
 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.020
 
this looks suspiciously similar to

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030
this looks suspiciously similar to
 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.050
this looks suspiciously similar to
having two frogs and two lily pad here

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060
having two frogs and two lily pad here
 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.859
having two frogs and two lily pad here
we have three frogs and three frogs

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869
we have three frogs and three frogs
 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.160
we have three frogs and three frogs
separated by three so this can be solved

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170
separated by three so this can be solved
 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.970
separated by three so this can be solved
in exactly the same way as two frogs can

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980
in exactly the same way as two frogs can
 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.339
in exactly the same way as two frogs can
be solved in two lilica so now that

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349
be solved in two lilica so now that
 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:23.610
be solved in two lilica so now that
we've solved six is it easy to solve 36

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620
we've solved six is it easy to solve 36
 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.020
we've solved six is it easy to solve 36
of course it is because we can design 36

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030
of course it is because we can design 36
 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.569
of course it is because we can design 36
we can solve for this six in the same

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579
we can solve for this six in the same
 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.449
we can solve for this six in the same
way we can solve for this 6 this 6 this

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459
way we can solve for this 6 this 6 this
 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.119
way we can solve for this 6 this 6 this
6 this 6 we've solved for all of the

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129
6 this 6 we've solved for all of the
 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.589
6 this 6 we've solved for all of the
sixes we now have six stacks of 6 all

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599
sixes we now have six stacks of 6 all
 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.050
sixes we now have six stacks of 6 all
separated by 6 then then just kind of

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060
separated by 6 then then just kind of
 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.599
separated by 6 then then just kind of
like a giant 6 it doesn't just give us

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609
like a giant 6 it doesn't just give us
 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.210
like a giant 6 it doesn't just give us
the solution for even numbers it also

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220
the solution for even numbers it also
 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.420
the solution for even numbers it also
gives us solutions for numbers like 9 3

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430
gives us solutions for numbers like 9 3
 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:02.240
gives us solutions for numbers like 9 3
times 3 because you could imagine with 9

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250
 
 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.569
 
with 9 we solve like this okay now you

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579
with 9 we solve like this okay now you
 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.809
with 9 we solve like this okay now you
can see we've really got a big version

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819
can see we've really got a big version
 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.599
can see we've really got a big version
of just the 3 so we do the same thing

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609
of just the 3 so we do the same thing
 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.960
of just the 3 so we do the same thing
we've solved it and we solve for prime

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970
we've solved it and we solve for prime
 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.800
we've solved it and we solve for prime
numbers can we go the relatively so the

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810
numbers can we go the relatively so the
 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.309
numbers can we go the relatively so the
answer is yes and let me show you this

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319
answer is yes and let me show you this
 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.610
answer is yes and let me show you this
is another you should you should take

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620
is another you should you should take
 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.620
is another you should you should take
time and try to solve for prime numbers

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630
time and try to solve for prime numbers
 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.770
time and try to solve for prime numbers
but let's set let's extend this we'll go

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780
but let's set let's extend this we'll go
 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.530
but let's set let's extend this we'll go
to 11 here I'm going to show you how to

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540
to 11 here I'm going to show you how to
 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.690
to 11 here I'm going to show you how to
do it and you'll immediately see that

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700
do it and you'll immediately see that
 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:54.949
do it and you'll immediately see that
you can do all integers 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959
you can do all integers 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.690
you can do all integers 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700
10 11
 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.539
10 11
solve that will work for everything

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549
solve that will work for everything
 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.420
solve that will work for everything
today the problem a little bit more

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430
today the problem a little bit more
 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.980
today the problem a little bit more
interesting though

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990
interesting though
 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.470
interesting though
now that we've solved for every integer

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480
now that we've solved for every integer
 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.510
now that we've solved for every integer
now what we're going to do is we're

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520
now what we're going to do is we're
 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.430
now what we're going to do is we're
going to say well one of these frogs is

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440
going to say well one of these frogs is
 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.110
going to say well one of these frogs is
actually the queen drug and the queen

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120
actually the queen drug and the queen
 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.800
actually the queen drug and the queen
frog must always be on the top of any

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810
frog must always be on the top of any
 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.220
frog must always be on the top of any
pile so you can think can you solve for

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230
pile so you can think can you solve for
 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.100
pile so you can think can you solve for
that always example you could go to here

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110
that always example you could go to here
 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.990
that always example you could go to here
but then you couldn't move this one on

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000
but then you couldn't move this one on
 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.540
but then you couldn't move this one on
top of the Queen you could move to here

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550
top of the Queen you could move to here
 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.540
top of the Queen you could move to here
this then becomes a challenge is this

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550
this then becomes a challenge is this
 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.610
this then becomes a challenge is this
always possible and does it is it always

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620
always possible and does it is it always
 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.980
always possible and does it is it always
possible no matter where the Queen is if

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990
possible no matter where the Queen is if
 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.860
possible no matter where the Queen is if
the Queen starts over here is this

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870
the Queen starts over here is this
 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.960
the Queen starts over here is this
possible so you should take a moment and

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970
possible so you should take a moment and
 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.300
possible so you should take a moment and
you should figure out is this possible

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310
you should figure out is this possible
 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.730
you should figure out is this possible
or impossible what I'm going to try to

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740
or impossible what I'm going to try to
 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.040
or impossible what I'm going to try to
do is I'm going to use this same

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050
do is I'm going to use this same
 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.630
do is I'm going to use this same
technique of back and forth and back and

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640
technique of back and forth and back and
 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.490
technique of back and forth and back and
forth and back and forth and and I'm

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500
forth and back and forth and and I'm
 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.390
forth and back and forth and and I'm
going to end up here all right let me do

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400
going to end up here all right let me do
 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.660
going to end up here all right let me do
that first so what do I need to do now I

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670
that first so what do I need to do now I
 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.990
that first so what do I need to do now I
need to somehow end up on this place

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000
need to somehow end up on this place
 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.450
need to somehow end up on this place
here and that that is doable by the same

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460
here and that that is doable by the same
 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.820
here and that that is doable by the same
technique I go back and forth I'm going

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830
technique I go back and forth I'm going
 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.860
technique I go back and forth I'm going
to start here and I'll go back and forth

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870
to start here and I'll go back and forth
 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.920
to start here and I'll go back and forth
and just by choosing correctly I can

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930
and just by choosing correctly I can
 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.890
and just by choosing correctly I can
make sure that this stack is going to

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900
make sure that this stack is going to
 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.610
make sure that this stack is going to
end up on top so this is also solvable

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620
end up on top so this is also solvable
 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.790
end up on top so this is also solvable
for all integers a little bit less

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800
for all integers a little bit less
 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.930
for all integers a little bit less
obvious now let's remove the Queen and

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940
obvious now let's remove the Queen and
 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.590
obvious now let's remove the Queen and
give instead a lazy told what would you

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600
give instead a lazy told what would you
 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.610
give instead a lazy told what would you
like the lazy told to be in third

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620
like the lazy told to be in third
 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.510
like the lazy told to be in third
position there okay so the lazy toad

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520
position there okay so the lazy toad
 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.770
position there okay so the lazy toad
doesn't move so we have got to have the

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780
doesn't move so we have got to have the
 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.950
doesn't move so we have got to have the
party on this lily pad is this possible

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960
party on this lily pad is this possible
 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.350
party on this lily pad is this possible
so take a second try to figure out it's

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360
so take a second try to figure out it's
 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.960
so take a second try to figure out it's
just always going to be possible or not

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970
just always going to be possible or not
 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.120
just always going to be possible or not
and the answer is yes this is always

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130
and the answer is yes this is always
 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.980
and the answer is yes this is always
going to be possible and the same with

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990
going to be possible and the same with
 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.930
going to be possible and the same with
the same system so here I'm going to

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940
the same system so here I'm going to
 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.340
the same system so here I'm going to
choose this one I'm going to move over

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.350
choose this one I'm going to move over
 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.950
choose this one I'm going to move over
here and go on top here I'm going to

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960
here and go on top here I'm going to
 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.270
here and go on top here I'm going to
choose something in the middle and you

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280
choose something in the middle and you
 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.730
choose something in the middle and you
just have to

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740
just have to
 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.189
just have to
figure out do I want to jump this way

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199
figure out do I want to jump this way
 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:30.490
figure out do I want to jump this way
and yes so I jump this way and we've

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500
and yes so I jump this way and we've
 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.150
and yes so I jump this way and we've
solved it

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160
solved it
 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.839
solved it
this is solvable for all integers you

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:34.849
this is solvable for all integers you
 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:36.460
this is solvable for all integers you
might want to experiment with one lazy

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470
might want to experiment with one lazy
 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.430
might want to experiment with one lazy
toad and one queen that has to be on top

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440
toad and one queen that has to be on top
 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.860
toad and one queen that has to be on top
and everything else drugs and see if

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870
and everything else drugs and see if
 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.839
and everything else drugs and see if
that is possible sometimes it's possible

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:43.849
that is possible sometimes it's possible
 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:45.550
that is possible sometimes it's possible
sometimes it's you know now I'm going to

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560
sometimes it's you know now I'm going to
 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.290
sometimes it's you know now I'm going to
share a problem that I don't know the

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.300
share a problem that I don't know the
 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:57.040
share a problem that I don't know the
answer to and this one we have the frogs

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050
answer to and this one we have the frogs
 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:02.950
answer to and this one we have the frogs
and unfortunately two of the lily pads

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960
and unfortunately two of the lily pads
 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.420
and unfortunately two of the lily pads
are waterlogged the ant the one second

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:07.430
are waterlogged the ant the one second
 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.390
are waterlogged the ant the one second
from the end on either side so no frogs

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400
from the end on either side so no frogs
 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.559
from the end on either side so no frogs
can go on here I do not know if this is

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:14.569
can go on here I do not know if this is
 

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:18.460
can go on here I do not know if this is
ever solvable for any number of lily

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.470
ever solvable for any number of lily
 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.170
ever solvable for any number of lily
pads I've never been able to solve a

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:20.180
pads I've never been able to solve a
 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.379
pads I've never been able to solve a
single one of these so that's that's my

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:23.389
single one of these so that's that's my
 

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:25.149
single one of these so that's that's my
open problem here will show you a

00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:25.159
open problem here will show you a
 

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:27.189
open problem here will show you a
failure so I need to get this frog

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199
failure so I need to get this frog
 

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:28.930
failure so I need to get this frog
somehow because it can't move here so I

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:28.940
somehow because it can't move here so I
 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.749
somehow because it can't move here so I
need to go over and grab it so let me

00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759
need to go over and grab it so let me
 

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:36.279
need to go over and grab it so let me
grab it by this technique I'll go to

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:36.289
grab it by this technique I'll go to
 

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:40.240
grab it by this technique I'll go to
that gives three now I come over here

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.250
that gives three now I come over here
 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.459
that gives three now I come over here
that's four one two three four I can

00:07:42.459 --> 00:07:42.469
that's four one two three four I can
 

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:44.709
that's four one two three four I can
come over and rescue this one now that's

00:07:44.709 --> 00:07:44.719
come over and rescue this one now that's
 

00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:48.700
come over and rescue this one now that's
five one two three four and I you see

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:48.710
five one two three four and I you see
 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.790
five one two three four and I you see
and I'm stuck here I've got this one by

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:51.800
and I'm stuck here I've got this one by
 

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.760
and I'm stuck here I've got this one by
itself now what can I do well I can at

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:54.770
itself now what can I do well I can at
 

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.339
itself now what can I do well I can at
least get this one but then that's one

00:07:57.339 --> 00:07:57.349
least get this one but then that's one
 

00:07:57.349 --> 00:07:59.680
least get this one but then that's one
two three four five I can't move this

00:07:59.680 --> 00:07:59.690
two three four five I can't move this
 

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.659
two three four five I can't move this
stack because that goes on to the

00:08:01.659 --> 00:08:01.669
stack because that goes on to the
 

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:04.390
stack because that goes on to the
waterlogged lily pad I can't move this

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400
waterlogged lily pad I can't move this
 

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.339
waterlogged lily pad I can't move this
back one two three and I can't move this

00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:06.349
back one two three and I can't move this
 

00:08:06.349 --> 00:08:09.399
back one two three and I can't move this
back so I'm stuck here so I've never

00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:09.409
back so I'm stuck here so I've never
 

00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:11.379
back so I'm stuck here so I've never
been able to solve any of these for any

00:08:11.379 --> 00:08:11.389
been able to solve any of these for any
 

00:08:11.389 --> 00:08:13.899
been able to solve any of these for any
length but it's not obvious at all of

00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:13.909
length but it's not obvious at all of
 

00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:16.120
length but it's not obvious at all of
this can't be solved for some length of

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.130
this can't be solved for some length of
 

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:20.020
this can't be solved for some length of
lily pads just the one one away from the

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:20.030
lily pads just the one one away from the
 

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:24.790
lily pads just the one one away from the
end on each side being waterlogged not

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800
end on each side being waterlogged not
 

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.860
end on each side being waterlogged not
low enough so what we could we do we

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:26.870
low enough so what we could we do we
 

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.519
low enough so what we could we do we
could split this into an eight here and

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:30.529
could split this into an eight here and
 

00:08:30.529 --> 00:08:32.660
could split this into an eight here and
a twelve we could do that and

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:32.670
a twelve we could do that and
 

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:37.550
a twelve we could do that and
now our score is 12 minus 4 is equal to

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:37.560
now our score is 12 minus 4 is equal to
 

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.860
now our score is 12 minus 4 is equal to
8
