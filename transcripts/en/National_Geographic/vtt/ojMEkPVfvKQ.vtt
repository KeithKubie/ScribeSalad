00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.700
DISPATCHER 1: There's
a reported structure

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.100
fire for [inaudible] 64.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.400
DISPATCHER 2: We think
it's a pretty heavy

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.200
flack on Adams above Holbart.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.433
DISPATCHER 3: --checking out.

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:13.333
We've got bottles
through the window.

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:16.967
DISPATCHER 2:
[inaudible] in that area.

00:00:16.967 --> 00:00:17.934
[inaudible]

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:19.066
We have a fireman shot.

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.166
We have a fireman shot.

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.133
We need help immediately.

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.467
DISPATCHER 4: Roger.

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:25.400
We can't make it down
in front with a gurney.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.967
DISPATCHER 5: They're
dispatching LAPD units

00:00:30.967 --> 00:00:34.333
along with all fire trucks
that respond to major emergency

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.967
blazes for our protection.

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:38.633
But with respect
to trying to get

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:41.700
LAPD service or anything else,
folks, you're on your own

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.633
down there.

00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:44.000
[sirens]

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.867
[music playing]

00:00:56.567 --> 00:00:57.967
NEWSCASTER: There
are fires burning.

00:00:57.967 --> 00:00:59.233
There are people being beaten.

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:00.700
There is looting.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.433
It is a dangerous night in
the city of Los Angeles.

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:04.734
[sirens]

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.934
PETE WILSON: I'm advised
that there is someone

00:01:25.934 --> 00:01:28.233
from the Secretary of
State's office on the way

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:33.633
over to accept this proclamation
of a state of emergency

00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:37.333
for Los Angeles City
and Los Angeles County.

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:44.767
This is in response to
requests by Mayor Bradley.

00:01:44.767 --> 00:01:48.000
As a result of the
discussions that we have had,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.333
there will be as many as 750
California highway patrolmen.

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:56.867
Additionally, we have
made available some 2,000

00:01:56.867 --> 00:01:58.367
National Guardsmen.

00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:02.800
They are on standby
prepared to move.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.500
Transport has been arranged.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.567
And it is our purpose here
at the state government level

00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:13.066
to restore law and order
and to minimize the danger

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.333
to the residents of the area.

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:19.233
This is a matter that needs
to be settled in the courts

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:20.967
and not in the streets.

00:02:20.967 --> 00:02:22.667
Thank you.
