So what DNA letter is missing in RNA? Thymine. You'll

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.300
notice that thymine represented by T, can't be found here in the RNA sequence.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.340
But instead, we have a new letter, U. And U stands for Uracil, which we'll

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:26.000
learn more about in a second. And since U is replacing T We might assume,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.940
based on the similar structure as well, that it base pairs with A, or adenine.
