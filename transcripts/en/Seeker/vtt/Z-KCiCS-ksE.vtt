00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.790
We haven’t found any distant Earth’s as
interstellar vacation spots just yet, but

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.350
astronomers have found a distant ice giant
for those who prefer vacations in cold climates.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.580
Hello everyone, Amy here for DNews.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.160
There are three types of planets in our solar
system: rocky, terrestrial planets like the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.400
Earth; massive gas giants like Jupiter and
Saturn; and ice giants like Neptune and Uranus.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.860
All the giant planets are mostly made of hydrogen
and helium, but the ice giants contain a significant

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.430
amount of methane ice, which accounts for
their gorgeous blue hues.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.390
And astronomers recently found the first candidate
ice giant orbiting a distant star.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.270
The exo-ice-giant in question is orbiting
a star about two-thirds the mass of our Sun

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.520
in a binary system some 25,000 light-years
from the Earth.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.120
And it’s not quite a dead ringer for our
own Uranus; it’s estimated to have about

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.190
four times the mass of our own ice giant.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.710
But this exoplanet does have a Uranus-like
orbit, and it’s this fact that’s making

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.480
astronomers draw strong comparisons between
it and Uranus.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.210
That it has a Uranus-like orbit suggests that
it could have a Uranus-like composition.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.210
Unfortunately that’s all conjecture for
now; the planet is way too far away for us

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.030
to study its chemical composition.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.050
But there’s still a lot this planet can
tell us.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.710
It might help shed some light on how our own
Solar System developed.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.950
Astronomers can’t totally explain how Neptune
and Uranus ended up so far from the Sun.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.479
Computer models of our Solar System’s history
say that these ice giants should have formed

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.909
much closer to the Sun then migrated outwards
somehow to their current positions, possibly

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.960
because of the massive gravitational pulls
of Jupiter and Saturn.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.590
Finding an exo-Uranus orbiting close to its
parent star might support this migration idea.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.369
This distant ice giant might be a glimpse
into the life Uranus might have known had

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:37.979
that migration not occurred.

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.810
Are you guys as excited about this possible
exo-Uranus as the science world is?
