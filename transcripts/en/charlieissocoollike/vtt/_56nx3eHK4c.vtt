00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.340
I am not here to
entertain you today. 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.290
I don't have the capacity
to do that right now. 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.970
I am here as one regular
human being to another 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.120
because I am not
happy right now. 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.990
I am not happy with myself,
and I need to talk to someone about it. 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.980
I just haven't been the
best version of myself recently.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.630
I said that I had ambitions
to try and make films, 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.830
but I've been making incredibly
slow progress on the short film 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.510
that I've been trying to write over
the course of the last year. 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.550
In regards to my YouTube channel,
not only am I not posting content 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.520
as regularly as I want to, 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.320
and know that I can because
I've done it well enough in the past, 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.060
but I also don't think the stuff
I've been making recently is just

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.140
as good as it used to be,
and that just makes me really sad. 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.990
And the worst part of it for me is
that I am trying incredibly hard 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.410
to be the person
that I want to be again, 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.140
but every time I sit and stare
at that blank text file, 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.990
ready to try and come up
with something new, 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.670
I find myself
terrified to create. 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.710
Like genuinely scared. 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.150
And the thing that I'm scared of,
honestly, I think it's you.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.520
I think I am scared
of you now,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.430
and that's not good. 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.330
We need to fix that. 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.010
I realized this recently when I sat down to try
and work out why I do anything, really. 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.350
Why anybody does anything. 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.640
And the best answer I could come up
with is that every person, deep down, 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.300
whether they are
willing to admit it or not, 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.770
just-- they want other
people to like them, 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.260
and that's all it's
ever been for me. 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.840
Before YouTube, for me,
it was magic tricks. 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.200
I used to go around school
with a magnet up my sleeve, 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.910
and I would make coins
disappear out of people's hands.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.160
And I did it because it impressed people,
and that made me feel cool.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.610
And, given the incredibly shy kid
that I was back then, 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.530
was a huge deal
for me. 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.420
Then YouTube happened,
and I started to feel better about myself 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.300
than I ever have
in my entire life 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.500
because people liked
me all of a sudden, 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.850
more people than I could ever hope to
impress at school doing magic tricks, 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.210
and my confidence boosted to highs
that I had never experienced before. 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.300
But over the course
of the last year, 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.340
whatever confidence I had left is
dwindled away to practically nothing. 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.200
When I try and make stuff nowadays,
what holds me back isn't the idea 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.650
that maybe it's not going
to be very good, 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.420
It's maybe you won't like it
and then by extension you won't like me. 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.110
And so I run away, which is what
I like to do when I am scared. 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.030
I run and I don't do
anything at all, 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.820
and I really wish
that wasn't the truth 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.660
because I can't escape the idea
that me wanting other people to like me

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.620
is somehow weak and I should just
make whatever I want to make 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.180
and not care about what
anyone else thinks of me, 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.540
but I can't help but care
about what you think 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.330
because worrying what other people
think of me has been my whole life. 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.210
I spend almost everyday
being anxious 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.510
about what my peers
think of me, you know,

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.740
what are the conversations that they have
about me when I'm not in the room,

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.810
what are the flaws of mine
that they have noticed but

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.170
would never dare to
point out to me,

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.080
and do they even talk
about me at all is another one. 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.690
Like do they even care
enough to discuss me? 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.500
That's what the inside of
my brain looks like. 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.780
My hope is that this is just
what it's like to be human, 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.780
that everybody secretly
just feels the same way as me, 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.180
just as anxious as I do
about other people, 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.300
but I don't know
that for sure, 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.600
and I don't know what
to do about this either. 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.290
Like the simplest answer to me is that
I should just stop caring about it so much, 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.750
but I have no idea
how to do that. 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.600
All I want to do with my life
is make and do things 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.560
that make other
people happy. 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.380
I can't think of a better way to
spend my time on this planet,

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.340
but right now I just
have to hope, I guess, 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.340
that I have the capacity within myself
to be that person that I want to be 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.880
because right now,
I just don't know. 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.380
I am unsure.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.140
And that scares
me a lot. 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.500
If you have been, thank you for sticking
with me over the course of this last year. 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.590
I really appreciate it more
than anything else, truly. 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.400
And thank you for
listening to me. Bye. 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.830

imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike,
