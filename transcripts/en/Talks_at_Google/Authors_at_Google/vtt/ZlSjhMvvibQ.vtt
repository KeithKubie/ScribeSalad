[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.332 --> 00:00:07.790
SPEAKER: Professor
Wu is the author

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.480
of "Yellow: Race in America,
Beyond Black and White,"

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.290
and co-author of "Race,
Rights, and Reparation:

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.960
Law and the Japanese-American
Internment."

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.610
And prior to his
academic career,

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.810
he held a clerkship with the
late US district Judge Frank J.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.360
Battisti in Cleveland,
and practiced law

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.630
with the firm of Morrison and
Foerster in San Francisco.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.430
And while there, he
devoted a quarter

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.620
of his time to pro bono work
on behalf of indigent clients.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.120
So it is my pleasure to give a
warm welcome to Professor Frank

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.364
H. Wu.

00:00:42.364 --> 00:00:45.226
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.480
FRANK H. WU: Good afternoon.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.030
Delighted to be here
with you talking

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.970
about issues of race,
diversity, the changing

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.140
face of our nation--

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.010
some of the subjects that
are most fraught, most tense

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.470
in this anxious era of ours.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.050
I hope to provoke you
to think for yourselves,

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.360
not persuade you
to think as I do,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.170
to think about these issues
with a new perspective, one

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.970
that you haven't heard before.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.170
I'll be talking to you today
about the model minority myth.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.390
Even if you haven't
heard that term before,

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.780
I'm confident that you
know the stereotype.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.890
That's what it is.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.560
It's an image, one of
the predominant images

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.120
of people of Asian descent,
east and south, here in the US.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.390
It's the image that we're all
whiz-kid rocket scientist child

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.420
prodigies.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.050
It's the idea that I must have
graduated from high school

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.170
when I was 10, from college
by the time I was 12,

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.050
with perfect SAT
scores, and so on.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.520
It's the idea that I learned to
play the violin at an early age

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.830
before I even started
kindergarten, and then

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:51.910
the piano.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.380
And by the time I
was a youngster,

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.260
I was playing the violin at
Carnegie Hall or the piano,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.420
or maybe I was playing
the violin and piano

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.730
simultaneously.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.540
It's the notion that I can
do calculus in my head.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.410
It's this idea that our
parents arrived here penniless

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.170
strangers from another
shore, that if we

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.730
got an A-minus on a report
card, we were beaten.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.110
It's the diligent, up
by your own bootstraps

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.420
myth with a Confucian twist,
with a slightly different look

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.530
to it.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.160
And what I'd like to do is
debunk this model minority

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.640
myth, explain why, like
every racial stereotype,

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.470
it's dangerous, even though on
the surface it seems positive.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.630
After all, we don't want
to just be politically

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.240
correct or hypersensitive.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.170
If someone says, you're
smart, you're hardworking,

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.030
how could we possibly object?

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.574
People sometimes say to me.

00:02:50.574 --> 00:02:51.490
What's wrong with you?

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.830
We're trying to pay
you a compliment.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.310
So being a lawyer and a law
professor, whenever I talk,

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.430
I have a caveat, a disclaimer.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.590
And so my caveat and
my disclaimer is this--

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.890
there's nothing wrong with
being smart and hardworking.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.000
We should applaud that.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.020
We should encourage it.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.510
It's wonderful to
see people invest

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.820
in higher education,
to take seriously

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.840
that they can improve their
lot in lives, to be dedicated,

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.920
disciplined.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.620
All of that is commendable.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.780
And I don't want anyone
to think that for a moment

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.380
I would take anything away from
my parents, or your parents,

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.220
or grandparents, those who
achieved phenomenal success.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.190
I look to them with
so much respect.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.060
I literally would not be here
if my parents hadn't come here

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.340
to the US and met here.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.550
And then I wouldn't have
done any of the things

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.520
that you've heard
from my background

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.160
if they hadn't set high
standards and encouraged me.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.250
So I want to be clear--

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.500
to be smart, to be hardworking,
those are commendable traits.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.890
That's what we should encourage
everyone to aspire to.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.060
My concern is different.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.430
My concern is when
Asian-Americans

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.770
are portrayed as somehow
racially smart and hardworking,

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.920
as if they have an
oriental secret, as

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.800
if it's something
that's unique to them

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.779
genetically or culturally.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.320
That's what worries me.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.240
And I'd like to take some time
to explain to you why this is

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.920
so troubling, concerning, how
it shows that we've fallen short

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.610
on a promise that we've made
to each other here in the New

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.910
World, in a diverse
democracy, an experiment

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.460
in self-governance--

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.970
that we will break free from
these racial stereotypes.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.420
We will allow people to write
the scripts of their own lives,

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.880
to chart their own destinies.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.830
And also being a law
professor, I always

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.630
usually make three points.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.500
So I'm going to
make three points.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.510
The first is that the
model minority myth

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.780
is inaccurate on its own terms.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.280
It's misleading.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.940
Second, that it leads to
resentment and prejudice,

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.090
discrimination, backlash.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.450
And third and finally, that
it's a form of false flattery.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.180
It's not really actually
about Asian-Americans at all.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.300
I'd like to suggest it's a
none-too-subtle way of sending

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.180
an insult to other
people of color.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.630
Let me start first, though,
with the point that, just as

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:26.980
a factual matter--

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.990
it doesn't matter
who you are, it

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.420
doesn't matter what
your politics are--

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.320
that the model minority
myth has, at its core,

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.530
a misleading falsehood.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.750
And the misleading falsehood is
it fails to take into account

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.340
that Asian-Americans, being
predominantly foreign born,

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.900
are like others who
are foreign born--

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.660
that is, they're brain drain.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.790
They're cream of the crop.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.520
It's no surprise that
people coming from Asia

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.210
are so successful, and that
their US-born descendants are,

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.790
because they represent
the individuals who

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.820
had achieved the most
in their home countries

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.590
before they migrated.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.550
They had human capital
or actual capital.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.280
That is to say, my
parents came here

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.130
to go to graduate
school on scholarships.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.770
That's true, probably,
of many of your parents

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.540
or grandparents, maybe even
some of you in this room.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.070
It means that the
individuals coming here,

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.150
they're not representative.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.060
And to be able to migrate
from Asia is not easy.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.380
It requires, for many people,
that they migrate within Asia

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.250
from the distant provinces
to a coastal big city,

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.470
and then that they
have that opportunity

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.500
to obtain a coveted
green card, often

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.150
by showing they have
superior skills.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:50.450
So the model minority myth
is based on a skewed sample.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.090
And many of you here
have STEM backgrounds.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.850
You're familiar with how to
think about these issues.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.080
So statistically, the people
who are our ancestors, those

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.360
of us who are
Asian-American, are not

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.220
like the people
they left behind.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.450
They tend to have had
higher levels of education,

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:14.000
higher levels of wealth,
greater access to this chance

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.020
to cross the ocean and
to make a new home here.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.680
So because Asian-Americans
represent brain drain,

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.890
right away you're starting
from a beginning point

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.500
where the comparison is inapt.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.620
If you look at people
who are foreign born

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.170
of all ethnic backgrounds,
and compare them

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:37.690
to people who are native born
of the same ethnic background,

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.990
there tend to be
marked differences.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.050
In fact, ironically,
some of the studies

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.540
suggest that
Asian-Americans whose

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.480
families have been here
multiple generations

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.130
regressed to the norm.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:53.120
That is, they look more and more
American by the time they reach

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.110
the third generation, fourth
generation, fifth generation,

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:59.000
in everything from how
much schooling they

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.110
have to even rates of
heart disease, and so on.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:07.250
If you live here long enough,
if your family is here

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.380
long enough, you do get bigger.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:14.390
That is, we are taller
than our cousins overseas.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:18.200
But we also suffer from all
the negative consequences

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.050
of fast food and the diet
that you usually have access

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.630
to here, so higher levels of
hypertension, heart disease,

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:25.620
and so on.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.130
So my first point is
that the model minority

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:29.990
myth, if you just
want to be factual,

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.190
and there's also the
problem of generalizing

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.429
about race and ethnicity,
these artificial categories

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:40.880
that we've created that
have tragic histories that

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.610
are so often used for
invidious purposes.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.000
But even if we accept
that it's OK to compare

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.320
different communities
against each other,

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.220
the problem with this
comparison, this model minority

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.840
myth, is that it's
based on a myth.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.380
It's based on this idea
that everyone who comes here

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.390
is literally
penniless, with nothing

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.430
but the shirts on their backs.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.210
Now, even if they came with
only a suitcase and very little,

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.490
they came with a scholarship.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.430
They came with admission
to graduate school

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.320
at Stanford or wherever else.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.140
That by itself,
that opportunity,

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.860
shows that they have something
that others don't have,

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.070
including native-born
Asian-Americans.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.810
So that's the first point.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.320
The second, though, is that
the model minority myth

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.720
generates its own problems.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.050
When I was a kid
growing up in Detroit

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:37.580
in the 1970s, my parents, they
socialized with other people

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.600
like them--

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.210
Chinese who come via Taiwan.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.210
And my mother would
often say to me,

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:48.140
why can't you be
like so-and-so's son?

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:52.100
And she would compare me to
some kid who I sort of knew

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.220
from the dinner parties
that our parents had,

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:59.840
who had gotten an SAT score
just slightly better than mine.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.930
And you know what would happen
when my mother would compare me

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:07.610
with some kid who was the
child of a friend of hers?

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:10.630
I'd want to go over and
punch that kid in the nose.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:14.990
Now, that reaction,
I think, is normal.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.810
It doesn't show that I
was especially violent.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.240
That's what
everybody wants to do

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.610
when they're compared this way.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:25.010
Actually, a number
of recent studies

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.200
have come out done by
social scientists that

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.990
show that in a
workplace setting,

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.780
even in an enlightened workplace
setting where people are

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.390
educated, they're
civilized, they're decent,

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:38.300
they think of themselves as
colleagues-- in a workplace

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:43.400
setting, the people who are
recognized as overachievers

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.160
tend to be undermined
by coworkers.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.700
That is, we all, to a little
extent live up to or down

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.640
to the saying Gore Vidal had.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.820
He once said, "Every
time a friend of mine

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.300
succeeds, a little
part of me dies."

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.930
So we all have this
competitive streak in us.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.870
And when people are held up--

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:11.620
this is a nation that
celebrates the underdog.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:15.850
We want to see people
succeed who come from behind,

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.240
whether that's in sports
or in any other context.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.660
So the model minority myth, by
suggesting that Asian-Americans

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.435
are uniformly overachievers--

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:26.560
just think about that term.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.960
What does it mean
to overachieve?

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.590
It means to have gotten
more than your fair share,

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:34.810
more than what others expected.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:40.000
To be an overachiever is to put
a target on your back, to say,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.780
this is somebody, and
part of a community, that

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.420
is disproportionately
represented

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.490
among the engineers.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:52.180
This is a group that
we should resent,

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:56.680
because somehow they've
done a little too well.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.610
For Asian-Americans
in particular,

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.720
there's a long history
of this sentiment,

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:07.840
as Ronald Takaki, the leading
scholar of the subject pointed

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.960
out, Asian-Americans
have long been punished,

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.580
not for their vices,
but for their virtues.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.240
So the model minority
myth is not new.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.900
If you go back to the era of
the Chinese Exclusion Act,

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:24.220
so in 1882, Congress started
to regulate the borders.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.000
And the first time they had
done that in a comprehensive way

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.550
was to exclude people on the
basis of ethnic backgrounds,

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:36.130
specifically Chinese,
and then all Asians.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:40.510
There was an Asiatic barred zone
for a couple of generations.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.390
And people of Asian descent,
even if they came legally,

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.340
could not naturalize.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.760
There was a color line, a bar.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.110
You had to show you
were a free white person

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:52.840
or of African
nativity or descent

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.590
to naturalize and become a
member of the body politic.

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.690
If you go back and
study the movement which

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.750
started in California,
right in San Francisco,

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.070
to keep out people
of Chinese descent,

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:05.770
do you know what
it was based on?

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.180
The model minority myth.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.600
It was based on the claim that
Chinese workers, the people who

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.150
built the Transcontinental
Railroad, for example,

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.790
almost the entire
workforce that laid

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:19.630
the Western half of the tracks
consisted of Chinese men,

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:24.580
10,000 to 12,000, and the
railroad barons, who competed,

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.930
actually bet who
could lay more track

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.830
in a day, the Chinese
coming from the west

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.230
or the Irish coming
from the east.

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:34.090
You know that term,
"chinaman's chance?"

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:35.380
It comes from that era.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.330
Because the Chinese
were assigned tasks

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:38.800
that no one else wanted to do--

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.330
lowered in baskets to
dynamite mountainsides

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.250
where they might not survive.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.420
That's where that
term comes from.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.030
They worked so
hard, yet they were

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:52.870
excluded from the ceremony,
when the golden spike was driven

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:56.440
at Promontory Point in Utah,
to unite in manifest destiny

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.050
this great continent of ours.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:01.540
Well, after the
railroad was built,

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.720
and Chinese migrated, many
of them to San Francisco,

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.530
there was a recession.

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:08.800
And the Chinese were
looked at, and thought of,

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.960
as working too hard,
as too successful.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.030
The main premise
for the exclusion

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:20.560
was that white working men, many
of them themselves immigrants,

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.010
foreigners-- so this
wasn't about natives

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:27.700
versus foreigners, it was
about whites versus Asians--

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.900
the claim that was made
was that whites could not

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.240
compete against Asians.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:39.160
Samuel Gompers, a renowned
labor leader, wrote a pamphlet.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:46.280
He was a union man, and
really progressive, liberal,

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.710
renowned--

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:48.970
but anti-Chinese.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.940
He wrote a pamphlet
in the early 1900s.

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.680
And when I give speeches--

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.122
those of you, it's
sort of ironic

00:14:55.122 --> 00:14:57.580
that I say this here on your
campus-- when I give speeches,

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.310
I always say to people,
"Don't take my word for it,

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:01.180
Google this."

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.060
So go ahead and pull out
your phone and look this up.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.220
Samuel Gompers, he
wrote a pamphlet back

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.980
when that's how you
made your points,

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:12.310
called, "Meat versus Rice."

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:15.100
That's the actual
name of this pamphlet.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.110
And it was one of
the leading documents

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.550
arguing for the exclusion.

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:21.280
And its argument-- he went
on for pages making this

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.430
argument-- his argument
was as follows--

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.280
white working men-- he was
only talking about men--

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.170
have to eat meat.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.180
They can't survive without meat.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:35.260
Whereas the Asiatic, the
oriental, the Mongoloid,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.540
they can subsist on rice.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.030
So he argued this is unfair.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.770
White people need meat.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.780
They need lots of meat.

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.920
Asian people eat rice.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:51.040
Whites will lose to Asians
in this economic competition.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.520
That's a early version of
the model minority myth--

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.900
the Asians work too hard.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.290
So his conclusion
was, the only response

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:02.880
is to keep out the Chinese
and eventually all the Asians,

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.420
because that's the
fair way to do things,

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.340
to draw this racial line.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.610
So this sort of resentment
persists to this day.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:13.600
And the model minority
myth, like all

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.550
of the racial stereotypes,
can be turned on its head.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.900
It can be flipped around.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.720
Let me explain how
this happens, so that

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.120
what looks positive
one day becomes

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.970
very negative the next day.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:28.770
What is it to be hardworking?

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:32.910
It's to be, as Gompers portrayed
it, unfair competition.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.610
What is it to be smart?

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:39.480
It's to be a geek, a nerd,
to just have book knowledge,

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.100
to not be practical.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.690
What is it even to be
good at math and science?

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:47.610
It's to lack people
skills, to not have

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.070
soul, to not be a leader.

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:53.400
People sometimes
say to me, would you

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.650
help me fix my laptop?

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.810
You Asians are all so good
at that sort of thing.

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:02.170
Makes you want to go right over
and wipe out their hard drive.

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:06.900
Not to be perverse, but
because that's a stereotype,

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.020
and it's a stereotype that's
extended to so many fields,

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.030
even the ones where
Asian-Americans are thought

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:15.030
of as successful or dominating.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.060
Think about classical
music, for example.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.810
Where would Western
classical music

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:22.349
be if it weren't for Asian
and Asian-American audiences

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:23.910
and performers?

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:27.910
You wouldn't have classical
music at this point.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:31.470
But what is it they say
about the Asian prodigy

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:32.670
pianist or violinist?

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:35.910
They always say, technical
perfection, but no

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.460
soul, no character.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:42.480
So the very positive trait of
playing the notes perfectly

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.450
is held against you, as if
you're an automaton, a robot.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:47.640
It's mechanical.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.500
You're not really a human being.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.500
You can't experience
the fullness of life.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.280
It's this idea that
Asian-Americans all look alike,

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.250
that we're humorless,
we can't be

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:02.000
differentiated from each other.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.320
Worse than that, the
model minority myth

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.510
generates resentment.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:07.690
How does it do that?

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.710
Well, this is a moment
when we in America,

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:14.520
both within the nation and as
we look at the global stage,

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.730
have an acute sense of anxiety.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:21.720
And Asian-Americans represent
both the rise of the East

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.510
and the decline of
the West to those

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:28.770
who would portray an
inevitable clash among people

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:32.400
on the basis of color of skin,
texture of hair, shape of eye.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.000
That's not the way
I see the world.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.440
But there are those who
believe that we are headed

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.110
for this battle among races.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:45.390
And in that, they portray
Asians and Asian-Americans

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.810
simultaneously with respect--

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:49.970
they're doing so well--

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.700
but with resentment--
they're doing too well.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.990
It's what motivates quotas
in higher education and so

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:03.660
much more, this notion
of invasion, of takeover.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.140
You've heard people say when
they go to a high school

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:10.080
graduation, and
the valedictorian,

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.420
and the entire
rest of the top 10

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:16.110
are named Nguyen,
Patel, Kim, and so on.

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:18.900
They say, we're
the real Americans.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.570
How come Asians are
winning the science

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.370
fairs, the spelling bees?

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.040
They're getting all the
scholarships, all the prizes.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.230
And so this model minority
myth, which has a germ of truth,

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:31.140
as so many stereotypes do--

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.240
it gets exaggerated,
and distorted,

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.870
and turned into a
threat, into the sense

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:41.070
that if you're not
Asian, if you're white,

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.640
you shouldn't take AP
calculus or a science class,

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.980
because the Asians will
set too hard of a curve.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.750
You hear that, here in
this area, in the suburbs.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:56.550
As white families say,
we can't do as well,

00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:02.730
and therefore, we have to have
preferences to favor whites,

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:06.290
not because of any bias
that they might face,

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:10.200
but because of this sense that
the Asians are taking over.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.730
So that's my second point, that
the model minority myth is too

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:18.780
easily abused and then
Asian-Americans too

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.680
easily abused, that even
though on the surface,

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:27.330
it seems superficially positive,
that lurking underneath is

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:31.110
this sense of racial resentment,
and that it provokes that,

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:35.430
it stokes that, because
of this sense built

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:38.790
into it of racial competition.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:41.910
Third and finally, though,
the model minority myth

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:46.410
sometimes isn't even really
about Asian-Americans.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:51.870
If you go back to where it
was first published in 1967,

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:55.530
in "The New York Times,"
in the "Sunday Magazine,"

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:58.260
there was a sociologist,
William Petersen,

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:02.130
he wrote what has been called
the single most influential

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:06.180
article ever written
about Asian-Americans.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.070
You can still find this.

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:10.770
It's not hard to Google.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:14.970
It's called "Success Story,
Japanese-American Style."

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.970
And it's a
sympathetic portrayal.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:21.310
This is one generation
after World War II.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:24.660
Japanese-Americans had
been locked up, interned,

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.500
imprisoned without due
process, 120,000 people,

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.860
2/3 of them citizens
of this nation

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.010
because as the Commander of
the Western Defense said,

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.830
A Jap's a Jap and that's
all there is to it.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:40.410
Because they were deemed
to be enemy aliens,

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:42.810
even if they were
assimilated, English speaking,

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:46.420
had never been to Tokyo,
men, women, children,

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.470
the elderly, disabled,
all of them locked up.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:54.299
So in 1967, Petersen
wrote a lavish article

00:21:54.299 --> 00:21:55.590
that had all these photographs.

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.060
And it was about how
Japanese-Americans had made

00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:58.790
it--

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.690
how after the war had
ended, the camps had closed,

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:05.440
how they had overcome the
bias, and they were successful.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.500
They were out-competing whites.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.620
So if you looked at
their income levels

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.270
and so on, by objective
measures, you might say,

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:18.420
wow, this is an ethnic group
that is at the top of the heap,

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.930
although there, too,
just as with brain drain,

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.090
family income levels
are highly misleading.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:27.240
Asian-Americans tend to have
higher levels of education.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.220
Once you control for
that, once you control

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.350
for geographic concentration
in high income areas,

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:33.990
multiple generations
contributing

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:37.080
to household income,
Asian-Americans actually,

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.590
once all that is controlled
for, fare less well.

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:43.350
But that's a different point.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:46.770
In Petersen's article, he
extolled all the virtues

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:48.720
of Japanese-Americans.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.730
But there was a catch.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:54.000
It was to point out the
vices of African-Americans

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.470
and Hispanics.

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:57.690
Now, I'm not
interpreting anything.

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:58.590
I'm not inferring.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:03.360
He made it explicit, because
the first half of his article

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.530
was all about people of
Japanese descent here in the US,

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:08.100
and how great they were.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.225
The back half of his
article was, and he said--

00:23:11.225 --> 00:23:13.350
I'm paraphrasing, but this
is roughly what he said,

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.030
he transitioned, he
said, this example

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:19.990
stands in contrast to what
might be called the problem

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.960
minorities.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:25.680
And he used Japanese-Americans
as an example.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.960
The real point of
his article was

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:32.400
to say that if you looked at
blacks and Hispanics, Negroes

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.030
and Mexicans in the
terms of the day,

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.250
that whatever
measurement you use,

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:42.150
they didn't compare as
well when you set them

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:43.470
against Japanese-Americans.

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:46.210
So he looked at
juvenile delinquency.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:47.310
He looked at income.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:49.330
He looked at various
measurements.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:52.110
And that's been a
consistent theme.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:55.050
Asian-Americans
often are held up,

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:59.080
and it's good that we talk about
race beyond black and white.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.890
That's the theme of
the book that I wrote.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:03.870
It's not so good
when Asian-Americans

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:07.020
are brought into the picture not
to build bridges, but to divide

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:11.070
and conquer, using a
longstanding tactic to use

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:15.210
Asian-Americans as a wedge
group to say, in a none

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:17.430
too subtle manner,
look at the Asians.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:20.400
They've made it, why can't you?

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.000
That's the concern that I
have about the model minority

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.670
myth at the end of
the day, that really,

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:28.950
far from being a compliment
of Asian-Americans,

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:32.230
it's an insult of
other people of color.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:36.510
You know, this Asian-American
example is not unique.

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:38.580
There are other
positive stereotypes

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:41.855
that, when you think about
it, they're troubling.

00:24:41.855 --> 00:24:43.800
I'll give you a few examples.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.770
So you still sometimes hear
people say something such

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:51.060
as, oh, Jews, they're
really good at making money.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:54.810
Now, on the surface, that's
a positive statement, right?

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:57.000
Who wouldn't want to be
good at making money?

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.100
But when you think
about it, it fits

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:03.480
with anti-Semitic
traditions of money lending,

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:07.560
and usury, and of global
financial conspiracies.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.680
So if someone said in
casual conversation to you,

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.620
oh, Jews, they're good at
making money, you pause.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.700
You wait, because you want
to hear what is said next,

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:21.606
because what is said next
can be very disturbing.

00:25:21.606 --> 00:25:23.730
And then it turns out that
the person is not really

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:25.800
admiring at all--

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.360
far from it.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.060
You sometimes hear
people say about blacks,

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.980
oh, natural athletes.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:38.060
And then a moment later, they
say, they were bred that way.

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.870
And then they suggest
it's all brute strength.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.950
It's brawn, it's not brains.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.520
That's why African-Americans
are good at being

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:50.590
the linebacker, but not
the quarterback, not

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:53.060
the manager or coach.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:56.090
And so commentators,
sometimes it

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:59.940
slips out as they're talking
about performance on the field.

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.090
So even though it sounds
like a compliment--

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.710
he's a natural athlete--

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:08.540
it suggests also that that
individual didn't really

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.840
put any effort into it, that
they don't deserve credit

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:15.790
for whatever award
they've just won,

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:20.740
that it's not because of
them as an individual.

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.990
It's because of them
as a racial group.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:28.850
So race is so volatile-- we've
had such a history with it--

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:32.210
that we know to
avoid stereotyping.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:33.740
Yet the model
minority myth seems

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.240
to violate all these rules.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.820
It seems to be an
example of a stereotype

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:42.680
that we embrace, where
we're willing to say, oh,

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:47.450
Asians, the model minority, and
then talk about them as if they

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:49.340
should be copied.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:53.510
I hope that I've shown at
least a few reasons why

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:56.150
we should be skeptical.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:58.820
I'll conclude by
telling you a story,

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.410
and then we'll open
up for dialogue,

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:03.650
because that is at the heart
of this diversity of ours,

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:07.460
this great democracy of ours.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.290
When I was a kid growing
up, if you told me

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:12.440
that you wanted to talk to me
about any of these issues--

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.560
race, civil rights, if you
mentioned the model minority

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.420
myth, and so on--

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.000
I would not have
had any interest.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.170
I was like any other kid.

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:23.840
I just wanted to ride my
bicycle around the block,

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.500
fit in, be normal.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:28.340
We all yearn to
belong in that way.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:32.510
And the truth is, though I'm
ashamed to admit this now,

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:35.390
I was always a little bit
embarrassed of my parents

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:37.400
and angry with them.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.400
I was embarrassed of them,
because they had accents.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.110
They ate funny foods.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:45.272
My dad was always trying to
get me to eat chicken feet.

00:27:45.272 --> 00:27:47.330
When we watched television,
they didn't quite

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:48.654
laugh at the right time.

00:27:48.654 --> 00:27:50.570
If there was a dispute
with the phone company,

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.370
they'd need my help
straightening it out

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:54.560
because my language
was better than theirs.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.240
And in that awkward
role reversal,

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.910
even though I was a kid, I would
have to be their interpreter

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:00.086
and translator.

00:28:00.086 --> 00:28:01.460
No doubt some of
you in this room

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.310
have had those experiences.

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:07.094
And I was always a
little angry with them,

00:28:07.094 --> 00:28:08.885
because when I would
come home from school,

00:28:08.885 --> 00:28:11.210
and I would explain that
yet again, I'd been teased

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:14.570
and taunted, subjected
to the common childhood

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:18.020
cruelty of the playground,
we know now to condemn it

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:21.500
as bullying-- you know, being
called chink and jap and gook,

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.950
being asked if I ate dogs,
my parents were communists,

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:28.430
how I could see
with eyes like that,

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:29.600
my parents would scold me.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.580
They would say, you should
try harder to fit in.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.240
And so I always figured that
my parents were blaming me

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.240
for all these experiences.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.800
Little did I know.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.510
You see, as a kid, I
was a little naive.

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:45.320
I thought I was smart,
but I was a little naive.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.300
I figured that it was only
as kids that we face this.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.490
I wanted to be like my dad.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:52.940
I wanted to grow up, wear a
coat and tie, shave, drive,

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:56.060
go off to work, because I
figured once you're an adult,

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.891
you didn't face any
of these issues.

00:28:57.891 --> 00:29:00.140
Little did I know, of course,
my father and my mother,

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:03.580
they faced all of the same
when they went off to work,

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.910
or if they went to the
bank to take out a loan,

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.400
or if they were shopping.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.870
They shielded my brothers
and me from all of this.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:16.010
And my parents, they
didn't blame me.

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:18.320
They blamed themselves.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.430
You see, they figured
that so strongly did

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:24.710
they believe in the
American dream that beckoned

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:28.280
the world over, promising
that San Francisco had

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.700
a gold mountain, that this was
a place of hope and opportunity,

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:32.540
as it is--

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.270
I say all this as
an optimist, as I

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:36.500
believe in the same dream--

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:41.570
my parents didn't understand
that we wouldn't just

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:43.970
be accepted, that
what they faced,

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:46.730
what my brothers and I faced,
that it was because we had

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:51.980
fallen short on the principles
that we as a nation espouse,

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:53.806
that this was racial
discrimination.

00:29:53.806 --> 00:29:55.430
They didn't have the
language for that.

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:57.388
They didn't speak the
language of civil rights,

00:29:57.388 --> 00:29:59.450
because they literally
spoke another language.

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:01.449
And I didn't speak the
language of civil rights,

00:30:01.449 --> 00:30:03.680
because I was a kid.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.260
And so we didn't
quite understand

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:09.500
what was happening when
we faced all of this.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:13.130
And so it was only much
later when I was mature

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:16.400
that I came to understand
how much my parents had

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:20.240
internalized, how they figured
it was their own fault.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:23.600
You see, they thought it was
because they were what others

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.150
perceived of them as being--

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:27.770
foreigners.

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:30.110
Although I admire
them so much, they

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:31.670
did something I could not do.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:34.150
They traveled halfway
around the world,

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:37.660
resettled, put down new roots,
achieved middle-class status,

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:39.910
raised a family,
prospered, eventually

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:43.360
became Asian-Americans.

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:48.560
But back then, we didn't quite
understand what was happening.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:53.760
And my parents always
wanted me to be an engineer,

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.354
a scientist, maybe a doctor.

00:30:56.354 --> 00:30:58.270
When I was 40 years old,
my mother said to me,

00:30:58.270 --> 00:30:59.060
it's not too late.

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:02.170
You can still go
to medical school.

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:04.360
And I was resentful
about that, too.

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.780
But what I later realized
is that my parents

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.040
had learned a lesson.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:11.560
They never articulated
it quite this way,

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:16.240
but they figured that
in law, in the fields

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.990
that I've chosen to pursue,
giving speeches, writing,

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:21.490
that all depends on language.

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:22.675
It depends on culture.

00:31:22.675 --> 00:31:26.830
It depends on understanding and
fitting in, in a way that they

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:27.370
couldn't.

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:31.180
So they thought-- and
this they did say--

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:34.570
if you use numbers,
you'll do well.

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:35.860
People can't judge you.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:37.550
Then it's not about
your identity.

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:40.240
It's not about where your
grandparents came from.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.190
You can have an accent,
because the numbers

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:45.730
are numbers in any
language, in any culture.

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:51.134
And you'll be better off in
what we now call a STEM field.

00:31:51.134 --> 00:31:53.050
What they didn't know,
and what I didn't know,

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:56.800
but what the statistics bear
out is even in STEM fields,

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.040
Asian-Americans face
a glass ceiling,

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.770
or what's been called
a bamboo ceiling,

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:04.300
so that when you look
at so many workplaces--

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:08.840
I'm astonished-- not just in
tech, but in accounting firms,

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.910
law firms, Asian-Americans now
have decent representation,

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:16.660
even arguably, for some ethnic
groups, over-representation

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:18.700
at the entry level.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.250
But once you get to
managers, once you

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:23.800
get to people in
charge, once you

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:27.070
get to people who are
leading that company,

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:29.680
unless they were the
entrepreneurs who founded it,

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.320
you find hardly any
Asian-Americans,

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:37.420
even in technical fields
where at the lower ranks,

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:40.360
they're the predominant group.

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.530
Why is this?

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:43.750
Well, I would suggest
to you that it

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:47.560
has to do with the prejudice
of the model minority myth.

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.840
This is how it
comes full circle.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.790
Because what is it
that the model minority

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:54.370
myth tells other people?

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:58.510
It tells them that
what we do is numbers.

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:01.180
It tells them that
what we don't do

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:05.920
is interact well with
other human beings.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:09.730
We don't have the character,
the soul, the people skills.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:12.070
We're not funny.

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:15.940
It constrains, in
the eyes of others

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.640
and, perhaps, in our
own self-perception,

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.970
the range of activities that
Asian-Americans engage in

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:23.910
and that they are successful at.

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:27.920
We are denied the fullness
of the human experience.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:33.550
Now, if people are engineers,
as most of you in this room are,

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:34.300
that's good.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.440
That's wonderful.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:39.360
But if all Asian-Americans
are only engineers,

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.770
if that's all they
can pursue, if none

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:45.580
can be artists or
athletes, it is not

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.960
only that stereotype
is fulfilled.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:54.400
It is that some individuals are
denied the dream that they have

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.980
that doesn't conform
with the image

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.910
that everyone else
is carrying around.

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:02.920
Now, all of this
also, it doesn't

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:10.239
have to be in your face,
egregious, overt, explicit.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.460
Though I wrote a
book called "Yellow,"

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:15.790
with a bright yellow cover to
make the argument that race was

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:18.790
not literally black and
white, I actually wanted

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.760
to give the book
the title, "Gray,"

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.817
and have a dull, drab cover.

00:34:22.817 --> 00:34:24.400
The publisher would
never go for that.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.020
They thought yellow
was going to sell.

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:29.020
A book called "Gray"
would just puzzle people.

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.480
But it's because I wanted
to make another point--

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:36.190
that race is also not
figuratively, metaphorically,

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:38.260
symbolically black and white.

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.170
We often talk about it
that way, as if it's only

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:43.520
about villains and victims.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.719
It's about the KKK,
skinheads, neo-Nazis,

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:49.780
those who would commit violence,
who would shoot, or stab,

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:52.870
or spit upon someone,
deny them a job or a home,

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:57.310
or seat them when they went
out to eat, and those to whom

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:01.100
those wrongs are done,
upon whose bodies violence

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:05.260
is visited, who are
powerless, weak, passive, not

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:07.540
agents of their own destiny.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:11.440
And there are villains and
victims, not just in the past,

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:14.050
not just in the deep
South or some other place,

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:15.550
but here and now.

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:20.020
And I'm dedicated to fighting
villains and helping victims.

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:22.210
But I wonder, if we
frame the story that way,

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:25.240
which we so often do-- that's
the conventional narrative-- it

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.400
is one of progress.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.520
It is triumphalist.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.680
It is, we have overcome
these problems.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.870
We teach our children
not to use the n-word.

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:34.080
We're post racial.

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:38.970
People said that until about a
year ago, the sense that race

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:42.030
is framed in this stark manner.

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:46.180
I wonder if it allows us too
easily to say to ourselves,

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.889
well, I'm not a villain.

00:35:47.889 --> 00:35:48.930
I'm not a victim, either.

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:50.940
So I wash my hands
of this matter--

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.970
to be able to say that
we are not complicit.

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:58.050
What I'd like to suggest is
sometimes, this is ambiguous.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:35:59.550
It's complicated.

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:02.820
It isn't a case where
you find the smoking

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:06.270
gun, where you can say,
that person there, they're

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:07.770
the wrongdoer.

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:09.420
They're the one who
espouses hatred.

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.820
If we just fire them,
all will be well.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:15.090
Sometimes in workplaces and
neighborhoods that we live in,

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:19.380
in society as a whole, the
villain has long since died,

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.170
or they can't be easily
identified, that culprit.

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:23.700
They fled the scene.

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.120
Yet we still have the
lingering problems.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.110
They're structural.

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:29.580
They're the burden of
history that we share.

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:32.070
And they're the
microaggressions.

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:36.660
Even what seems to be
a compliment conceals

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:37.800
and signals.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:41.640
It shows us something about
what's beneath the surface.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:45.240
For Asian-Americans
it's, where are you from?

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.170
I say, Detroit.

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.960
People furrow their brows,
and say, no, no, no, no.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.890
They get annoyed.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:51.690
Where are you really from--

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:54.750
a question we ask only of
some people selectively.

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:57.420
I know I've asked white people,
where are you really from?

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:58.390
And they get flustered.

00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:59.890
And they say, well,
I'm an American.

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:01.974
I'm from Iowa, which
is exactly the point.

00:37:01.974 --> 00:37:03.390
They're assured
of their identity,

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:05.076
even as they doubt mine.

00:37:05.076 --> 00:37:06.450
And it's also to
say I am a liar.

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:09.600
I can't be from the Midwest--
after all, just look at me.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.030
It's to say that I
have no privacy--

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.880
that I must disclose
my ethnicity,

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:19.770
and then sing and dance in
some way, and offer an egg roll

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:22.110
or be obsequious
like Charlie Chan.

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:26.040
It's to say that we are
always, in the minds of others,

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:31.410
first and foremost orientals,
Asians, the model minority,

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:33.600
the perpetual foreigner.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.550
So it's these moments
when someone says,

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:40.259
I wanted to let you know,
you speak English so well--

00:37:40.259 --> 00:37:41.550
they're really quite surprised.

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:43.383
This still happens to
me every now and then.

00:37:43.383 --> 00:37:44.890
I always reply, gee, thanks.

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:46.267
So do you.

00:37:46.267 --> 00:37:47.850
Because what they're
really saying is,

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:51.150
you don't sound like the image
that I have rattling around

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:52.900
in the back of my head.

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:57.690
You don't sound like you have
an accent, like you belong here.

00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:59.970
It's a sense of surprise.

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:02.310
That's how the model
minority myth works.

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:04.890
It's not always open like that.

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:06.960
Sometimes it is,
but sometimes, you

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.680
wonder when you interview for
a job, and the questions you're

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.370
asked, if maybe the
person talking to you

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:16.200
is just thinking back
fondly to their childhood

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.380
and their favorite Bruce
Lee movie or Jackie Chan,

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.860
and that's who they see you
as, the martial arts Kung Fu

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:27.570
expert, as the rocket
scientist grown up,

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:32.790
but don't understand that
you're applying to be a lawyer

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:36.270
or for a different job,
not one that emphasizes

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:38.160
the skills that they
would assign to you,

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:42.501
but that is about the strength
you as an individual actually

00:38:42.501 --> 00:38:43.000
have.

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.360
When we talk about the
model minority myth,

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.330
we are able to glimpse
and have an insight

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:54.300
into the complexities of race.

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.730
This isn't easy.

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:58.980
Race, when you look here
on this campus, when

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.320
you walk around any
selective college,

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:05.010
you realize it doesn't
matter who you are.

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:06.960
And it's not a claim
of ethnic pride.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.280
You realize that race is not
literally black and white,

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:13.710
that people don't fit just
neatly into one of two boxes.

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:17.010
My proposition to you is that
race is also not figuratively

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:18.190
black and white.

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:21.060
It's not just about
the overt instances

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.410
where someone discriminates.

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:26.010
It's also about everything
else that we can't quite

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:27.720
put our finger on.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:31.350
And we wouldn't say in
this case, it's clear cut,

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:32.970
but when you look
at the pattern that

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:36.120
emerges, you can't
help but notice

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:41.640
that all of the Asian-Americans
are concentrated in one area,

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.410
even though some would
rather do something else.

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:45.660
And they're all at the bottom.

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:50.220
None has risen, despite having
master's degrees, and PhDs,

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:53.070
and all the training you
could possibly wish for.

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:57.710
And you wonder to yourself,
how did this come to be?

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:00.180
We can do better than that.

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:03.470
That's why all of us, or
our ancestors, however

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:07.580
many generations ago came
here, because they thought

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:12.650
that here in America, we
believed in a set of ideals,

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:15.300
principles that united
us in a civic culture

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.810
through the Constitution,
through the Bill of Rights.

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:21.390
It is this notion that we are
the authors of our own destiny.

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:23.990
We write the scripts
that we will follow.

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:26.810
We are not constrained
by stereotypes, the model

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:29.300
minority, or any of the others.

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:32.540
I'm confident that
we will make good

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:35.510
on diversity and
democracy, but only

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:38.390
if we come together,
only if we recognize

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:44.150
these complexities of how
race works at all times,

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:49.070
and yet how each of us
has a stake in making

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:52.130
this community better
than it has been,

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:56.840
of bequeathing to our children
the ideal of the United States

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.440
of America.

00:40:58.440 --> 00:40:59.828
Thank you so very much.

00:40:59.828 --> 00:41:00.824
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:00.824 --> 00:41:04.100
I'm happy to take questions.

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.870
We've allocated
about 15 minutes.

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:08.690
I understand some people
are watching remotely.

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:10.490
That's great.

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:14.060
And so I will do something that
law professors are taught never

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:14.660
to do.

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:16.540
I will answer your question.

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:20.210
You see, in law school-- and I
know we have some lawyers here

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:23.210
including a former
student, thank you--

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:26.900
in law school, we just
started school this week,

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:29.730
professors usually say,
that's a good question.

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:30.620
What do you think?

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:31.850
So I won't do that here.

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:34.590
If you ask me a question, I
will give you the best answer

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:36.300
that I possibly can.

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:40.970
And I hope you will challenge
anything and everything

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:42.950
that I have said.

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:44.215
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:44.215 --> 00:41:46.090
I was hoping you could
talk a little bit more

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:47.620
about Southeast
Asian communities?

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:49.270
Because contrary to
your first point,

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:53.140
a lot of Southeast Asians
come to America as refugees.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:55.360
And they have some of
the highest poverty rates

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.153
and the lowest education
rates in America.

00:41:58.153 --> 00:41:59.740
And I was wondering
if you could talk

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:02.010
about how the model minority
erases their experiences.

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:03.218
FRANK H. WU: Yes, absolutely.

00:42:03.218 --> 00:42:05.110
I really appreciate that point.

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:08.680
Southeast Asians and Pacific
Islanders, for example,

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:11.650
you're celebrating AAPI.

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:15.880
We hardly ever take time to
talk about Pacific Islanders.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:19.210
And when you look at the data,
if you don't disaggregate it,

00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:20.240
it's misleading.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:23.150
It gives you a picture of the
world that's not accurate.

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:27.430
So I actually--
let me preface this

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:30.590
by explaining why I
wrote the book I wrote.

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:34.210
I wrote the book I wrote
because I started writing a term

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:35.880
paper when I was in college.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.880
I was a sophomore.

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.592
And I wanted to write a term
paper about Asian-Americans

00:42:40.592 --> 00:42:41.300
and civil rights.

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.620
So I went to the library,
went to the card catalog.

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:46.720
Most of you don't remember
the card catalog room.

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.640
Google replaced it.

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.590
But remember when you
went to this room,

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:53.365
and there were
these huge cabinets

00:42:53.365 --> 00:42:55.060
with long drawers
you'd pull out,

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:58.330
and there'd be index cards,
one for every book-- actually,

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:01.030
three for every book, by
title, by author, by subject.

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:03.460
I looked up Asian-Americans
and civil rights.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.180
You know what?

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:09.527
When I went to the library at a
fine East Coast private school,

00:43:09.527 --> 00:43:10.360
there were no books.

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.760
No one had ever written a
book about Asian-Americans

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.470
and civil rights.

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:16.810
And when I went and looked
at the books about race,

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:18.790
there were dozens of
books about race--

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:21.280
thick, thin, by liberals,
conservatives, historians,

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:25.384
sociologists, journalists, old
books, new books, you name it.

00:43:25.384 --> 00:43:26.800
Even though the
dust jacket blurbs

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.744
said this has the latest
census data, if everyone read

00:43:29.744 --> 00:43:31.660
this book, the world
would be a better place--

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:33.326
they touted the virtues
of the authors--

00:43:33.326 --> 00:43:37.640
when I read the books, there
weren't any Asian-Americans

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.140
in them.

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:40.056
Even though the books
claimed to be universal,

00:43:40.056 --> 00:43:41.670
and they had these
grand titles--

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:45.100
this book is comprehensive,
everything about race

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.140
is in this book--

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:46.840
I would read.

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.600
And in the first
chapter, the author

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.309
would say, well, there's
some Asian people.

00:43:51.309 --> 00:43:52.350
There are some Hispanics.

00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:53.720
But I don't really know
anything about them.

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.250
So they're not in this book.

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:57.910
I would be offended, not
as an Asian-American.

00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:59.624
I would just be
offended just as someone

00:43:59.624 --> 00:44:02.040
who's a student who wanted to
get a good grade on my paper

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:02.910
and who had eyes.

00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:06.390
Because I could stroll across
campus and see this book

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:07.690
is wrong.

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:11.070
It's wrong in the sense that
the picture of the world that it

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:14.560
offers us is not accurate.

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:19.440
So that's where I always
begin, that this is not about

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.490
are you Asian-American?

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:22.350
You want to claim your
place in the world?

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:24.210
Some of it is about that.

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:27.060
But it doesn't matter
what your ethnicity is,

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.880
where your grandparents
came from who you voted for,

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:33.030
what academic discipline
you're in, what public policies

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.870
you support.

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:36.000
When we talk about any
issue, we should start

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.490
with a picture that's accurate.

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:40.690
And the picture the model
minority myth presents

00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:43.019
is not accurate.

00:44:43.019 --> 00:44:45.310
And let me turn now very
specifically to your question.

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:46.800
One of the ways
it's not accurate

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.350
is because it altogether
omits the experience

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:53.910
of Southeast Asians,
Vietnamese, Cambodian, Hmong.

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:56.970
It omits the experience
of Pacific Islanders.

00:44:56.970 --> 00:45:02.070
It omits a whole history
of colonial conquests

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:04.110
the United States has.

00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:10.290
And it even omits something very
important about the migration

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:14.116
from places such as
China, Japan, India,

00:45:14.116 --> 00:45:15.240
which I'll talk about, too.

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:18.270
But let me address your
very specific question.

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:20.820
You are absolutely right.

00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:23.700
When you look at
Southeast Asian groups,

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:27.450
if you want to aggregate, if you
want to look at the averages,

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:29.610
if you want to generalize,
you want to compare,

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:31.000
what do you find?

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.590
You find high school dropout
rates, teen pregnancy rates,

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:39.780
income levels equivalent
to blacks and Hispanics.

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.220
You find housing segregation.

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:42.940
You find gang violence.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.460
I'm not touting this.

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:47.130
I'm saying we ignore it.

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:49.495
We not only ignore it,
we deny it deliberately.

00:45:49.495 --> 00:45:51.870
Because we say, oh, you Asians,
you're all doing so well.

00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:53.370
What do we have to
be worried about?

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:55.339
Plus you're a bunch
of foreigners.

00:45:55.339 --> 00:45:56.880
Never mind that
these are individuals

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.830
who naturalized, that
in many instances,

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:00.360
they fought for
the United States.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.130
That explains why they're here.

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:05.940
Or it's their American-born
children and grandchildren,

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:08.820
who deserve every bit as
much consideration, whatever

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:09.870
program we have.

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:12.480
But Asian-Americans
sometimes are left out

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:16.230
because of the model minority
myth, because people explicitly

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:19.735
say, "You have no problems."

00:46:19.735 --> 00:46:21.360
And then they add,
plus, you can always

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.840
go back where you came from.

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:25.690
That's the perpetual foreigner
syndrome, a different subject.

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:27.390
You can have me back
to talk about that.

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:30.320
So you've touched upon a
very important point, which

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.390
is the model minority
myth also whitewashes

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:39.360
very real racial bias and
racial disparities, including

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.760
among Asian-Americans.

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.530
There's an additional
point to this, which is--

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:46.620
and this is a very
sophisticated crowd,

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:50.850
so I'm going to talk about
numbers for a moment--

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:55.080
migration from Asia actually
tends to have a bipolar

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:58.950
distribution, so that even if
you take the groups that are

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:00.960
thought of as the
most well-to-do--

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:04.480
so Chinese and South Asians--

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.630
and you look at
contemporary migration now,

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:11.790
it has both the people with
PhDs, MDs, the brain drain,

00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:12.630
the white--

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:14.610
and there's a huge
segment including

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:17.340
some who are coming
undocumented who

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:21.600
are taxicab drivers, waiters.

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.720
These two communities
are very different.

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:28.620
And the first community
would disavow the second.

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:31.680
They wouldn't acknowledge
that actually,

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:33.870
when you talk about people
who are undocumented,

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:37.960
there is a huge Asian
undocumented population.

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:40.590
And when you talk about
the model minority myth,

00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:43.800
you're ignoring
urban Chinatowns.

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:46.590
You're ignoring the people
who, when you go out

00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:50.070
to eat at your favorite
Chinese buffet,

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:54.240
are making minimum wage or less.

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.530
So thank you.

00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:58.140
Your point is
absolutely well-taken.

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.527
And it's one reason why--

00:48:00.527 --> 00:48:02.235
one other reason why--
the model minority

00:48:02.235 --> 00:48:05.250
myth is dangerous
and wrong, but also

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:07.530
a reason why when we
have celebrations,

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:09.150
when we have events,
we really have

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:13.890
to be all-inclusive and see
the diversity within diversity.

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:20.310
Not everyone who comes
here is a PhD student

00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:25.800
who had the highest test scores
in all of China or India.

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.620
Some of them are people
coming from very different

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:30.450
circumstances.

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:34.470
There are people whose
are, or whose parents were,

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:38.910
boat people, and who
have just struggles

00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:41.550
that we can't even imagine.

00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:43.950
If we can't imagine
them, we're not

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:48.400
likely to show very
much empathy for them.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.820
But what's most pernicious
is the model minority

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:53.190
myth allows all of us,
including Asian-Americans who

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:56.560
tout the tiger mom, and
so on, to say to them,

00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:58.530
you're not our concern.

00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:00.720
You're not one of us.

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.390
And we don't see that disparity.

00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:08.460
It's masked because of the
significant numbers of Chinese

00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:11.280
and South Asians,
Koreans as well,

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.560
that swamps all these numbers.

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:18.780
Because the Southeast Asians are
a much smaller absolute number,

00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:20.860
and much smaller proportion.

00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:22.440
So thank you.

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.170
Yes.

00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:27.360
AUDIENCE: Affirmative
action and civil rights

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.250
bills were introduced
to help, basically,

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:33.150
minorities, for example,
African-Americans and Latinos.

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:37.270
Among my friends, circle of
my friends, especially Asian

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:40.480
friends, it seems that
points are very divided

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.310
towards affirmative action.

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:46.670
The majority of my friends do
not like affirmative action,

00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:48.830
because they say, hey,
look at our SAT scores.

00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:50.630
Our kids are scoring so well.

00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:56.720
Average Asian students score 150
points more than other races.

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.160
So race should not
be an issue, be

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:01.500
a factor in college admissions.

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:04.410
But then, affirmative
action is supposed

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:07.620
to help minority groups, and
Asian being one small minority

00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:08.310
group.

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:11.580
So what do you think is the
correct political stance Asians

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:14.240
should take as a group?

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.990
FRANK H. WU: So we
have five minutes left.

00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:19.260
This subject is far
too complicated.

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.750
Google has been a
very generous host.

00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:24.540
I'd be delighted to come back to
speak specifically about that.

00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:27.610
I'll just make three very quick
points, just very briefly.

00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:32.380
Number one, I'm on
the side of everyone

00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:36.610
who wants to see a better
life for themselves

00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:37.660
or for their children.

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:39.310
Asian-American
parents and families

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:41.370
who want to pursue
higher ed, who

00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:43.360
want their kids to go
to the best college,

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:44.740
deserve our support.

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:47.620
They want nothing different
from what any other family

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:48.850
of any background wants.

00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:51.730
I want to be absolutely clear--

00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:52.960
I'm on their side.

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:55.630
And I have zero doubt,
based on what I've seen,

00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:59.182
that Asian-Americans face
bias in higher education.

00:50:59.182 --> 00:51:00.580
I have no doubt about that--

00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:01.260
first point.

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:05.650
Second point-- you were very
careful, and I commend you.

00:51:05.650 --> 00:51:08.660
There is a big lie.

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:10.800
And people are encouraged
to believe this lie.

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.770
And I use the term
"big lie" advisedly.

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:16.170
The big lie is this--

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:18.240
Asian-Americans,
it is true, when

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.580
you look at the most highly
selective institutions,

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:22.980
have to score
higher than others.

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:25.230
But let me be very clear--

00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:27.120
they score higher than whites.

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.220
They have to score
higher than whites.

00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:30.640
What does this mean?

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:32.480
This means that
the real issue here

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.230
doesn't have to do
with affirmative action

00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:36.360
for African-Americans.

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:39.360
It has to do with regular
racial discrimination in favor

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:41.080
of whites.

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:41.580
Why?

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:45.120
Because A, Asian-Americans score
higher on average than whites.

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:47.740
And B, there are many, many,
many, many, many, many, many,

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:53.250
many, many more whites
than blacks in the pool.

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:58.530
So however you measure
this, objectively, the bulk

00:51:58.530 --> 00:52:02.010
of the effect, negative
effect for Asian-Americans,

00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:04.650
comes from
competition where it's

00:52:04.650 --> 00:52:07.830
weighted unfairly for whites.

00:52:07.830 --> 00:52:10.410
In other words, it's not
about affirmative action.

00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:14.110
So your friends who are angry,
they're right to be angry.

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:16.420
They should understand who
they out to be angry at.

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:20.060
So if you look at higher
education, legacy preferences--

00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:22.380
if your father or mother,
usually father went

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:24.230
to the school--

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:27.650
result in admission rates
sometimes an order of magnitude

00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:29.910
higher than in the
general applicant pool.

00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:33.880
So understand how much a thumb
is being put on the scale

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:34.400
there.

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:37.310
Now, people point out
those individuals often

00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:38.450
are qualified.

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:40.910
But understand, too, that
higher education admissions

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:43.670
at selective schools is
not about who's qualified

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:44.360
and who's not.

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:45.776
Everyone who gets
in is qualified.

00:52:45.776 --> 00:52:48.540
It's about among the individuals
who are qualified, who gets in.

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:50.120
Because there's a
scarcity problem.

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:50.995
That's another issue.

00:52:50.995 --> 00:52:53.210
We just don't have enough
seats to go around.

00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:55.910
And Asian-Americans would
be adversely affected

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:56.540
no matter what.

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:59.250
Here's why-- Asian-Americans
apply to selective colleges

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:03.330
at 2x the rate of
other minority groups,

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:05.301
or all other racial
groups-- sorry,

00:53:05.301 --> 00:53:06.550
I misspoke-- including whites.

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:07.550
What does this mean?

00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:08.920
This means anything you do.

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:11.560
So let's say you
increase the class size.

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:13.140
So you decrease the class size.

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:15.430
It's going to have a
disproportionate effect

00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:17.252
on people of Asian descent.

00:53:17.252 --> 00:53:19.210
It's got nothing to do
with affirmative action,

00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:23.980
preferences, merits, or any
program you have at any school

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:27.850
will affect Asian-Americans
in a massive way.

00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:30.580
And there are also studies
that suggest something--

00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:33.550
Asian-Americans value
prestigious brands much more

00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:35.170
in higher education.

00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:39.160
They place a huge premium
and are much less willing--

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:41.350
in a way-- so I'm
going say something

00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:45.580
critical about Asian-Americans.

00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:48.100
If you don't get
into Harvard but you

00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:53.140
go to Princeton instead, I
really don't feel bad for you.

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:55.340
Princeton is a
perfectly fine school.

00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:59.170
And arguably, Princeton is a
better school than Harvard.

00:53:59.170 --> 00:54:02.970
Or I went to college
at Johns Hopkins.

00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:04.990
It's in the top 10.

00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:06.580
Do I lie awake at
night thinking,

00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:09.580
oh, man, I didn't go to Harvard?

00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:12.470
No, I don't lie
awake thinking that.

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:13.990
I was a fellow over at Stanford.

00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:15.910
It all works out.

00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:17.860
But the third point
is, the framing

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:21.790
of this whole argument,
affirmative action or not,

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:22.870
is the wrong framing.

00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:25.210
The first thing we teach
people in law school

00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:27.190
is if you're going to be
an effective advocate,

00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:28.270
you have to know
what question to ask.

00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:30.700
Because the person who
controls the question asked

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:33.040
has already determined
the answer to be given.

00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:36.880
When we frame this as, should we
have affirmative action or not,

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:38.950
anyone who supports
diversity has already lost.

00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:41.560
The real question is, how do
we make good on our ideals

00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:44.490
in a practical way?

00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:47.020
And for some people,
they don't care.

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:50.500
If the entering class at
Stanford or Berkeley has one

00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:53.950
African-American in it,
and for some programs--

00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:55.570
and remember, in
California, 1996,

00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:58.810
voters abolished in the UC
system consideration of race.

00:54:58.810 --> 00:54:59.860
It does not occur.

00:55:02.544 --> 00:55:04.460
And immediately afterward,
and you can look up

00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:07.190
all this data for many
different programs, law,

00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:09.140
different graduate
schools, you had

00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:11.090
zero or one African-American.

00:55:11.090 --> 00:55:13.760
Not just African-Americans-- if
you look at Southeast Asians,

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:16.070
if you look at Berkeley
Law School, for example,

00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:18.470
I think the year
after Prop 209 passed,

00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:21.280
it had either zero
or one Filipino.

00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:25.500
I'm not talking
about we should have

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:28.270
proportional
representation or quotas.

00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:32.370
And I don't have a fancy
constitutional theory for this.

00:55:32.370 --> 00:55:35.400
I'm just going to say
something that I believe.

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:37.260
You don't have to
believe as I believe.

00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:43.200
I think if a law school has
zero African-Americans, that's

00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:45.370
not good.

00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:49.950
That's just-- as a society,
we can't have that outcome.

00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:51.870
That is not an
acceptable outcome,

00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:55.080
or if it has zero Filipinos.

00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:57.900
The largest concentration of
Filipinos in North America

00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:00.090
is in Daly City.

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:02.610
And if the institutions,
the public institutions

00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:04.320
of higher education
in the Bay Area

00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:08.550
enroll next to no Filipinos, we
ought to be worried about that.

00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:09.300
One last question.

00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:09.800
Yeah.

00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:12.737
You have a question.

00:56:12.737 --> 00:56:14.820
AUDIENCE: You've shared a
lot of insightful things

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:15.870
that even I didn't know.

00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:17.800
I thought I'd heard all
these things before.

00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:21.864
So how should we take
action in forums?

00:56:21.864 --> 00:56:22.530
When do we talk?

00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:27.030
Or is this kind of a topic which
is always smaller of importance

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:28.719
than the larger ones
that are present,

00:56:28.719 --> 00:56:30.510
like physical violence,
or-- because you're

00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:32.250
talking about subtext.

00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:37.080
Someone [INAUDIBLE] hurt
you, less urgent, but still

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:38.080
important to talk about.

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:38.829
FRANK H. WU: Yeah.

00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:39.360
Yeah.

00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:41.850
I'm going to tell one
last story in closing.

00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:43.470
We're already at one and two--

00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:44.880
I have two and a half minutes?

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:45.990
SPEAKER: It's OK.

00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:51.890
FRANK H. WU: So when I was a
kid growing up, I was beaten up.

00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:53.120
I often fought back.

00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:57.500
I like to think I did pretty
well in the scrapes I got into.

00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:00.290
Even today, even in San
Francisco, when I walk down

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:02.300
the street, sometimes
a kid comes up to me

00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:03.800
and does the Ching
Chong, you know,

00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:06.197
karate Kung Fu moves,
howling and hissing,

00:57:06.197 --> 00:57:07.655
even if I'm wearing
a coat and tie.

00:57:07.655 --> 00:57:11.570
They're pretty sure I've got
that black belt on underneath.

00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:15.050
Here's something
interesting-- when I was a kid

00:57:15.050 --> 00:57:20.060
on the playground during recess,
and all of these issues--

00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:21.350
this is where they occur--

00:57:21.350 --> 00:57:24.860
bullying on the
playground during recess

00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:26.600
when you're seven years old.

00:57:30.496 --> 00:57:35.090
And my classmates-- there's
a term now, frenemies--

00:57:35.090 --> 00:57:36.720
they were sort of my friends.

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.124
That's what's most
troubling, because it's

00:57:39.124 --> 00:57:40.790
one thing if it's
someone who hates you,

00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:42.350
and you know they hate
you, and they do this.

00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:43.640
But sometimes it's the
people you play with.

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:45.431
You think they're your
friends, but then it

00:57:45.431 --> 00:57:49.064
turns out in a moment
when they're not thinking,

00:57:49.064 --> 00:57:49.980
they call you a chink.

00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:51.110
Or they say, not you.

00:57:51.110 --> 00:57:52.650
We like you.

00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:55.910
But they think of your
parents as chinks.

00:57:55.910 --> 00:58:01.830
So it didn't happen
every day, but it

00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:04.270
happened almost every day.

00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:06.920
And what I would
say to the teacher

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:08.399
that yet again
this happened, you

00:58:08.399 --> 00:58:09.690
know what they would say to me?

00:58:09.690 --> 00:58:13.410
They would say, just tell
them, sticks and stones

00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:16.170
will break my bones, but
words will never hurt me.

00:58:16.170 --> 00:58:20.612
Any of you ever hear that, along
with "Chinese, Japanese, dirty

00:58:20.612 --> 00:58:21.570
knees, what are these?"

00:58:21.570 --> 00:58:23.653
And then people pull their
eyes back in the slant.

00:58:23.653 --> 00:58:25.440
That still goes on today.

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:28.110
By most measurements,
bullying is

00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:32.220
highest among either
Asian kids or Muslim kids.

00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:33.910
Other groups don't
get bullied as much.

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:35.493
And the bullying
comes from all sides.

00:58:35.493 --> 00:58:37.860
It can be from whites,
blacks, Hispanics.

00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:41.010
It can even be
from other Asians.

00:58:41.010 --> 00:58:43.460
So even as a kid, I
thought, you know,

00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:45.480
the sticks and stones line--

00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:46.690
I'm not persuaded by it.

00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:49.270
There's something wrong
with it, for two reasons.

00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:52.640
The first is-- and so I'm going
to slightly take issue with

00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:54.110
what you said--

00:58:54.110 --> 00:58:56.690
the words lead to the
sticks and stones.

00:58:56.690 --> 00:59:00.770
So yes, the words
are almost trivial.

00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:03.020
They're certainly trivial
to the person uttering them.

00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:05.730
They're traumatic to the person
who hears them repeatedly.

00:59:05.730 --> 00:59:07.366
But it falls on a spectrum.

00:59:07.366 --> 00:59:09.240
When you look at hate
crimes like the killing

00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:11.135
of Vincent Chin in
Detroit, my hometown--

00:59:11.135 --> 00:59:12.510
I didn't know
Chin, but I grew up

00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:14.093
a few miles from
where this happened--

00:59:14.093 --> 00:59:17.610
in one sentence, 27-year-old
in 1982 bludgeoned to death

00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:20.550
with a baseball bat by
autoworkers who blamed him

00:59:20.550 --> 00:59:22.761
for the success of
Japanese car companies,

00:59:22.761 --> 00:59:24.510
even though he was of
Chinese descent, not

00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:27.570
Japanese, and American, not a
foreigner-- mistaken identity

00:59:27.570 --> 00:59:28.650
twice over.

00:59:28.650 --> 00:59:31.710
Wouldn't have been right if
they'd picked more precisely,

00:59:31.710 --> 00:59:33.720
and killed someone
of Japanese descent

00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:35.700
for representing
Tokyo and Toyota.

00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:37.920
But the point of
this is what preceded

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:39.390
that bludgeoning death?

00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:42.480
Chink, jap, nip.

00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:44.730
And then they finally said,
it's because of you little

00:59:44.730 --> 00:59:45.637
motherfuckers.

00:59:45.637 --> 00:59:46.470
Pardon the language.

00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:47.928
Because of you
little motherfuckers

00:59:47.928 --> 00:59:49.230
that we're out of work.

00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:51.120
Those words are fighting words.

00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:53.010
They got people riled up.

00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:56.600
Alcohol, testosterone,
hatred-- it all mixed together.

00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:02.670
So my first concern is, yeah,
the words, they are just words.

01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:07.830
But as we've seen recently,
tweets, memes, this all

01:00:07.830 --> 01:00:08.460
has power.

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:12.000
This is the hatred on the
web, the sophisticated modern

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:12.810
version.

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:16.440
This is how people are primed
to go out and do this, even

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.230
ordinary people.

01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:19.730
They're not bigots
through and through.

01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:23.080
But they go to a rally,
a neo-Nazi rally.

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:24.100
They get all excited.

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:26.200
The Asians are taking over.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:30.340
China is rising, and look
at all these Asian-Americans

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:31.420
at your school.

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:34.060
How come they get
all the goodies?

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:36.760
And those words stir people up.

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:39.276
The other reason this
sticks and stones retort

01:00:39.276 --> 01:00:41.650
never persuaded me is, I'll
be honest, when you're a kid,

01:00:41.650 --> 01:00:44.007
you suffer all sorts
of physical harm.

01:00:44.007 --> 01:00:46.090
You fly off a swing set,
you knock your teeth out.

01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:47.670
I actually did that.

01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:48.580
You have high fevers.

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:50.534
You tumble down stairs,
you break your arm.

01:00:50.534 --> 01:00:52.200
If you're a kid, and
you break your arm,

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.580
especially if you're a boy,
you've got street cred.

01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:55.475
You've got a cast.

01:00:55.475 --> 01:00:56.350
People sign the cast.

01:00:56.350 --> 01:00:58.450
You're cool for six weeks
because you walk around

01:00:58.450 --> 01:00:59.420
with that cast.

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:00.370
You recover.

01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:04.090
You recover from physical harms
that adults couldn't take.

01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:08.240
I look back on
that, and I think,

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:11.340
that's all right I knocked my
teeth out on the swing set.

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:13.424
That's a pretty good story.

01:01:13.424 --> 01:01:15.590
I mean, who doesn't do
something like that as a kid?

01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:17.430
It's rough and tumble.

01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:21.140
But even now, if a car drives
away and someone shouts,

01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:22.820
go back to where
you came from, I'll

01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:26.300
tell you that packs a
wallop more than a punch.

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:27.620
It reduces me to nothing.

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:33.530
It says not just me, but all
of my kin, we don't belong,

01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:37.230
that we have no rights.

01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:39.442
So how do we respond?

01:01:39.442 --> 01:01:41.400
I'm going to give you a
law professor's answer.

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.260
There is no one answer.

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:45.570
You don't respond the
same way at the workplace

01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:53.280
or to your new girlfriend's
grandmother, who says, oh, gee,

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.500
you're taller than most Chinese.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.822
You don't immediately
say, you're a bigot.

01:01:57.822 --> 01:01:59.280
That's not an
appropriate response.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.863
You have to calibrate
for the context.

01:02:00.863 --> 01:02:02.650
It takes multiple strategies.

01:02:02.650 --> 01:02:04.760
But it takes bridge building.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:11.150
It takes working with others,
which requires acknowledging

01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:13.040
that there is an issue.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:16.580
Truth is, and this is
the last thing I'll say,

01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:18.230
I've never gone hungry at night.

01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:22.550
I recognize that I'm relatively
privileged, that the prejudice

01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:25.400
I face, even though we don't
want to compare suffering,

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:28.440
because that contest
has no winners,

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:31.450
I'm not stereotyped as a thug
when I walk down the street.

01:02:31.450 --> 01:02:35.310
The worst is these karate moves.

01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:39.860
So it takes understanding
that this is all around us,

01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:43.050
that even if you achieve the
highest level of success--

01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:47.430
so I used to run a campus of
the University of California.

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:48.810
That's not small.

01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:50.970
My mother was proud I
had the title Chancellor.

01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:53.340
It sounds even
better in Mandarin.

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:57.330
And I would go out,
and I would fundraise.

01:02:57.330 --> 01:02:58.200
I'd meet donors.

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.720
I'd meet alumni,
judges, lawyers.

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:04.350
I would see important people.

01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:09.320
In a busy week, I might meet 100
strangers, shake their hands.

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:13.470
I can't tell you how many times,
not every day, but every month,

01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:15.821
sometimes more than once a
month, someone would meet me,

01:03:15.821 --> 01:03:16.820
and they'd be surprised.

01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:18.900
They'd say, really,
you're the chancellor?

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:20.196
You're the dean?

01:03:20.196 --> 01:03:22.806
They would look at my
card, and they'd say--

01:03:22.806 --> 01:03:24.680
they would actually do
this-- they would say,

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:27.810
is this title right?

01:03:27.810 --> 01:03:30.390
They just wouldn't
believe that I was

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:32.010
the CEO, that I was in charge.

01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:34.200
They would just
tell me to my face,

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:37.190
oh, you mean you're
an associate dean?

01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:40.530
I would say, no, no, I actually
am in charge of the place.

01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:42.150
But here's the kicker--

01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:47.160
I would usually be staffed by
somebody, fundraiser, or CFO,

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:49.260
general counsel,
sometimes students

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:51.090
would be out there with me.

01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:52.855
But someone would be there.

01:03:52.855 --> 01:03:54.980
I think of them as colleagues,
but they were always

01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:55.620
junior to me.

01:03:55.620 --> 01:04:00.380
They reported to me,
because I was the CEO.

01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:04.610
Not once, never in
almost six years,

01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:08.710
10,000 strangers I met, never
did anyone look at someone

01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:14.660
who's a white male
and think, I'm sorry,

01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:15.910
that's not what I want to say.

01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:18.890
Not once anyone look at
anyone who is female or black

01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:21.320
and think that they
were in charge.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.450
They always understood they
were subordinate to me.

01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:26.800
But more than once, a dozen
times, couple dozen times,

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:29.220
someone would look
at white males,

01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:31.472
and when we were coming
in, and they were told,

01:04:31.472 --> 01:04:33.180
you're going to meet
with the chancellor,

01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:35.430
they would go over to the
white male subordinate to me

01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:36.570
and shake their hand.

01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:39.110
And then there would be
this awkward embarrassment,

01:04:39.110 --> 01:04:40.980
when it would be
explained, no, no,

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:43.860
that's actually the
person staffing me.

01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:46.840
Now, is that person
a racist, a sexist?

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:48.720
No, they're just
an ordinary person

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:51.810
who assumes if they're going to
meet the individual in charge,

01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:53.230
it's going to be a white male.

01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:55.140
So what did I learn from this?

01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:58.290
I learned that all
women were presumed

01:04:58.290 --> 01:04:59.640
to be subordinate to me.

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:00.540
That's not good.

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:01.950
That's just sexism.

01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:04.740
And that essentially
anyone African-American

01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:07.200
is assumed to be
subordinate to me.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:10.890
But white men often,
not always, but often

01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:12.810
were assumed to be my superior.

01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:15.990
I was there just to
carry their bags.

01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:18.762
So these issues arise.

01:05:18.762 --> 01:05:20.220
And once you start
looking at them,

01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:23.880
once you start realizing that
it's around us in the world,

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:30.280
you start to see that yes,
work twice as hard, study,

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.090
be successful.

01:05:32.090 --> 01:05:33.790
But if you really
want to achieve--

01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:37.180
not only for yourself, but for
our society, for a community--

01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:39.520
the potential of this
nation, what it stands for,

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:43.720
what we are proud of, those
principles that we proclaim,

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:46.120
regrettably, there
are these moments,

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.100
even in the San
Francisco Bay Area,

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:49.990
even in the most
enlightened workplace, where

01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:51.250
you have to catch yourself.

01:05:51.250 --> 01:05:54.340
And you have to say,
excuse me, I think

01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:56.590
I need to say something now.

01:05:56.590 --> 01:05:58.430
And that's not easy.

01:05:58.430 --> 01:06:00.745
That's why we have
sessions such as this.

01:06:00.745 --> 01:06:04.060
And it's why it's so important
to stand up and speak out.

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:05.440
Those are my last words.

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.590
Stand up.

01:06:06.590 --> 01:06:07.810
Speak out.

01:06:07.810 --> 01:06:08.980
You'll be the better for it.

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:10.210
So will your community.

01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:11.680
So will our nation.

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.030
Thank you so much.

01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:16.080
