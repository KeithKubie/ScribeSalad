00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
[Narrator] And what we need to make a network work is a protocol, and what a protocol is

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is a set of rules that people agree to

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that tell you how 2 entities can talk to each other.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
For the web, the protocol gives rules about how a client and a server talk to each other.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The client is the web browser and the server is the web server.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
That might be Udacity.com.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The web browser is what you're running at home,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and what the protocol says is if you want to get the server to do something

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the client has to send a message in a particular way.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The protocol that we use on the web is called hypertext transfer protocol

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
which is abbreviated as HTTP.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
When you look in your browser, almost all the URLs that you use start with HTTP.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
That indicates that the protocol that you should use to talk to the server

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
that you're requesting a document from is this protocol called hypertext transfer protocol,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and it's a very simple protocol.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
There aren't too many messages.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
There's actually only 2 main messages and there's only 1 we'll talk about.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
That's the message called get.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The client can send a message to the server

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
where the message says get and then the name of the object that you want to get.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
That's all the client does.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It sends a message like this, and if you remember the Python code for get page,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
while it's calling some library function that actually does this.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It's sending the get message to the server.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The server will get that message.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It will do run some code on it.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It will find a file that was requested.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It might run some more code to get the result.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Take the web application course to understand more about what the server does,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but what matters to the client and what matters to us in using this is what happens after that.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The server sends back a response,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
which is the contents of the requested object.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
That's the whole protocol; that's what's going on whether you send a web request

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
using your browser, by clinking on a link.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Well, then the browser is doing a lot of things to figure out what you requested,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and then it's sending a get message to the right web server

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that was the server specified by the URL to know which server it is,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and then it's getting a response, and it's doing--processing on that response to render it.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
If you want to understand more about what the web browser is doing

00:02:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
take the programming languages class that focuses on how to build a web browser.
