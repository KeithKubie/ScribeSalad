00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:05.416
(air whooshes)
(digits beep)

00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:08.544
(bright piano music)

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.403
- We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.620
Bipedal,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.910
naked,

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:15.923
large-brained,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.713
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves,

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.903
aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.863
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.243
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.450
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.020
We shape the future

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.693
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.160
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.210
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.703
and how we got here,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.960
an exploration made possible

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.737
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.700
(dramatic synth music)

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.847
(bright techno music)

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:40.680
Thank you, everyone, for coming,

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.220
and I'll just take a moment to tell you

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.780
a little bit about how we decided

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.950
to make a CARTA meeting
entirely on human imagination.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.490
And this is one of those things

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.570
that it seems to only
happens only in San Diego,

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.770
where two people, and
I'm talking about myself,

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.920
who I'm a professor in pediatrics

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.790
and cellular and molecular medicine,

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.860
turns out to be in a meeting

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.470
sitting together with Sheldon Brown,

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.300
who's gonna hear as our first speaker.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.910
And Sheldon Brown comes from visual art.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.830
So, a scientist and an
artist, we start talking,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.940
and we realize we have
something in common.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.430
We are both fascinated
by human imagination.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.230
So, I make a challenge to Sheldon and say,

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.970
well, can we put this
in a scientific context?

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.880
And we started planning
about a meeting like that,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.130
and we realized that most of the time

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.250
when we try to understand something,

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.730
if it's unique or enhanced in humans,

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.680
we turn on to compare
to our closest relative,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.050
living relatives, such as the chimpanzee.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.940
And comparing to other
animals is difficult,

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.260
especially if you're talking about

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.140
cognition and imagination.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.170
So, this time I think you're gonna hear

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.850
lots of speakers talking about
imagination in modern humans

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.323
and also extinct in humans
such as the Neanderthals.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.240
And we hope that the
combination of those speakers,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.740
all this knowledge, will
help us to understand

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.600
a little bit about ourselves

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.120
and answer those questions
that Ajit posed to us.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.293
- Good afternoon.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.423
Imagination makes huge
demands on the brain.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.090
And when we use imagination,

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.610
there's neural connectivity that occurs

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.873
between many areas of the brain.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.570
But not all brains are equal,

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.640
so people who have high creativity brains

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.113
have different networks
from those who don't.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.820
This means that the study of imagination

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.113
and the study of brains
is not a linear thing.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.210
Face recognition in objects

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.490
requires a certain
proportion of brain power

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.970
that we call the face recognition area.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.680
And when people are thinking about faces,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.290
this is what is activated.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.270
Now, archeologists, and
I'm an archeologist,

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.600
can't access brains.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.600
All we can do is to have a look
at items of material culture

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.933
as proxies for imagination
in the deep past.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.213
But how far back can we go?

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.300
And it's perhaps important or
relevant in a group like this

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.182
to say, "Once upon a time."

00:04:34.182 --> 00:04:37.200
(audience laughs)

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.863
Three million years ago,
Makapan in South Africa.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.290
This little jaspilite pebble was found.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.030
And the question, of course,
is did Australopithecus

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.093
have a face recognition part of the brain?

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.200
And about 300,000 years ago,

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.570
this flint hand ax with
a shell in its center

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.673
was found in the UK.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.190
And here the question is,

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.570
was the fossil shell
perhaps more important

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.443
than the tool itself?

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.973
Did it spark imagination?

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.590
And about 300,000 in Israel

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.243
at Berekhat Ram,

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.970
this little object that some people think

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.340
was a figurine was found,

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.500
and the use-wear traces
on it were analyzed

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.263
by Francesco d'Errico and April Nowell,

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.040
and they discovered that it had, in fact,

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.120
been purposely modified.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.703
It had been ground,

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.993
and there were some nick
marks around the neck.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.030
What they also found, however,

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.030
was that red powder tends to
come off when this is ground.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.890
So, maybe it wasn't a symbolic artifact,

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.030
even though it had been
purposefully modified.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.460
Now, the important point about all three

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.250
of these objects that I've shown you

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.350
is that they represent outliers,

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.850
not regular, patterned behavior.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.370
And if we're thinking about
imagination and symbolism,

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.563
we need to know that
this is shared behavior.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.083
So, all of these objects
could be accidental,

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.760
though of course, they
give us a very nice clue

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.023
as to how early imagination
may have arisen.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.180
Proxies for imagination
appear very regularly

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.220
in the last 100,000 years,

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.190
so there's no problem about
recognizing them then.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.893
And they tend to multiply
exponentially after that.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.160
So, the first ones I'm going to show you

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.123
are from Diepkloof in South Africa.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:12.010
The oldest of these engraved
eggshells is 100,000 years old.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.850
And they were found up 'til
about 60,000 years ago.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.690
We know that they're water bottles

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:25.220
because some of the openings
done on the bottom right there

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.660
have the ground openings
just like the ones

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.090
in the Kalahari today,

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:36.650
where you see a woman pouring
water into this water bottle.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.520
You can see that her water bottle

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.410
is a little decorated there, too,

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.430
whereas the older ones, in fact,

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:48.430
have much greater variety
of decoration on them,

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.313
and perhaps engaged more imagination.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.300
Refitting suggests that
the Diepkloof water bottles

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.180
were highly decorated.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.183
You can see that the patterning
was all over then there.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.010
What I think is really important

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:13.110
is that the engraved eggshell
occurs at many sites.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.760
So, we see it here at Klipdrift

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.780
and at sites up in Namibia.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.920
There you see a pathway
up towards the west

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.340
that has engraved eggshell,

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.660
whereas the perforated marine shells

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.890
that I'm about to show you have a pathway

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:36.160
that goes up the eastern
part of Southern Africa.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.580
They don't only occur

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.300
in the eastern part of Southern Africa.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.080
They go right the way up to North Africa,

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.400
and into Israel, as well.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.430
So, let's have a look at those.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:51.890
These perforated machine
shells that are probably beads

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.850
are 72,000 years old,

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.223
and yet the ones further
north are even older.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.130
Some experimental work by Marian Vanhaeren

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.640
has suggested that people imaginatively

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.793
strung these together in different ways.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.150
The oldest ones at the top

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.223
were strung together in
little pairs like that.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.853
The ones in the middle
were strung back to back.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.970
And then the younger beads

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.483
were strung in even a different way.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.303
Again, using imagination.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.330
I think it's important that shell beads

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:40.320
are also found at Sibudu and
Klasies River in South Africa.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.973
So, once again we have an
established behavioral pattern.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:48.890
The Sibudu ones are 72,000 years old.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.773
The Klasies are similar age.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.400
But there's much other technology

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.350
that occurs in the last 100,000 years

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:04.560
that demonstrates the imagination
of people at the time.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.660
You've already seen the
Blombos engraved piece of ocher

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.920
that is 72,000 years old.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.770
There's other engraved
ocher from Blombos, too.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.810
So, once again we see a pattern there.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.820
There's engraved ocher at Klasies River

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.423
and at several other South African sites.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.853
At 100,000 years ago at Blombos,

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.620
paint was manufactured
in an abalone shell.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:37.020
And this was red ocher mixed
with a number of ingredients,

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.260
including an unknown liquid.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.803
We don't know what the paint was used for,

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:48.380
but we do know that it was
a compound, complex mixture.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.803
At Sibudu, there's also paint.

00:10:55.176 --> 00:10:57.680
It was found on this flake here,

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.290
and this paint was made out
of ground red ocher powder

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:06.320
mixed with casein, casein
being a milk product.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.690
Was this perhaps the first tempera paint

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.280
that was ever used in the world?

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.833
I think it may have been.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.150
At Sibudu, there are also
many imaginative adhesives

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:22.420
made out of things like
red ocher and resin,

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:26.400
or red ocher mixed with graphite,

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.240
mixed with other products, sometimes fat.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.963
A whole variety of adhesive recipes.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:40.550
Also at Sibudu, this
time at 77,000 years ago,

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:44.310
people imagined how they
could get rid of insects

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:48.010
that buzzed around their
bedding annoyingly at night.

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:51.300
And so they placed aromatic leaves,

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.660
in this case Cryptocarya,

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.523
on top of the sedge bedding.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.880
And these aromatic leaves
are slightly poisonous

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.383
and probably kept the mosquitoes away.

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:11.050
Burial, something that has
only briefly been mentioned

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:16.013
up until now, allows our
imagination in a different way.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.000
Because when we see burial,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.740
we know people were imagining ancestors.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.650
They were thinking about the after-people,

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.713
as well was the after-life.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.120
The earliest burial that
we know about so far

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.623
comes from Israel at Skhul and Qafzeh.

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.460
And here the burials,

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.620
which are repeated as
many as 10 at a time,

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.840
have been buried with shell beads,

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:52.840
perforated marine shell, and
red ocher as grave goods.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.250
Then at Border Cave in
the Lebombo Mountains

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:01.950
of South Africa at 74,000 years ago,

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:05.020
an infant was buried with this Conus shell

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:09.250
that had been perforated,
perhaps as a pendant.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.200
The little sketches over on the left

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.373
were from the excavation in the 1940s.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.490
Through time, burials
became much more complex,

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:25.970
and here in Russia at 34,000 years ago,

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:30.400
we see one of the most beautiful burials

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.130
that has come to light so far.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:34.810
It's a young man on the left,

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.180
that's the archeological example,

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:41.170
covered with 3,000 mammoth ivory beads

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:46.170
with fox canines and
bangles made of ivory.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.150
And the reconstruction on the right

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.870
suggests that these decorative items

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.340
may have been stitched onto the clothing

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:55.683
that he was buried in.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.690
But when we think of imagination,

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:03.563
we can hardly separate it from fantasy.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:08.880
And probably the earliest
secure archeological evidence

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.880
for fantasy is the Lion-Man
from Germany, 32,000 years ago.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.070
This is an ivory figurine,

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:23.233
the figurine of a human
figure with a lion head.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:26.530
This kind of therianthrope,

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:30.980
because the mixture of
animal and human features

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.453
defines a therianthrope,

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:38.730
it's a manifestation
of an abstract concept,

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:43.170
but it really is the first
evidence that we have

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.720
of true fantasy.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.130
It's not the only one, though,

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:53.130
and at Apollo 11 in
Namibia, 27,000 years ago,

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:57.140
the motif of a feline is used again.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:01.970
Here on the painted slab you
see half-human, have feline.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.363
The head is a feline and
the back legs are human.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.390
And this slab was buried
in the little cave

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.993
that you see up on the top left there.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.180
Now, all the evidence that we have

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:22.610
for imagination and
highly-developed technology,

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.740
some of which I've shown you,

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:29.630
can be used to imply that
we had complex cognition

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.180
and modern brains

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:37.080
way before any of this
evidence that I've shown you,

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.310
right back to 300,000 years ago

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:43.740
when Homo sapiens first arrived

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.843
in the archeological evidence.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:53.570
But for once, let's turn this
idea on its head and say,

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:57.650
material culture itself is not passive.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:01.130
And so when people manipulate items,

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.910
when they work on material culture,

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:08.910
this is stimulating their
imagination and their cognition.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.450
And by doing, we develop
the brains even more.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.920
We develop imagination further.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:19.610
And it's this kind of thing that leads to

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:24.080
increased technological
development through time,

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.653
increased imagination,
increased creativity.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:30.633
And thus we can say

00:16:30.633 --> 00:16:34.420
that technology and
cognition and imagination

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.800
engage with each other reflectively

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.343
and reflexively.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.290
And the reflexivity that we see

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:49.060
between the technology and
the cognition and imagination

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.210
gave rise to what I've
demonstrated to you,

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:56.350
the exponential growth of material culture

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.513
by 100,000 years ago.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.640
So, all of the things I've shown you,

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.060
beads, paint, art, engraved ocher,

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:11.050
engraved ostrich eggshell,
adhesive recipes,

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.480
bow and arrow that I haven't mentioned,

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.540
new tool classes, and burial,

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:21.540
all of these appear very
rapidly by 100,000 years ago.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.760
We may have had the humble beginnings

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.773
of this earlier than that,

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:31.270
but certainly we get definitive evidence

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.423
by 100,000 years ago.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:35.375
Thank you.

00:17:35.375 --> 00:17:38.375
(audience applauds)

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:42.653
- Thank you very much.

00:17:42.653 --> 00:17:44.620
What I want to talk about

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.330
is the organization of human society

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.363
and the nature of human society.

00:17:50.989 --> 00:17:54.410
And I believe that if we think of it

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:57.520
in general evolutionary terms,

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.260
we see that the organization
of human society

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.870
is really quite different to that

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:05.900
of our nearest

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.760
primate cousins,

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.820
the chimpanzees.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:15.820
I think the results of
the difference are clear,

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.600
and there are two.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:24.600
One of them is that we are
able to build up societies

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.250
of far greater size than we find

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:32.340
in any other close primates,

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.740
in greater complexity.

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.200
And the second one

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.290
is that we think of
our social organization

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.840
as lasting far, far longer

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.368
than the life of the people

00:18:47.368 --> 00:18:51.173
who might be part of that society.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:57.110
I believe that both these
differences are due to the fact

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:02.323
that many aspects of human
society are imaginary,

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.910
and therefore I'm going to
start to look at imagination

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.520
in a certain amount of detail.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.000
The notion of imagination

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
is very often linked with
creativity, and quite rightly,

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.963
and it's often linked
with individual creation.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.550
That's not what I'll be talking about.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.140
I'll be talking about
something quite different,

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.923
which is shared imagination.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:35.710
How the same imaginary features

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.760
are shared within a group.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:43.760
And how that comes about
is due to a number of

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.150
factors,

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:46.200
but I think already,

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.770
if we remember the slide
we've seen about pretend play,

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:52.920
we can see that both,

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.250
there seem to be a general predispositions

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.070
in humans for pretend play,

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:02.430
but that pretend play gets slot in

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.680
with things which are instituted

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.000
within the culture and
the society of people

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.380
who are doing this pretend play.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.440
So, I think we have to
think of predispositions

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.400
enabling us to take on

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:26.263
historically created structures,

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:31.760
like schools, was obvious
in the last picture

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.780
in that series about

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.563
pretend playing.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.350
We have to think of this articulation

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:43.553
between the two kinds of things.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.093
As I was saying, how,

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:54.960
so what I'll be talking about
is not individual imagination,

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.940
though obviously it's involved,

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:58.823
but the sharing of imagination.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:05.252
And let me go back to
what I started off with,

00:21:05.252 --> 00:21:07.520
saying that there are many aspects

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:12.520
of human social organization
which have to be imaginary.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:18.430
First factor of this
which I want to talk about

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:23.430
is the notion of the groups
we often think we belong to.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.210
Let me start off with
the examples of clans,

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:33.210
which we find in various
forms in many human societies.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.500
Now, one of the interesting
things about clans

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.460
is that they're thought
about lasting in time

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:46.460
far longer than the
lifespan of individuals.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.910
That already means that
they have to be imaginary.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:54.580
Because obviously if they were
attached to the individuals,

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:59.393
they would sort of end or
have no great continuity.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.418
But this would also be true of nations

00:22:04.418 --> 00:22:09.260
for example, one can think
of Greeks as a nation

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.140
quite apart from their territory

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:15.730
having gone on for very,
very long periods in time.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.530
The Greeks continued.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:21.340
They passed on from one
another something called

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.580
vague Greek-ish-ness.
(audience laughs)

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.970
It's very difficult to
define what that might be,

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:28.803
and very interesting,

00:22:28.803 --> 00:22:31.190
it's very difficult even for the people

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:35.020
who think this is extremely
important to define it.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.000
So, again, we imagine,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.070
and I think we can use the word,

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:41.903
that there is

00:22:43.908 --> 00:22:46.060
a level at which

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.400
social continues

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.900
on quite a different timescale

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:58.500
than our biological life.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:02.550
That doesn't mean, and
there is another factor

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:05.990
which is even more important.

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:09.170
We continually think of

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:11.760
as a very important part of our society,

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.743
is that we have instituted roles.

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:19.530
Husband-wife, to use an
example which was used

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:21.500
by the philosopher Searle,

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.090
but policeman

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.560
and so on.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.543
Now, there's something
rather odd about these roles,

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:31.663
because

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:36.230
they can't,

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:38.490
they don't seem to have very little to do

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:41.163
with what people actually get up to.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.547
People may hate each other,

00:23:44.547 --> 00:23:47.340
husbands and wives may hate each other,

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:50.540
but we think there's something about them

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:55.540
being husband and wife
independently of this.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:01.980
So, we think of our society
as systems of roles,

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.670
and large numbers of roles.

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:09.220
We realize we have to
think on another level,

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.983
on an imaginary level,

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:15.800
other than the interactions,

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:20.120
which has been the greatest
focus in psychology

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.600
when people are thinking of the social.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:27.600
We have to think of how it is
possible that these systems,

00:24:27.679 --> 00:24:32.470
there are shared systems
of the social which

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.140
don't correspond to anything empirical.

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.210
I should have mentioned when
I was talking about clans

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:43.850
is that people can imagine
themselves belonging to clans

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:47.620
without anything obvious marking them out

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.900
from people that belong to other clans.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.070
That they usually do not live together,

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:53.590
that they're dispersed.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:58.590
Yet somehow there is a
level, an imaginary level,

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.453
which people can think
of themselves as one.

00:25:04.145 --> 00:25:07.123
So, this really presents,

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.290
this is something which we do not find

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:13.890
in any other primates.

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.480
This is why I would argue that there is,

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:21.370
that we should stop
thinking of human society

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:26.070
as a sort of incremental business

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:30.170
of getting better and better
at knowing other people

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:32.380
and knowing the world.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.400
There is also a discontinuity,

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.640
which means that, which I would identify

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:42.223
with the presence of that imagination.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:48.010
Having said that, however,
this presents a problem

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:52.580
how what I started off with talking about,

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.240
which is I was saying there's something

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.780
very different about human societies,

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.320
is they seem to able to be expanded

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.320
to extraordinarily large size

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:06.130
in a way that doesn't
apply to other primates.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:11.130
And there's also this idea
of them continuing in time.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.410
Of course, this is not a problem

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:19.410
if by society we mean these
imaginary representations

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.380
that I was talking about.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:26.380
They can be as large
as you like and indeed,

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:30.973
here are systems which are not
tied to particular moments.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:34.790
But I was talking about practical results.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:39.790
How can this imaginary level
have practical results,

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.770
which are tremendously important

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:47.453
if we're going to understand
the evolution of human society?

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.350
I think the answer comes from the fact

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:55.440
that this imaginary
level is not as imaginary

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.160
as it might seem at first.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.000
There are what I have called emergences,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.250
that is, moments when

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:09.810
the shared imagination
is actually acted out,

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:14.810
where people can live in
the shared imagination

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:19.520
as well as they live in the
practical, interactional world

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:24.540
which is normal, sort of everyday level.

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:26.680
These very large early rituals

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:31.680
which involve people
losing many of the aspects

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.960
of themselves as individuals,

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.110
and what characterizes a ritual

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:39.250
is that they are repetitions of previous.

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:42.820
People say the same things
other people have said.

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:45.440
They therefore lose their intentionality.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:49.420
They become kind of elements
in an abstract structure,

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:50.927
but it is acted out.

00:27:50.927 --> 00:27:52.633
And at other moments,

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:54.563
so,

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:59.670
in normal life, or in
normal, traditional life,

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:04.220
people step in and out
of the imaginary level

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.310
to an interactional level,

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:11.800
and they're able to hold
two quite different ways

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.800
of thinking about society.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:19.800
This is what not found in other primates.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:24.220
And this has practical results.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.460
For example, if you imagine yourself

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:29.810
living in a Neolithic village,

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:34.060
and you want to move to another village,

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.520
you have to move to this imaginary level

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:42.520
in order to be able to build
up kinship relationships

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:46.660
with other people in that other village,

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:50.160
convince them that somehow
there is something in common,

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.970
and that is moving to another level,

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:53.460
to that imaginary level,

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.420
and then you can move
to that sort of place.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:01.400
This, I think, explains
how pre-state humans

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:05.080
managed to have very far-reaching

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:08.570
and distant trading relationships.

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:12.303
And also to the other practical level,

00:29:13.333 --> 00:29:14.760
to the other practical factor,

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:19.100
which is imagining that
your society lasts in time.

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.510
That somehow, we can imagine
that we have a social

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:23.810
which lasts in time

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:27.360
quite independently of
our biological life.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.963
It means that there is some point in,

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:36.380
first of all, in passing on and
accumulating either objects,

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:42.461
because we are passing them on
to people who we don't know,

00:29:42.461 --> 00:29:47.461
who are our continuation,
but only in imagination,

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:51.320
and perhaps passing on knowledge,

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.870
which then becomes the basis of what

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:59.960
the evolutionary biologist
Michael Thomas Seller

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.040
has called the ratchet effect.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.920
That is, building up on

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:09.220
knowledge which is already there,

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:14.220
so it can then be used for
ever more complex systems.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:18.570
This is basically the
ability in human culture

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:19.713
to continue,

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:25.670
and to accumulate, and to advance.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:30.050
So, the possibility of
stepping in to moments

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:31.990
of what is normally shared imagination

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:37.670
explains, I think, the most
fundamental differences

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:41.000
between our society and

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.860
the society of, let us say, chimpanzees.

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:47.510
Thank you.
(audience applauds)

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:51.010
- I like to start with kind of
very self-flattering question

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.040
of how do we get so smart?

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:56.550
How are we humans able to think about

00:30:56.550 --> 00:31:00.050
all of the complex and
sophisticated things we think about?

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:01.930
How do we invent them?

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:03.530
And specifically there's a puzzle,

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:06.360
because ultimately we're
physical creatures,

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.520
and we get only physical
information from the world, right?

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.470
So, we get photons in our eyes.

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:15.061
We get pressure waves in our ears.

00:31:15.061 --> 00:31:18.500
We're subject to gravity
and we bend our toes

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:22.550
and flex our knees to try to
defy gravity and stay upright.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:26.070
And we can push on things and
exert pressure in the world.

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:29.570
And that somehow, through this
soup of physical interaction,

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:32.450
we end up with really fancy ideas,

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:34.450
like we think about goals

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:36.870
and principles and truth and justice,

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:40.813
and we invent ideas like time
travel and imaginary numbers.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.480
How do we do that?

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.190
How does that set of physical interactions

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:47.720
and brains that are evolved

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.190
for these basic physical interactions,

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:53.040
how do they create this

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.550
wonderful, abstract world of ideas?

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:58.750
And these abstract ideas are the things

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:01.360
that actually make
being human so much fun.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.193
Right?

00:32:02.193 --> 00:32:04.130
So, if you go the a dinner party,

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:06.240
and the only things you talk about

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.340
are physical, concrete things,

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:12.036
like all you can say is,
"Boy, this podium is wooden."

00:32:12.036 --> 00:32:13.127
(knuckles rap)
(audience laughs)

00:32:13.127 --> 00:32:14.347
"And solid."

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:16.700
You're not gonna get invited back

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:17.867
to that dinner party, right?

00:32:17.867 --> 00:32:18.700
(audience laughs)

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.590
The things that we talk about,

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:22.940
the things we obsess about all day long

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.710
are these abstract things.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:26.550
How do our minds create these?

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:27.560
Now, this is a problem

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.780
that has vexed scholars for centuries.

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.110
Plato thought about it,

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.530
so he thought about how
you would teach someone

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:36.930
an abstract idea like virtue,

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:39.938
and he ends up concluding
that it's impossible.

00:32:39.938 --> 00:32:41.490
We can't learn these things,

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:42.860
so we must recollect them

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.963
from past incarnations from our souls.

00:32:46.449 --> 00:32:48.860
Darwin also actually ran into this.

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.240
So, Alfred Wallace, the co-originator

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.520
of the theory of evolution with Darwin,

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.590
gave up on the theory of evolution

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:58.360
because he got so vexed by this idea

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:02.620
of how brains that evolved
for physical interaction,

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:05.430
how natural selection
could have created brains

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:08.420
that then invent symphonies or play chess

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:11.150
or do any of the kinds of
complex things that we do.

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:14.240
And Darwin tried to
intervene, writing to Wallace,

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.930
I hope you've not murdered too completely

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:17.220
your own and my child.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.080
Don't throw the baby
out with the bath water.

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.853
We can save this evolution thing.

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:26.590
So, how do we actually
create these abstract ideas?

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:28.577
I'm gonna give you one specific example,

00:33:28.577 --> 00:33:31.180
and that is how we think about time.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:33.380
Now, I do a lot of work on time.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.630
I'm not the only obsessed with time.

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:38.630
The word time is actually the
most frequent noun in English.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:40.900
And that's kind of interesting,

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.360
because of course, we can't see time.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.480
We can't touch time, we can't smell time,

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.650
we can't taste time.

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:47.920
It's abstract.

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.460
But at the same time,

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:53.640
it creates the very basis
of our experience, right?

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.940
You can't experience
anything outside of time.

00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:01.670
So, how do we conceptualize
this abstract entity?

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:04.850
And I'll take it one step further and ask,

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:06.730
how do we think of
something like time travel?

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:08.030
How do we invent that idea?

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:10.650
Of course, it's not
truth physical experience

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:12.190
of your own with time travel.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:13.810
It's not because you actually traveled

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:15.150
to some other time and came back

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:17.750
and now you can recollect that idea.

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:20.110
So, here's a story of how we might come up

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:21.653
with an idea like time travel.

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:25.930
In lots of languages, we talk about time

00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:27.680
using spacial metaphors.

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:28.970
So, we'll say things like,

00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:30.590
we're approaching the holidays,

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:33.290
or we're coming up on Christmas.

00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:35.560
We're coming up on the deadline.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:38.860
Well, if we're coming up on the holidays,

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:41.160
time is a path on which I'm traveling.

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.260
I'm traveling from the past to the future.

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.950
Well, once you have that
analogy in place, that metaphor,

00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:49.350
if time is a path that you can travel,

00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:51.940
well, a path you can travel
in whatever direction you want

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.540
at whatever speed you want.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:57.020
So, once you set that
analogy, you can now extend it

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:59.630
and think about something that
goes beyond what's possible

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:00.700
in your physical experience.

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.930
You've invented the idea of time travel

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:05.600
just by extending this little analogy.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.750
So, there are a couple of
ingredients to that story.

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:08.980
On is,

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:10.600
you have to be able to make an analogy

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:14.060
between physical experience
and something more abstract.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.730
But also, something has to encourage you

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:17.160
and invite you to make that analogy.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.100
Something has to say,

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.350
well, why don't you think
about moving in time

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:21.390
like moving in space,

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:23.437
and then you can go beyond that, right?

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:26.730
How do we know that any part of the story

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:28.010
that I just told you is true?

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:31.015
That people actually do
these kinds of extensions?

00:35:31.015 --> 00:35:33.163
Let me give you a couple of examples.

00:35:34.357 --> 00:35:38.420
In English, we actually have
two kind of opposing ways

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:39.950
of talking about time.

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:42.110
One talks about ourselves

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:43.970
as moving from the past to the future.

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:46.010
We call this the ego-moving metaphor,

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:49.590
and we say things like, "We're
approaching the deadline."

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:51.860
The other one goes in
the opposite direction.

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:54.600
We're stationary, and
time is moving past us

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.300
like a train or a river.

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.370
We call this the time-moving metaphor.

00:35:58.370 --> 00:35:59.387
So, you might say something like,

00:35:59.387 --> 00:36:01.710
"The deadline is approaching."

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:04.950
Now, in a strict physical sense,

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:06.520
if I'm approaching the deadline

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.520
or the deadline is approaching me,

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.130
those are the same, right?

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:14.200
If time is really a uni-directional,
one-dimensional entity,

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.540
it doesn't actually matter
which one of us is moving.

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:18.840
But in space, it matters.

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:22.010
So, if I'm moving towards you
or you're moving towards me,

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:23.080
those two things are different

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.260
because there's a fixed ground
against which we're moving,

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.770
so we can actually tell the difference,

00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:28.070
of which one is happening.

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:31.690
How do we know if people
really think about

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:33.010
I'm approaching the deadline

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:35.510
as being different from,
the deadline is approaching?

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:39.010
To people really take these
spacial metaphors seriously?

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:40.643
Well, here's one hint.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.127
Suppose I ask you, "Next
Wednesday's meeting

00:36:44.127 --> 00:36:46.867
"has been moved forward two days.

00:36:46.867 --> 00:36:49.492
"What day is the meeting now
that it's been rescheduled?"

00:36:49.492 --> 00:36:50.670
(audience murmurs)

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:51.763
Who thinks Monday?

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:54.870
Who thinks Friday?

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:57.156
Okay, that's about normal.

00:36:57.156 --> 00:37:00.390
So, if you're thinking of
time moving towards you,

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.160
than moving the meeting forward

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.320
is moving the meeting in the
direction of motion of time,

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.870
from Wednesday to Monday.

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:09.540
But if you think of yourself
as moving through time,

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.120
than moving the meeting forward

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:14.060
is moving the meeting in
your direction of motion,

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.080
from Wednesday to Friday, right?

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.970
And we can actually get people to imagine

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:20.520
motion in space.

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.557
So, for example, you'd say,

00:37:21.557 --> 00:37:23.710
"Imagine how you would
maneuver the chair to the X."

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:25.890
And you either have to imagine yourself

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:27.690
scooting in a chair somewhere,

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:30.910
or you imagine pulling a
rope to bring a chair to you.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:32.897
So, in one case you're
imagining yourself moving,

00:37:32.897 --> 00:37:35.280
and the other case something
is coming towards you.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.770
And after people have
imagined one or the other,

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:41.010
we slip in this seemingly
unrelated question about time.

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:42.237
We say, "Next Wednesday's meeting

00:37:42.237 --> 00:37:43.367
"has been moved forward two days.

00:37:43.367 --> 00:37:44.950
"What day is the meeting?"

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:47.580
And we find that people who
have been imagining themselves

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.470
moving forward through space

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:51.590
will say the meeting is now on Friday.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:54.680
People who have been imagining
something coming towards them

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.770
will say the meeting is now on Monday.

00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:59.670
Of course, they don't know
that they're being influenced

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:02.110
by this imagination
exercise that we gave them,

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:04.770
but what it's telling us is
people are actively using

00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:07.360
the spacial image that they created

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.360
to think about time, right?

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.670
That actually these two scenarios in time

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:13.670
are psychologically different from them.

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:16.880
Now, the other thing about
how we think about time

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:20.290
is that it differs from
culture to culture.

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:22.290
So, humans haven't invented

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:23.610
just one way of thinking about time

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:25.870
but we invented many, many different ways.

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:28.480
Let me give you just a few examples.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.900
So, in English, of course,

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.230
we read and write from left to right,

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:36.190
and it's natural to then
organize all kinds of things

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.023
from left to right.

00:38:37.023 --> 00:38:38.730
So here, I'm showing you pictures

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:40.530
of my grandfather at different ages,

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:43.130
and if I gave you this set
of cards, shuffled them,

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:45.790
and said, "Please lay them
out in the correct order,"

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:47.840
chances are you would lay
them out exactly like this,

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:48.720
from left to right.

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:51.010
We consider this to be the correct order,

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:52.830
the correct arrangement.

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:55.640
But people who read and
write from right to left,

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.370
for example, people who
read Arabic or Hebrew,

00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:00.980
will organize these
cards from right to left.

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.380
So, for them, the direction of time

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:05.030
goes the opposite direction.

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:07.750
And just to give you
an intuition for this,

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:11.530
here's a logo for a nutritional
supplement for kids,

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:13.550
and you can read this logo very easily

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:16.530
and you can see what
it does for your child.

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:18.890
When they tried using this
in Arabic speaking countries,

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:20.829
they ran into some problems.

00:39:20.829 --> 00:39:21.890
(audience laughs)

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:24.640
Because if you read the
logo from right to left

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.020
it becomes quite problematic

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:27.981
and confusing what it does for you child.

00:39:27.981 --> 00:39:30.960
(audience laughs)

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.890
Now, so far I've given you examples

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:35.300
of how time can travel
with respect to the body,

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:37.890
either left to right or right to left.

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:41.750
But it can also travel not with
respect to the body at all.

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:42.983
So, here's an example.

00:39:44.037 --> 00:39:46.650
This is an aboriginal
community in Australia

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:47.790
that I had a chance to work with.

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:49.740
They live on the edge of Cape York.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.200
They are the Kuuk Thaayorre people.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.760
And what's interesting about
languages like Kuuk Thaayorre

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.540
is they don't use words
like left and right.

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:58.940
Instead, they primarily rely on words

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:00.710
like north, south, east, and west.

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:02.153
Cardinal direction terms.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.270
And when I say they primarily rely

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:06.500
on cardinal direction terms,

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.530
I really mean that at all scales.

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.800
So, even for body parts, you would say,

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.990
there's an ant on your southwest leg,

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:16.550
or move your cup to the
north-northeast a little bit.

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:17.640
Things like that.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.350
Even the way you say
hello in Kuuk Thaayorre

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:22.020
is to say, which way are you heading?

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.140
And the answer should be something like,

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:25.910
north-northwest in the far distance.

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:26.743
How about you?

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:30.230
So, imagine as you walk around your day,

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:31.750
everyone you greet,

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:33.653
you have to report your heading direction.

00:40:33.653 --> 00:40:34.490
(audience chuckles)

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:36.700
That would get you oriented
really quickly, right,

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.530
because literally you
could not get past hello

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:42.240
without knowing which way is which.

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.280
And let's just establish that
we don't think like this.

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.180
Everyone close your eyes for a second,

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:49.383
and I can see you,

00:40:49.383 --> 00:40:51.830
so I can tell whether or
not you've closed your eyes.

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:52.853
Point southeast.

00:40:54.373 --> 00:40:59.373
(audience murmurs)
(audience members laugh)

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:03.770
All right, you can open your eyes.

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:06.289
I see points in every possible direction.

00:41:06.289 --> 00:41:07.790
(audience laughs)

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:09.676
At least some of you are right.

00:41:09.676 --> 00:41:11.226
(audience laughs)
That's good.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.280
So, people who speak
languages like Kuuk Thaayorre

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.500
actually stay oriented really well.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.400
They can point southeast
without hesitation.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.043
Even young children can do that.

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:25.710
But I also wondered, how
do they think about time?

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:28.180
So, if they don't think
about left and right

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:29.610
with respect to space,

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:30.710
how do they lay out time?

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:32.740
So remember, if I give you this task,

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.900
I give you a bunch of cards to lay out,

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.300
what would they do?

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.560
So here's an example.

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.140
This is one participant.

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:41.670
They're sitting facing south,

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:44.500
and this is a bunch of different
card sets they've laid out,

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:47.643
and what they've done is go
from left to right in each case.

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:50.250
Here's another participant,

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:52.540
I'm sorry, this is the same
participant on a different day

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:53.850
sitting facing north.

00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:57.213
And they've laid everything
out now from right to left.

00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:01.100
Here's a different person
sitting facing east,

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:04.640
and they've laid everything
out coming towards the body.

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.370
What's the pattern?

00:42:06.370 --> 00:42:08.650
It's the sun, from east to west, right?

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:12.070
So, for them, time is
locked on the landscape.

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:13.950
It doesn't stay locked on the body.

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:16.010
So, for me as an English speaker,

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:18.210
if I'm facing this way,
then time goes this way.

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:20.420
If I'm facing this way,
then time goes this way.

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.910
And if I'm facing this way,
then time goes this way.

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:26.340
Very egocentric of me to
make the dimension of time

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.970
chase me around every time I turn my body.

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:30.330
Instead for the Kuuk Thaayorre,

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:31.890
time always goes in the same direction

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:33.110
with respect to the landscape,

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:35.810
regardless of which way
their body is facing.

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:37.940
And this isn't the only
way that time can flow

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:39.160
according to the landscape.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:43.090
So, for example, work by
Rafael Nunez here at UCSD

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:45.540
shows that time doesn't even
to go in a straight line.

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:48.060
So, for example, for the
Yoog-no of Papua New Guinea,

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:50.800
time flows into the village at one angle,

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.010
and once it hits the village,

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:54.120
it takes a turn and flows
out at a different angle,

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.620
and this has to do with the mouth

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:56.860
and the source of the Yuba River,

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:59.480
which are important
geographical locations.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:03.180
So, people around the world
have imagined all kinds of ways

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.860
to organize this very
basic dimension, right?

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.200
Whether it goes left to
right, right to left,

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.370
there are vertical organizations,

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:11.990
organizations that go on the landscape

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:14.290
in all kinds of different ways.

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:16.010
There's a really rich variety

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:18.160
that humans have invented
around the world.

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:22.300
Now, you could ask how deeply rooted

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.420
is this imagined time
in our idea of space?

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:29.560
So, if you were to disable
the part of the brain

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:32.080
that processes the
particular part of space,

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:35.400
would that also disrupt
our ability to imagine

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.050
that part of time?

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:39.530
And we actually had a
chance to test this idea

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:41.640
by looking at patients
who've suffered strokes

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.120
in their right parietal lobe.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.290
So, here I'm showing you the
brain of Federico Fellini

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:48.120
after he suffered a stroke
in his right parietal lobe,

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.840
and this kind of stroke
often results in neglect

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.100
on the opposite side of the stroke.

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.920
If you have left neglect in everyday life,

00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:00.800
you might not notice food on
the left side of your plate.

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.850
You might only eat the food on
the right side of your plate

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:04.360
even though you're still hungry.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.990
You might only put makeup
on one side of your face

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:08.820
or shave one side of your face.

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:11.900
You might only read words
on one side of the page.

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:13.580
People with neglect

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:16.040
seem to not notice, not pay attention to,

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.670
things on the left side of space for them.

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:21.000
This member of KISS doesn't
have neglect as far as I know,

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.360
but this is how he would
do his make-up if he did.

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.760
(audience laughs)

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:28.760
So, we wondered how would patients

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:31.920
who neglect the left side
of space think about time?

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.552
So, we told patients about

00:44:35.552 --> 00:44:37.610
a guy, David, a fictional guy, David,

00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:39.487
who likes doing some things 10 years ago

00:44:39.487 --> 00:44:42.620
and likes doing different
things 10 years from now.

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:44.480
So, 10 years ago he liked strawberries,

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.530
but 10 years from now,
he'll like cherries.

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:48.660
And they just had to remember these facts.

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:50.860
And we had a couple of control groups.

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:52.270
We had healthy controls,

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:54.140
and also patients who'd had a stroke

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:56.230
but didn't show signs of neglect.

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:59.180
So, let me show you data from
the two control groups first.

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:03.060
So, solid bars here show you the items

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:04.020
that people got right,

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.420
and everything to the right of the center

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:07.710
is things to do with the future.

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:09.070
Everything to the left of the center

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:10.830
is things to do with the past.

00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:13.850
The shaded areas are where
people made mistakes.

00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:16.610
Now, of course both
groups made some mistakes,

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:18.150
but the mistakes are symmetrical

00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:20.540
around the past and the future.

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:23.770
Here's what the neglect
patients look like.

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:26.970
They were heavily shifted to the right.

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:28.850
They weren't able to recognize correctly

00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:30.460
things that had to do with the past,

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:33.364
with the left side of the mental timeline,

00:45:33.364 --> 00:45:35.410
and instead, they misattributed

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:39.560
a whole lot of things to the right.

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:42.240
So, when you damage to part of the brain

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.460
that's responsible for representing
the left side of space,

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:48.120
you also damage the imagined left,

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:52.403
the time that you imagine on
the left side of your body.

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:56.010
Now, I've been giving a lot of examples

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.380
about how we imagine time as space

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.240
and how metaphors and cultural artifacts

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.030
like reading and writing

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:06.780
invite us to make different
kinds of analogies,

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:09.430
but of course these ideas go far beyond

00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:10.440
how we think about time,

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:14.580
because metaphor is ubiquitous
in our experience, right?

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:18.340
Just about anything that's
complex or interesting

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:21.374
is at least partially imagined,

00:46:21.374 --> 00:46:25.440
and the way we talk about these
complex, interesting things

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.180
is suffused with metaphor.

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:30.200
So, if you're talking about
a relationship problem,

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:34.060
you might say, "We're
spinning our wheels,"

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:36.240
or, "Our relationship is off track."

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.727
If we're talking about the
economy, you might say,

00:46:38.727 --> 00:46:40.400
"We need to jump start the economy."

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.470
And the idea is a quick stimulus

00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:45.290
is what the economy
needs to get going again.

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:47.710
Or you might say that we
need to prop up the economy,

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:51.340
and then you're using a different
set of physical metaphors

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:53.940
to think about what needs to happen.

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.680
When we talk about theories or ideas,

00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:00.020
we talk about poking holes
or warming up to ideas.

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:02.650
With social issues, we
talk about immigrants

00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:04.360
as seeping into the country,

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.320
as if they're some kind
of nefarious substance,

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:11.240
or crime as preying or
infecting our neighborhoods.

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:14.610
And these metaphors have
psychological weight.

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:17.410
For example, in our lab we've looked at

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:20.170
how people want to approach
a crime problem in a city,

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:22.070
if you tell them that crime is a beast

00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:25.440
plaguing their city or
preying on their city,

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.520
as opposed to crime is a virus.

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.410
If you tell them crime is a beast,

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:32.220
they want to do the kinds of things

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:33.910
you would normally do to contain a beast,

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:36.760
so they want harsher enforcement measures.

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:38.540
If you tell them crime is a virus,

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:41.560
they want to take a more
epidemiological approach.

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.320
They want to diagnose the problem,

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:45.303
maybe inoculate the population,

00:47:45.303 --> 00:47:48.290
do things that are more reform-oriented.

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:50.840
So, these metaphors have
real psychological weight.

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:55.963
So, coming back to this question
of how do we get so smart?

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.020
My answer would be that our brains

00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:04.020
are masters at doing dynamic,
opportunistic bricolage.

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:07.180
They recycle and reuse machinery

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:11.140
that has evolved for simpler,
perceptual motor tasks.

00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:13.670
They cycle and reuse the
knowledge that we acquire

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:15.910
through physical experience.

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:19.690
But also, language is a
incredibly powerful tool

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:22.160
that invites us to conjure up those ideas

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:24.960
and recombine them all
kinds of novel ways,

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:28.950
because languages supplies us
with a large stock of units

00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:31.630
but an infinite ability to recombine them.

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:34.790
So, I can right now take a bunch of words,

00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:37.290
put them in a new configuration,

00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:38.490
and invite you to imagine

00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:40.040
something you've never imagined before.

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.740
So, I could say,

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:46.360
imagine a circle of
hedgehogs dancing the polka

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:49.360
on top of a crepe that
is traveling through time

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.630
from Paleolithic times to now

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:53.440
to puzzle us about how
they are able to make

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:56.125
such fine, thin pastry back then.

00:48:56.125 --> 00:48:57.553
(audience laughs)
Now,

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:01.940
if everything has gone relatively
well in your life so far,

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:04.138
you haven't had that
thought before, right?

00:49:04.138 --> 00:49:07.190
(audience laughs)
And so,

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:08.043
you're welcome.

00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:11.840
That is through the power of language.

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:13.990
We can conjure up all kinds of ideas,

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:16.250
an infinite set of new ideas

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:19.420
by recombining things from
our physical experience

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:22.620
and from other abstract ideas
we've built in the past.

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:23.972
Thank you very much.

00:49:23.972 --> 00:49:26.972
(audience applauds)

00:49:28.652 --> 00:49:32.319
(bright instrumental music)
