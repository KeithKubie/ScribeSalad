00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:06.846
PROFESSOR: So in
this recitation,

00:00:06.846 --> 00:00:09.345
we're going to look at step and
delta functions, integration

00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:11.350
and generalized derivatives.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.550
So the first part, you're
asked to compute the integral

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.320
from zero minus to infinity
delta(t) exponential t

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.730
squared dt.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.190
The second one is from zero
minus to infinity delta(t-2)

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.690
exponential of t
squared sine t cos 2t.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.030
The third one is zero plus to
infinity delta(t) exponential

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.170
of squared dt.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.550
So know that it's the same
as a, except that the bounds

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.320
of integration changed.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.310
The second part,
we're asked to define

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.530
the generalized derivatives
of these two functions,

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.280
where u here is just a step
function that you saw before.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.390
So it's 3u(t) minus 2u(t-1).

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.690
And the second one is t
squared for t is negative

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.295
and exponential of
minus t for t positive.

00:00:55.295 --> 00:00:57.920
So why don't you pause the video
and work through this example,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.890
and I'll be right back.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.930
Welcome back.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.570
So let's compute the first one.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:23.900
Zero minus, infinity, delta(t)
exponential t squared dt.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.770
So just to remind you,
the delta function

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.700
is everywhere zero
except at the value zero.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.130
And we represent
it with an arrow.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.170
And the integral of the delta
would be 1 from minus infinity

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.326
to plus infinity.

00:01:40.326 --> 00:01:42.200
In this integral, we're
integrating from zero

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.350
minus to infinity, which means
that the zero is included

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.390
in our interval from
zero minus to infinity.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.330
Therefore, this
integral is basically

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.786
assigning the value to this
function exponential t squared.

00:01:55.786 --> 00:01:57.160
And the value that
it's assigning

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.900
to it is the value
it would take at t

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.110
equals to zero where
the delta is non-zero.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.040
So really clearly, this is
just exponential of zero.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.120
And it gives us 1.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.860
For the second integral, it goes
from zero minus to infinity,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.970
delta t minus 2 exponential,
a more complicated function,

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.200
t square sine t cos 2t.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.350
So now, let's represent
this delta function here.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.050
So this is just our zero axis.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.890
And the delta here
is zero everywhere

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.690
except at 2 where we
would represent it, again,

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.750
with an arrow at 2 amplitude 1.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.630
So this delta is zero
everywhere except at 2

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.380
where it would assign
the value to the function

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.390
next to it at the
value t equals to 2.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.040
So really this
integration gives us

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.980
just the value of this
function at t equal 2,

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.600
so 4 sine 2 cos 4.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.530
And here, the key
was that again, this

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.130
interval of integration
from zero minus to infinity

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.590
and clearly it includes
the value at which delta

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.450
function is non-zero.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.710
So for the last one, we return
to our first integral except

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.570
that now we are changing
the bounds of integration

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.745
to zero plus to infinity.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.630
So now, if I do representation
of the delta function

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.760
that we're dealing with,
so delta centered at 1,

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.240
and the interval
of integration, we

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.310
have an open interval
now that does not

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.710
include the value at which
delta is non-equal to zero.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.430
So everywhere this
function would just

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.430
be assigned its value at--
it'd just be multiplied

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.930
by the function that is zero.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.130
And so basically, it's like
multiplying this function

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.540
by zero, and it
just gives us zero.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.510
It's like the delta fell off
of our interval of integration,

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.476
so we're just left
with a zero function.

00:04:06.476 --> 00:04:07.850
So let's move to
the second part.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.450
The second part asked us to
find a generalized derivative

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:26.680
to f of t equals 3u of
t minus 2u of t minus 1.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.450
So just to remind you
here of what u of t's are,

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.950
just want to sketch
a few things.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.280
So first, u of t is
just the step function

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.140
that would be zero
everywhere and would

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.270
take the value 1 for
t larger than zero.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.900
So this first part
here would just

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.070
be non-zero for t
larger than zero.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.770
Instead of being
assigned value 1,

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.830
it's just the assigned
value 3 because we're

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.830
multiplying the u of t by 3.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.810
So this first part
would look like this.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.410
The second part here would
be u shifted by minus 1,

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.630
which means that u is zero
everywhere for t less than 1.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.550
So we would have a
zero function here.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.470
So let me just do dots, but
it should be on the same axis.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.270
And 1 for t larger than 1.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.770
But here, we're multiplying
it by factor minus 2.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:29.690
So really, what we have
is another u function that

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.070
is shifted down to minus 2.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.520
So the sum of these
two contributions

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.670
is zero for t negative,
takes the value

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:49.680
3 for t between zero and 1, and
the value 1, 3 minus 2, for t

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.670
larger than 1.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.890
So clearly here, we have
discontinuities at t

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.980
equals to zero
and t equals to 1.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.320
So let's just write
down the derivative.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.180
The generalized derivative
here would lead us first

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.140
to compute the derivatives where
the function is continuous.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.910
So for minus infinity to
zero, it's a constant,

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.290
derivative would be zero.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.560
Between zero and
1, it's constant,

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.890
derivative would be zero.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.360
And from 1 to infinity, it
would also give us zero.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.980
So we would have a
zero contribution

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.390
from the continuous part of
the function, if you wish.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.060
But we still need to account
for the discontinuities.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.790
So at zero, we have a
jump from zero to 3.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.930
And that we learned
can be written down

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:35.950
as a delta function of
magnitude 3 centered at zero.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.410
After that, we
have another jump.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:38.790
Now, it's from 3 to 1.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.660
So it's a jump of minus 2
amplitude centered at 1.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.310
So here, we can also
do that with the delta,

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.950
but we just need also
to shift it by minus 1

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.110
to show clearly that
the jump occurs at 1

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:56.120
and multiply this by minus 2 to
show the amplitude of the jump

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.180
down.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:02.870
So if we were now to
represent this f prime,

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.650
basically, the
regular part is zero.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.460
So there's nothing to write down
except just a zero function.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.940
And these discontinuities
that I'm just

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.740
going to represent on the graph
would be the delta function

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:20.890
centered at zero magnitude 3
and delta function centered

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.950
around 1 of magnitude minus 2.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.200
And the rest would just
be the zero function.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.296
So that would be f prime.

00:07:32.296 --> 00:07:35.110
f of t.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:42.470
So for the second one
that we were given,

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.600
it's a function
f of t that takes

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:51.570
the value t squared for t
negative and exponential minus

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:56.880
t for t positive.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.880
So a quick sketch here
tells that this function

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:06.110
looks like this, an exponential
minus t for t positive taking

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.040
a value here 1.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.660
So clearly, there is a
jump here, discontinuity.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.420
So how do we go about computing
this generalized derivative?

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.210
So let's look again at
the continuous parts.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.400
So from minus infinity
to zero, we're

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.220
dealing with just the t squared.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.600
So the derivative is just 2t.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.570
For t between zero
and infinity, we're

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.820
just dealing with
exponential minus t.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:35.539
So that's minus
exponential minus t.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:37.760
But we need to account
for the discontinuity

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.870
the jump of
amplitude, 1 at zero.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.850
So as we saw before,
this can just

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:46.780
be modeled with
a delta function.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.860
And if we were to
represent this function,

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:56.210
then we would just need to add
the delta function of magnitude

00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:02.430
1 here and then just sketch
2t, for example, and then

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.490
minus exponential of minus 2t.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.460
That would give us
something like that.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.550
And that ends the
problem for today.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.320
And the key point here
were just to learn

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.020
how to manipulate
the step function

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.920
and how to use the
delta function when

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.210
you compute your integrals.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.970
And be careful with the
bounds of integration.
