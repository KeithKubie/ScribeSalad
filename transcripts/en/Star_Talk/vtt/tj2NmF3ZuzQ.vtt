00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.630
- So Chuck,

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:06.780
I brought you here today.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.793
- For lunch?

00:00:07.793 --> 00:00:08.626
(laughing)

00:00:08.626 --> 00:00:09.480
Clearly!

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.870
- You paying?

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.220
So, just to show the difference between

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.240
an average full moon,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.309
and what people are
calling the super moon.

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:18.430
- Super moon!

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.080
- This being New York City,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.020
pizza is the best sort of
circular object to reference.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.880
- Yes, and it kind of looks like a moon,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.713
a little bit.

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:27.320
- Yeah it's splotchy.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.580
So, I went up to the front, and I said,

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.850
we're in Famous Ray's Pizza,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:32.683
and I said,

00:00:32.683 --> 00:00:36.560
I'd please like a 15 inch
pizza, which is here,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.670
and a 16 inch pizza, which is here.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.740
- [Chuck] And then they went,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.600
who is this crazy dude?

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.460
- So, I said look,

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.293
I can do this,

00:00:44.293 --> 00:00:45.430
we got this, okay.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.660
So, point being,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.100
the average size of the
full moon on the sky

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.723
is to a 15 inch pizza,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.210
what the super moon is to a 16 inch pizza.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.160
- So, what you see normally, okay,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.280
- On average.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.720
- Because the moon is
closer and farther...

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.570
- The moon is sometimes
closer, sometimes farther.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.900
And that change in
difference, when it's closer,

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.383
it's a little bigger,
looks a little bigger,

00:01:09.383 --> 00:01:11.240
when it's farther it
looks a little smaller.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.040
It's an oval orbit around the Earth,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.080
it's not a perfect circle.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.030
If it was a perfect circle it would be

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.640
the same size all the time.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.470
It can be at any phase at
any of these distances.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.890
You can have a really big crescent,

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.900
or a big half moon.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.432
- Nobody cares about that.

00:01:25.432 --> 00:01:26.681
It's not a super half!

00:01:26.681 --> 00:01:28.280
- Or super crescent, right.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.940
You could say that, but no one is,

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.110
because we're somehow
fantasized about the full moon.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.380
So, I'm just trying to show you

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.800
the difference between the two.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.633
- Right.

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:39.550
- I want to take the 15 inch pizza.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.240
- After we've measured it.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.820
What are you doing?

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.653
Oh my God!

00:01:43.653 --> 00:01:44.486
- Just, excuse me.

00:01:45.663 --> 00:01:46.900
This is for science!

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.030
- Oh, God, okay.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.920
- It is for science.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.140
- Alright, this is for science.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.860
Oh Lord Jesus, he is killing this pizza.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.392
So, really, it's just a
little teeny bit bigger.

00:01:57.392 --> 00:01:59.280
- A half inch all around.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.160
Average full moon.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.660
- Right.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.410
- Super moon!

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.980
So, if that half inch is super to you,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.813
- Right.

00:02:08.813 --> 00:02:10.090
- On a pizza,

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.480
then, call the moon
what the hell you want,

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.560
but, in a pizza shop, nobody
here's calling this one super.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.490
- Right.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.770
- You don't come in and
say give me a super pizza,

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.750
and then you make it a half
inch bigger all around,

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.500
because a half inch and a
half inch makes an inch.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.053
That's all I'm saying, Chuck.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.920
- Oh, oh it's okay.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.170
A super moon is a half inch
bigger than a regular moon.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.870
- Why do you get to cut the pizza?

00:02:33.542 --> 00:02:34.375
- Because I'm hungry!

00:02:34.375 --> 00:02:35.640
I'll tell you what, no matter what,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.110
this moon is delicious.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.360
(grunting)

00:02:42.655 --> 00:02:43.488
- Okay.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.510
- Let's eat some moon
- Let's eat some moon, baby.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.852
That don't sound good.

00:02:48.852 --> 00:02:51.102
(laughing)
