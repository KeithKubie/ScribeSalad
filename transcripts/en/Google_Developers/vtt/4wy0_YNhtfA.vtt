[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.670
MALE SPEAKER 1: Shanghai GDG
is a very interesting

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.770
developer community.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:21.480
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.710
has asked this question.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.910
MALE SPEAKER 2: This is
when magic happens.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.330
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: This is
primarily a question and

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.090
answer show, so if any
of you out there

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.340
would like to ask questions?

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.260
JENNY MURPHY: Hello everyone.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.860
Welcome to this week's session
of the Google+

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.414
Platform Office Hours.

00:00:38.414 --> 00:00:40.850
Whoops.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.200
I accidentally had
my sound on.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.200
Sorry about that.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.360
Welcome to the Google+ Platform
Office Hours.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.050
This is the show where we keep
you up-to-date with what's new

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.640
on the Google+ platform.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.780
This week, we're going to be
talking about the new release

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.840
of the Hangouts API, version
1.2, but before we get into

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.130
that, let me introduce myself
and my co-host, and those

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.010
developers who have joined in.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.500
So I'm Jennifer Murphy.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.640
I'm a developer programs
engineer here at Google.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.930
I focus on Google+, and I help
you build awesome stuff with

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.940
our APIs and plug-ins.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.310
And joining me in-studio today,
our Hangout expert.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.160
JONATHAN BERI: Jonathan Beri.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.700
I'm a developer advocate
working on Google+.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.660
I spend a lot of my time
building Hangout apps and

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.070
doing video conferencing.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.140
Fun stuff.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.890
And I worked a little
bit on this release.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.000
JENNY MURPHY: Great.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.280
And joining us through
the magic of

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.730
cyberspace on the Hangout.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.765
From left to right,
we have Allen.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.980
And I think you might
be muted.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.830
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: I'm an
outside developer, and I do

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.090
most of my work with
the Hangout API.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.400
JENNY MURPHY: Great.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.810
Gerwin.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.530
GERWIN STURM: Hi, I'm
Gerwin from Austria.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.270
I'm a developer doing all sorts
of stuff with different

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.520
Google+ APIs.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:02.480
JENNY MURPHY: Thanks.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.130
And Moritz.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.440
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Hi.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.190
I'm Moritz from Germany, and
I'm a system engineer and I

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.780
work mostly with the Hangouts
API, the Google+ API, and some

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.150
other cool APIs from Google
to [? Google Maps. ?]

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.050
JENNY MURPHY: Thanks for
joining us, guys.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.530
And so I guess we'll
get right into it.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.370
So, Jonathan, what's new in the
version 1.2 release of the

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.426
Hangouts API?

00:02:25.426 --> 00:02:28.870
JONATHAN BERI: So 1.2 is
our latest release.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.965
And we've been iterating on some
of the name-spaces that

00:02:32.965 --> 00:02:35.020
we launched in the beginning.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.520
Sort of rounding it
out, we added a

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.640
few general API features.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.330
Some are interesting if you have
particular use cases, but

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.820
some are just, we felt like
we needed to add them.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.640
Things like the Topic.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.430
So Get Topic, On Topic
Change kind of stuff.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.450
Locale information, if the
Hangout has a particular

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.290
preferred language
for the speakers.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.016
Things around the YouTube
live-streams to

00:02:58.016 --> 00:02:59.600
get to YouTube live.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.650
But sort of the bigger releases
are new types of

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.920
sound effects.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.100
So previously, we allowed you
to broadcast locally.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.110
So I could hear-- let's say it's
my turn-- like a ding,

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.000
for example.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.410
But in the newest release, we've
added the ability to

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.020
broadcast sound, so everybody
can hear that same track.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.550
Whether it be background
music playing in a

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.270
game or a laugh track.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.130
It's all synchronized, and it
uses the same noise canceling

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.460
capabilities of the plug-in.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.570
And you just have to pass
that URL and it plays.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.940
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.310
JONATHAN BERI: We've also
released another interesting

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.890
API related to an app we produce
called Cameraman.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.570
And so we provide the ability
for broadcast applications to

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.330
remove particular users
from the broadcast.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.090
JENNY MURPHY: That sounds
really useful for larger

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.692
broadcasts.

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:49.910
JONATHAN BERI: But by far, I
think the most requested

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.720
feature that we made into 1.2
is our memory management

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.720
capabilities.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.680
This is the ability to load
resources to the plug-in,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.060
whether they be static
overlays or

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.400
face-tracking overlays.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.340
And really know when they're
loaded, to dispose of them

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.750
when you don't need them, to
track one that's actually been

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.610
disposed, and events
around that stuff.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.440
So I would like to spend a few
minutes just talking about

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.470
those particular features in
a little bit more depth.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.149
And general best practices
for memory management.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:17.750
JENNY MURPHY: Sounds great.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.930
Tell us more.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.690
JONATHAN BERI: So, before
1.2, you could

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.270
create a new resource.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.905
And that could be an image
resource, that could be an

00:04:24.905 --> 00:04:25.750
audio resource.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.290
And you just kept on creating
them as you needed them.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.650
There was actually no way to
dispose of those resources.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.020
So the challenge was, every
time you create a new

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.320
resource, you take up memory,
and the plug-in runs--

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.730
whether it be an image
or an audio snippet--

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.600
in the memory of the browser
and in your system.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.860
And it varies across different
capabilities of systems.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.550
So high-end machines would have
lots of memory to play

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.970
around with, and lower-end
machines would just bork out.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.810
So of course we want to address
that problem by adding

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.860
the ability to not only track
when resources are loaded, but

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.500
to figure out the state
of all the resources

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.700
and dispose of them.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.240
So that same face-tracking or
static overlay or even audio

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.890
resource, you can properly
manage them.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.030
And that really helps you if
you're trying to be nice to

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.200
your users' computers.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.850
Or if you're trying to use
those resources for more

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.680
computationally intensive
things.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.900
And it's pretty neat.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.270
If you go to the
documentation--

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.160
I'm not going to actually pull
up or walk through the

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.720
particular examples-- but on the
actual objects you create,

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.190
you can go ahead and call
Method, call Dispose, and that

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.410
will get rid of it.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.460
You can also check if it's
loaded by calling Is-Loaded

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.470
Method or Is-Disposed Method.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.720
And there's a bunch of events
associated with the different

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.080
types of objects to tell
when it's loaded.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.250
So you can track that.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.110
And you can go ahead and sort
of walk through all your

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.580
different objects or your
resources, in this case, and

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.355
dispose of them or
work with them.

00:05:58.355 --> 00:05:59.360
JENNY MURPHY: Very cool.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.230
So sounds like it opens
up potential for new

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.290
applications?

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.790
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah,
definitely.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.170
So we have a set of running
sample apps.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.310
And our go-to sample app
is the media-Starter.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.845
And that plays around
with different

00:06:10.845 --> 00:06:12.130
use cases for overlays.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.500
One example that we
added recently was

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.910
the ability to do--

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.810
we're calling it an animated
overlay-- but really, it has a

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.450
little counter with a clock that
changes from zero to one,

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.510
to two, to three.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.910
And that does that efficiently
by disposing of it when it's

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.220
not necessary.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.020
So playing around with
the different URLs.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.216
JENNY MURPHY: Very cool.

00:06:32.216 --> 00:06:34.710
Sounds like a lot of potential
for some pretty cool overlay

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.585
applications, so I
look forward to

00:06:36.585 --> 00:06:38.510
seeing what people develop.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.900
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.250
And it just goes in line with
the larger topic of memory

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:42.920
management.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.707
As front-end engineers, we tend
not to worry about memory

00:06:46.707 --> 00:06:49.220
management the same way that
other types of engineers.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.740
So if you've come from an
embedded system background or

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.220
building console games, you very
much know that memory is

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.070
really important.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.560
But in the client-side world,
we tend not to build really

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.100
resource-intensive applications
unless you're

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.250
really into game space.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.880
But when you're doing things
with Hangouts, you are

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.510
starting to create resource
constraints.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.010
So taking advantage of the
ability to dispose of

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.900
resources or smartly reusing
those is best practices.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.260
But also things like
taking advantage of

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.740
requestAnimateFrame, which is
a feature of the browser, to

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.690
smartly change your frame rate,
and tab visibility,

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.870
which lets you know if a user's
currently focused on

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.290
your application,
and things like

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.340
Web-Workers and Smart caching.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.560
Things like that.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.930
JENNY MURPHY: Very cool.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:36.980
Excellent.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.885
So thanks for that summary of
what's new in Hangouts 1.2.

00:07:40.885 --> 00:07:42.320
JONATHAN BERI: You're welcome.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.440
JENNY MURPHY: So as I said
during the pre-roll, this is a

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.930
questions and answer show.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.970
Does anyone from the Hangout
have any questions about

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.170
things we added in the version
1.2 API or anything else about

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.420
Hangout app development?

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.260
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Yeah, I had
a question that is actually a

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.120
follow-up a little bit on the
memory resource issues that we

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.260
just discussed.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:06.150
One of the things that people
have noticed is that once you

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:11.220
have an image resource, you can
create a single overlay

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.510
from that, but trying to create
a second overlay, or

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:18.390
trying to create another image
resource using the same URL

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.830
doesn't work as well as
you might expect.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:25.060
Is that still an
issue with 1.2?

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.570
JONATHAN BERI: There was a
threat actually with Moritz

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.820
regarding that.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:33.169
It's sounded like there was a
bug with using the same URL.

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:36.630
But not creating
new resources.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:40.230
So in general, go ahead and
intelligently create a new

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.919
resource when you want
to have a new image.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.500
But, for example, in the Lower
Thirds use case, you really

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.210
only have one image resource,
so you want to swap out the

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.030
URL if it changes.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.700
And the bug is filed, and
that particular one is

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.380
being worked on.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.260
And I don't think there should
be any issues with creating

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.050
new image resources.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:57.170
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: OK.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:02.780
I think this actually came up
with the donut tossing game.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.590
Where they wanted to have
multiple donuts, which were

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:11.260
the same image resource, but
multiple overlays from that.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.470
And their workaround at the time
was actually to create

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.755
multiple image resources.

00:09:14.755 --> 00:09:16.400
JONATHAN BERI:Yep, yep.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.060
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: OK, so
that's still in place.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.950
That constraint is
still there.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:22.520
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.280
That's actually a bug.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.880
And that's being worked
on as we speak.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.470
It's already been filed
and identified.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.145
But creating new resources just
in general shouldn't be

00:09:30.145 --> 00:09:31.135
any problem.

00:09:31.135 --> 00:09:31.540
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: OK.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:35.030
JONATHAN BERI: If you look at
just the effects app, for

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.590
example, we're using multiple
overlays with face-tracking

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.900
overlays, so there's three to
four overlays at one time.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.481
There's no problem there.

00:09:44.481 --> 00:09:46.920
Cool.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.520
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Yeah, I just
want to jump in right there.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.250
As Gerwin mentioned, there's
still a bug with the same

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.270
image resource when the
URL is the same.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:01.570
I noticed that a while ago, it
was working fine in version

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.920
1.1, but at some point,
something changed in the

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.940
Hangout code which is causing
this issue, this

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.990
behavior, of the URL.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.670
So whenever I have a Lower
Third up and disable it

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.140
without changing anything and
want to load it up again, it's

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.020
not showing up.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:20.440
But now with version 1.2 and
with the Dispose Method, I can

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.130
handle these images in my app.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.403
So whenever I disable an
overlay, I dispose

00:10:25.403 --> 00:10:26.710
it at the same time.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:30.290
But as you said, if you want
to load up the same URL, so

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:34.050
more than one object, like
cloning them, it's not working

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.120
at the moment.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.401
JONATHAN BERI: Right.

00:10:36.401 --> 00:10:38.780
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: If you dispose
any resources and

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.498
handle the resources properly
with the new methods, it's

00:10:41.498 --> 00:10:42.960
working fine.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.200
JONATHAN BERI: Great.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.320
Yeah, it's a great workaround.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.400
And like I said, it may be in
the plug-in level, so that's

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.910
something that changed
over time.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.880
And we basically may have
reintroduced that minor bug,

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.760
but it's an easy fix and we've
identified it, so that

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.900
shouldn't be a problem.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:58.160
And--

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.610
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Yeah,
another workaround--

00:10:59.610 --> 00:10:59.990
sorry--

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.030
JONATHAN BERI: No, go for it.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:06.130
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Another
workaround I figured so far is

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:09.270
to just add a transparent pixel
somewhere in the image

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:17.030
and change the alpha channel
always in one step.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:22.060
So the data URL is always a bit
different, but you don't

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.580
actually see it in
the actual image.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.956
So it's some sort of tricky
workaround until it gets

00:11:26.956 --> 00:11:29.430
fixed, and this works as well.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:30.720
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah, and I
think one of those other

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.340
solutions that we talked about
was if you know the image is

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.630
not changing, you may not
need to dispose of it.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:41.295
You may just want to hide it,
and then re-enable it at a

00:11:41.295 --> 00:11:41.640
future time.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.960
And if there is a change to the
resource, you may want to

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.860
use things like fragment
identifiers to change the URL,

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.620
cache-busting style.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.010
But of course, there's still
the bug that we're going to

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.010
plug as well.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:56.060
But that may come in handy for
other instances when you want

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.150
to have the same base image
resource and to do things like

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:02.475
data URIs to dynamically
change that content.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.150
JENNY MURPHY: Great.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.210
So if you are watching the
stream live, either on YouTube

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.450
or on Google+ Developers, I just
want to remind you that

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:18.060
you are welcome to ask
questions, either by posting

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.050
on the event as a comment
or by commenting

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:21.150
on the YouTube channel.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:24.250
I'm watching the comments right
here, so feel free to

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.140
ask questions.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.450
So does anyone in the Hangout
have any other questions about

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:31.890
the API before we
move on to the

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.970
questions from the comments?

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:36.860
JONATHAN BERI: Gerwin, I'm going
to ask you a question.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.970
I saw a comment about the
YouTube Live ID, and that

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.060
you've integrated it into one
of your applications?

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:43.670
GERWIN STURM: No, not yet.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.110
I am planning to.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.870
JONATHAN BERI: Oh.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.120
Do you want to talk about it?

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.520
GERWIN STURM: Yeah, so I'm
planning to use it for the

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.400
Comment Tracker because then
people can just start up the

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.600
Comment Tracker, and I can
automatically fetch all the

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.540
YouTube comments without people
having to copy the URL

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.900
and putting it in.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.180
So just to make it easier for
people to use Comment Tracker

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.490
so they don't have to copy a URL
from here, from there, to

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:13.460
just take it and put it in.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.200
So to just start the Comment
Tracker and we'll fetch the

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.370
YouTube ID automatically and
fetch all the comments.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:20.780
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah so
I kind of glazed

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.150
over that minor feature--

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:26.020
basically again the YouTube Live
of the Hangouts On Air.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.450
That's a perfect use case
of that functionality.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:32.240
Because right now, the
broadcaster, the Hangout, does

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.490
have the embed code, for
example, for the YouTube, but

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:35.550
can't interact with it.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.240
So there's a lot of interesting
use cases of how

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.840
you could use the YouTube URL
right in your application for

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.220
broadcast purposes, sharing,
and things like that.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:46.675
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:13:46.675 --> 00:13:48.300
It seems like it'll make
a lot of things easier.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.060
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah,
definitely.

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:50.320
JENNY MURPHY: Definitely.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.600
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Jonathan, can
you just mention briefly,

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:57.420
is the data that is returned
by that the ID

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.070
of the YouTube video?

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:03.350
Or is it a URL for one
of the various ways

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:05.160
to get to that video?

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.890
JONATHAN BERI: It is
the YouTube ID.

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:11.010
And so you can essentially
generate the YouTube URL by

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:14.410
appending the ID to
the YouTube.com.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.410
GERWIN STURM: And so I actually
wanted to ask about--

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:19.640
because we have this on YouTube
ID ready event.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:24.120
Will this fire in any case, or
if we already have Hangout

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.036
On-Air running and then start
the application later, will

00:14:27.036 --> 00:14:28.180
the event still fire?

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.420
Because then the ID
was already ready?

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.650
Do you need to check
this, or will the

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:34.330
event fire in any case?

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.640
JONATHAN BERI: That's
a good question.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.870
I haven't tested for that, but
that's sort of something I

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:39.800
could figure out for you.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.780
GERWIN STURM: Yeah, that's
probably something I'm going

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:41.575
to test anyways.

00:14:41.575 --> 00:14:44.090
JONATHAN BERI: OK, we'll
do that in conjunction.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:45.950
GERWIN STURM: I'll
let you know.

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:50.150
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah, there are
some cases where the events

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.140
will fire in only one
rare situation.

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.040
But it's still useful.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:58.310
So for example, on some of the
Hangouts, the on-air stuff,

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.710
will only fire in one
particular path.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:04.110
So we still provide those
because that one use case it's

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.090
useful for.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:08.900
So say apps we're building
or apps that we foresee.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:10.790
JENNY MURPHY: Although for an
[? on ready ?], I'd expect it

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:13.800
to probably work for when
participants join.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.570
So give it a try and tell
us how well it works.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.330
If the current behavior is not
what you expect, we can always

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.150
take another look at it.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.250
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: OK, I have not
really two questions, but

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:29.336
more like feature requests
or suggestions.

00:15:29.336 --> 00:15:29.770
JENNY MURPHY: I love feedback.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:30.330
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: One
thing I already

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.910
talked about with Jenny.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:36.980
It would be cool to be able to
figure with the API if the

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.640
Hangout is set to
plus 18 or not.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:45.920
Because I'm working on a game
currently which might contain

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.130
some swear words
in one edition.

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:49.840
So we want to build
like two editions.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.670
One which is PG-13 and one which
is 18 plus, but this

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.870
requires me to have some tools
in the API where I can figure

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.570
out the state of the Hangout by
is it public or not or is

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:02.070
it 18 plus or not.

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:06.110
And the other thing is,
especially I think for all

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:10.160
developers who develop apps,
I haven't tried it yet, but

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.120
would it work when I add a +1
button to my app, or like the

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.680
Share button, would it actually
share the app?

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.275
Am I able to put specific URL
stuff in there, including the

00:16:21.275 --> 00:16:26.150
app ID so they can launch the
app from the shared host?

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.300
Or is that something you could
probably think of building

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:32.180
into the API, like having
a share option for apps?

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.830
JENNY MURPHY: I can
answer that one.

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:38.570
So yes, you can render Share
buttons, +1 buttons, badges,

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.520
and all those plug-ins
within a Hangout.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.685
And you can specify
target URLs.

00:16:42.685 --> 00:16:44.670
So you can render a +1 button
and you can target

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:45.870
whatever you like.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.330
You could target the
URL to start the

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.310
Hangout, for example.

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:53.040
But if you're going to be
changing the target often and

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:58.080
during the runtime of your
Hangout, potentially if you're

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.960
targeting a high score or some
other content like that--

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.840
the Share link might actually
be the most appropriate.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.540
Because it's the most
light-weight mechanism of

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.460
sharing to Google+.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:06.790
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Yeah.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.359
I was actually sharing
the app.

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:11.470
Like when the user opens up the
app and thinks, wow, this

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:14.170
is a great app, I want to share
that with my friends.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.010
Actually they have to figure
out the app or find an app

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:18.605
page to this app.

00:17:18.605 --> 00:17:20.660
But when they have a Share
button, they can instantly

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.859
click it and it will post to the
Google+ stream, and they

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:25.740
can let other users know
about this app.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.849
JONATHAN BERI: So I've
actually done some

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:28.660
experiments with this.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.330
I have a sample app I should
probably publish, but the code

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:31.980
is really simple.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:35.400
Because all the plug-ins have
an explicit render mode.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.880
So you can use that to say,
I want to render this

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:38.780
plug-in right now.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.140
And of course the Share link
is a great option.

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.560
And we also have the
Hangout URL.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.780
So with the Hangout URL, that's
one way to pass it.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:49.030
I know some of the Hangout apps
now, like the poker, for

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.400
example, they pull in the
hangout URL and they post that

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.240
to their site.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.750
And that's one way of doing
it, to share it.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:59.790
And the other one is to create
a Hangout with a

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.230
G ID on it as well.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:06.480
And it works exactly
as documented.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.540
There's nothing tricky there.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.690
But one thing I also want to
throw in there is brands

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:14.410
really like to use both the
Share link and the Badge

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:15.540
inside their Hangout.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.086
So you can imagine if you're a
brand and you have a Plus Page

00:18:18.086 --> 00:18:20.050
and it's really active.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:23.630
To get users, to drive them to
your Plus Page, the Badge.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:29.316
As well as share, let's say, the
page, or part of the app.

00:18:29.316 --> 00:18:32.383
So it could be a screenshot that
you've rendered or some

00:18:32.383 --> 00:18:34.210
sort of stated information.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:37.050
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Talking about
brands, when will it be

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:41.400
able for brands to launch
apps in a Hangout?

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.930
I hear a lot of brand page users
and they want use Lower

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:48.060
Third in their brand Hangouts,
but they're not able to

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.280
because the permission
thing pops up but

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.530
then disappears again.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:53.950
JONATHAN BERI: Yes.

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:57.880
We did one small change recently
about how extensions

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.350
are being rendered
within Hangouts.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.510
I think you saw that post.

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:05.150
And we're working on better
integration for the rest of

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:06.240
Google+ like Plus pages.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.690
So that's coming soon.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:12.070
And we know it's
a major issue.

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.910
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: On the
previous topic, I would also

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:17.220
add that I've been doing some
testing recently using the

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:22.330
History API to log when you
start an application and have

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.850
that application automatically
show up in your history vault.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.890
And that's been working out
fairly well so far.

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:30.450
Still not production yet, but
it's a good trend and I see

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:34.060
that as a really good avenue
to start pursuing.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:35.480
JONATHAN BERI: That's
pretty neat.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.990
And actually I think Moments
within a Hangout app could be

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:39.346
interesting too.

00:19:39.346 --> 00:19:40.430
That just launched.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:41.080
JENNY MURPHY: Definitely.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.130
We've gotten a lot of feedback
from many of you and a lot of

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:47.100
other people in the developer
community about Moment ideas,

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.320
and a lot of them centered
around the kind of experience

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.040
you would expect within
a Hangout app.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.390
So we're listening.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.170
Keep the feedback coming, all
you, to continue that

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.420
development for sure.

00:19:59.030 --> 00:19:59.800
Great.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:00.150
JONATHAN BERI: Awesome.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:01.710
JENNY MURPHY: So I guess I'm
going to take a few questions

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:03.480
from the stream.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.900
First one is one I'll field.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.850
Sean asks, will this Hangout be
archived for later viewing?

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.570
The answer is yes.

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.750
You will always be able to watch
this Hangout from the

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:13.980
Google+ event.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.560
And we'll embed the
video there.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.280
And we'll also upload
it to YouTube, the

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.720
Google Developers channel.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.550
I'll include links to that
in the show notes.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:23.550
So yes, you can watch these.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.170
They'll be archived.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.230
And you can also see all of the
previous sessions archived

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:28.480
there as well.

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:33.740
And Darrell has some
questions.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:37.700
So Darrell asks, is there a
way for a user to remove a

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:41.550
plug-in from their Hangout
once they have added it?

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.320
JONATHAN BERI: And so I think
what Darrell is asking about

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:49.300
for Hangout app extensions, if
somebody ran a Hangout app

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.710
extension, can they remove it
during the session and after

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.410
the session.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:57.260
So during the session, you can
actually stop running any app

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.000
by going to the lower
app switcher.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.710
There's the People tab
and the Apps tab.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:03.920
And if you click on that,
you'll see the running

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.140
Hangouts, and as you hover over
those apps, there's a

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.930
little title and an
X next to it.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:13.966
And that actually kills the app
for your session, and you

00:21:13.966 --> 00:21:16.160
can either run it again if
something went wrong, or if

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.440
you just don't want
anymore apps to be

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.370
running for this Hangout.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.370
In terms of post Hangout.

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:23.470
So, if you notice at the top the
screen, there's a list of

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:25.320
recently used apps.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.970
And if you go to Add Apps,
there's even a longer one.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:29.900
That's basically just
a running list.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:35.210
It's not installed, it's been
recently run and authorized.

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.470
Now if you want to de-authorize
that, just like

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.665
any app you've ever associated
with your Google account, you

00:21:40.665 --> 00:21:42.080
can go to the Google
Account settings

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.060
and revoke that access.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:48.180
But it will still show up in
your Recently Used list.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.337
That's just sort of a UI
feature right now, and

00:21:51.337 --> 00:21:53.780
something certainly
we can look into.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.950
JENNY MURPHY: Great.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:58.520
He has a couple more
questions.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:02.460
So his next question is, the
self view of the camera is

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.090
mirrored, flipped
left to right.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:08.770
This also happens when images
are displayed with my plug-in.

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:11.570
Is this a known issue?

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:15.760
JONATHAN BERI: So that actually,
it's not an issue.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.160
It's something that we've
implemented on purpose.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.500
And it can be a little
confusing.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.350
We actually did a bunch of user
studies around video and

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:27.750
we found that it's actually
awkward for users to see

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.220
themselves right facing.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.800
Because in their day-to-day
lives, the only time they

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.540
themselves is in a mirror.

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.380
And when you display themselves
right facing, it

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:38.040
throws them off.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.960
Their depth perception is kind
of screwed, they don't know

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.100
their right from their
left, and this was

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.470
through user testing.

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.560
And we've enforced that.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.540
And it seems to be helping a
lot with user confusion.

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.680
Now when you have an app that
becomes most apparent when you

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.720
have text, for example, because
it looks flipped.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.130
When your face is on camera,
it's not as big of a deal.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:04.580
I've seen even Moritz's app
declare, hey, don't worry,

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.250
this is a flipped image, this is
supposed to happen, it will

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:08.730
look right for you.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:11.930
And that's just something we
have to contend with being on

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.880
broadcasting video.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.110
JENNY MURPHY: Right.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:17.790
Because since we're flipping the
image of yourself, we also

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:20.570
have to flip any overlays you
have so that they line up

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:23.090
properly with whatever the
content on the screen is.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:25.960
Because if we didn't, content
on the overlay that would be

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.720
on the left side would be on the
right side, and you'd have

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:31.890
a different view than those
viewing your stream.

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:35.020
So just a necessary evil, just
part of human psychology.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.400
So we did it on purpose.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.890
If you want to try it out the
other way, you can always use

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:41.180
other web cam applications.

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.330
And you should try it
out sometime if

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:43.520
you have the chance.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.480
Using Photo Booth, you can
actually tell it to remove the

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.000
reverse and it's a pretty
trippy experience.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.440
You'll definitely realize
why we're doing it if

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.690
you try that app.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.750
Darrell has one more question.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:59.350
I'd love to see the API support
multiple cameras on a

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.750
single machine.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.140
Give developers functions to
switch between these cameras

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:06.080
and maybe grab a still
from the camera.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.570
It would add a lot
of functionality.

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:09.660
JONATHAN BERI: So sounds
like there's

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:10.800
three feature requests.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.070
One is to support multiple
cameras from the plug-in.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:17.210
The second one is expose the
ability to switch those

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:18.640
cameras from the plug-in.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.530
And a third is a
screenshot API.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:25.910
The multiple cameras one, that
is an interesting challenge.

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:29.600
The way that the Google Talk
plug-in works, is it talks to

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.470
the operating system.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:31.850
Sort of blindly.

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:36.100
Saying, hey I would like a web
cam interface to work and do

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.300
some cool stuff with it.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.165
And the operating system's like,
hey, here's the web cam.

00:24:40.165 --> 00:24:42.420
It doesn't know too much about
the architecture of the web

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:44.150
cam, it doesn't know the model,
doesn't know the make,

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:48.050
except for a string for
the title to display.

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:49.620
So that's sort of transparent
to the plug-in

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.730
as it stands today.

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:54.110
For operating systems that
support multiple web-cams

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:56.360
running at the same time--

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.600
and that they can expose
that to the plug-in--

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.250
that's a little bit tricky.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:03.520
Definitely when you move up to
sort of the professional grade

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.960
video mixing stuff, the kind of
stuff we use to do this, it

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.130
becomes easier.

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:12.480
But for the average consumer
sitting in their house or

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:17.220
maybe at a party using a laptop,
that's probably not

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.930
the most common use case.

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:20.840
It's something interesting.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.350
And we're always exploring
different ways you can add new

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:29.270
functionality to the plug-in
beyond just overlays and

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:30.640
broadcasting.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:35.150
And I think that is an
interesting use case.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.110
I don't have anything else to
say about that today, just

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:41.690
because it is a challenge
in many, many ways.

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:44.720
But the same goes with the API
that would go with that to do

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.650
camera switching.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.380
I've definitely seen people
experiment with using multiple

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:52.190
machines and multiple
cameras to do a faux

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:53.020
studio like set up.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:57.310
So they actually take one of the
spots in the Hangout, and

00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:01.630
then use the Hangout app to
switch who's the camera being

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:02.180
focused on.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.800
So you get that sort
of studio effect.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.000
And then the screenshot one is
a great idea, a great feature

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.130
request I definitely hope
you can file that

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:12.270
into our issue tracker.

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:14.700
Because I've heard that before,
and if it's not there

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.670
already, that's a great
one to bubble up.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:18.390
JENNY MURPHY: I believe that
one's already being tracked in

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:20.430
our issue tracker, so I'll
include a link to that issue

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:22.850
if you'd like to give some more
feedback or star it, so

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.930
you get notified when there's
an update to that request.

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:30.210
So yes, if you have other
requests, please definitely

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:31.270
add them to our issue tracker.

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:33.540
It's the best way for us to
hear about the requests.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.260
It kind of helps us collaborate
and just make sure

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:38.120
we don't lose them
in the shuffle.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.420
So I'll link to the issue
tracker in the

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:40.400
show notes as well.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.430
But thanks a lot for the
feedback and questions.

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:46.240
We have another question
from the stream.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.250
Actually it's more a request.

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:49.980
And I'm about to butcher
your first name,

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.700
sorry ahead of time.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.870
Lasse asks, I have
a feature request

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:56.430
for the Hangout button.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:59.770
It would be really nice to be
able to pre-fill the dialogue

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:02.370
with emails.

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:04.090
So that when the Hangout starts,
it's easier for people

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:06.920
to invite the people that
are maybe connected

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.630
to them on the site.

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:10.950
JONATHAN BERI: So first, I
think you got that right.

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:15.230
Lasse is one of the developers
from Symphonical, one of the

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.150
apps that are featured.

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:19.200
So yeah, that is a
great request.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.445
We've heard others like the
ability to pre-populate, for

00:27:23.445 --> 00:27:25.900
example, members from your
circle or circles.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.920
Right now one of the limitations
to that is the

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.360
Hangout button is not JavaScript
based, and exposing

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.660
emails through a URL, there's
complicated privacy concerns

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:40.310
both here and around the world,
but I definitely think

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.416
we want to make that
button better.

00:27:42.416 --> 00:27:45.520
It is a cool feature of
Hangouts-- the ability to

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.840
launch a new Hangout with an app
running, and the ability

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.750
to launch a new Hangout with
an app running and

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.030
pre-populate data.

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:54.580
So I think that's a natural
evolution of where we want to

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:58.390
go is make that button smarter
and stay tuned for that

00:27:58.390 --> 00:27:59.095
[INAUDIBLE].

00:27:59.095 --> 00:28:00.630
JENNY MURPHY: Yep, it's
definitely something we're

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:01.880
working on.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.320
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: I think as
an extension of that, one of

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:07.790
the other things that would be
great is to have the option so

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:10.290
that when it launches, it
doesn't bring up the

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:12.000
invitation window.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.520
So that you can launch into a
Hangout with the app running,

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:19.190
and have the app itself
do invitation via

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:20.860
other magical means.

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.440
And not feel like you need
to invite people in

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.860
order to run the app.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.020
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah,
that makes sense.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:28.830
I like that idea.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:31.040
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, these are
both good ideas, and I can see

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.210
them both being useful for
different kinds of

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:34.530
applications, perhaps.

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.420
Because some applications may
only make sense if there are

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.850
people there at the
very beginning.

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:41.700
So a lot of options for
us to consider.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:45.684
But yes, keep that feedback
coming, we love it.

00:28:45.684 --> 00:28:46.670
Great.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:48.290
So are there
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:49.680
Oh, you beat me to it--

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.270
I was about to ask
if you had--

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:55.840
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: I have another
small feature request.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:00.350
Are you planning at some point
maybe to enable the API to

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:04.600
expose some data from the
Hangout to external websites,

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.430
for example?

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:09.100
I mean only if the Hangout
is public.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.540
For limited Hangout,
no go at all.

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:14.280
But if you have a public
Hangout, it would be cool to

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.290
have an API feature which
enables me to give a callback

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:20.300
to another script or something
where I can get a list of

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.400
participants who was actually in
the Hangout or who work in

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.120
the Hangout--

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.290
especially with Hangouts On
Air when I embed the live

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:29.390
player on my own website.

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:33.760
And then I want to display, as
well, the participants below

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.770
the post, so people can actually
click on the person

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:37.850
and check out their profiles.

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:40.870
This would be a great feature.

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:43.400
You can ultimately gather a
list, over time, of people who

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.730
were in your Hangout shows.

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:49.790
JONATHAN BERI: So basically
either a RESTful API or JSONP

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:54.040
type of interface for metadata
around the Hangouts.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:54.480
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Right.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.950
JONATHAN BERI: We don't have
any plans right now.

00:29:55.950 --> 00:30:00.060
I've definitely heard that
from you before and from

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.660
Hangout Canopy folks who are
trying to do some interesting

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.720
things with the RESTful API.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.660
We did sort of a lightweight
thing with Search.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.180
You can sort of trick
Search to find

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:12.970
publicly running Hangouts.

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:17.010
But nothing official in the
Hangouts API namespace.

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:19.490
But definitely useful,
definitely cool.

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:21.490
I like that idea a lot.

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:25.325
And I could think of a bunch
of use cases, especially on

00:30:25.325 --> 00:30:26.990
the on-air side of why
we'd use that.

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:28.810
So we'll take that feedback.

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:29.290
JENNY MURPHY: Yes.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:31.420
Making the REST APIs more
expressive and more

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.170
descriptive is something that's
definitely on our radar

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:34.920
and we care a lot about.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:38.590
So no promises yet, but it's
something we're definitely

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:42.820
thinking about in regard to
Hangouts, events, and other

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.710
kinds of rich content
that shows up in the

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:45.960
RESTful APIs today.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.550
Excellent.

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:52.200
So are there any other
questions from

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.450
people in the Hangout?

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.460
JONATHAN BERI: Is there anything
on the YouTube

00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.666
channel, by any chance?

00:30:59.666 --> 00:31:01.120
JENNY MURPHY: Took a
look at it also.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.080
I think we're pretty much
done for today.

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:03.450
JONATHAN BERI: Cool.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:06.380
JENNY MURPHY: So thanks a lot
to all of you who tuned in

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:09.870
from YouTube Live from
the Google+ event.

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:12.670
Thanks to everyone who joined in
the Hangout and in-person.

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:16.650
So that's it for this week's
session of the Google+

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:17.520
Platform Office Hours.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.000
We'll be back next
week with another

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.790
exciting session, I guess.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:22.380
JONATHAN BERI: Great.

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:23.280
JENNY MURPHY: Yep,
bye everyone.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.480
JONATHAN BERI: See ya.
