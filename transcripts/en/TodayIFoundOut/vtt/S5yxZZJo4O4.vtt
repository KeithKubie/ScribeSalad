00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.420
A wise man once said, "Everybody poops."

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.930
Well that should probably be changed to everything
poops, because all living things excrete waste.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.789
This brings us to a brilliant question posed
by a subscriber called George, whose head

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:29.220
we’d love to crack open and see what’s
going on inside- do trees poop?

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.780
As it so happens, yes they do, though there
is a bit of a semantic argument to be had

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.070
over what one might consider "tree poop."

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.760
(A sentence I've never in my life thought
I'd have need to utter.)

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.620
To begin with, all living things excrete things
they no longer need or which otherwise might

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.280
be harmful to them if allowed to build up
in said being's system- yes, everything from

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.850
the lowliest single celled organisms to blue
whales do this.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.219
In fact, a microbe known as Paramecium caudatum
has been observed passing solid, liquid and

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:04.710
gaseous waste, meaning it technically poops,
pees and farts, despite its entire being consisting

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.360
of a single cell.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.880
So what exactly do trees excrete?

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.670
Well, although trees produce very little in
terms of pure waste, due to tremendously efficient

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.930
metabolic systems that convert most everything
the plants take in into something they can

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.310
make use of (and a generally good nutrient
acquisition system that ensures many things

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.250
that would otherwise be bad for the plants
aren't taken in at all), nothing is perfect

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.470
and trees will invariably need to excrete
a number of things to remain healthy- the

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.070
most well known of course being oxygen.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.649
Now oxygen, which the tree, like any aerobic
life form, does need but invariably has an

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.579
excess amount of as a natural byproduct of
photosynthesis, is mostly expired, along with

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.640
other gaseous waste, through small pores in
the leaves of a tree known as stomata.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.730
Trees also excrete water vapour containing
various other waste products during this process.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.040
While this is an excretion, you may not consider
this akin to pooping and peeing, perhaps more

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.040
like breathing.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.659
After all, humans expel carbon dioxide, water
vapour and certain other substances while

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.930
breathing.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.410
So what's something the tree does that is
more like pooping and peeing?

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.090
In regards to the latter, some, but not all,
plants occasionally expel water and other

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.420
waste via a process known as guttation.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.440
In a nutshell, guttation occurs when excess
water is taken into the roots resulting in

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.079
an upwards pressure within the tree that must
be gotten rid of; this most commonly occurs

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.290
at night when the stomata are generally closed,
robbing the tree of one way it may get rid

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.890
of such excess water.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.260
The result of this root pressure is a sticky
sap, consisting of sugar, water, and various

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.830
other substances, including waste compounds,
being pushed out of water stomata or hydathodes

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.450
in the leaves.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.020
What about tree pooping?

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.199
Plant cells contain large vacuoles that are
variously used either to store essential nutrients

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:54.530
or waste the plant no longer has use for.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.790
In regards to the latter waste, plants concentrate
it in parts of its anatomy that, while also

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.070
potentially serving other purposes throughout
those parts' lifecycle, are nonetheless “destined

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.010
to fall off or die”, like leaves, petals,
or even fruit.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.340
The waste, which in turn sometimes also serves
a useful purpose but nonetheless must be gotten

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.980
rid of lest it build up and ultimately harm
the tree, including things like heavy metals,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.860
tannins, oxalates, and anthocyanins, will
naturally be lost come wintertime for many

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.810
trees or just at random times throughout the
year for evergreens.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.940
As famed biologist Brian J. Ford notes, "the
leaf... not only [is] the plant’s photosynthetic

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.570
centre, but also [is] the organ which, at
the end of its anabolic programme, is stripped

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.060
of vital constituents and systematically charged
with metabolic wastes."

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.560
As a noteworthy example of this, mangroves
are able to thrive in saltwater, despite too

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.470
much salt being harmful for the plant and
that they otherwise don't need large amounts

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.470
of salt to survive.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.840
(In fact, many mangroves will, in fact, grow
just fine in fresh water.)

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.280
They achieve this partially as they are adapted
to filter with their roots sometimes as much

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.060
as 90% of the salt from the water they take
in, which is quite remarkable considering

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.250
such strong osmotic pressure would normally
result in water being drawn out of roots rather

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.720
than being absorbed.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.850
Any salt the plant does imbibe is then ultimately
excreted through a combination of various

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.300
processes, most significantly by the plant
concentrating the salt in older leaves and

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.830
bark which will be periodically shed.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.050
So given that many plants, such as trees,
use their leaves and other eventual droppings

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.520
as a way to get rid of waste, we'd just like
to explicitly point out that when you're eating

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.490
many types of fruit, or drinking that delicious
cup of tea, you're kind of eating and drinking

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.380
bits of plant "poop" that are included...

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.900
Beyond things shed, many trees also store
waste in their innermost tissues, for instance,

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.170
heartwood which is sometimes considered to
be dead upon formation, though some argue

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.830
otherwise as it's still able to react chemically
to certain things, such as various organisms

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.490
that may cause decay in the tree if introduced.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.740
Nonetheless, this wood no longer plays an
active role in the growth and metabolism of

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.840
the tree, making it a safe place to concentrate
waste materials the tree cannot get rid of

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.560
other ways, or not get rid of fast enough
elsewise.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.430
In addition, trees may also expel waste through
their roots, as has been observed via introducing

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.900
an otherwise toxic substance to a portion
of a tree's roots.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.340
For example, in one such study doing just
this, it was later found that the toxic substance

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.400
taken up by certain roots had later been in
turn excreted by the rest.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.440
It should also be noted that, as previously
alluded to, many plants and trees excrete

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.210
things in a variety of ways that also very
much have a purpose beyond letting something

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.720
build-up within their system.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.460
For many of these things, some don't consider
them akin to poop, while others do, as they

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.700
may largely be made up of metabolic waste
or other substances that could be toxic to

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.920
the tree if not regularly excreted.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.330
For instance, some plants and trees are known
to intentionally leach harmful waste products

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.870
into the surrounding soil or from its leaves
or bark as a defence mechanism.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.170
This can take the form of compounds that kill,
trap, or deter pests from eating the plant,

00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:00.050
like latex which among other things does include
chemicals that are toxic to the plant itself.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.430
Some plants, such as the Scots pine, even
produce waste products with antibacterial

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.150
properties, helping to protect them from disease.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.590
So in the end, while to some extent whether
trees poop and pee or not, and which mechanisms

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:17.900
constitute doing this, is an argument in semantics,
they do unequivocally expel metabolic waste

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:23.080
and other harmful substances in a variety
of interesting ways- which ones are most analogous

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.750
to pooping, peeing, farting or burping, we'll
leave for discussion in the comments.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.210
Bonus Facts:
• At this point you might be wondering whether

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.400
carnivorous plants that actually eat living
things pee or poop more like animals.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.420
After all, unlike most plants, these also
take in the bodies of insects and the like.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.500
Do these plants then have to poop this out?

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.860
While mechanisms vary, generally speaking
what happens here is that after all the nutrients

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.800
are extracted from the living thing, the plant
will simply open back up and allow the remaining

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.389
matter to be washed away in the rain or potentially
be blown away by the wind.

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:03.169
Not necessarily a perfect system, however,
waste may still be left in the plant potentially

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:05.990
causing an issue if allowed to continue to
accumulate.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.970
So how is this dealt with?

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.800
Often by simply getting rid of the trap mechanism
containing the waste itself.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.090
For example, consider the Venus flytrap- after
a certain number of closures (around 10-12

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:22.420
or, if a successful capture, 3-5 meals or
so) a given trap will no longer respond to

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:27.950
external stimuli and instead will simply perform
its function in photosynthesis before ultimately

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.620
being expelled from the plant.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.640
• The fact that trees excrete otherwise
toxic heavy metals as a waste product in their

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.930
leaves has very recently been suggested as
a way to find rich gold deposits deep underground

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:46.010
and estimate their concentration, specifically
using certain species of Eucalyptus trees,

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:52.380
which can have amazingly deep taproots, extending
over 40 meters (about 130 feet) deep into

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.380
the ground.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:59.080
In a study published in October of 2013, Natural
gold particles in Eucalyptus leaves and their

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.900
relevance to exploration for buried gold deposits,
the researchers found that Eucalyptus trees

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:09.030
growing at the Freddo Gold Prospect in Western
Australia were indeed transporting gold from

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:13.919
far under ground to the surface via taking
it up from its deepest roots, then ultimately

00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:18.450
transporting much of the toxic gold to the
leaves (at upwards of 80 parts per billion

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:24.419
accumulating in the leaves vs 44 p.p.b in
the twigs, 4 p.p.b. in the bark, and only

00:08:24.419 --> 00:08:27.500
0.1 to 0.7 p.p.b. in the trunk).

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.640
Even though most eucalyptus are evergreens,
ultimately the leaves are shed, removing the

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:38.590
toxic substance from the tree, though also
resulting in it accumulating more in the topsoil.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:42.060
• Speaking of eating tree poop, we also
have the interesting case of figs and you

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:46.770
potentially eating wasp eggs or larvae and
bits of wasp bodies along with the tree poop...

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:51.881
You see, certain types of fig trees have a
symbiotic relationship with wasps, which lay

00:08:51.881 --> 00:08:55.980
their eggs inside immature figs and in return
pollinate it.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.339
Fig trees are able to tell when a wasp doesn’t
hold up its end of the bargain and will often

00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:04.540
drop an immature fruit containing eggs if
the wasp who laid them doesn’t pollinate

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.540
it.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.080
What makes this all even more interesting
is that in some species, the wasp must actively

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.290
pollinate the fig tree, rather than it just
being the byproduct of the wasp being covered

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:17.090
in pollen or the like and passively pollinating
the tree.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:21.620
So if an active-pollinator wasp tries to cheat
the system to save itself a bit of effort,

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.220
the fig tree is able to tell that, and rather
than continue to waste resources on such an

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.840
unpollinated fruit, it may sacrifice it.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.070
The downside for the wasp, of course, is its
offspring will not survive, also increasing

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:35.890
the likelihood that cheater wasps will be
bred out.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:39.960
Unsurprisingly from this, it's been discovered
that in fig species where non-pollination

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.930
is most heavily sanctioned by the tree, active-pollinator
wasps that will attempt to cheat the system

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.080
in this way are much more rare.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:52.410
(Though there do exist other species of non-pollinating
wasps which are happy to swoop into a pollinated

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:57.200
fruit and lay their eggs inside as well, piggybacking
on the pollinator wasp's efforts.)

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.510
And if at this point you're worried about
accidentally eating a wasp body or body parts

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:05.730
when eating a fig, this shouldn't typically
be the case with commercially grown figs,

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.910
which usually use species that do not require
pollination.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:14.050
However, with figs that do require pollination
to grow mature fruit, it is likely in eating

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:18.480
such a fruit that you'll be getting bits of
wing and antenna as the female often loses

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.230
these as she bores inside to lay her eggs.

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:25.410
On top of that, once hatched, many species
of male are not capable of flight and instead

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:29.410
simply mate with the female, bore their way
out (providing a path for the young female

00:10:29.410 --> 00:11:01.260
to exit) and die, occasionally even dying
inside the fig if it fails to make an exit...
