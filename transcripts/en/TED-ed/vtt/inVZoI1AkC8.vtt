00:00:07.184 --> 00:00:10.724
Testing, testing, one, two, three.

00:00:10.724 --> 00:00:15.129
When your band is trying to perform,
feedback is an annoying obstacle,

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.509
but in the grand orchestra of nature,
feedback is not only beneficial,

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:21.672
it's what makes everything work.

00:00:21.672 --> 00:00:23.543
What exactly is feedback?

00:00:23.543 --> 00:00:27.831
The key element, whether in sound,
the environment or social science,

00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:31.392
is a phenomenon called
mutual causal interaction,

00:00:31.392 --> 00:00:36.106
where x affects y, y affects x, and so on,

00:00:36.106 --> 00:00:39.822
creating an ongoing process called 
a feedback loop.

00:00:39.822 --> 00:00:42.664
And the natural world is full 
of these mechanisms

00:00:42.664 --> 00:00:46.171
formed by the links between living 
and nonliving things

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:49.347
that build resilience by governing 
the way populations

00:00:49.347 --> 00:00:52.432
and food webs respond to events.

00:00:52.432 --> 00:00:57.767
When plants die, the dead material
enriches the soil with humus,

00:00:57.767 --> 00:01:01.836
a stable mass of organic matter,
providing moisture and nutrients

00:01:01.836 --> 00:01:04.019
for other plants to grow.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.545
The more plants grow and die,
the more humus is produced,

00:01:07.545 --> 00:01:10.722
allowing even more plants to grow,
and so on.

00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:13.421
This is an example of positive feedback,

00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:16.694
an essential force
in the buildup of ecosystems.

00:01:16.694 --> 00:01:20.009
But it's not called positive feedback
because it's beneficial.

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.146
Rather, it is positive because it amplifies
a particular effect or change

00:01:24.146 --> 00:01:26.185
from previous conditions.

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:30.149
These positive, or amplifying, loops
can also be harmful,

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.609
like when removing a forest 
makes it vulnerable to erosion,

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:36.522
which removes organic matter
and nutrients from the earth,

00:01:36.522 --> 00:01:41.502
leaving less plants to anchor the soil,
and leading to more erosion.

00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:46.622
In contrast, negative feedback diminishes
or counteracts changes in an ecosystem

00:01:46.622 --> 00:01:49.698
to maintain a more stable balance.

00:01:49.698 --> 00:01:51.969
Consider predators and their prey.

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.930
When lynx eat snowshoe hares,
they reduce their population,

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.845
but this drop in the lynx's food source will
soon cause their own population to decline,

00:02:00.845 --> 00:02:05.785
reducing the predation rate and allowing 
the hare population to increase again.

00:02:05.785 --> 00:02:09.278
The ongoing cycle creates an up and down
wavelike pattern,

00:02:09.278 --> 00:02:14.865
maintaining a long-term equilibrium and
allowing a food chain to persist over time.

00:02:14.865 --> 00:02:18.344
Feedback processes might seem
counterintuitive because many of us

00:02:18.344 --> 00:02:22.434
are used to more predictable linear
scenarios of cause and effect.

00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:24.437
For instance, it seems simple enough that

00:02:24.437 --> 00:02:29.209
spraying pesticides would help plants grow
by killing pest insects,

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.882
but it may trigger a host of other
unexpected reactions.

00:02:32.882 --> 00:02:36.764
For example, if spraying pushes down
the insect population,

00:02:36.764 --> 00:02:38.835
its predators will have less food.

00:02:38.835 --> 00:02:40.421
As their population dips,

00:02:40.421 --> 00:02:44.487
the reduced predation would allow the
insect population to rise,

00:02:44.487 --> 00:02:47.289
counteracting the effects of 
our pesticides.

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:51.743
Note that each feedback is
the product of the links in the loop.

00:02:51.743 --> 00:02:56.581
Add one negative link and it will
reverse the feedback force entirely,

00:02:56.581 --> 00:03:01.777
and one weak link will reduce the
effect of the entire feedback considerably.

00:03:01.777 --> 00:03:05.011
Lose a link, and the whole loop is broken.

00:03:05.011 --> 00:03:06.850
But this is only a simple example,

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.283
since natural communities consist not 
of separate food chains,

00:03:10.283 --> 00:03:12.619
but networks of interactions.

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:17.073
Feedback loops will often be indirect,
occurring through longer chains.

00:03:17.073 --> 00:03:21.516
A food web containing twenty populations
can generate thousands of loops

00:03:21.516 --> 00:03:23.680
of up to twenty links in length.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.448
But instead of forming a disordered 
cacophany,

00:03:26.448 --> 00:03:30.059
feedback loops in ecological systems
play together,

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:33.059
creating regular patterns
just like multiple instruments,

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:37.237
coming together to create a complex
but harmonious piece of music.

00:03:37.237 --> 00:03:41.183
Wide-ranging negative feedbacks
keep the positive feedbacks in check,

00:03:41.183 --> 00:03:43.878
like drums maintaining a rhythm.

00:03:43.878 --> 00:03:47.678
You can look at the way a particular
ecosystem functions within its unique habitat

00:03:47.678 --> 00:03:51.157
as representing its trademark sound.

00:03:51.157 --> 00:03:54.872
Ocean environments dominated 
by predator-prey interactions,

00:03:54.872 --> 00:03:59.347
and strong negative and positive loops
stabilized by self-damping feedback,

00:03:59.347 --> 00:04:03.744
are powerful and loud,
with many oscillations.

00:04:03.744 --> 00:04:07.416
Desert ecosystems, where the 
turn over of biomass is slow,

00:04:07.416 --> 00:04:12.869
and the weak feedbacks loops through dead
matter are more like a constant drone.

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:16.146
And the tropical rainforest,
with its great diversity of species,

00:04:16.146 --> 00:04:21.412
high nutrient turnover, and strong feedbacks
among both living and dead matter,

00:04:21.412 --> 00:04:24.320
is like a lush panoply of sounds.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.074
Despite their stabilizing effects,

00:04:26.074 --> 00:04:31.247
many of these habitats and their 
ecosystems develop and change over time,

00:04:31.247 --> 00:04:33.614
as do the harmonies they create.

00:04:33.614 --> 00:04:37.437
Deforestation may turn lush tropics
into a barren patch,

00:04:37.437 --> 00:04:41.982
like a successful ensemble breaking up
after losing its star performers.

00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:46.234
But an abandoned patch of farmland
may also become a forest over time,

00:04:46.234 --> 00:04:51.184
like a garage band growing into
a magnificent orchestra.
