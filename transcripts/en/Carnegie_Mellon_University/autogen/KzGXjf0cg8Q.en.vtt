correct new policies though we do it's
 

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.980
correct new policies though we do it's
also that we need everyone at the table

you see as their regulatory hurdles to

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:13.740
you see as their regulatory hurdles to
 

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.860
you see as their regulatory hurdles to
achieve your vision particularly with

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:15.870
achieve your vision particularly with
 

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:19.970
achieve your vision particularly with
micro grids yeah well there's many many

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:19.980
micro grids yeah well there's many many
 

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:23.330
micro grids yeah well there's many many
regulatory hurdles out there so one of

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:23.340
regulatory hurdles out there so one of
 

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.789
regulatory hurdles out there so one of
the challenges that we have is being

00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:25.799
the challenges that we have is being
 

00:31:25.799 --> 00:31:29.350
the challenges that we have is being
innovative and taking innovative steps

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360
innovative and taking innovative steps
 

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:33.740
innovative and taking innovative steps
when you know the current regulatory

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:33.750
when you know the current regulatory
 

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:37.310
when you know the current regulatory
model you know really and the law really

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:37.320
model you know really and the law really
 

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.380
model you know really and the law really
sort of constrains what you can invest

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:39.390
sort of constrains what you can invest
 

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:41.600
sort of constrains what you can invest
in as an electric utility so for

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:41.610
in as an electric utility so for
 

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:44.120
in as an electric utility so for
instance the micro grid isn't precisely

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:44.130
instance the micro grid isn't precisely
 

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:46.760
instance the micro grid isn't precisely
within the four corners of the law in

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:46.770
within the four corners of the law in
 

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:48.889
within the four corners of the law in
terms of what were permitted to do

00:31:48.889 --> 00:31:48.899
terms of what were permitted to do
 

00:31:48.899 --> 00:31:51.080
terms of what were permitted to do
there's some questions about generation

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:51.090
there's some questions about generation
 

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:52.789
there's some questions about generation
ownership there's some questions we have

00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799
ownership there's some questions we have
 

00:31:52.799 --> 00:31:55.310
ownership there's some questions we have
battery storage in there you know what

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:55.320
battery storage in there you know what
 

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.899
battery storage in there you know what
is the role of battery storage is at

00:31:56.899 --> 00:31:56.909
is the role of battery storage is at
 

00:31:56.909 --> 00:31:58.820
is the role of battery storage is at
generation is it distribution can the

00:31:58.820 --> 00:31:58.830
generation is it distribution can the
 

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:00.500
generation is it distribution can the
utility own it we're a restructured

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:00.510
utility own it we're a restructured
 

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:02.450
utility own it we're a restructured
state so the question of generation

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:02.460
state so the question of generation
 

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:05.419
state so the question of generation
ownership is always there so it's you

00:32:05.419 --> 00:32:05.429
ownership is always there so it's you
 

00:32:05.429 --> 00:32:07.130
ownership is always there so it's you
know probably a twenty five million

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:07.140
know probably a twenty five million
 

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.200
know probably a twenty five million
dollar project at the end of the day and

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:09.210
dollar project at the end of the day and
 

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:11.990
dollar project at the end of the day and
the question is are you willing to place

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000
the question is are you willing to place
 

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.529
the question is are you willing to place
that bet without knowing that you'll

00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:15.539
that bet without knowing that you'll
 

00:32:15.539 --> 00:32:17.450
that bet without knowing that you'll
actually recover those costs when you go

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:17.460
actually recover those costs when you go
 

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.850
actually recover those costs when you go
into the regulatory agency with your

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:19.860
into the regulatory agency with your
 

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:24.200
into the regulatory agency with your
rate case or do you want to sort of

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:24.210
rate case or do you want to sort of
 

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:27.440
rate case or do you want to sort of
carve a regulatory path to get some sort

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:27.450
carve a regulatory path to get some sort
 

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:29.630
carve a regulatory path to get some sort
of pre-approval that will very much slow

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:29.640
of pre-approval that will very much slow
 

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.260
of pre-approval that will very much slow
you down

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:30.270
you down
 

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.360
you down
so this micro grid we've been working on

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:32.370
so this micro grid we've been working on
 

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:34.430
so this micro grid we've been working on
for about three years

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440
for about three years
 

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.310
for about three years
we made an attempt to set up legislation

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.320
we made an attempt to set up legislation
 

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.350
we made an attempt to set up legislation
that would allow us to build micro grids

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360
that would allow us to build micro grids
 

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.019
that would allow us to build micro grids
that did work so we went to the

00:32:42.019 --> 00:32:42.029
that did work so we went to the
 

00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:44.389
that did work so we went to the
regulator and we actually got approval

00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399
regulator and we actually got approval
 

00:32:44.399 --> 00:32:47.269
regulator and we actually got approval
for this just in February so you know

00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279
for this just in February so you know
 

00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:48.169
for this just in February so you know
one of the hurdles

00:32:48.169 --> 00:32:48.179
one of the hurdles
 

00:32:48.179 --> 00:32:51.799
one of the hurdles
is how do you till ''tis engage in

00:32:51.799 --> 00:32:51.809
is how do you till ''tis engage in
 

00:32:51.809 --> 00:32:55.100
is how do you till ''tis engage in
innovative and experimental projects

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:55.110
innovative and experimental projects
 

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:57.769
innovative and experimental projects
when the law is not designed to

00:32:57.769 --> 00:32:57.779
when the law is not designed to
 

00:32:57.779 --> 00:32:59.509
when the law is not designed to
accommodate that and you're always doing

00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519
accommodate that and you're always doing
 

00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:01.609
accommodate that and you're always doing
that at risk and I think you know we

00:33:01.609 --> 00:33:01.619
that at risk and I think you know we
 

00:33:01.619 --> 00:33:03.139
that at risk and I think you know we
understand that we're pushing the

00:33:03.139 --> 00:33:03.149
understand that we're pushing the
 

00:33:03.149 --> 00:33:04.549
understand that we're pushing the
envelope and there's a certain amount of

00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559
envelope and there's a certain amount of
 

00:33:04.559 --> 00:33:07.249
envelope and there's a certain amount of
risk that we're willing to take but many

00:33:07.249 --> 00:33:07.259
risk that we're willing to take but many
 

00:33:07.259 --> 00:33:08.869
risk that we're willing to take but many
of these projects are going to be quite

00:33:08.869 --> 00:33:08.879
of these projects are going to be quite
 

00:33:08.879 --> 00:33:10.549
of these projects are going to be quite
expensive we just have a very expensive

00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559
expensive we just have a very expensive
 

00:33:10.559 --> 00:33:12.350
expensive we just have a very expensive
business the infrastructure is not cheap

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360
business the infrastructure is not cheap
 

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.629
business the infrastructure is not cheap
and so how much risk are you willing to

00:33:14.629 --> 00:33:14.639
and so how much risk are you willing to
 

00:33:14.639 --> 00:33:17.269
and so how much risk are you willing to
take is you know is always a question

00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279
take is you know is always a question
 

00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:19.789
take is you know is always a question
and so that's one of the ways we've

00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:19.799
and so that's one of the ways we've
 

00:33:19.799 --> 00:33:22.879
and so that's one of the ways we've
tried to solve it we one of the things

00:33:22.879 --> 00:33:22.889
tried to solve it we one of the things
 

00:33:22.889 --> 00:33:25.879
tried to solve it we one of the things
we were able to do about a year ago at

00:33:25.879 --> 00:33:25.889
we were able to do about a year ago at
 

00:33:25.889 --> 00:33:27.739
we were able to do about a year ago at
the legislature was we took energy

00:33:27.739 --> 00:33:27.749
the legislature was we took energy
 

00:33:27.749 --> 00:33:31.749

well basically if we spend a dollar on

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:36.330
well basically if we spend a dollar on
 

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:39.080
well basically if we spend a dollar on
energy efficiency we recover a dollar so

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:39.090
energy efficiency we recover a dollar so
 

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:41.180

it's just a pass-through we turned it

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:41.190
it's just a pass-through we turned it
 

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:43.580
it's just a pass-through we turned it
into an earnings opportunity which in

the ever-increasing transportation
electrification yeah we are working on

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:14.060
electrification yeah we are working on
 

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:16.030
electrification yeah we are working on
that I would say we're you know there

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.040
that I would say we're you know there
 

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.490
that I would say we're you know there
are probably places and utilities around

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:18.500
are probably places and utilities around
 

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.109
are probably places and utilities around
the country that are a little bit ahead

00:38:20.109 --> 00:38:20.119
the country that are a little bit ahead
 

00:38:20.119 --> 00:38:22.000
the country that are a little bit ahead
of us on that I think California has a

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:22.010
of us on that I think California has a
 

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:24.550
of us on that I think California has a
lot going on with charging stations the

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560
lot going on with charging stations the
 

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.290
lot going on with charging stations the
utilities in general have been very

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:26.300
utilities in general have been very
 

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.150
utilities in general have been very
focused on building charging stations

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160
focused on building charging stations
 

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.490
focused on building charging stations
and the reason for that is the way we

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:30.500
and the reason for that is the way we
 

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:32.950
and the reason for that is the way we
make money is by building infrastructure

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960
make money is by building infrastructure
 

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.230
make money is by building infrastructure
we put iron in the ground we go to the

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:35.240
we put iron in the ground we go to the
 

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.120
we put iron in the ground we go to the
regulator we pass it through a rate case

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:37.130
regulator we pass it through a rate case
 

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:38.890
regulator we pass it through a rate case
and we earn a return on it so anytime

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:38.900
and we earn a return on it so anytime
 

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:40.750
and we earn a return on it so anytime
you can put iron in the ground and your

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:40.760
you can put iron in the ground and your
 

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.240
you can put iron in the ground and your
utility it's a good thing I frankly

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:43.250
utility it's a good thing I frankly
 

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:45.220
utility it's a good thing I frankly
don't think that charging infrastructure

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:45.230
don't think that charging infrastructure
 

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:47.950
don't think that charging infrastructure
is where where the game is at on

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:47.960
is where where the game is at on
 

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.260
is where where the game is at on
electric transportation I think there's

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:50.270
electric transportation I think there's
 

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:53.829
electric transportation I think there's
so many more interesting questions in

00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839
so many more interesting questions in
 

00:38:53.839 --> 00:38:57.579
so many more interesting questions in
you know the network aspects of it both

00:38:57.579 --> 00:38:57.589
you know the network aspects of it both
 

00:38:57.589 --> 00:39:00.070
you know the network aspects of it both
in terms of how does a person from

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:00.080
in terms of how does a person from
 

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.720
in terms of how does a person from
California who's driving across the

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:01.730
California who's driving across the
 

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:03.460
California who's driving across the
country and gets into your service

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:03.470
country and gets into your service
 

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:07.690
country and gets into your service
territory get charged and you know it's

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:07.700
territory get charged and you know it's
 

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.150
territory get charged and you know it's
almost like an ATM network how does that

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160
almost like an ATM network how does that
 

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.099
almost like an ATM network how does that
work so I think that's a question that

00:39:12.099 --> 00:39:12.109
work so I think that's a question that
 

00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:13.450
work so I think that's a question that
we have to solve that's very interesting

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:13.460
we have to solve that's very interesting
 

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:15.760
we have to solve that's very interesting
and will require both competitive

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:15.770
and will require both competitive
 

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:19.599
and will require both competitive
companies and the you utility and then I

00:39:19.599 --> 00:39:19.609
companies and the you utility and then I
 

00:39:19.609 --> 00:39:21.250
companies and the you utility and then I
think the other really interesting

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:21.260
think the other really interesting
 

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:22.570
think the other really interesting
question around electric transportation

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:22.580
question around electric transportation
 

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:25.060
question around electric transportation
is when you've got when you're

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:25.070
is when you've got when you're
 

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:27.250
is when you've got when you're
managing a distribution grid and you've

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:27.260
managing a distribution grid and you've
 

00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:29.230
managing a distribution grid and you've
got generation inside the distribution

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:29.240
got generation inside the distribution
 

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.290
got generation inside the distribution
grid and it's very volatile and you've

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:32.300
grid and it's very volatile and you've
 

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.570
grid and it's very volatile and you've
got people buying and selling and you're

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:34.580
got people buying and selling and you're
 

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:38.550
got people buying and selling and you're
really managing a much more dynamic grid

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560
really managing a much more dynamic grid
 

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:42.700
really managing a much more dynamic grid
the questions of how you the contracts

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:42.710
the questions of how you the contracts
 

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:45.610
the questions of how you the contracts
that you create with vehicle owners how

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:45.620
that you create with vehicle owners how
 

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:48.970
that you create with vehicle owners how
you draw on their energy or ask them to

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:48.980
you draw on their energy or ask them to
 

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:50.710
you draw on their energy or ask them to
back off and pay them for demand

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720
back off and pay them for demand
 

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.900
back off and pay them for demand
management all those questions of how

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:52.910
management all those questions of how
 

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:56.320
management all those questions of how
you manage the system in that in that

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:56.330
you manage the system in that in that
 

00:39:56.330 --> 00:39:57.910
you manage the system in that in that
kind of scenario a lot of which will be

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920
kind of scenario a lot of which will be
 

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.550
kind of scenario a lot of which will be
automated are are interesting questions

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560
automated are are interesting questions
 

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:01.600
automated are are interesting questions
in my mind

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:01.610
in my mind
 

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:03.310
in my mind
we're working with environmental groups

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:03.320
we're working with environmental groups
 

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.790
we're working with environmental groups
in Illinois right now to to try to look

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800
in Illinois right now to to try to look
 

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.130
in Illinois right now to to try to look
at electric transportation and think

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:09.140
at electric transportation and think
 

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.290
at electric transportation and think
about how we can jumpstart that for the

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:11.300
about how we can jumpstart that for the
 

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:12.760
about how we can jumpstart that for the
future but I think we're probably a

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:12.770
future but I think we're probably a
 

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:15.070
future but I think we're probably a
couple steps behind some other places on

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:15.080
couple steps behind some other places on
 

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:18.190
couple steps behind some other places on
that so a good question from a

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.200
that so a good question from a
 

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:24.190
that so a good question from a
university what kind of skills are you

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:24.200
university what kind of skills are you
 

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.720
university what kind of skills are you
looking for in your future employees

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:27.730
looking for in your future employees
 

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:31.720
looking for in your future employees
yeah that's a great question so we

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:31.730
yeah that's a great question so we
 

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:33.520
yeah that's a great question so we
definitely need technical skills

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:33.530
definitely need technical skills
 

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:35.500
definitely need technical skills
obviously there's a lot of Technology

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:35.510
obviously there's a lot of Technology
 

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:39.610
obviously there's a lot of Technology
here but we need people who can combine

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:39.620
here but we need people who can combine
 

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:42.460
here but we need people who can combine
that with you know sort of creative

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:42.470
that with you know sort of creative
 

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:44.470
that with you know sort of creative
thinking skills I mean you almost want a

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480
thinking skills I mean you almost want a
 

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.880
thinking skills I mean you almost want a
little bit of Liberal Arts and a little

bit of Technology
 

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:49.990
bit of Technology
you know blend it in I need people who

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000
you know blend it in I need people who

can be agile and nimble who can think
about you know playing a role on one

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:54.170
about you know playing a role on one
 

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:56.680
about you know playing a role on one
team one day and then you know a couple

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:56.690
team one day and then you know a couple
 

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:59.140
team one day and then you know a couple
months later shifting to another team

00:40:59.140 --> 00:40:59.150
months later shifting to another team
 

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:01.030

and playing a different kind of role and

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040
and playing a different kind of role and
 

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.640
and playing a different kind of role and
so people who know how to be

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:02.650
so people who know how to be
 

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:04.900
so people who know how to be
collaborators and followers and leaders

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:04.910
collaborators and followers and leaders
 

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:07.720
collaborators and followers and leaders
when needed people who can be technical

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:07.730
when needed people who can be technical
 

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:10.930
when needed people who can be technical
but also can be you know creative and

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:10.940
but also can be you know creative and
 

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:13.330
but also can be you know creative and
see the you know human and you know

00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:13.340
see the you know human and you know
 

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:16.360
see the you know human and you know
community side of things as well and the

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:16.370
community side of things as well and the
 

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:18.580
community side of things as well and the
impacts of their technology so it's

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:18.590
impacts of their technology so it's
 

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:20.860
impacts of their technology so it's
really interdisciplinary and again you

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:20.870
really interdisciplinary and again you
 

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:23.440
really interdisciplinary and again you
know I give you know Laurie and Carnegie

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:23.450
know I give you know Laurie and Carnegie
 

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:25.840
know I give you know Laurie and Carnegie
Mellon a lot of credit for you know

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:25.850
Mellon a lot of credit for you know
 

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:27.360
Mellon a lot of credit for you know
looking at this question

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:27.370
looking at this question
 

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:28.960
looking at this question
cross-functionally because that's the

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:28.970
cross-functionally because that's the
 

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:30.490
cross-functionally because that's the
way we're trying to solve it I'm

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:30.500
way we're trying to solve it I'm
 

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.260
way we're trying to solve it I'm
actually at a conversation with Laurie

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:32.270
actually at a conversation with Laurie
 

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:35.660
actually at a conversation with Laurie
earlier today about inside the company

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:35.670
earlier today about inside the company
 

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:37.520
earlier today about inside the company
yeah utilities are really really

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:37.530
yeah utilities are really really
 

00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:42.410
yeah utilities are really really
hierarchical and they're very structured

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:42.420
hierarchical and they're very structured
 

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:44.510
hierarchical and they're very structured
very linearly so you have your

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520
very linearly so you have your
 

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.100
very linearly so you have your
engineering lane and you have your

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:46.110
engineering lane and you have your
 

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:48.260
engineering lane and you have your
economists and you have your lawyers and

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:48.270
economists and you have your lawyers and
 

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:50.000
economists and you have your lawyers and
you have your finance people and they

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:50.010
you have your finance people and they
 

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:52.160
you have your finance people and they
haven't traditionally talked much to

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:52.170
haven't traditionally talked much to
 

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:52.640
haven't traditionally talked much to
each other

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:52.650
each other
 

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:54.950
each other
and so I'm throwing them all into the

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960
and so I'm throwing them all into the
 

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.390
and so I'm throwing them all into the
same room and telling them that they got

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400
same room and telling them that they got
 

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.430
same room and telling them that they got
to figure this out together and it's

00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:58.440
to figure this out together and it's
 

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.460
to figure this out together and it's
very interesting it's very interesting

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:01.470
very interesting it's very interesting
 

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:05.230
very interesting it's very interesting
but I need people who can talk across

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:05.240
but I need people who can talk across
 

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.850
but I need people who can talk across
different functions and can kind of work

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:07.860
different functions and can kind of work
 

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:09.620
different functions and can kind of work
in those kind of teams because a team I

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:09.630
in those kind of teams because a team I
 

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:11.720
in those kind of teams because a team I
have together today in a couple months

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:11.730
have together today in a couple months
 

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:13.880
have together today in a couple months
it'll be a different team some of them

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:13.890
it'll be a different team some of them
 

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:15.230
it'll be a different team some of them
will be the same but I'll throw some new

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240
will be the same but I'll throw some new
 

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.420
will be the same but I'll throw some new
people in there so this ability to kind

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:17.430
people in there so this ability to kind
 

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:20.210
people in there so this ability to kind
of shape-shift and morph and evolve

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:20.220
of shape-shift and morph and evolve
 

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:23.390
of shape-shift and morph and evolve
and you know play different roles is is

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:23.400
and you know play different roles is is
 

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.670
and you know play different roles is is
is is a big piece of what the future

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680
is is a big piece of what the future
 

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:29.630
is is a big piece of what the future
will require I think in our companies we

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640
will require I think in our companies we
 

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:35.540
will require I think in our companies we
always need good engineers with the law

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:35.550
always need good engineers with the law
 

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:37.550
always need good engineers with the law
limiting your business in some ways

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:37.560
limiting your business in some ways
 

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:40.100
limiting your business in some ways
how can startups engage with you are you

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:40.110
how can startups engage with you are you
 

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:44.710
how can startups engage with you are you
able to invest in innovative startups

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720
able to invest in innovative startups
 

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.820
able to invest in innovative startups
yes oh I'll come at that question a

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:46.830
yes oh I'll come at that question a
 

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:48.710
yes oh I'll come at that question a
couple different ways one is so we're

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720
couple different ways one is so we're
 

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:51.430
couple different ways one is so we're
part of a larger holding company exelon

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.440
part of a larger holding company exelon
 

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.730
part of a larger holding company exelon
exelon has five utilities and in a very

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:55.740
exelon has five utilities and in a very
 

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:57.980
exelon has five utilities and in a very
large generation company and so there's

00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:57.990
large generation company and so there's
 

00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:00.500
large generation company and so there's
exelon actually which has more of a

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:00.510
exelon actually which has more of a
 

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:02.300
exelon actually which has more of a
competitive side as well as a regulated

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:02.310
competitive side as well as a regulated
 

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:06.800
competitive side as well as a regulated
side actually does invest in in in

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:06.810
side actually does invest in in in
 

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:08.570
side actually does invest in in in
start-up companies so that usually that

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:08.580
start-up companies so that usually that
 

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:10.970
start-up companies so that usually that
comes through the exelon realm not so

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:10.980
comes through the exelon realm not so
 

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:13.310
comes through the exelon realm not so
much the regulated utility realm but

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:13.320
much the regulated utility realm but
 

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.020
much the regulated utility realm but
here's how I think we we think about

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:15.030
here's how I think we we think about
 

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:17.270
here's how I think we we think about
engaging with startups and third-party

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280
engaging with startups and third-party
 

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.280
engaging with startups and third-party
companies I talked about the platform

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:19.290
companies I talked about the platform
 

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:21.500
companies I talked about the platform
model in the four layers that we've kind

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:21.510
model in the four layers that we've kind
 

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:24.740
model in the four layers that we've kind
of you know identified that we're trying

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:24.750
of you know identified that we're trying
 

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:26.690
of you know identified that we're trying
to work through and when I talked about

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:26.700
to work through and when I talked about
 

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:28.970
to work through and when I talked about
it I talked about the first layer being

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:28.980
it I talked about the first layer being
 

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:30.530
it I talked about the first layer being
really the infrastructure layer that's

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:30.540
really the infrastructure layer that's
 

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.390
really the infrastructure layer that's
kind of where we live today and that's

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400
kind of where we live today and that's
 

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.580
kind of where we live today and that's
probably where I think the utility lives

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:34.590
probably where I think the utility lives
 

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:36.470
probably where I think the utility lives
for a long time in the future planning

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480
for a long time in the future planning
 

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.830
for a long time in the future planning
and operating similarly I think you know

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:39.840
and operating similarly I think you know
 

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.540
and operating similarly I think you know
you probably want your utility to do

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:41.550
you probably want your utility to do
 

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:43.430
you probably want your utility to do
that when you get to layer 3 and you

00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440
that when you get to layer 3 and you
 

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.530
that when you get to layer 3 and you
start thinking about energy transactions

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:45.540
start thinking about energy transactions
 

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.660
start thinking about energy transactions
and you get to layer 4 and you start

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:47.670
and you get to layer 4 and you start
 

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:48.400
and you get to layer 4 and you start
thinking about

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:48.410
thinking about
 

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:51.700
thinking about
services transactions then I think you

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:51.710
services transactions then I think you
 

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:53.920
services transactions then I think you
start to bring in third parties because

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:53.930
start to bring in third parties because
 

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:55.990
start to bring in third parties because
that's not especially in a restructured

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000
that's not especially in a restructured
 

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.180
that's not especially in a restructured
state like Illinois we run wires and

00:43:58.180 --> 00:43:58.190
state like Illinois we run wires and
 

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:00.910
state like Illinois we run wires and
poles we don't run generation we're not

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:00.920
poles we don't run generation we're not
 

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.040
poles we don't run generation we're not
going to be involved in most of those

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:03.050
going to be involved in most of those
 

00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:04.600
going to be involved in most of those
transactions it's going we're going to

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:04.610
transactions it's going we're going to
 

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:06.700
transactions it's going we're going to
facilitate them as a platform kind of an

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:06.710
facilitate them as a platform kind of an
 

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:09.490
facilitate them as a platform kind of an
ebay we connect buyers and sellers but

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:09.500
ebay we connect buyers and sellers but
 

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:13.180
ebay we connect buyers and sellers but
we're not the buyer or the seller for

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:13.190
we're not the buyer or the seller for
 

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:14.680
we're not the buyer or the seller for
the most part and so I think that's how

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:14.690
the most part and so I think that's how
 

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:16.390
the most part and so I think that's how
we think about bringing in the

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400
we think about bringing in the
 

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.460
we think about bringing in the
innovation that small companies that

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:18.470
innovation that small companies that
 

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:21.610
innovation that small companies that
startups that new you know fresh views

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:21.620
startups that new you know fresh views
 

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:24.190
startups that new you know fresh views
of the industry can bring as well as

00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:24.200
of the industry can bring as well as
 

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.500
of the industry can bring as well as
sort of maintaining the stability and

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:26.510
sort of maintaining the stability and
 

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:28.990
sort of maintaining the stability and
and doing what we do best

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.000
and doing what we do best
 

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.020
and doing what we do best
we have a marketplace right now it's

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:32.030
we have a marketplace right now it's
 

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:34.600
we have a marketplace right now it's
basically an internet marketplace but

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:34.610
basically an internet marketplace but
 

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:36.040
basically an internet marketplace but
it's a little bit of an experiment that

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:36.050
it's a little bit of an experiment that
 

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:37.990
it's a little bit of an experiment that
we're doing we've had enough of maybe a

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.000
we're doing we've had enough of maybe a
 

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
we're doing we've had enough of maybe a
year and a half now we've got smart

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:40.010
year and a half now we've got smart
 

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:41.860
year and a half now we've got smart
thermostats that we sell on it again

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:41.870
thermostats that we sell on it again
 

00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:44.260
thermostats that we sell on it again
it's not we don't make smart thermostats

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:44.270
it's not we don't make smart thermostats
 

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:47.350
it's not we don't make smart thermostats
but nest does and others do ecobee and

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:47.360
but nest does and others do ecobee and
 

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:51.220
but nest does and others do ecobee and
so we sell those smart thermostats

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:51.230
so we sell those smart thermostats
 

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:53.290
so we sell those smart thermostats
across the marketplace we're evolving

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:53.300
across the marketplace we're evolving
 

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.350
across the marketplace we're evolving
the marketplace we expect to see solar

00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:55.360
the marketplace we expect to see solar
 

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:58.510
the marketplace we expect to see solar
start to emerge in numbers probably

00:44:58.510 --> 00:44:58.520
start to emerge in numbers probably
 

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.480
start to emerge in numbers probably
fourth quarter this year and we're

00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:01.490
fourth quarter this year and we're
 

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:03.700
fourth quarter this year and we're
putting together a solar services

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:03.710
putting together a solar services
 

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:06.310
putting together a solar services
platform so if you're thinking about

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:06.320
platform so if you're thinking about
 

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.680
platform so if you're thinking about
purchasing solar you can come onto our

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:08.690
purchasing solar you can come onto our
 

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:10.300
purchasing solar you can come onto our
platform we'll pull down your usage

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:10.310
platform we'll pull down your usage
 

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:12.310
platform we'll pull down your usage
we'll take a google shot of your home

00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:12.320
we'll take a google shot of your home
 

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:15.520
we'll take a google shot of your home
we'll give you the economics of running

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:15.530
we'll give you the economics of running
 

00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:17.650
we'll give you the economics of running
solar off of your home if that's not

00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:17.660
solar off of your home if that's not
 

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:19.420
solar off of your home if that's not
feasible we can give you the economics

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:19.430
feasible we can give you the economics
 

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:21.370
feasible we can give you the economics
of a share in a community solar program

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:21.380
of a share in a community solar program
 

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:23.890
of a share in a community solar program
and where you might find that similarly

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:23.900
and where you might find that similarly
 

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:25.270
and where you might find that similarly
once you make the investment in solar

00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280
once you make the investment in solar
 

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.980
once you make the investment in solar
we'll have a tracker that allows you to

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:26.990
we'll have a tracker that allows you to
 

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:29.950
we'll have a tracker that allows you to
track the economics the payback etc so

00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:29.960
track the economics the payback etc so
 

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.960
track the economics the payback etc so
this is you know sort of the the

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:31.970
this is you know sort of the the
 

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:34.630
this is you know sort of the the
services platform again some of which I

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640
services platform again some of which I
 

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.340
services platform again some of which I
think we can provide because we can do

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:36.350
think we can provide because we can do
 

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:39.010
think we can provide because we can do
that efficiently and some of which will

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:39.020
that efficiently and some of which will
 

00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:40.510
that efficiently and some of which will
have third parties brought in and that's

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:40.520
have third parties brought in and that's
 

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.190
have third parties brought in and that's
how I think we'll connect at the utility

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:42.200
how I think we'll connect at the utility
 

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:45.940
how I think we'll connect at the utility
level the next question how can

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:45.950
level the next question how can
 

00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:49.120
level the next question how can
universities help utilities the most to

the legal entanglements of regulation

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:22.820
the legal entanglements of regulation
 

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:25.300
the legal entanglements of regulation
and you know when I got the headhunter

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:25.310
and you know when I got the headhunter
 

00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:27.370
and you know when I got the headhunter
call I liked practicing antitrust law I

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:27.380
call I liked practicing antitrust law I
 

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:28.120
call I liked practicing antitrust law I
thought it was great

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:28.130
thought it was great
 

00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:31.079
thought it was great
but I thought this is really the last

00:47:31.079 --> 00:47:31.089
but I thought this is really the last
 

00:47:31.089 --> 00:47:33.940
but I thought this is really the last
sort of fully economically regulated

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:33.950
sort of fully economically regulated
 

00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:35.800
sort of fully economically regulated
industry obviously regulation hits most

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:35.810
industry obviously regulation hits most
 

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:37.390
industry obviously regulation hits most
industries in many different ways but

00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:37.400
industries in many different ways but
 

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.900
industries in many different ways but
fully economically regulated industry

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:40.910
fully economically regulated industry
 

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:42.250
fully economically regulated industry
this was the last one to go through

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:42.260
this was the last one to go through
 

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:45.630
this was the last one to go through
restructuring you know Airlines had gone

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:45.640
restructuring you know Airlines had gone
 

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:50.140
restructuring you know Airlines had gone
telecommunications trucking and and and

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:50.150
telecommunications trucking and and and
 

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:51.460
telecommunications trucking and and and
you know you got you're sitting here

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:51.470
you know you got you're sitting here
 

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:52.720
you know you got you're sitting here
with the electric industry and you're

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:52.730
with the electric industry and you're
 

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:54.550
with the electric industry and you're
left with it and I thought it's just a

00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:54.560
left with it and I thought it's just a
 

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:57.130
left with it and I thought it's just a
great opportunity you know for an

00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:57.140
great opportunity you know for an
 

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:59.079
great opportunity you know for an
intellectual challenge and I never ever

00:47:59.079 --> 00:47:59.089
intellectual challenge and I never ever
 

00:47:59.089 --> 00:48:02.170
intellectual challenge and I never ever
thought I'd end up here I just thought I

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:02.180
thought I'd end up here I just thought I
 

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:03.220
thought I'd end up here I just thought I
was going to have a great time

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:03.230
was going to have a great time
 

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:05.329
was going to have a great time
practicing law in this

00:48:05.329 --> 00:48:05.339
practicing law in this
 

00:48:05.339 --> 00:48:07.940
practicing law in this
realm of untangling you know a

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:07.950
realm of untangling you know a
 

00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:10.789
realm of untangling you know a
hundred-year network of regulation in a

00:48:10.789 --> 00:48:10.799
hundred-year network of regulation in a
 

00:48:10.799 --> 00:48:13.339
hundred-year network of regulation in a
way that would allow markets to work and

00:48:13.339 --> 00:48:13.349
way that would allow markets to work and
 

00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:15.979
way that would allow markets to work and
provide benefits you know to consumers

00:48:15.979 --> 00:48:15.989
provide benefits you know to consumers
 

00:48:15.989 --> 00:48:18.140
provide benefits you know to consumers
at the end of the day so that's why I

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:18.150
at the end of the day so that's why I
 

00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:22.999
at the end of the day so that's why I
jumped alright so the last question what

00:48:22.999 --> 00:48:23.009
jumped alright so the last question what
 

00:48:23.009 --> 00:48:24.920
jumped alright so the last question what
is your strategy for handling the data

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:24.930
is your strategy for handling the data
 

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:27.200
is your strategy for handling the data
coming from new technologies and what

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:27.210
coming from new technologies and what
 

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:29.329
coming from new technologies and what
role do you see machine learning

00:48:29.329 --> 00:48:29.339
role do you see machine learning
 

00:48:29.339 --> 00:48:32.120
role do you see machine learning
techniques playing for tackling Grid

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:32.130
techniques playing for tackling Grid
 

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:36.650
techniques playing for tackling Grid
problems yeah I think so yeah data is a

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:36.660
problems yeah I think so yeah data is a
 

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:38.930
problems yeah I think so yeah data is a
is a huge question that is really you

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:38.940
is a huge question that is really you
 

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:40.940
is a huge question that is really you
know sort of underlies everything here

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:40.950
know sort of underlies everything here
 

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:43.339
know sort of underlies everything here
and there's a lot of work to be done

00:48:43.339 --> 00:48:43.349
and there's a lot of work to be done
 

00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:46.880
and there's a lot of work to be done
there so on the one hand we need data we

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:46.890
there so on the one hand we need data we
 

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:50.749
there so on the one hand we need data we
need to figure out how we use data for

00:48:50.749 --> 00:48:50.759
need to figure out how we use data for
 

00:48:50.759 --> 00:48:53.150
need to figure out how we use data for
operational purposes there is so much

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.160
operational purposes there is so much
 

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.039
operational purposes there is so much
opportunity to more be more efficient

00:48:55.039 --> 00:48:55.049
opportunity to more be more efficient
 

00:48:55.049 --> 00:48:58.249
opportunity to more be more efficient
operationally I mean we literally still

00:48:58.249 --> 00:48:58.259
operationally I mean we literally still
 

00:48:58.259 --> 00:49:03.349
operationally I mean we literally still
do you know our maintenance you know you

00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359
do you know our maintenance you know you
 

00:49:03.359 --> 00:49:05.390
do you know our maintenance you know you
know time-based maintenance every couple

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:05.400
know time-based maintenance every couple
 

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:07.519
know time-based maintenance every couple
weeks we send somebody to the substation

00:49:07.519 --> 00:49:07.529
weeks we send somebody to the substation
 

00:49:07.529 --> 00:49:09.380
weeks we send somebody to the substation
to you know check the gases on the

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:09.390
to you know check the gases on the
 

00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:12.799
to you know check the gases on the
transformer and you know to be able to

00:49:12.799 --> 00:49:12.809
transformer and you know to be able to
 

00:49:12.809 --> 00:49:16.279
transformer and you know to be able to
do condition based maintenance the the

00:49:16.279 --> 00:49:16.289
do condition based maintenance the the
 

00:49:16.289 --> 00:49:18.859
do condition based maintenance the the
amount of cost that will pull out of our

00:49:18.859 --> 00:49:18.869
amount of cost that will pull out of our
 

00:49:18.869 --> 00:49:21.440
amount of cost that will pull out of our
system is tremendous so that's you know

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:21.450
system is tremendous so that's you know
 

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:26.749
system is tremendous so that's you know
one lane of using data in in our

00:49:26.749 --> 00:49:26.759
one lane of using data in in our
 

00:49:26.759 --> 00:49:29.950
one lane of using data in in our
operations I think you know automation

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:29.960
operations I think you know automation
 

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:33.680
operations I think you know automation
and you know intelligence and robotics

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:33.690
and you know intelligence and robotics
 

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:39.489
and you know intelligence and robotics
also has you know tremendous benefits I

00:49:39.489 --> 00:49:39.499
also has you know tremendous benefits I
 

00:49:39.499 --> 00:49:43.519
also has you know tremendous benefits I
saw recently robotics that's used on we

00:49:43.519 --> 00:49:43.529
saw recently robotics that's used on we
 

00:49:43.529 --> 00:49:46.029
saw recently robotics that's used on we
use drones to fly our transmission lines

00:49:46.029 --> 00:49:46.039
use drones to fly our transmission lines
 

00:49:46.039 --> 00:49:49.670
use drones to fly our transmission lines
but I saw a robot that essentially you

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680
but I saw a robot that essentially you
 

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.410
but I saw a robot that essentially you
know runs along transmission lines and

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:51.420
know runs along transmission lines and
 

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:53.359
know runs along transmission lines and
detects you know faults and when you

00:49:53.359 --> 00:49:53.369
detects you know faults and when you
 

00:49:53.369 --> 00:49:55.759
detects you know faults and when you
think about being able to do your

00:49:55.759 --> 00:49:55.769
think about being able to do your
 

00:49:55.769 --> 00:49:58.700
think about being able to do your
inspections and maintenance by virtue of

00:49:58.700 --> 00:49:58.710
inspections and maintenance by virtue of
 

00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:01.729
inspections and maintenance by virtue of
technology you know not only are you

00:50:01.729 --> 00:50:01.739
technology you know not only are you
 

00:50:01.739 --> 00:50:03.079
technology you know not only are you
going to run a better and more reliable

00:50:03.079 --> 00:50:03.089
going to run a better and more reliable
 

00:50:03.089 --> 00:50:05.599
going to run a better and more reliable
system but you're going to take cost out

00:50:05.599 --> 00:50:05.609
system but you're going to take cost out
 

00:50:05.609 --> 00:50:08.150
system but you're going to take cost out
so there's a big piece of data in

00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160
so there's a big piece of data in
 

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.069
so there's a big piece of data in
running our system that we have not

00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079
running our system that we have not
 

00:50:10.079 --> 00:50:11.870
running our system that we have not
figured out we have just scratched the

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:11.880
figured out we have just scratched the
 

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:13.789
figured out we have just scratched the
surface and we need an awful lot of help

00:50:13.789 --> 00:50:13.799
surface and we need an awful lot of help
 

00:50:13.799 --> 00:50:17.239
surface and we need an awful lot of help
because it's just not our bailiwick

00:50:17.239 --> 00:50:17.249
because it's just not our bailiwick
 

00:50:17.249 --> 00:50:18.890
because it's just not our bailiwick
the second area

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:18.900
the second area
 

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:21.410
the second area
is the data that you need to animate

00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:21.420
is the data that you need to animate
 

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:25.789
is the data that you need to animate
markets and there's always a push and

00:50:25.789 --> 00:50:25.799
markets and there's always a push and
 

00:50:25.799 --> 00:50:27.859
markets and there's always a push and
pull there there are you know third

00:50:27.859 --> 00:50:27.869
pull there there are you know third
 

00:50:27.869 --> 00:50:29.870
pull there there are you know third
parties who tend to want more of the

00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:29.880
parties who tend to want more of the
 

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.660
parties who tend to want more of the
information than we want to give we're a

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:32.670
information than we want to give we're a
 

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:34.160
information than we want to give we're a
little concerned because obviously

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:34.170
little concerned because obviously
 

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:36.339
little concerned because obviously
security interests in this industry are

00:50:36.339 --> 00:50:36.349
security interests in this industry are
 

00:50:36.349 --> 00:50:39.890
security interests in this industry are
significant and and so we're very

00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:39.900
significant and and so we're very
 

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:42.170
significant and and so we're very
careful about what kind of data gets out

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:42.180
careful about what kind of data gets out
 

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.549
careful about what kind of data gets out
there about you know system

00:50:43.549 --> 00:50:43.559
there about you know system
 

00:50:43.559 --> 00:50:45.440
there about you know system
configuration and that sort of thing so

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:45.450
configuration and that sort of thing so
 

00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:47.299
configuration and that sort of thing so
there's a big push pull on that and I

00:50:47.299 --> 00:50:47.309
there's a big push pull on that and I
 

00:50:47.309 --> 00:50:48.769
there's a big push pull on that and I
think that will continue for some time

00:50:48.769 --> 00:50:48.779
think that will continue for some time
 

00:50:48.779 --> 00:50:50.630
think that will continue for some time
and you know we'll find the right

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640
and you know we'll find the right
 

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.569
and you know we'll find the right
balance but we are cognizant of the fact

00:50:52.569 --> 00:50:52.579
balance but we are cognizant of the fact
 

00:50:52.579 --> 00:50:54.769
balance but we are cognizant of the fact
that we're going to have to share more

00:50:54.769 --> 00:50:54.779
that we're going to have to share more
 

00:50:54.779 --> 00:50:56.690
that we're going to have to share more
and that it's important to have it out

00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:56.700
and that it's important to have it out
 

00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:59.690
and that it's important to have it out
there in order to animate markets create

00:50:59.690 --> 00:50:59.700
there in order to animate markets create
 

00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:02.870
there in order to animate markets create
benefits for for consumers and then I'd

00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880
benefits for for consumers and then I'd
 

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:04.430
benefits for for consumers and then I'd
say the third bucket is really data

00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:04.440
say the third bucket is really data
 

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:06.500
say the third bucket is really data
privacy and and you know maintaining

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:06.510
privacy and and you know maintaining
 

00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:09.500
privacy and and you know maintaining
that and that is very parallel to what

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:09.510
that and that is very parallel to what
 

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:11.660
that and that is very parallel to what
we see in other commercial entities and

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:11.670
we see in other commercial entities and
 

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:13.640
we see in other commercial entities and
trying to make sure that we've got the

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:13.650
trying to make sure that we've got the
 

00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:17.299
trying to make sure that we've got the
right practices as well as technology to

00:51:17.299 --> 00:51:17.309
right practices as well as technology to
 

00:51:17.309 --> 00:51:20.089
right practices as well as technology to
protect that but this is a huge area

00:51:20.089 --> 00:51:20.099
protect that but this is a huge area
 

00:51:20.099 --> 00:51:22.839
protect that but this is a huge area
it's an area where again it's not

00:51:22.839 --> 00:51:22.849
it's an area where again it's not
 

00:51:22.849 --> 00:51:26.269
it's an area where again it's not
particularly our you know our strong

00:51:26.269 --> 00:51:26.279
particularly our you know our strong
 

00:51:26.279 --> 00:51:27.769
particularly our you know our strong
suit and I think there's a lot of room

00:51:27.769 --> 00:51:27.779
suit and I think there's a lot of room
 

00:51:27.779 --> 00:51:41.630
suit and I think there's a lot of room
for for help on that okay thank you

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640
 
 

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.839
 
I just want to take a moment to thank

00:51:44.839 --> 00:51:44.849
