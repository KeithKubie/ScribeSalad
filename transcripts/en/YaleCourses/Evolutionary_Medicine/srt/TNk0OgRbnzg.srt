1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,340
Hello, my name is Steve Sterns and I'd
like to welcome you into this course on

2
00:00:04,341 --> 00:00:05,390
evolutionary medicine.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,460
It is aimed at audiences
that include undergraduates,

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,780
medical students and uh,

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:19,160
physicians who are interested in CME
credits and anyone else who was interested

6
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:21,920
in evolutionary insights
in the medical issues.

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:23,740
Yeah,

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,740
the course is supported by a book which
just was published a few days ago.

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,270
Uh,

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:36,270
it's coauthored with Russell on med
cutoff and it's available from sign our

11
00:00:36,821 --> 00:00:37,654
associates.

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,390
The scope of the book actually
defines the scope of the course.

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,790
Evolutionary insights are more important
in some parts of medicine and the R and

14
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:50,624
others.

15
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,410
And we concentrate on issues where
evolutionary biology and evolutionary

16
00:00:56,901 --> 00:01:01,901
thinking brings insights that can
reduce suffering and save lives either

17
00:01:02,451 --> 00:01:05,510
immediately or as basic
research continues.

18
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:12,370
So she insights are distributed across
many different parts of medicine for like

19
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:13,630
physics and chemistry.

20
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,250
Evolutionary biology is a basic science
that underpins all of medical science.

21
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:20,290
Okay,

22
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,790
here's an overview of the topics.

23
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:27,340
In chapter one we introduced evolutionary
thinking and then we ask to rather

24
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:28,510
interesting questions.

25
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:33,570
What does a patient and what is a
disease that issue what is a disease,

26
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,350
sets up the discussion of defenses and
then takes us on into pathogen evolution,

27
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,450
discussion of cancer, reproductive
medicine and the issue of mismatch.

28
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,540
We then go on into mental disorders,

29
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:51,530
discuss how individual versus
population thinking, uh,

30
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,350
is involved in health. And the
book concludes with open questions.

31
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:57,920
Yeah.

32
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,800
So in this introduction to
the course and this welcome,

33
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:04,040
I just want to very quickly take you
through the highlights of those chapters.

34
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,180
So in evolutionary thinking,
uh,

35
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,900
we recognize the biological evolution
is both a process called micro evolution

36
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,420
that produces a pattern
called macro evolution.

37
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,870
And both of these ways of
thinking are relevant to medicine.

38
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,600
The toolkit of these ideas for
microevolution includes natural selection,

39
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,690
random processes,
genetic drift,

40
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,440
genetic change and development.

41
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,910
In macro evolution,
the framework shifts to history,

42
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,520
how history defines relationships,

43
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,330
provides an origin for
constraints and again,

44
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,600
insights into development.
What do we think about what is a patient?

45
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,490
I think the first thing we recognize is
that patients are bundles of trade offs.

46
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,720
They are not built like machines
with parts that you can just replace.

47
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,700
They contain ancient

48
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,300
patients vary for both senate and
genetic and environmental reasons.

49
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,920
They age,

50
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,390
which makes them vulnerable and
they are unusual among primates.

51
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,650
They also contain very
important microbiota which
are playing an increasing role

52
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,240
in medical explanation.

53
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,020
When we come to what is the disease?

54
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,080
I think the first thing to mention is
that instead of using the traditional

55
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:30,540
categories of infectious versus chronic,

56
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,410
we placed diseases into seven categories
that reflect their causes and which

57
00:03:36,481 --> 00:03:41,280
relate to whether they, whether evolution
could have affected the fences are not

58
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:48,290
the tissues in the organism and the
patient very from vulnerable to robust.

59
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:54,150
The physiological functions that are
involved in disease very from fixed to

60
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:59,151
adjustable and many diseases are produced
by interactions between genes and

61
00:04:00,151 --> 00:04:00,930
environment.

62
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,850
So those are some of the highlights about
disease that sets up the discussion of

63
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:06,684
defenses.

64
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,770
Defense mechanisms have usually evolved
as modifications of processes that were

65
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:17,370
already part of normal
physiology evolution.

66
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:22,580
We'll tolerate high costs and will permit
significant vulnerabilities when those

67
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:28,170
costs and those vulnerabilities
are associated with major benefits.

68
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,520
Some defenses have major benefits and
are associated with large costs and

69
00:04:34,861 --> 00:04:36,390
significant vulnerabilities.

70
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,603
Yeah.

71
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,260
Pathogens evolve and they
evolve quite rapidly.

72
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,710
They have their own agendas and
they respond to human interventions.

73
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,340
The responses include virulence,

74
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,010
their roles in the Microbiota,

75
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,030
the evasion and suppression of defenses,

76
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,080
resistance to antibiotics and reactions
to attempts to prevent their own

77
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:05,034
evolution,

78
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,830
so they are a flexible and
highly adjustable population.

79
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay.

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,960
Cancer is a very interesting
part of evolutionary medicine,

81
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,690
both because there is a historical
component evolution build vulnerability to

82
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:25,390
cancer deep into the design of our bodies,

83
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,520
it's going to be almost impossible to
change that design and eliminate that

84
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:31,354
vulnerability.

85
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,740
Every cancer is an independent instance
of clonal evolution and that is fueled

86
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,410
by genetic variation.

87
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:48,210
That evolution creates a
unique evolutionary history
with each patient and that

88
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,510
evolution can be reconstructed with
molecular phylogenetic so that we can

89
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:57,100
actually see the history of
an individual cancer. Okay.

90
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,200
That every cancer evolves has some very
important implications for therapy.

91
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,340
Yeah.

92
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,640
There are also evolutionary insights that
are quite interesting and important in

93
00:06:08,641 --> 00:06:09,660
reproductive medicine.

94
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,310
Evolution helps us to understand
ministration menopause,

95
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,700
the difficulty of childbirth
and the diseases of pregnancy.

96
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:18,980
Okay.

97
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,870
It also allows us to see
that the evolution of the
placenta is connected to the

98
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:28,640
risk of cancer. Evolutionary
conflicts over parental investment.

99
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,400
Help us to understand the diseases of
pregnancy, gestation length, birth way,

100
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,340
and give us some insight
into middle of disorders.

101
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,750
Reproductive events
that occur early in life

102
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,220
have consequences for health late in life.

103
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,580
So there was a whole complex
of interesting issues
built around the process of

104
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:53,354
reproduction.

105
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:55,650
Okay.

106
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,650
Mismatch is one of the major concepts
in evolutionary medicine and it arises

107
00:07:01,981 --> 00:07:06,981
because our environment has recently been
changing more rapidly than our biology

108
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:07,920
can keep up with.

109
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:09,310
Yeah.

110
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:13,840
The resulting mismatch between
biology and environment producers,

111
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:17,470
mild to severe loss of evolutionary
fitness, which is expressed.

112
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,390
His contributions to disease states.

113
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,510
These diseases include obesity, type
two diabetes and cardiovascular disease,

114
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,290
female reproductive cancers,
asthma and autoimmune diseases.

115
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,920
So these are part of the complex of
diseases that are part of the worlds

116
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,410
emerging huge health burden.

117
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,620
Okay.

118
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,350
There are also evolutionary
insights into mental disorders.

119
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,040
Probably the most important one is that
mental disorders are disturbances of

120
00:07:50,191 --> 00:07:53,910
cognition and behavior that function
well in most, but break down in a few.

121
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,460
Yeah.

122
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,930
Cognition and behavior are
complex processes that are
influenced both by genetic

123
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:04,400
and by developmental events. They have
many components, each of which can vary.

124
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,660
That variation produces a distribution
of cognition and behavior.

125
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:09,850
Yeah.

126
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:14,770
We can view some mental
disorders as byproducts of
selection for normal behavior

127
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,490
caused by inescapable
features of complex systems,

128
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,810
so you can think of the normal behaviors
being the center of the distribution

129
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,690
and the mental disorders as being
the tails of the distribution.

130
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,950
They can also be disorders of defense,

131
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,650
of homeostasis and of mismatch.

132
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:38,680
So there are a number of
different evolutionary
insights into mental disorders.

133
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:40,710
Yeah.

134
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:45,710
In chapter 10 we discuss individual
health versus population benefit.

135
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,790
There are conflicts that arise
between individuals and populations.

136
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,040
When physicians treat their decisions
accumulate to have consequences for

137
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:02,490
epidemiology, demography,
and even natural selection.

138
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,370
Those consequences often contain conflicts
between the welfare of the individual

139
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:13,430
and the welfare of the group involving
externalization of private costs and

140
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,740
exploitation of public goods.

141
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,440
Important examples include
vaccination and antibiotic therapy,

142
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,220
and this is the point at which morality
enters the discussion of and how it is

143
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:36,030
connected to evolutionary insights.
Finally,

144
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:41,031
we close the book with some of the
open questions because naturally any

145
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,190
searching analysis reveals many
places where we need to know more.

146
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,360
Can we design evolution
proof antibiotic therapies?

147
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,900
Can we switch the host pathogen
relationship from resistance to tolerance?

148
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,510
Do Pathogens evolve greater virulence
when leaky vaccines are used?

149
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,710
Does adaptive therapy
slowdown cancer revolution?

150
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,660
Do Evolutionary Tradeoffs
suggest treatments for aging?

151
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,870
And does genomic imprinting help to
explain autism and schizophrenia?

152
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,180
There were some indications that it helps.
So in conclusion,

153
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,230
evolutionary thinking,

154
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:29,190
cast new lights on many areas of
medical research and practice,

155
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,880
it complements other approaches.
It does not replace them.

156
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,880
It helps to reduce
suffering and save lives,

157
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:38,850
but it also contains fascinating ideas.
It's fun.
