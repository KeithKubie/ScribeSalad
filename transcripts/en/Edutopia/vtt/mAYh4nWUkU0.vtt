00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.826
&gt;&gt;Student: I opened it up,
and there was a root inside.

00:00:05.126 --> 00:00:08.706
&gt;&gt;Anne: What's exciting about
the inquiry models that we go far

00:00:08.706 --> 00:00:12.106
and above what the curriculum
expectations are.

00:00:12.716 --> 00:00:15.886
Kids are invested in their learning,
and they're able to transfer

00:00:15.886 --> 00:00:18.976
and apply what they're learning
in school to the real world.

00:00:25.176 --> 00:00:28.126
&gt;&gt;Lindsay: Inquiry based learning
allows the students to be the thinkers.

00:00:28.546 --> 00:00:32.196
Teachers begin their lesson with an
idea of where they want to end in mind,

00:00:32.196 --> 00:00:35.536
but really give the students the
opportunity to drive it to that point.

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:38.086
&gt;&gt;Lindsay: So your job, keep
working through your procedure,

00:00:38.086 --> 00:00:40.536
when you all agree, I'll come
back and check in with you.

00:00:40.536 --> 00:00:41.876
&gt;&gt;Dawn: We have guided inquiry,

00:00:42.036 --> 00:00:43.776
where teachers are guiding
students through the curriculum.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.350
&gt;&gt;D.J.: Okay, find that
five milliliters.

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:49.206
&gt;&gt;Dawn: And then making a shift
into student driven inquiry,

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.226
where students use that
as prior knowledge

00:00:51.226 --> 00:00:53.336
and build their own inquiries
around that.

00:00:53.836 --> 00:00:57.816
We want them to be building the
foundation for higher level inquiry,

00:00:57.926 --> 00:00:59.946
starting right when we
have them in kindergarten.

00:01:04.046 --> 00:01:05.186
&gt;&gt;Lindsay: And once someone
finds something,

00:01:05.186 --> 00:01:08.946
make sure that you tell the
rest of the paleontologists.

00:01:08.946 --> 00:01:09.856
&gt;&gt;Student: We found the skull!

00:01:09.856 --> 00:01:10.436
&gt;&gt;Lindsay: [gasps] Oh,
you found the skull?

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:10.526
&gt;&gt;Student: Yes.

00:01:10.526 --> 00:01:13.786
&gt;&gt;Anne: The teacher's developing
the guided inquiry model based

00:01:13.786 --> 00:01:16.826
on the curriculum, but then
the students are shaping

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:18.216
where do they want to go with it.

00:01:18.486 --> 00:01:21.286
&gt;&gt;Lindsay: We're going to go through our
lab sheet quickly, and then we're going

00:01:21.286 --> 00:01:24.296
to get into our experimental groups.

00:01:24.556 --> 00:01:27.926
&gt;&gt;Lindsay: They were told that two
scientists had a mix-up in their lab.

00:01:27.926 --> 00:01:31.336
They had some seeds, they had some eggs,
and now they don't know which are which.

00:01:31.606 --> 00:01:33.146
The students had the opportunity

00:01:33.146 --> 00:01:36.026
to decide what they thought
would be helpful experiments

00:01:36.026 --> 00:01:37.736
for us to get to our answer.

00:01:37.956 --> 00:01:41.816
Instead of opening with a bunch of
information and facts and details,

00:01:42.026 --> 00:01:44.586
the students are given a
problem, and then they're the ones

00:01:44.586 --> 00:01:46.936
who get to drive the experiments.

00:01:47.046 --> 00:01:49.826
&gt;&gt;Katie: I'm trying to see which
one is eggs, and which one's seeds.

00:01:49.826 --> 00:01:51.186
But we don't know.

00:01:51.586 --> 00:01:55.966
So we're trying to figure out
strategies that we can do.

00:01:56.046 --> 00:01:59.916
&gt;&gt;Logan: We make our steps and
then we test and see what happens.

00:02:01.236 --> 00:02:02.806
&gt;&gt;Hadley: And we think planting them,

00:02:02.806 --> 00:02:05.976
and we think the seeds
will grow, and eggs won't.

00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:09.796
&gt;&gt;Student: I think they'll get bigger.

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:12.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah, so once they get
bigger, it would like crack open.

00:02:13.046 --> 00:02:14.886
&gt;&gt;Dawn: Teachers are
guiding with questions

00:02:15.086 --> 00:02:18.506
and to really get students thinking,
and learning how to question themselves.

00:02:20.046 --> 00:02:20.666
&gt;&gt;Lindsay: How might that help us figure

00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:22.156
out which are the eggs
and which are the seeds?

00:02:22.156 --> 00:02:22.976
Floating or sinking?

00:02:24.056 --> 00:02:28.286
&gt;&gt;Student: It might be that the
eggs are heavier than the seeds.

00:02:28.286 --> 00:02:30.046
&gt;&gt;Student: I like doing it
this way, because you get

00:02:30.046 --> 00:02:33.176
to touch what you're actually doing,
instead of just looking at it.

00:02:33.176 --> 00:02:36.206
&gt;&gt;Dawn: Well, we started with
the inquiry model in science,

00:02:36.206 --> 00:02:40.296
and as we started to see students
getting excited about finding answers

00:02:40.296 --> 00:02:43.876
to deeper level questions,
we saw the power and how

00:02:43.876 --> 00:02:45.966
that could be implemented
throughout the school day.

00:02:48.856 --> 00:02:51.286
&gt;&gt;D.J.: If you grab a tube of
paint, there's no real connection

00:02:51.286 --> 00:02:53.816
to the science behind making that paint.

00:02:54.216 --> 00:02:56.796
I want them to see that
art is everywhere.

00:02:56.796 --> 00:03:00.886
Science is everywhere,
math is everywhere.

00:03:01.046 --> 00:03:03.586
&gt;&gt;D.J.: Hey, we are making paint
out of household items today.

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:08.306
&gt;&gt;Student: We started in the art room,
following every step of the recipe.

00:03:09.006 --> 00:03:10.366
&gt;&gt;Anne: Kids need background knowledge,

00:03:10.366 --> 00:03:12.696
and some conceptual understanding
of things.

00:03:13.346 --> 00:03:14.836
&gt;&gt;D.J.: How much salt do we need?

00:03:14.896 --> 00:03:15.956
&gt;&gt;Student: A quarter cup.

00:03:16.206 --> 00:03:16.776
&gt;&gt;D.J.: A quarter cup.

00:03:17.016 --> 00:03:19.056
So how many tablespoons is that?

00:03:19.056 --> 00:03:20.156
&gt;&gt;Students: Eight-- four!

00:03:20.726 --> 00:03:21.276
&gt;&gt;D.J.: Four!

00:03:22.046 --> 00:03:24.036
&gt;&gt;Anne: The next step is, "What
do I want to wonder about now?

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:25.426
How do I want to adjust this?"

00:03:26.436 --> 00:03:29.316
&gt;&gt;D.J.: You have to form your
questions so that you're not taking

00:03:29.316 --> 00:03:32.336
over their creative process, but
helping that creative process.

00:03:32.336 --> 00:03:35.656
"How can you make this paint
fit your needs as an artist?"

00:03:35.656 --> 00:03:40.846
"As a scientist, how am going to change
or modify this paint so that it works?"

00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:42.086
&gt;&gt;D.J.: So I want you to test that.

00:03:42.176 --> 00:03:43.626
And remember to document what you did.

00:03:43.746 --> 00:03:44.276
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay!

00:03:48.156 --> 00:03:51.046
&gt;&gt;Kendall: We wanted
to change the texture,

00:03:51.046 --> 00:03:53.746
because ours was a bit
too lumpy for our liking

00:03:54.316 --> 00:03:57.306
and we added a lot of ingredients.

00:03:57.666 --> 00:03:59.726
&gt;&gt;Dawn: For the inquiry
to be successful,

00:03:59.726 --> 00:04:01.246
the question has to be appropriate.

00:04:01.786 --> 00:04:05.066
And so we really had to teach
students what questions would work,

00:04:05.356 --> 00:04:06.366
how to model them.

00:04:06.576 --> 00:04:10.596
&gt;&gt;Paval: My question that I had is how
could I get this to be a thinner paint

00:04:10.596 --> 00:04:14.376
so I can have like one straight line,
so it doesn't splatter everywhere.

00:04:14.946 --> 00:04:17.226
&gt;&gt;Anne: The exciting piece
of learning this way is

00:04:17.226 --> 00:04:19.146
that we don't always know
what the outcome will be.

00:04:19.146 --> 00:04:24.346
It's a lot of risk involved in
allowing your students to kind

00:04:24.346 --> 00:04:26.446
of just do some discovery
learning on their own.

00:04:27.286 --> 00:04:31.616
&gt;&gt;Paval: I learned that if you're
making paint, you use a liquid substance

00:04:31.616 --> 00:04:33.796
to make it thinner, but
if you mix too many

00:04:33.796 --> 00:04:35.706
of the wrong things,
it might just blow up.

00:04:35.706 --> 00:04:36.896
&gt;&gt;Katie: I think this is pretty good!

00:04:37.426 --> 00:04:40.666
&gt;&gt;Anne: We want kids to be critical
thinkers, to be problem solvers.

00:04:41.096 --> 00:04:45.756
Kids are getting to dig deep into
the cause and effect relationships

00:04:45.816 --> 00:04:49.076
that occur in every field
when we open that up,

00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:52.486
it just empowers them to love learning.

00:04:53.146 --> 00:04:54.636
&gt;&gt;Kendall: We really don't have a limit.

00:04:55.026 --> 00:04:59.826
We get to learn how to do
this stuff with our own ideas.

00:05:00.096 --> 00:05:01.976
It took a lot of time, but we did it.

00:05:04.066 --> 00:05:05.866
&gt;Students: Yay!
