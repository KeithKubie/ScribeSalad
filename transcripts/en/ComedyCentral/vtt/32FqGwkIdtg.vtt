00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:03.270
If you're feeling a palpable
sexual excitement in the air,

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:06.540
it's probably because the vice
presidential debate was tonight.

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:09.076
-Oh! There they...
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.545
Tim Kaine and Mike Pence,
otherwise known as

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:16.316
white guy 37B
and white guy 55C squared off...

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.219
Hang on. That's Mr. Belding and
the dad from <i>That '70s Show.</i>

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:20.654
-It's...
-(laughter)

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.557
Jack, will you please
put up the right photos?

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.693
No, Jack. That is Ned Flanders
and a bowl of rice.

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:29.196
Please find photos
of the VP candidates.

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:33.300
-All right, that's better. Uh...
-(laughter)

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.903
-Now...
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:35.936 --> 00:00:39.239
Since we were busy
taping at the time,

00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:41.441
we didn't get to see the debate
as it happened,

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:43.243
so we're just assuming
that at some point,

00:00:43.277 --> 00:00:45.078
harmonica enthusiast Tim Kaine
did a bitching duet

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:47.648
with John Popper
from Blues Traveler,

00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:50.117
and that Mike Pence revealed
he's been a dummy

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.386
controlled by Jeff Dunham
this entire time.

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:53.921
(laughter)

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:56.156
Either way, Americans knows next
to nothing about these two.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.192
So comedians, what's a question
they should have been asked

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:00.460
to get the core
of these store-brand white guys?

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:01.828
Louie Anderson.

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:04.865
Have you ever owned stock
in Cracker Barrel?

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:07.267
-HARDWICK: Points. Points.
-(laughter)

00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:09.369
-(applause)
-Are you Cracker Barrel?

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:11.471
Brendon Walsh.

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:13.073
What's your favorite
Jimmy Buffett song?

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:16.043
-And you can't say all of them.
-HARDWICK: Yes. Points.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.978
-(laughter, applause)
-Martha Kelly. -KELLY: Oh.

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:20.914
Should 21st century
American women be allowed

00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:23.150
to get abortions
or just fake boobs?

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:23.250
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: Points. Points.
