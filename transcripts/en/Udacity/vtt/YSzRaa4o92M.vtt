00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.856
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Keeping in mind that we don't want any common factors to be within any of the

00:00:03.856 --> 00:00:07.948
final factors we end up with that multiply to create a polynomial, how would you

00:00:07.948 --> 00:00:11.955
factor this polynomial? I'll give you a little hint, and that hint is that if

00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:15.798
there are any common factors that all of the terms have, you should start the

00:00:15.798 --> 00:00:17.841
problem off by pulling those out first.
