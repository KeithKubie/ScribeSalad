there's plenty of movies that have tried
 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.920
there's plenty of movies that have tried
to to be built around that kind of a

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930
to to be built around that kind of a
 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.350
to to be built around that kind of a
theme but climate change is not an

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360
theme but climate change is not an
 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.620
theme but climate change is not an
external threat it's an internal one and

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630
external threat it's an internal one and
 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.920
external threat it's an internal one and
it requires a it's going to affect

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930
it requires a it's going to affect
 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.300
it requires a it's going to affect
everything so number one I would say

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310
everything so number one I would say
 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.130
everything so number one I would say
climate change which also as I said it

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140
climate change which also as I said it
 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.630
climate change which also as I said it
affects poverty it affects health and

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640
affects poverty it affects health and
 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.980
affects poverty it affects health and
when I look at the big issues I think

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990
when I look at the big issues I think
 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.680
when I look at the big issues I think
they start with that

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690
 
 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.350

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360
well I think you can't understand Israel
 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.390
well I think you can't understand Israel
without understanding the Holocaust the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400
without understanding the Holocaust the
 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.530
without understanding the Holocaust the
Holocaust is the seminal event in Jewish

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540
Holocaust is the seminal event in Jewish
 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.360
Holocaust is the seminal event in Jewish
history at least the seminal tragedy in

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370
history at least the seminal tragedy in
 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.350
history at least the seminal tragedy in
Jewish history and you have the birth of

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360
Jewish history and you have the birth of
 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.500
Jewish history and you have the birth of
a nation state that emerges out of that

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510
a nation state that emerges out of that
 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.240
a nation state that emerges out of that
the Zionist movement was creating the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250
the Zionist movement was creating the
 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.640
the Zionist movement was creating the
basis for a state before that but the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650
basis for a state before that but the
 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.910
basis for a state before that but the
Holocaust that is a transforming reality

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
Holocaust that is a transforming reality
 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.930
Holocaust that is a transforming reality
so Israel emerges but it has that as its

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940
so Israel emerges but it has that as its
 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.190
so Israel emerges but it has that as its
its most important element of history

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200
its most important element of history
 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.190
its most important element of history
and historical identity and the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
and historical identity and the
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.620
and historical identity and the
significance of that is for Israelis the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
significance of that is for Israelis the
 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.980
significance of that is for Israelis the
worst can happen it's not it's not there

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990
worst can happen it's not it's not there
 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.430
worst can happen it's not it's not there
imagining or conjuring up what are false

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440
imagining or conjuring up what are false
 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.730
imagining or conjuring up what are false
kinds of threats the worst can happen so

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740
kinds of threats the worst can happen so
 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.740
kinds of threats the worst can happen so
in terms of affecting the Israeli

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750
in terms of affecting the Israeli
 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.590
in terms of affecting the Israeli
outlook number one you start with the

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600
outlook number one you start with the
 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.400
outlook number one you start with the
premise that the worst can happen

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410
premise that the worst can happen
 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.860
premise that the worst can happen
because of the Holocaust number two

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870
because of the Holocaust number two
 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.900
because of the Holocaust number two
you're dealing with the reality that all

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910
you're dealing with the reality that all
 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.840

adopted is prepared to condemn it so the
 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.789
adopted is prepared to condemn it so the
message of the Israelis is will the

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799
message of the Israelis is will the
 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.380
message of the Israelis is will the
words or one thing the realities of

something else so the whole Israeli

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940
something else so the whole Israeli
 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.710
something else so the whole Israeli
mindset is governed by a perception of

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720
mindset is governed by a perception of
 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.039
mindset is governed by a perception of
not really being accepted where terror

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049
not really being accepted where terror
 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.599
not really being accepted where terror
is seen it against you seen as being

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609
is seen it against you seen as being
 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.460
is seen it against you seen as being
legitimate and where security becomes a

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470
legitimate and where security becomes a
 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.020
legitimate and where security becomes a
preoccupation and you have to do it

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030
preoccupation and you have to do it
 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.040
preoccupation and you have to do it
because you can't rely upon anybody else

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050
because you can't rely upon anybody else
 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.670
because you can't rely upon anybody else
1967 is a war where the Israelis have

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970
commitments from the Eisenhower
 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.029
commitments from the Eisenhower
administration which the Johnson

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039
administration which the Johnson
 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.450
administration which the Johnson
administration doesn't fulfill and it

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460
administration doesn't fulfill and it
 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.219
administration doesn't fulfill and it
reminds the Israelis okay we're on our

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229
reminds the Israelis okay we're on our
 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.379
reminds the Israelis okay we're on our
own then of course when they win in a

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389
own then of course when they win in a
 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.420
own then of course when they win in a
dramatic way then there's a feeling not

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430
dramatic way then there's a feeling not
 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.129
dramatic way then there's a feeling not
only well are we on our own but that's

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139
only well are we on our own but that's
 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.680
only well are we on our own but that's
okay because we can handle it so there's

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690
okay because we can handle it so there's
 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.320
okay because we can handle it so there's
a profound sense of self-reliance but

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330
a profound sense of self-reliance but
 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.790
a profound sense of self-reliance but
it's also a function of feeling

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800
it's also a function of feeling
 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.560
it's also a function of feeling
ultimately you can't count on anybody

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570
ultimately you can't count on anybody
 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.719
ultimately you can't count on anybody
else and we always have to be the ones

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729
else and we always have to be the ones
 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.580
else and we always have to be the ones
who rely upon ourselves there's a

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590
who rely upon ourselves there's a
 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.100
who rely upon ourselves there's a
preoccupation with security because of

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110
preoccupation with security because of
 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.100
preoccupation with security because of
that whole context I described and

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110
that whole context I described and
 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.990
that whole context I described and
security becomes a kind of sinequan on

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000
security becomes a kind of sinequan on
 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.250
security becomes a kind of sinequan on
for how to see the world now as Israel

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260
for how to see the world now as Israel
 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.879
for how to see the world now as Israel
develops and it becomes actually quite I

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889
develops and it becomes actually quite I
 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.690
develops and it becomes actually quite I
think quite effective in terms of its

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700
think quite effective in terms of its
 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.909
think quite effective in terms of its
development economically you look at it

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919
development economically you look at it
 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.330
development economically you look at it
now it's 140 billion dollar economy

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340
now it's 140 billion dollar economy
 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.430
now it's 140 billion dollar economy
Dwarfs all of its neighbors so it's very

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440
Dwarfs all of its neighbors so it's very
 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.890
Dwarfs all of its neighbors so it's very
successful and more and more of the

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900
successful and more and more of the
 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.779
successful and more and more of the
Israelis see themselves connected to the

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789
Israelis see themselves connected to the
 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:36.690
Israelis see themselves connected to the
world because of the global economy and

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700
world because of the global economy and
 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.610
world because of the global economy and
their success in competing in the global

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620
their success in competing in the global
 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.980
their success in competing in the global
economy so there's a there's an

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990
economy so there's a there's an
 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.420
economy so there's a there's an
interesting duality that's emerging the

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430
interesting duality that's emerging the
 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.159
interesting duality that's emerging the
sense of being on your own the sense of

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169
sense of being on your own the sense of
 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:44.430
sense of being on your own the sense of
being

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440
being
 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.400
being
redwood security somehow you have this

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410
redwood security somehow you have this
 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.680
redwood security somehow you have this
other reality where the world is shrunk

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690
other reality where the world is shrunk
 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.380
other reality where the world is shrunk
and economically speaking you're an

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390
and economically speaking you're an
 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.630
and economically speaking you're an
important part of it and so there's

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640
important part of it and so there's
 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.430
important part of it and so there's
there's an evolution taking place

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440
there's an evolution taking place
 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.920
there's an evolution taking place
although pretty hard to dismiss the

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930
although pretty hard to dismiss the
 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.570
although pretty hard to dismiss the
preoccupation with security

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580
 
 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.740
 
the in the Arab mind said there was a

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750
the in the Arab mind said there was a
 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.170
the in the Arab mind said there was a
sense of fundamental grievance the land

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180
sense of fundamental grievance the land
 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.730
sense of fundamental grievance the land
was Palestinian and it was taken from

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740
was Palestinian and it was taken from
 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.149
was Palestinian and it was taken from
them and they weren't prepared to accept

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:16.159
them and they weren't prepared to accept
 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:18.990
them and they weren't prepared to accept
that Israel had a right to be there

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000
that Israel had a right to be there
 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.520
that Israel had a right to be there
especially if they were seen as being

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530
especially if they were seen as being
 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.020
especially if they were seen as being
usurpers and taking the place of the

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030
usurpers and taking the place of the
 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.490
usurpers and taking the place of the
Palestinians and this was seen as an

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500
Palestinians and this was seen as an
 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.129
Palestinians and this was seen as an
outside force that came in and took the

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139
outside force that came in and took the
 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.100
outside force that came in and took the
land and the land had a kind of sacred

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110
land and the land had a kind of sacred
 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.760
land and the land had a kind of sacred
quality so from the Arab standpoint

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770
quality so from the Arab standpoint
 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.800
quality so from the Arab standpoint
there was a sense of this kind of

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810
there was a sense of this kind of
 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.270
there was a sense of this kind of
outside interloper usurper and there was

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280
outside interloper usurper and there was
 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.100
outside interloper usurper and there was
a fundamental injustice a fundamental

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110
a fundamental injustice a fundamental
 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.450
a fundamental injustice a fundamental
wrong and the land was taken from the

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460
wrong and the land was taken from the
 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.920
wrong and the land was taken from the
Palestinians so you wouldn't accept the

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930
Palestinians so you wouldn't accept the
 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.209
Palestinians so you wouldn't accept the
Israelis now that was a what I would

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:49.219
Israelis now that was a what I would
 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:52.020
Israelis now that was a what I would
describe as a kind of ethos that existed

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030
describe as a kind of ethos that existed
 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.869
describe as a kind of ethos that existed
in the Arab world it was also exploited

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:54.879
in the Arab world it was also exploited
 

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:56.950
in the Arab world it was also exploited
because there were those who were

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960
because there were those who were
 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.839
because there were those who were
leaders who sought to use that to

00:06:58.839 --> 00:06:58.849
leaders who sought to use that to
 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:00.790
leaders who sought to use that to
mobilize support for themselves both

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800
mobilize support for themselves both
 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.100
mobilize support for themselves both
internally and in competition with their

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110
internally and in competition with their
 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.159
internally and in competition with their
neighbors and it wasn't really that they

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:06.169
neighbors and it wasn't really that they
 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:07.899
neighbors and it wasn't really that they
cared so much about the Palestinians as

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:07.909
cared so much about the Palestinians as
 

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:09.939
cared so much about the Palestinians as
much as they care to use it as an issue

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:09.949
much as they care to use it as an issue
 

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:11.580
much as they care to use it as an issue
for political purposes and for

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.590
for political purposes and for
 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.409
for political purposes and for
legitimating purposes since they most of

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:14.419
legitimating purposes since they most of
 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:16.480
legitimating purposes since they most of
them had seized power they'd hadn't they

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:16.490
them had seized power they'd hadn't they
 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.189
them had seized power they'd hadn't they
hadn't won power in the basis of the

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199
hadn't won power in the basis of the
 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:19.450
hadn't won power in the basis of the
consent of the government of the

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:19.460
consent of the government of the
 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.040
consent of the government of the
governed they didn't really have a

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.050
governed they didn't really have a
 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.629
governed they didn't really have a
legitimate basis for power so they had

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639
legitimate basis for power so they had
 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:24.909
legitimate basis for power so they had
to seek some other legitimizing element

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:24.919
to seek some other legitimizing element
 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:27.430
to seek some other legitimizing element
and using the Palestine issue became a

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440
and using the Palestine issue became a
 

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.219
and using the Palestine issue became a
legitimizing element so there is both a

00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:30.229
legitimizing element so there is both a
 

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:33.399
legitimizing element so there is both a
genuine reality of injustice and a

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:33.409
genuine reality of injustice and a
 

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:35.469
genuine reality of injustice and a
grievance but there's also the

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:35.479
grievance but there's also the
 

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:37.779
grievance but there's also the
exploitation of this for internal

00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:37.789
exploitation of this for internal
 

00:07:37.789 --> 00:07:41.600
exploitation of this for internal
legitimizing purposes

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:41.610
 
 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.029
 
well I think there's I guess there's two

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:44.039
well I think there's I guess there's two
 

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:46.550
well I think there's I guess there's two
points I would make the first point is

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560
points I would make the first point is

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.910
state it means it will have to disengage
from the West Bank but how it disengages

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920
from the West Bank but how it disengages
 

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.800
from the West Bank but how it disengages
will be a function of whether or not in

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:19.810
will be a function of whether or not in
 

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:21.050
will be a function of whether or not in
fact there's a readiness for

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:21.060
fact there's a readiness for
 

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.430
fact there's a readiness for
Palestinians to be able in fact to

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440
Palestinians to be able in fact to
 

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.930
Palestinians to be able in fact to
fulfill their responsibilities and if

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:24.940
fulfill their responsibilities and if
 

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.819
fulfill their responsibilities and if
not the disengagement will be of

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:26.829
not the disengagement will be of
 

00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:30.390
not the disengagement will be of
settlements not of the military

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:30.400
 
 

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.550
 
well I think they fundamentally meet on

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560
well I think they fundamentally meet on
 

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.890
well I think they fundamentally meet on
the desire for peace because i think

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:34.900
the desire for peace because i think
 

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.290
the desire for peace because i think
it's israel needs peace for itself not

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:37.300
it's israel needs peace for itself not
 

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.140
it's israel needs peace for itself not
as a favor to the United States the

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:40.150
as a favor to the United States the
 

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.700
as a favor to the United States the
United States favors peace because it's

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:41.710
United States favors peace because it's
 

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.470
United States favors peace because it's
right and because it makes it easier for

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:43.480
right and because it makes it easier for
 

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.790
right and because it makes it easier for
us to have good relations with Israelis

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800
us to have good relations with Israelis
 

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.030
us to have good relations with Israelis
and Arabs so there's a convergence there

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.040
and Arabs so there's a convergence there
 

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.800
and Arabs so there's a convergence there
now sometimes there's a divergence in

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:49.810
now sometimes there's a divergence in
 

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:53.760
now sometimes there's a divergence in
that sometimes the u.s. is is more

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:53.770
that sometimes the u.s. is is more
 

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.290
that sometimes the u.s. is is more
prepared to push farther than the

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:55.300
prepared to push farther than the
 

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.420
prepared to push farther than the
Israelis think that their position and

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:57.430
Israelis think that their position and
 

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.720
Israelis think that their position and
security can afford as well as the way

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:00.730
security can afford as well as the way
 

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.940
security can afford as well as the way
they look at their neighbors and their

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:02.950
they look at their neighbors and their
 

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.200
they look at their neighbors and their
concerns about how the neighbors may

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:04.210
concerns about how the neighbors may
 

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.390
concerns about how the neighbors may
miss read some of the moves so there's

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:06.400
miss read some of the moves so there's
 

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.470
miss read some of the moves so there's
that's one area where there's a

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:07.480
that's one area where there's a
 

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.050
that's one area where there's a
potential diversions there's a

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:10.060
potential diversions there's a
 

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.820
potential diversions there's a
convergence also I think in terms of

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:11.830
convergence also I think in terms of
 

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.560
convergence also I think in terms of
also both being threatened by radical

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:13.570
also both being threatened by radical
 

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:19.650
also both being threatened by radical
Islam both of us are I think targets of

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:19.660
Islam both of us are I think targets of
 

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.590
Islam both of us are I think targets of
the radical Islamists we're seen as

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:22.600
the radical Islamists we're seen as
 

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.390
the radical Islamists we're seen as
being connected and will always be seen

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:24.400
being connected and will always be seen
 

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.610
being connected and will always be seen
as being connected and that creates also

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:26.620
as being connected and that creates also
 

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:30.360
as being connected and that creates also
a powerful sense of convergence where

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:30.370
a powerful sense of convergence where
 

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.000
a powerful sense of convergence where
there's a potential for divergences

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:32.010
there's a potential for divergences
 

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.230
there's a potential for divergences
because the u.s. is so sensitive to

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240
because the u.s. is so sensitive to
 

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.820
because the u.s. is so sensitive to
wanting to have a certain kind of

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:35.830
wanting to have a certain kind of
 

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:37.620
wanting to have a certain kind of
position in the Middle East you know

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:37.630
position in the Middle East you know
 

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.350
position in the Middle East you know
sometimes it is more concerned about its

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:40.360
sometimes it is more concerned about its
 

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.850
sometimes it is more concerned about its
relationship with the Arab world even if

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:41.860
relationship with the Arab world even if
 

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.260
relationship with the Arab world even if
it would come at some cost to its

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:43.270
it would come at some cost to its
 

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.120
it would come at some cost to its
relationship with Israel so I think

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:45.130
relationship with Israel so I think
 

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.490
relationship with Israel so I think
that's an area of some potential tension

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:47.500
that's an area of some potential tension
 

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.540
that's an area of some potential tension
but even here we're in a world now where

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:50.550
but even here we're in a world now where
 

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.890
but even here we're in a world now where
many in the Arab world recognize the

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:52.900
many in the Arab world recognize the
 

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.900
many in the Arab world recognize the
radical Islamists are as much a threat

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:54.910
radical Islamists are as much a threat
 

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.560
radical Islamists are as much a threat
to them as they are to anyone else so

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:57.570
to them as they are to anyone else so
 

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.850
to them as they are to anyone else so
there could be a natural convergence

00:12:59.850 --> 00:12:59.860
there could be a natural convergence
 

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.270
there could be a natural convergence
between all of us between the what I

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:03.280
between all of us between the what I
 

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.130
between all of us between the what I
would say the those moderate Arab states

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:05.140
would say the those moderate Arab states
 

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.560
would say the those moderate Arab states
the Israelis in the United States the

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:07.570
the Israelis in the United States the
 

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.120
the Israelis in the United States the
competition with the radical Islamists

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:09.130
competition with the radical Islamists
 

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:10.980
competition with the radical Islamists
may lead to different prescriptions for

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:10.990
may lead to different prescriptions for
 

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.620
may lead to different prescriptions for
how to do it the some of the Arab states

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:13.630
how to do it the some of the Arab states
 

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.420
how to do it the some of the Arab states
will say gee we need the Palestinian

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:15.430
will say gee we need the Palestinian
 

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:16.980
will say gee we need the Palestinian
monkey off our back and then we can do

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:16.990
monkey off our back and then we can do
 

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.020
monkey off our back and then we can do
much more with the Israelis and the way

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:19.030
much more with the Israelis and the way
 

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.430
much more with the Israelis and the way
they would get the monkey off the back

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:20.440
they would get the monkey off the back
 

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.140
they would get the monkey off the back
is basically have Israel concede

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:22.150
is basically have Israel concede
 

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.840
is basically have Israel concede
anything and from their standpoint there

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:24.850
anything and from their standpoint there
 

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.360
anything and from their standpoint there
is no concession that's two large from

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:27.370
is no concession that's two large from
 

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:28.680
is no concession that's two large from
the Israeli standpoint obviously a

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:28.690
the Israeli standpoint obviously a
 

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.120
the Israeli standpoint obviously a
concession that threatens the viability

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:30.130
concession that threatens the viability
 

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:32.880
concession that threatens the viability
of state is too large so you know that's

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:32.890
of state is too large so you know that's
 

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:36.000
of state is too large so you know that's
where somehow the US has to find a

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:36.010
where somehow the US has to find a
 

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.910
where somehow the US has to find a
medium of balance that's one of the

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:38.920
medium of balance that's one of the
 

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.950
medium of balance that's one of the
things that a mediator has to do so I

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:40.960
things that a mediator has to do so I
 

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.079
things that a mediator has to do so I
think there's much more where we have

00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:43.089
think there's much more where we have
 

00:13:43.089 --> 00:13:45.360
think there's much more where we have
convergences with the Israelis certainly

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:45.370
convergences with the Israelis certainly
 

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.249
convergences with the Israelis certainly
in terms of values we have a fundamental

00:13:47.249 --> 00:13:47.259
in terms of values we have a fundamental
 

00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:49.559
in terms of values we have a fundamental
convergence with the Israelis in terms

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:49.569
convergence with the Israelis in terms
 

00:13:49.569 --> 00:13:53.460
convergence with the Israelis in terms
of cooperating on issues military kinds

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:53.470
of cooperating on issues military kinds
 

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.840
of cooperating on issues military kinds
of issues or intelligence kinds of

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:54.850
of issues or intelligence kinds of
 

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.610
of issues or intelligence kinds of
issues we have enormous convergence with

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:56.620
issues we have enormous convergence with
 

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.579
issues we have enormous convergence with
the Israelis and I think in terms of

00:13:59.579 --> 00:13:59.589
the Israelis and I think in terms of
 

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:02.280
the Israelis and I think in terms of
wanting peace and even the competition

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:02.290
wanting peace and even the competition
 

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:03.900
wanting peace and even the competition
with the radical Islamists a struggled

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:03.910
with the radical Islamists a struggled
 

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.129
with the radical Islamists a struggled
radicalism is we have great deal of

00:14:05.129 --> 00:14:05.139
radicalism is we have great deal of
 

00:14:05.139 --> 00:14:07.949
radicalism is we have great deal of
convergence it's where we we get into

00:14:07.949 --> 00:14:07.959
convergence it's where we we get into
 

00:14:07.959 --> 00:14:11.249
convergence it's where we we get into
those points where the Arab sets of

00:14:11.249 --> 00:14:11.259
those points where the Arab sets of
 

00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:15.329
those points where the Arab sets of
interests are seen as somehow in tension

00:14:15.329 --> 00:14:15.339
interests are seen as somehow in tension
 

00:14:15.339 --> 00:14:17.160
interests are seen as somehow in tension
especially because we're trying to

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:17.170
especially because we're trying to
 

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:18.600
especially because we're trying to
maintain certain kinds of relations with

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:18.610
maintain certain kinds of relations with
 

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:20.850
maintain certain kinds of relations with
them they have views of what it will

them they have views of what it will
take to deal with the threats to all of

00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959
take to deal with the threats to all of
 

00:14:22.959 --> 00:14:25.769
take to deal with the threats to all of
us that might not converge exactly with

00:14:25.769 --> 00:14:25.779
us that might not converge exactly with
 

00:14:25.779 --> 00:14:29.950
us that might not converge exactly with
the way the Israelis see those threats

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:29.960
 
 

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.890

in the case of the Iranians the whole
Iranian leadership and elite wants

Iranian leadership and elite wants

Iranian leadership and elite wants
nuclear weapons but not all of them

nuclear weapons but not all of them
 

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.190
nuclear weapons but not all of them
wanted at any price and the again

statecraft is governed by recognizing

statecraft is governed by recognizing

statecraft is governed by recognizing
