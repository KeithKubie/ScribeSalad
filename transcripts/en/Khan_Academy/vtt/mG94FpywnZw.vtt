00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.900
We're on problem 24.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.650
Use the solution procedure below
to answer the question

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:07.960
that follows.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.600
Which of the following is a
major flaw in the procedure

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.360
shown above?

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.430
So let's look for some flaws.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.070
So the way I always like to do
it is just think about how I

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.790
would have done it.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.850
So if I started with minus 3x
plus 25 is equal to 4, the

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.990
first thing I would do is
subtract 25 from both sides of

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.250
the equation.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.030
So I would take a minus 25 from
the left-hand side, and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.860
then a minus 25 from the
right-hand side.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.840
And it looks like that's what
the person did-- took a minus

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.320
25 there and they took a minus
the 25, just like that.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.160
And then he said, OK,
well that's the same

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.040
thing as minus 21.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.080
So then you would get minus 3x,
on the left-hand side, is

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.290
equal to minus 21.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.630
I have a sense that I already
know what the major flaw is.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.200
He's doing two steps, and he's
not writing a nice clean

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.940
equality, and he's trying
to skip steps.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.310
And my guess is that he's
going to get confused.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.610
So then you end up with
minus 3x on the

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.910
left-hand side, right?

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.380
Because these cancel out.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.770
Minus 3x is equal to minus 21.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.660
So you get that.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.600
So you get that right there.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.070
So you get minus 3x is equal
to minus 21, and then you

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.750
divide both sides by minus 3,
and you get x is equal to 7.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.340
So the guy got the right answer,
however he or she may

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.870
have done it.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.920
But this is a little confusing,
because then

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.410
divides by 3, but you know, this
divide by minus 3, which

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.510
you do have to do, you
have to do to both

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.670
sides of this equation.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.870
I just don't see where
he or she did it.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.940
Maybe, you know, somehow
they just

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.830
divided by minus 3 randomly.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:44.400
I don't know why.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.090
They didn't really understand
the notion of

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.660
inequality on an equation.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.210
You have to do the same
thing to both

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.060
sides of this equation.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.840
So let's see what
the choices are.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.230
The concept of the opposite
number is confused with

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.950
subtraction.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:59.630
No, not really.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.960
The equal sign is used to
connect expressions

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.560
that are not equal.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.030
That sounds about right, because
this expression, that

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.210
expression, and this
are equal.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.280
We got minus 3x plus 25, minus
25, which is just minus 3x.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.550
That does indeed equal 4
minus 25 or minus 21.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.090
But that does not equal minus
21 divided by minus 3.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.020
So this looks like my answer.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.490
Let's look at the
other choices.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.990
The solution contains
an error in the

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.120
arithmetic of signed numbers.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.510
No, the solution is
arithmetically correct.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.640
D, the order of operations
between subtraction and

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.210
division is reversed.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.400
I really don't see that.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.440
So, my choice would be B.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.460
They don't-- the equal sign--
this, right here, does not

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.990
equal this, right over there.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.370
Next problem.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.370
25.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.570
Use the diagram below
to answer the

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.355
question that follows.

00:02:56.355 --> 00:02:57.740
So let's see, they're extending

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.970
by 1 in each direction.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.450
They're kind of creating
this triangle.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.540
If the pattern continues, how
many more small squares are in

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.050
figure 100 than are
in figure 99?

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.980
So let's think, every time we
increment it, how may squares

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.550
are we adding?

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.875
When we go from 1 to 2,
how many did we add?

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:17.790
We added 1, 2 squares.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.680
When we went from 2 to 3,
how many did we add?

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.030
We added 1, 2, 3 squares.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.450
When we went from 3 to 4,
how many did we add?

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.560
We added 1, 2, 3, 4 squares.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.330
Those are the 4 that are
kind of layered over

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.580
the 3, right there.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.430
So when you go from
99 to 100, we're

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.210
going to add 100 squares.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.540
We're going to add
100 squares.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:49.832
When we go from n to n plus 1,
we're adding n plus 1 squares.

00:03:49.832 --> 00:03:53.960
So you go from 99 to 100,
you add 100 squares.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.820
Or there are 100 more squares
in the 100 figure

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.700
than in the 99 figure.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.950
Next problem.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.170
All right.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.890
Problem 26.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.860
Use the table below to answer
the question that follows.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.486
We have a x-axis, and then
we have a y-axis.

00:04:12.486 --> 00:04:14.820
And what do they
want us to do?

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.940
Each number in the table above
represents a value of w that

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.040
is determined by the values
of integers x and y.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:30.340
For example, when x equals 2, y
equals 1, w is equal to 21.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.210
If the pattern continues, what
is the value of w when x is

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:43.320
equal to 20, and y
is equal to 8?

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.800
So let's see if we can get
a sense of what w is.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.160
So w, if you remember your
functions, w is a function

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.820
of-- I can write it
like that-- is a

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.550
function of x and y.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.255
That might confuse you.

00:04:55.255 --> 00:04:56.480
It may or may not.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.730
We just have to figure out
what this function is.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.240
So if you look at this pattern
every time we look here, we

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.750
go-- so this is 0 to 8.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.660
And then we go from 8 to 16.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.600
So, this is, we're adding 8
every time we go to the right.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.160
We're adding 8, right?

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.180
It looks like we are.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.920
And then as we go up,
what are we doing?

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.890
So this is plus 8.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.310
So for example, this right
here is 4 times 8.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.670
This is 3 times 8.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.850
So it looks like w is
equal to 8 times x.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.260
But then as you go
up, what happens?

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.490
As you go up, we're adding
5 every time.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.710
Is that throughout
the whole table?

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:40.150
Yeah, sure.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.550
37 plus 5 is 42.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.410
We add 5 every time.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.060
And we start here,
just 8 times x.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.110
And then when y is 0, and then
we add 1 times 5, 2 times 5.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.520
Looks like it's 8x plus 5y.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.760
That's what w is.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.040
Right?

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.190
And let's verify it.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.690
We pick the point 3, 2, so that
would be w is equal to 8

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.800
times 3, plus 5 times 2.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.790
So w is equal to 24 plus 10 is
equal to 34, which is, indeed,

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:15.830
what it equals.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.470
So we found our function
of x and y.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.240
And what are they asking?

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.370
If the pattern continues, what
is the value when x is equal

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.420
to 20 and y is equal to 8?

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:29.600
Well, in that situation, w is
equal to 8 times x, which is

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:36.620
20, plus 5 times y, which is 8,
which is equal to 160 plus

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.290
40, which is equal to 200.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.430
And that is choice B.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.690
Next problem.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.070
Problem 27.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:54.340
The function r of x gives the
remainder when a whole number

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.600
x is divided by 10.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.030
Which of the following graphs
represents r of x?

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.860
So when you take something on
the x-axis and divide it by

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.720
10, r of x should be
its remainder.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.350
So we take 5 divided by 10.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.610
The remainder is 5.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.680
So we should plot out to
be a 5 right there.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.620
When you take 10 divided by 10,
your answer is-- well, the

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.480
answer is 1, and your
remainder is 0.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.860
So that looks right.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.760
And then 15, the
remainder is 5.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.690
So those look right.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:31.760
Let's see, when you plot, when
you have 1, 1 divided by 5, 1

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.980
divided by-- sorry-- 1 divided
by 10, the remainder is 1.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:35.930
That looks right.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.600
This graph A looks
pretty good.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.180
If you take, you know,
20 divided by 10, the

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:41.960
remainder is 0.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.010
If you take 30 divided by
10, the remainder is 0.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.180
If you take 29 divided
by 10, the

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.260
remainder is 9, right there.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.230
19 divided by 10, the
remainder is 9.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.970
9 divided by 10, the
remainder is 9.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:55.110
This one looks pretty good.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.940
Let's see what the
other ones do.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:02.250
So here, let's see, when I take
10 divided by 10, the

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.580
remainder should be 0.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.610
This should be a 0 right here,
but they have it the

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.080
remainder being 10.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.590
So this is wrong, right
off the bat.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.220
And then here, the remainder
when a whole number x is

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.290
divided by-- this is a whole
number, right, whole number x.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.970
Here, they're doing it for
essentially all of the real

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.050
numbers, right?

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.330
This would be true if they
said any real number, but

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.820
they're including fractions,
because they're filling in the

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:26.780
gaps right here.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.970
So C and D are not dealing
with whole numbers.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:34.289
So our answer is definitely A.
