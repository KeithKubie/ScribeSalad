00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.110
In this video, we're going
to hopefully understand

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.980
why the exponential
form of a complex number

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.635
is actually useful.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.610
So let's say we want
to solve the equation x

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.210
to the third power
is equal to 1.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.900
So we want to find all of
the real and/or complex roots

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.540
of this equation
right over here.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.070
This is the same thing
as x to the third minus 1

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.950
is equal to 0.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.470
So we're looking for all the
real and complex roots of this.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.170
And there are ways to do
this without exponential form

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.530
of a complex number.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.370
But the technique we're
going to see in this video

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.750
could be applied if this
was x to the fifth minus 1,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.840
or x to the 13th minus 1.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.020
And it's also going to
show us the patterns that

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.530
emerge when you start looking
at things on an Argand diagram.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.220
So to do this, let's think about
the exponential representation

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.330
of 1.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.800
So let's just say
z is equal to 1.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.140
1 is a complex number.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.220
It's a real number.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.660
All real numbers are
also complex numbers.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.150
They're a subset.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.860
They're in the complex plane.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.110
They just don't have
an imaginary part.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.200
So let's draw this
on an Argand diagram.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.850
So that's my real axis.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.955
This is my imaginary axis.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.870
And so this is the real.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.660
This is the imaginary.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.720
And if I wanted to
represent z equals 1,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.570
it only has a real part.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.860
So let me just
draw 1 all around.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.260
Negative 1.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.994
Negative 1.

00:01:36.994 --> 00:01:38.720
z looks like this.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.560
z would look like
that, a position

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.150
vector that just goes to 1, 0.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.500
One way to view it-- this is
the same thing as equal to 1

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.270
plus 0i.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.610
Now, let's put this
in exponential form.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.000
Well, its magnitude is
pretty straightforward.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.780
The magnitude of z is just
the length of this vector,

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.690
or it's the absolute value of 1.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.060
That's just going to be 1.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.030
Now, what's the argument of z?

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.670
What's the angle
that this vector

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.050
makes with the
positive real axis?

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.790
Well, it's on the
positive real axis.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.140
It's a real number.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.340
So it has no angle.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.960
So the arg of z is 0.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.420
So that might not be
too interesting so far.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:40.550
We just figured out that 1 is
equal to 1 times e to the 0i.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.770
And this is kind of obvious.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.060
e to the 0-- this is
just going to be 0.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.270
0 times i is 0.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.770
e to the 0 is going to be
1, times 1 is equal to 1.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.570
Not a big deal there.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.690
But what is neat is that this
argument-- you could view it

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.800
as 0 radians, or you could
go all the way around

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.100
and add 2 pi to it and
get to the same point.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.540
So the argument of our complex
number-- or of the number 1,

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.910
really-- could also be an angle
of 2 pi, or an angle of 4 pi,

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.700
or an angle of 6 pi,
or an angle of 8 pi.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.860
So we can write 1
as 1 times e-- I

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.520
won't write the 1
anymore-- 1 times

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:31.120
e to the 2 pi i, or 1
times e to the 4 pi i.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.740
And the reason why
this is interesting

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.544
is then this equation
right here can

00:03:35.544 --> 00:03:36.710
be written in multiple ways.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.200
It can be written as x to
the third is equal to 1.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.970
It could be written
as x to the third

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.550
is equal to e to the 2 pi i.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.370
Or it could be written
as x to the third

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.737
is equal to e to the 4 pi i.

00:03:57.844 --> 00:03:59.260
And this is
interesting, and we're

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.030
going to see this in a second.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.140
Let's take both sides
of all these equations

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.900
to the one-third
power to solve for x.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.810
So to the one-third.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.560
We're going to take
that to the one-third.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.690
We're going to do that
same thing over here.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.900
We're just taking everything
to the one-third power

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.839
to solve for the x's in
each of these equations.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.160
To the one-third power.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.649
So this first equation over
here becomes x is equal to 1

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:25.510
to the one-third power,
which is just equal to 1.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.740
Now, what's the second
equation become?

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.680
This second equation-- x is
equal to e to the-- well,

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.325
this is going to be the
2 pi over 3, i power.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.160
And then this
equation over here is

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.430
going to be-- so x is going
to be equal to-- obviously,

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.220
the 3 to the one-third, that
just becomes x to the 1.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.620
Let me do that same blue.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:05:03.590
x over here is going to be equal
to e to the 4 pi over 3, i.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.580
So let's think about
this for a little bit.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.530
What is this?

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.070
So immediately, what's
the argument here?

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.670
So these are three
different roots.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.649
Let me call this x1, x2, and x3.

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:20.190
So these are three
different numbers.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.130
One of the roots is 1.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.510
That's pretty clear over here.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.760
1 is one of the cube
roots of itself.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.270
But these are other numbers.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.370
And these are going
to be complex numbers.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.545
So let's visualize these
numbers a little bit.

00:05:33.545 --> 00:05:34.545
So what is the argument?

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.910
The magnitude of x2
is still clearly 1.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.015
It's the coefficient
out in front of the e.

00:05:44.015 --> 00:05:46.465
It's clearly 1.

00:05:46.465 --> 00:05:48.410
Let me do that same color.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.880
The magnitude of x3 is
also clearly going to be 1.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.780
But what is the argument of x2?

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.090
What is phi?

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.000
What is the argument?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.190
Well, it's 2 pi over 3.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.620
So how would we draw x2?

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.680
So the angle is 2 pi over 3.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.830
It's easier for me to
visualize in degrees.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.050
So 2 pi is 360 degrees.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.530
360 degrees divided
by 3 is 120 degrees.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.300
So this is going
to be-- 120 degrees

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.345
is 60 short of-- so it's
going to look like this.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.210
So this angle right
here, its argument

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.760
is going to be
120 degrees, which

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.686
is the same thing
as 2 pi over 3.

00:06:38.686 --> 00:06:40.560
And it's going to have
the exact same length.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.976
So let me do it
in the same color.

00:06:41.976 --> 00:06:43.030
So this is x1.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.980
So that is this green
color right over here.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.349
x2 is this magenta
one right over here.

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:51.890
And they all have
the same magnitude.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.056
So we really just rotate it.

00:06:53.056 --> 00:06:54.690
We rotate it 120 degrees.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:55.750
And what about x3?

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.770
What's its argument?

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.100
What's x3's argument?

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.480
Its argument is 4 pi over 3.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.400
That's the same thing
as 720 degrees over 3,

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.130
if we were to put
it into degrees.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:16.890
And so 3 goes into
720-- what is it?

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.710
240?

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:19.780
720.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.350
240.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.890
Right.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.230
I should have known that.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.710
So 240 degrees-- we're
going to go 180 degrees,

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.950
and then go another 60 degrees.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.680
So it's going to
be right over here.

00:07:35.152 --> 00:07:36.740
So let me draw it like this.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.310
It's going to be
right over here.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.000
That angle right
over there is 4 pi

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.400
over 3 radians, which
is equal to 240 degrees.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.290
And once again, it has
the same magnitude.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.310
So what we just saw is
when I take the cube

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.210
roots of this real
number, I'm essentially

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.120
taking the entire--
I guess we could

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.350
call it the entire
circle or the entire 360

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.480
degrees or the
entire 2 pi radians--

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:12.180
and I'm dividing it
into three, essentially.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.250
This is one third.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.120
Then we have
another 120 degrees.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.310
And then we have
another 120 degrees.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.216
And so you see the pattern of
where all of the roots are.

00:08:20.216 --> 00:08:21.840
And in case you're
still not satisfied,

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.680
you're just like, well, you said
you would find complex roots.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.870
Yeah, I'm not used
to this or this

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.350
as actually being
complex numbers.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:34.020
I actually want it to be in the
form a plus bi-- we can easily

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.820
figure it out from
this right over here.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:47.510
So x2-- it's going to be equal
to the cosine of 2 pi over 3

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:52.090
plus i times the
sine of 2 pi over 3.

00:08:55.624 --> 00:08:57.040
And if you look
at this over here,

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.206
we can figure out what those
things are going to be.

00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:01.060
This is the angle
right over here.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.120
If this angle right over
here is 60 degrees-- which

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.550
it is, because
this up here is 30

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.860
degrees-- the hypotenuse,
or the length, is 1, then

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.690
this over here is
square root of 3 over 2.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.870
And then this distance right
over here is negative 1/2.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:23.340
So x2 is going to be equal
to-- cosine of 2 pi over 3

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.237
is-- negative 1/2.

00:09:26.237 --> 00:09:27.070
Did I do that right?

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:32.102
Yep, negative 1/2, plus i
times sine of 2 pi over 3.

00:09:32.102 --> 00:09:33.560
That's this height
over here, which

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.330
is square root of 3 over 2, i.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.770
So that's x2.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.110
And we could do the
exact same thing with x3.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.965
x3 is going to be
equal to its x value.

00:09:45.965 --> 00:09:47.340
Or I should say
its real value is

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.715
going to be the
exact same thing.

00:09:48.715 --> 00:09:51.550
It's going to be negative 1/2.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:56.690
And then, its imaginary
value, so this angle right

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:00.750
over here-- this just from
the negative real axis down

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.736
to the vector-- is going
to be negative 60 degrees.

00:10:03.736 --> 00:10:05.110
So this height
right over here is

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.130
going to be negative
square root of 3 over 2.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:13.050
So it's negative 1/2 minus the
square root of 3 over 2, i.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:17.580
So using this technique,
we were able to find

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.300
the three complex roots of 1.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.250
This is one of them.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.100
This is another one.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.015
And of course, 1 is
one of them as well.

00:10:27.015 --> 00:10:27.890
Where did we do that?

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.379
1 is one of them as well.

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:31.170
And you could use this
exact same technique

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.700
if we were finding
the fourth roots.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.170
We would take the 2 pi
radians, or the 360 degrees,

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:37.356
and divide it into 4.

00:10:37.356 --> 00:10:38.730
And so it would
actually be this.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:40.220
It would be i.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.225
It would be negative 1.

00:10:41.225 --> 00:10:42.350
And it would be negative i.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.890
And we know if you take i
to the fourth, you get 1.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:48.270
If you take negative i
to the fourth, you get 1.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.600
And if you take negative 1
to the fourth, you get 1.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.391
And if you take 1 to
the fourth, you get 1.

00:10:52.391 --> 00:10:54.610
And so you can find
the eighth roots of 1

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.120
using this technique.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.290
Now, the other question that
might be popping in your brain

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:03.686
is, why did I stop
at e to the 4 pi i?

00:11:03.686 --> 00:11:05.060
Why didn't I go
on and say, well,

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.350
this is equal to e to the 6 pi
i and look for another root?

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.910
And so if I did that, if I
said x to the third-- let's say

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.900
I wanted to find a
fourth root here, maybe.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:18.430
x to the third is equal
to e to the 6 pi i.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.140
And I take both sides
of this equation

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.570
to the one-third power.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:28.200
Taking this to the one third,
I would get e to the 2 pi i.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.470
Well, what's e to the
2 pi i? e to the 2 pi

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.930
i would just get us back to 1.

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:35.580
So when I added 2 pi again, it
just gets us back to this root

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:36.810
again.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.400
If I took e to the 6 pi,
if I took e to the 8 pi,

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.860
I would get this root again.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:46.800
So you're going to get
only three roots if you're

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.050
finding the third
roots of something.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.678
Anything beyond that, it
just becomes redundant.
