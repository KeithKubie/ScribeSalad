results and a little bit of our
 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.660
results and a little bit of our
methodology and then maybe some things

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670
methodology and then maybe some things
 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.490

that are yet to be proved so let's start

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500
that are yet to be proved so let's start
 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.529
that are yet to be proved so let's start
with left or durability I say that a

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539
with left or durability I say that a
 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.419
with left or durability I say that a
non-trivial group is left were durable

00:01:04.419 --> 00:01:04.429

the group essentially which respects
left multiplication within the group so

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330
left multiplication within the group so
 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.810
left multiplication within the group so
G has less than H then after you must be

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820
G has less than H then after you must be
 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.960

if you have an inequality you add the

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500
if you have an inequality you add the
 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.710
if you have an inequality you add the
same thing to both sides

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720
same thing to both sides
 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.990
same thing to both sides
surely you must get inequality that's

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000
surely you must get inequality that's
 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.440
surely you must get inequality that's
still true and you're not example is

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450
still true and you're not example is
 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.279

so she is greater than one

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070
so she is greater than one
 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.240
so she is greater than one
well we know that it's if we assuming I

say G is greater than fun well now we

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330
say G is greater than fun well now we
 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.130
say G is greater than fun well now we
can multiply on both sides by G so you

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140
can multiply on both sides by G so you
 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.840
can multiply on both sides by G so you
get G super creative gene but emoji is

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850
get G super creative gene but emoji is
 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.430
get G super creative gene but emoji is
available so G squared is greater than

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440
available so G squared is greater than
 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.020
available so G squared is greater than

basically the embedding of the circle

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750
basically the embedding of the circle
 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:05:03.750
basically the embedding of the circle
into our s3 and here's another example

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760
into our s3 and here's another example
 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.330
into our s3 and here's another example
of a knot and a particularly interesting

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340
of a knot and a particularly interesting
 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.060
of a knot and a particularly interesting
one is the torus knot so what you do the

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070
one is the torus knot so what you do the
 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.410
one is the torus knot so what you do the
case in the torus knot is you take a

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420
case in the torus knot is you take a
 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.380
case in the torus knot is you take a
torus right and you basically inscribe

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390
torus right and you basically inscribe
 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.050
torus right and you basically inscribe
your embedding an s-1 along the torrance

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060
your embedding an s-1 along the torrance
 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.290
your embedding an s-1 along the torrance
right so I'm protecting what you can do

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300
right so I'm protecting what you can do
 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.900
right so I'm protecting what you can do
is you can take a pair P Q right and

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910
is you can take a pair P Q right and
 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.760
is you can take a pair P Q right and
that's your wrap key times around this

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770
that's your wrap key times around this
 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.640
that's your wrap key times around this
way you wrap to Q times around the

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650
way you wrap to Q times around the
 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.909
way you wrap to Q times around the
meridian right we call this the TP q

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919
meridian right we call this the TP q
 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.330
meridian right we call this the TP q
before side so this is one picture of it

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340
before side so this is one picture of it
 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.640
before side so this is one picture of it
another's like this you can sort of also

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650
another's like this you can sort of also

giving them five whole twists and then

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220
giving them five whole twists and then
 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.880
giving them five whole twists and then
closing it all so so I think more

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890
closing it all so so I think more
 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.950
closing it all so so I think more
complicated than this is the twisted

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960
complicated than this is the twisted
 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.810
complicated than this is the twisted
tourists line so what you do in the case

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820
tourists line so what you do in the case
 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.430
tourists line so what you do in the case
of the twisted torus knot is you take

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440
of the twisted torus knot is you take
 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.710
of the twisted torus knot is you take

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720
care of tpq torus knot you're taking
 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.890
care of tpq torus knot you're taking
elbow strands then you put em twists on

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900
elbow strands then you put em twists on
 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.130
elbow strands then you put em twists on
you can view this as sort of the knots

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140
you can view this as sort of the knots
 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.260
you can view this as sort of the knots
genius to Jesus through surface so it

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270
genius to Jesus through surface so it
 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.520
genius to Jesus through surface so it
looks something like this and we call

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530
looks something like this and we call
 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.560
looks something like this and we call
this the TP qlm torso ok so now that

this the TP qlm torso ok so now that
 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.940
this the TP qlm torso ok so now that
we've got these knobs we need to somehow

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950
we've got these knobs we need to somehow
 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.010
we've got these knobs we need to somehow

can we do this by a process called on

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940
can we do this by a process called on

can we do this by a process called on
gain surgery so what you do in a surgery

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180
gain surgery so what you do in a surgery
 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:21.620
gain surgery so what you do in a surgery
is is essentially basically let's say

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630
is is essentially basically let's say
 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.080
is is essentially basically let's say
you have a knot or some simplicity let

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090
you have a knot or some simplicity let
 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.760
you have a knot or some simplicity let
just say it's the unknot or which is

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770
just say it's the unknot or which is
 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:31.700
just say it's the unknot or which is
just the circle and another course over

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710
just the circle and another course over
 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.370
just the circle and another course over
here so if you take any nod you thinking

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380
here so if you take any nod you thinking
 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:41.930
here so if you take any nod you thinking
it a little bit and you'll get a

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940
it a little bit and you'll get a
 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.730
it a little bit and you'll get a
tortoise right or something close to a

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740
tortoise right or something close to a
 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.630
tortoise right or something close to a
tortoise with them twisting over then

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:47.640
tortoise with them twisting over then
 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.100
tortoise with them twisting over then
what you do is you basically take the

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110
what you do is you basically take the
 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.130
what you do is you basically take the
compliment inside s3 right so you get

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:52.140
compliment inside s3 right so you get
 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.910
compliment inside s3 right so you get
all this stuff around here right and so

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:55.920
all this stuff around here right and so
 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.880
all this stuff around here right and so
now you have them you have on s3 but

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:58.890
now you have them you have on s3 but
 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.710
now you have them you have on s3 but
it's missing a torus on the inside right

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720
it's missing a torus on the inside right
 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.610
it's missing a torus on the inside right
so now what you have to do is to make it

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620
so now what you have to do is to make it
 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.410
so now what you have to do is to make it
slightly more complex is you have to do

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:06.420
slightly more complex is you have to do
 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.920
slightly more complex is you have to do
back in this chorus so how do you do

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:09.930
back in this chorus so how do you do
 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.300
back in this chorus so how do you do
this right well if you want to glue back

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.310
this right well if you want to glue back
 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.720
this right well if you want to glue back
in a torus right you have to specify

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:13.730
in a torus right you have to specify
 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.660
in a torus right you have to specify
where the part essentially on the

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:17.670
where the part essentially on the
 

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.420
where the part essentially on the
meridians going to go right so basically

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.430
meridians going to go right so basically
 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.240
meridians going to go right so basically
what you do is so by the specified

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.250
what you do is so by the specified
 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.280
what you do is so by the specified
regulus meridians going to go I'll be

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:25.290
regulus meridians going to go I'll be
 

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.990
regulus meridians going to go I'll be
able to glue back in the entire chorus

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000
able to glue back in the entire chorus
 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.620
able to glue back in the entire chorus
so this is basically specified by a

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:30.630
so this is basically specified by a
 

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.010
so this is basically specified by a
rational number arm right because if I

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020
rational number arm right because if I
 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.790
rational number arm right because if I
don't know where R is equal to P over Q

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800
don't know where R is equal to P over Q
 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.040
don't know where R is equal to P over Q
that will correspond to basically if I

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.050
that will correspond to basically if I
 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:40.430
that will correspond to basically if I
go

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.440
go
 

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.470
go
times around this way grabbing key times

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:42.480
times around this way grabbing key times
 

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.970
times around this way grabbing key times
around this so it's the same concept of

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:43.980
around this so it's the same concept of
 

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.020
around this so it's the same concept of
the Taurus right so I glued it back in

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:48.030
the Taurus right so I glued it back in
 

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:52.280
the Taurus right so I glued it back in
like this right and basically it'll take

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:52.290
like this right and basically it'll take
 

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:53.840
like this right and basically it'll take
you to this rational number R which

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:53.850
you to this rational number R which
 

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.160
you to this rational number R which
corresponds to the slope that you're

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:55.170
corresponds to the slope that you're
 

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.050
corresponds to the slope that you're
moving along and this is not and will

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:57.060
moving along and this is not and will
 

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.760
moving along and this is not and will
give you a three-month right so in a

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:01.770
give you a three-month right so in a
 

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:04.570
give you a three-month right so in a

Pete okay or M now they either had to
fix K or M so we have to try to

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:05.610
fix K or M so we have to try to
 

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:08.630
fix K or M so we have to try to
generalize that result for people's

Walt so what we did was we considered

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:14.070
Walt so what we did was we considered
 

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.790
Walt so what we did was we considered
cases where and we were positive or

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800
cases where and we were positive or
 

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.940
cases where and we were positive or
negative but it turns out and gets stuck

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:19.950
negative but it turns out and gets stuck
 

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.150
negative but it turns out and gets stuck
with and we are both negative so we were

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.160
with and we are both negative so we were
 

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.660
with and we are both negative so we were
really stuck and then a paper by each

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:26.670
really stuck and then a paper by each

made of all our results useless because

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:32.810
made of all our results useless because
 

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:36.080

general so we were like where do we go

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:47.910
general so we were like where do we go
 

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.600

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:10.730
classes le is 2 and l equals P minus 2 M
equals 1 and helices P minus 1 so

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:10.740
equals 1 and helices P minus 1 so
 

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.490
equals 1 and helices P minus 1 so
we wondered whether it was possible to

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:13.500
we wondered whether it was possible to
 

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.730
we wondered whether it was possible to
use the methods of EGR Ottumwa and adapt

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:16.740

that's exactly what we did so cleanly

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:27.930
that's exactly what we did so cleanly
 

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.380
that's exactly what we did so cleanly
Watson's general general case was just

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:30.390
Watson's general general case was just
 

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:39.910
Watson's general general case was just
the first case and we did this first

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:39.920
 

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.949
and our bound on art is larger than the

00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959
and our bound on art is larger than the
 

00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:46.629
and our bound on art is larger than the
bound of day Michael Ian Watson

00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639
bound of day Michael Ian Watson
 

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:52.440
bound of day Michael Ian Watson
so it's better

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:52.450
 

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:56.759
so we proved it for l equals P minus 2 M

00:12:56.759 --> 00:12:56.769
so we proved it for l equals P minus 2 M
 

00:12:56.769 --> 00:12:59.850
so we proved it for l equals P minus 2 M
equals 1 and l equals P minus 1 but we

00:12:59.850 --> 00:12:59.860
equals 1 and l equals P minus 1 but we
 

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.040
equals 1 and l equals P minus 1 but we
weren't able to prove it for Elephants 2

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:02.050
weren't able to prove it for Elephants 2
 

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.250
weren't able to prove it for Elephants 2
and that question still remains open but
