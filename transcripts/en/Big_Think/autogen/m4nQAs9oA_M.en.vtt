I remember when the first search engines

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:07.760
I remember when the first search engines
 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.500
I remember when the first search engines
came around and big back then Alta Vista

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510
came around and big back then Alta Vista
 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.840
came around and big back then Alta Vista
was a very big thing Alta Vista tried to

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:13.850
was a very big thing Alta Vista tried to
 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.730
was a very big thing Alta Vista tried to
strike a balance between the

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740
strike a balance between the
 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.860
strike a balance between the
inconveniences in terms of advertising

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:17.870
inconveniences in terms of advertising
 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.140
inconveniences in terms of advertising
and so on it could put on the user and

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150
and so on it could put on the user and
 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.880
and so on it could put on the user and
the utility it had for the user so it

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890
the utility it had for the user so it
 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.530
the utility it had for the user so it
would for instance mix search results

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540
would for instance mix search results
 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.960
would for instance mix search results
with advertising and at this point

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970
with advertising and at this point
 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.150
with advertising and at this point
Google came along Google was very small

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160
Google came along Google was very small
 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.250
Google came along Google was very small
and inconsequential and nobody really

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260
and inconsequential and nobody really
 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.440
and inconsequential and nobody really
took it seriously but it did an amazing

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450
took it seriously but it did an amazing
 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.389
took it seriously but it did an amazing
thing it did give people exactly what

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399
thing it did give people exactly what
 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.459
thing it did give people exactly what
they wanted it gives them a pretty much

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469
they wanted it gives them a pretty much
 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.290
they wanted it gives them a pretty much
at free experience and gave them exactly

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300
at free experience and gave them exactly
 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.060
at free experience and gave them exactly
the search results that they wanted the

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070
the search results that they wanted the
 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.729
the search results that they wanted the
best ones closest ones to what people

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739
best ones closest ones to what people
 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.860
best ones closest ones to what people
wanted to have and Google dramatically

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870
wanted to have and Google dramatically
 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.419
wanted to have and Google dramatically
outperformed Alta Vista Alta Vista

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:46.429
outperformed Alta Vista Alta Vista
 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.450

disappeared and that was an amazing

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460
disappeared and that was an amazing
 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.459
disappeared and that was an amazing
insight to see that if you are in a

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469
insight to see that if you are in a
 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.590
insight to see that if you are in a
dramatically scalable economy like the

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600
dramatically scalable economy like the
 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.360
dramatically scalable economy like the
internet where you have the biggest

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370
internet where you have the biggest
 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.709
internet where you have the biggest
amount of competition that you can

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719
amount of competition that you can
 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.349
amount of competition that you can
possibly have you need to build a

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359
possibly have you need to build a
 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.079
possibly have you need to build a
product that is optimally aligned with

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089
product that is optimally aligned with
 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:03.759
product that is optimally aligned with
the interest of the users unless you

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769
the interest of the users unless you
 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.500
the interest of the users unless you
manage to get some kind of monopoly and

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510
manage to get some kind of monopoly and
 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.850
manage to get some kind of monopoly and
can drive out other competition and so

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860
can drive out other competition and so
 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.100
can drive out other competition and so
when we build new products in that space

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110
when we build new products in that space
 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.109
when we build new products in that space
we have to think about how to build the

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119
we have to think about how to build the
 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.359
we have to think about how to build the
most useful product not necessarily just

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369
most useful product not necessarily just
 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:17.830
most useful product not necessarily just
the product that is going to make the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840
the product that is going to make the
 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.039
the product that is going to make the
biggest amount of money that is going to

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049
biggest amount of money that is going to
 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.510
biggest amount of money that is going to
have the most efficient business model

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520
have the most efficient business model
 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.359
have the most efficient business model
in some sense or the best business case

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369
in some sense or the best business case
 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.590
in some sense or the best business case
eventually it's going to be the product

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600
eventually it's going to be the product
 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.569
eventually it's going to be the product
that is getting the most used by people

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579
that is getting the most used by people
 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.870
that is getting the most used by people
and people will find out that they will

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880
and people will find out that they will
 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.330
and people will find out that they will
use most what is most useful to them

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340
use most what is most useful to them
 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.649
use most what is most useful to them
in the long run that's going to be the

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659
in the long run that's going to be the
 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.359
in the long run that's going to be the
stuff that is not addictive that is

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369
stuff that is not addictive that is
 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.249
stuff that is not addictive that is
hygienic that serves their actual needs

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259
hygienic that serves their actual needs
 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.230
hygienic that serves their actual needs
that makes them more happy and fulfilled

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240
that makes them more happy and fulfilled
 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.359
that makes them more happy and fulfilled
and right now be mostly build

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369
and right now be mostly build
 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.940
and right now be mostly build
applications that utilize the cravings

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950
applications that utilize the cravings
 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.069
applications that utilize the cravings
of people that make them addicted people

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079
of people that make them addicted people
 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.529
of people that make them addicted people
start checking the smartphones every few

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539
start checking the smartphones every few
 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.209
start checking the smartphones every few
seconds to see if a new email arrived

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219
seconds to see if a new email arrived
 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.279
seconds to see if a new email arrived
but this new email is not going to make

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289
but this new email is not going to make
 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.830
but this new email is not going to make
them more happy unfulfilled this instead

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840
them more happy unfulfilled this instead
 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.169
them more happy unfulfilled this instead
it rocks it takes away their attention

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179
it rocks it takes away their attention
 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.840
it rocks it takes away their attention
so I believe the next big movement and

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850
so I believe the next big movement and
 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.810
so I believe the next big movement and
how we built technical systems will be

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820
how we built technical systems will be
 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.599
how we built technical systems will be
hygienic technology it will be how to

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609
hygienic technology it will be how to
 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.999
hygienic technology it will be how to
build systems that is careful with our

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009
build systems that is careful with our
 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.130
build systems that is careful with our
attention how they use it and that is

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140
attention how they use it and that is
 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.140
attention how they use it and that is
careful with our way of living and what

careful with our way of living and what
 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.640
careful with our way of living and what
we want to achieve with the tools that

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650
we want to achieve with the tools that
 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.940
we want to achieve with the tools that
we are building

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950
we are building
