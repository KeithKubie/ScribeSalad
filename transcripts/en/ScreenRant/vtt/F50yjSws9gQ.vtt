00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:11.290
Even the most intense and dramatic movies
can’t keep actors from goofing around, which

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.469
means plenty of blooper reels and blown takes
for fans to enjoy during the credits, or as

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.109
a bonus on home video.

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.330
But sometimes, a spur-of-the-moment decision,
mistake, or even injury can be too good to

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.330
cut.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.510
Make sure you comment below as you watch!

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.140
We want to know what you guys think!

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.810
Here are ScreenRant’s 10 Movie Bloopers
That Made It To The Final Cut.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.880
Django Unchained

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.100
Quentin Tarantino’s western was one only
a few movies to put Leonardo DiCaprio in a

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.890
supporting role, but the actor found a surprising
way to prove he’s always a superstar.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.839
During the movie’s climactic dinner scene,
Calvin Candie’s anger explodes in smashed

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.049
bone, glass – and blood.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:53.500
The injury was completely unplanned, with
the other actors clearly stunned as the director

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.890
and actor kept on rolling.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.699
You can even watch as DiCaprio picks the glass
from his hand once his speech is over.

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.359
Hopefully, the blood smeared on his co-star
wasn’t quite as real.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:03.600
Mission Impossible 2

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.800
When filming the final fight in Mission: Impossible
2, Tom Cruise and a stuntman trained to make

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.920
their moves as realistic as possible – including
swinging a knife just millimetres from his

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.920
eye.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.009
But when his fellow stuntman told Cruise not
to pull back on his final kick, he didn’t

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.590
– planting his foot squarely on his partner’s
jaw.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.560
Director John Woo used the entire shot, including
the star’s clearly shocked reaction to his

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.840
mistake.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.840
Zoolander

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.000
Ben Stiller’s world famous male model is
better known for his looks than his smarts,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.189
but one joke concerning Derek’s low IQ rose
above the rest.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.590
When David Duchovny’s character explains
why male models make the perfect brainwashed

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.250
assassins, Derek doesn’t quite keep up.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.829
The moment wasn’t planned.

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:48.679
Stiller simply forgot his next line, and instead
of ruining the take, repeated the question.

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:59.159
Duchovny didn’t miss a beat, giving as deadpan
a response as he could, delivering one of

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.770
the more memorable jokes in the process.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.770
Knocked Up

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.969
Stars Seth Rogen, Jason Siegel Jonah Hill,
and Jay Baruchel open the movie with a montage

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.210
of wasting time, capping the scene off with
a ride on a spinning roller coaster.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.810
A ride not ALL of them enjoyed.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.110
Baruchel’s fear of roller coasters was so
strong, he agreed to appear naked in the movie

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.209
just to avoid the ride.

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.599
But the director and cast pushed him to do
it, meaning Siegel had to appear in the flesh,

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.200
and Baruchel’s genuine terror made it into
the movie.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.200
Raiders of the Lost Ark

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.860
When Indiana Jones attempts to ambush a group
of Nazis with his leading lady held prisoner,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.960
the movie’s villain Belloq takes part in
a surprise cameo.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.650
A fly suddenly appearing on an actor’s face
can usually ruin a take, but the bug disappearing

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.010
implies something much worse.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.280
According to actor Paul Freeman, the effects
team thought it would be funnier to erase

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.540
the fly’s escape, turning what could have
been a blown take into an infamous moment

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.659
that’s impossible to miss.

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.500
Midnight Cowboy

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.640
Quite possibly the most famous blooper in
movie history, Ratso Rizzo’s catchphrase

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.959
in Midnight Cowboy was completely unplanned.

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.760
As the crew secretly filmed actors Dustin
Hoffman and Jon Voight on a New York street,

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.040
a taxi nearly hit the pair of them crossing
the street.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.709
The actors maintain it was completely unplanned,
but as Voight watched on in surprise, Hoffman

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.290
turned the blown take into not just the most
well-known scene in the movie, but a line

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.250
that would become even more well-known and
iconic than he could ever have guessed.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.819
The 
Lord of the Rings

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.611
When Gandalf first arrives to visit Bilbo
in Bag End, he shows how hard it can be to

00:03:26.611 --> 00:03:27.970
move through a miniature home.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.560
Actor Ian McKellen’s fumbling with the chandelier
was planned, but his sudden slam into a ceiling

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.560
beam wasn’t.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.200
His surprised shout and laugh were too good
to leave out, and Peter Jackson left the mistake

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.030
in the finished film.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.030
Blade Runner

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.830
Ridley Scott’s sci-fi detective story made
actress Daryl Hannah an up-and-coming star

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.989
overnight, but her dedication to the role
went beyond acting.

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.730
When her character is introduced, she panics,
running off and smashing the window of a parked

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.730
van.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.730
The stunt wasn’t planned, meaning Hannah
simply slammed into the van with enough force

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.069
to shatter the very real glass – and her
elbow along with it.

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.370
She remained in character, making sure the
mistake wound up in the original film – and

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.709
wound up in surgery herself.

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:05.709
Rain Man

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.620
Stars Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman were at
the top of their game in this tale of dysfunctional

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.670
brothers, but that doesn’t mean some unintended
moments were to thank for one of its most

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:13.670
famous moments.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.900
When the pair are squeezed into a phone booth,
Hoffman’s character takes things from bad

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.340
to worse, passing some gas in the cramped
space.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.860
But Hoffman wasn’t making it up, simply
giving his co-star a heads-up on his flatulence.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.700
Cruise took the cue to stay in character,
and the rest is history.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.700
Back to the Future Part 2

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.410
The hover boards may have become the runaway
stars of the Back to the Future series, but

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.170
the futuristic gadgets also led to one of
the trilogy’s most disastrous stunts.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.030
When Biff’s gang tries to take out Marty
in 2015, they wind up smashing through a courthouse

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.030
window.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.230
The risky stunt called for all three actors
to fly through the glass before dropping safely

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.030
below, but an error sent stuntwoman Cheryl
Wheeler-Dixon slamming into a pillar instead.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.540
With the timing thrown off, she was dropped
thirty feet onto the stone below.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.940
She survived the fall, but sustained serious
injuries.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.280
Even more shocking?

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.250
The stunt was only performed once, meaning
her fall can actually be seen in the finished

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.140
film, thankfully cutting away a split second
before impact.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.280
