00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This problem takes place in Florence, Italy.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The Duomo is a famous cathedral in Florence, Italy.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In this problem you are going to calculate the height of the Duomo.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You'll calculate this height based on these dimensions,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which I've given you here, as well as the fact

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that at a certain time of day the sun strikes just right,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
so that one of the sun's rays, which just grazes the tip of the spire here

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
will also just graze the corner of this part of the building

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and land right into this man's eye.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Use these dimensions, use this fact about the sun's ray,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and tell me the height of the Duomo.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Enter your height here in meters,

00:00:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and remember the height is the full distance from this tip all the way down to the bottom.
