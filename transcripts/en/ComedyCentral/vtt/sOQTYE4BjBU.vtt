00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.903 size:88% position:44%
  (upbeat rap music)

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:07.206 size:88% position:44%
 Ha!

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:10.143 size:88% position:44%
  (upbeat rap music)

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:15.681
 - Cha-ching!

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:17.483 size:84% position:42%
  - Hi, I'm Staci Greenbaum

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:19.052 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I'm the Costume
Designer at Broad City.

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:22.221
 - Staci has been with
 us from the beginning.

00:00:22.254 --> 00:00:25.691 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - She was sort of
 that immediate friend.

00:00:25.724 --> 00:00:26.993 size:88% position:44%
 - Whoa, I love that outfit.

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:28.428
 - Thank you.

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:30.897 align:start position:0%
 - Staci has such a great
 balance between looking good,

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.366 align:start position:0%
  looking fine, looking bad,
  but like I'm not gonna

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.469 size:88% position:44%
  fully hate myself
  while I'm editing.

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:37.770 size:84% position:42%
  - For me, it's been like,

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:39.272 size:88% position:44%
  well how would the
  characters dress?

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
 How am I differentiating
 myself from this character?

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:42.775 align:start position:0%
 - [Staci] Abbi typically
 does a lot of physical comedy

00:00:42.808 --> 00:00:44.811
 so whether or not
 it caters to that is

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:46.679 size:88% position:44%
  usually kind of an
  important factor.

00:00:46.712 --> 00:00:49.615 align:start size:88% position:13%
 We play with color
 and pattern and print,

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:51.317
 and I'd say that this season,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.287 size:88% position:44%
  we've kind of been able to
  go the distance on that.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.822
 - Know what, I think
 I need to change into

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:59.125 size:84% position:42%
  something a little more
  casual, like resort wear.

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:00.393
 - Resort wear?

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:03.096
 - Ilana, who's sort of
 an occasional dresser.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.065 align:start position:0%
  She likes to be outlandish
  and a little wacky.

00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:09.235 align:start size:88% position:13%
 But we kind of go from
 zero to 60 on her.

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:11.270 size:88% position:44%
  - Can you remind again why
  you asked me to meet you

00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:14.374 size:88% position:44%
  at what turned out
  to be a sex store?

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:18.010 size:84% position:42%
  - Because I need a second
  opinion on a new leotard.

00:01:18.043 --> 00:01:19.212 size:84% position:42%
  - Come on, Ilana.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.980 align:start size:88% position:13%
- The process with
Abbi and Ilana has been

00:01:21.013 --> 00:01:22.482
extremely collaborative.

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.450
 - Sometimes we're leading and
 then sometimes Staci leads.

00:01:24.483 --> 00:01:25.685 size:84% position:42%
  - Mm-hmm.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.353
- We just want it to feel real.

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:28.921 align:start size:88% position:13%
 When I'm looking
 for new inspiration,
 I'm also looking to,

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:31.824
 sort of, what is the
 arc of their life?

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:33.459 size:88% position:44%
 Cuz that actually
 influences a lot of

00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:34.694 size:84% position:42%
  the choices that we make.

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:37.163
 This is the season
 where Abbi and Ilana

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:38.898
are both kind of starting fresh.

00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:41.267 size:88% position:44%
 - Everyone is gonna see how
 freakin' hot you are today,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.469
 including you.

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.473
 (funky music)

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.410 size:84% position:42%
  - One of my very favorite
  pieces from this season,

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:54.747
 this jean jacket was
 kind of a reference to

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.482
a Don King jean jacket.

00:01:56.515 --> 00:01:59.318 size:88% position:44%
 Also again, a great
 collaboration where
 we sort of picked

00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:00.853
 Ilana's brain, like,

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:02.688 size:88% position:44%
 "Who are the women that are
 important to Ilana Wexler?"

00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:04.690 align:start size:88% position:13%
 And then we kind
 of went from there.

00:02:04.723 --> 00:02:06.859 size:84% position:42%
  It's really fantastic and
  says a lot about Ilana.

00:02:06.892 --> 00:02:09.729 align:start position:0%
 - It looked beautiful on
 you tonight, so (bleep) me.

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:12.532 align:start position:0%
  - One of the things that's
  really fun this season

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:15.801 align:start size:88% position:13%
  is that we do a
  flashback episode.

00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:17.069 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - Thanks again
  for swiping me in.

00:02:17.102 --> 00:02:18.504 size:88% position:44%
 - Oh, you're welcome ma'am.

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:20.973
 - Well, she did a lot
 of research on 2011.

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:23.142 size:88% position:44%
 - [Staci] We had to imagine
 Abbi and Ilana individually

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:25.278 align:start size:88% position:13%
 without the influence
 of one another.

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:28.848 align:start position:0%
 One of the trends that we
 wanted to bring back for Abbi

00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:30.950 align:start position:0%
 was sort of this whole
 peasant, free people moment.

00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:33.719
And belting things that
truly needed no belting.

00:02:33.752 --> 00:02:35.855 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I was always belting
 stuff like that.

00:02:35.888 --> 00:02:39.292
 - Belting, and your
 flats were horrible.

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:41.394 size:84% position:42%
  - Ugh, you're kidding me.

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:44.630
 - Hey.

00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:45.731 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - Florida was a
  big Staci episode.

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:46.699 size:88% position:44%
  - So cute.

00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:48.267
 - We are family now!

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.702 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - This is an outfit
 that Abbi wears

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:51.370 align:start position:0%
  to the condo board
  meeting when it's sort of

00:02:51.403 --> 00:02:52.905 size:84% position:42%
  this big deciding moment.

00:02:52.938 --> 00:02:54.774 align:start position:0%
  - Funny thing about the
  Florida outfits were like,

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.275
we kind of looked cute.

00:02:56.308 --> 00:02:57.944
 They're not just ridiculous.

00:02:57.977 --> 00:02:59.946 size:84% position:42%
  - [Staci] There are seven
  changes for each of them.

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.815 size:84% position:42%
  So we really do a
  whole runaround.

00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:04.217 size:88% position:44%
  - Thanks for the
  full new wardrobe.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.119
 - If fashion is art
 that you're wearing,

00:03:07.152 --> 00:03:10.489 align:start size:88% position:13%
 we are wearing subtle
 nuanced comedy.

00:03:10.522 --> 00:03:12.825 size:88% position:44%
  - The fitting process is
  so fun and sort of the way

00:03:12.858 --> 00:03:15.261
 the girls write really
 lend itself to these

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:17.864
really amazing costume moments.

00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:20.333
 - The dress.

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:21.634
 - Hon, do zip me up.

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:23.436
- [Staci] Broad City is
such a dream to work on.

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:24.704
It's something that I relate to,

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:26.839 size:88% position:44%
  it's something my
  friends relate to.

00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:28.341 size:88% position:44%
  And I think this
  season especially,

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:31.477
 with everything that's going
 on, it just feels really good

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.313 align:start size:88% position:13%
 to be part of a
 show that encourages

00:03:34.346 --> 00:03:37.049
women and really
everyone to just

00:03:37.082 --> 00:03:39.452
be better, to do better,

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:40.653 size:88% position:44%
  and to support each other.

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:42.488 align:start size:88% position:13%
 And that's kind of
 what the show's about.

00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:46.693 size:88% position:44%
  (howling)
  (cheering)
