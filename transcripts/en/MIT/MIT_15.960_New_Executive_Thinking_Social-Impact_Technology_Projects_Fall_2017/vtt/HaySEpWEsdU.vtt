00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.350
ANJALI SASTRY: I've been
teaching at MIT since 2001.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.960
And I've taught all
kinds of classes.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.350
But the innovation I'm excited
to be talking about today is

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.410
a new set of linked projects
that I helped our mid-career

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.440
executive students--
the Sloan Fellow MBAs--

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.660
on this past year.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.930
So I hung up my
shingle and asked

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.820
students who had a passion
for linking technology

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.360
with social impact in some
way to come and talk to me.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.170
And I created with
them a set of projects

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.710
which allowed the students to
really dig into areas that they

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.550
came to MIT passionate
about, but also

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.752
to link it to their coursework
and their degree program.

00:00:53.752 --> 00:00:55.460
SARAH HANSEN: Could
you talk a little bit

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.472
about some of the specific
projects that students did?

00:00:58.472 --> 00:00:59.930
ANJALI SASTRY: The
project students

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.500
did ranged greatly
but all had as a theme

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.390
using what they
were learning here

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.150
and tapping into emerging or
existing technology in new ways

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.230
to find solutions to
problems that face many.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.560
That's the social
impact aspect of it.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.440
And it took with each
student some effort

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.480
to really map out a good enough
and focused enough question

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.180
that was doable as
an independent study

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.440
project and that was deep enough
to allow me to really bring

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.430
to bear the educational goals
that I had for the projects.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.790
So one student,
Doreen, was really

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.610
interested in the problem of
creating agricultural products

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.620
in Africa using crops
and products that are

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.960
grown right there in Africa.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.980
Why is Africa importing a
lot of consumer products

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.570
when the continent has a
lot of agricultural assets?

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.240
So she was really interested
in understanding--

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.120
what are the business models,
what are the constraints, what

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.090
are the opportunities
when it comes to finding

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.420
new ways to create locally
sourced products that could

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.420
actually serve
beauty, nutrition,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.540
or other needs in
her native Zimbabwe

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.850
or elsewhere in Africa.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.970
I'll tell you about
another project.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.020
Idoia, a student who came
to me after deep experience

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.560
at the World Bank, was really
interested in a challenge

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.530
that traditional governmental
organizations really

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.760
wrestle with.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.540
How do we tap into
entrepreneurship

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.670
when we're trying to
serve the public good?

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.000
There seems to be a challenge
in linking the entrepreneur

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.190
and the public sector.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.100
And we know that there are
all kinds of innovations

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.010
that play in this sphere.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.300
From ridesharing and
regulated industries,

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.690
all the way through to providing
in a better way the services

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.640
that governments are
already on the hook for.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.130
So they're either
regulated or they

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.208
are substitutes for
improvements of services

00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:13.250
that governments provide.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.210
And sometimes they're
also missing services.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.220
What are the barriers to this?

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.570
Where are the opportunities?

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.130
What are the trends?

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.100
And can we actually
map out where

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.060
we think this field could go,
of mixing entrepreneurship

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.770
and the public sector?

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.440
One of my students, Aline,
came to MIT completely on fire

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.820
with this idea of tapping
into analytics and AI

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.510
to solve what she saw
as a major challenge

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.310
when it came to bringing finance
to small holder and small scale

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.450
farmers.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.090
She's an expert on
agricultural finance.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.230
And she realized that, in her
native Brazil and elsewhere,

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.920
people who didn't have good
credit standing and good credit

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.330
records--

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.610
farmers who didn't
have those assets--

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.810
couldn't get loans and
were forever locked out.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.230
So there's a big dichotomy
between the people who have

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.230
access to finance
and those who don't.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.560
Could she break down
that barrier in some way?

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.250
Could new forms of data and
technology help do that?

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.840
So instead of relying only
on somebody's credit record,

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.250
could you look at the weather,
their farming choices,

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.670
their behaviors,
and physical data,

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.830
and use it to come
up with a better

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.670
assessment of the riskiness of
a given farmer from the lender's

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:41.750
point of view?

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.520
Slightly technical area.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.580
But it actually has
huge implications

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.850
because it could open the
door to all kinds of folks

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.660
who are excluded from
traditional finance

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.960
by providing other
methods of sorting out

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.770
their riskiness and
their credit worthiness.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.960
SARAH HANSEN: So how did
it all work logistically?

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.490
How did you manage to create
all these different individual

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.930
projects?

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.200
ANJALI SASTRY: So that's the
downside of this approach.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.240
Each project was customized.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.450
It's kind of a boutique
learning experience in a sense.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.030
And one of the
things I've learned

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.060
about trying to innovate
when it comes to teaching

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.950
is you have to be
willing to invest

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.720
a lot the first few rounds--

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.610
the first few years
you do something.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.380
And then over
time, you learn how

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.930
to make it a little more
efficient, streamlined,

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.020
and maybe scalable, and
more cost effective.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.080
But this year was
definitely a labor of love.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.290
So students came to me
with all kinds of ideas.

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.890
And I had open office hours.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.370
I have a wiki page
where students

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.060
can sign up to meet with
me in 20 minute increments.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.160
And I would just set up hours
of these meetings every week

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.400
and sit and talk to
students about their ideas,

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.870
try to formulate some
reasonable next steps,

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.090
really push them to
think about how they're

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.590
using their coursework here
and their presence on campus

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.890
to craft something they
couldn't do anywhere else

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.390
and that spoke to
everything else

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.060
they had access to
while they were here.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.940
So that process took a
lot of back and forth.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.090
Usually, I would meet
with students once a week.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.090
I opened a shared
folder with each of them

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.870
and would shoot materials
that I found into the folder

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.160
and have them load their drafts,
work plans, and other work

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.140
in progress there.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:46.470
And then I also got
into a very quick habit

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.700
of sending any interesting
reading, news article,

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.890
conference notice
directly to the students.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.700
So some of them would be getting
10 emails from me a week.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.680
But that really got
us going because they

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.090
could see I was thinking about
it all week, and they were too.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.120
I learned I had to keep a
whiteboard up in my office with

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.020
each project and each person,
because I had over a dozen

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.160
running, to keep them straight
and try to remember who's doing

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.160
what so that when I saw it--
when I came into the office--

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.410
that person would be on
my mind, or that project

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:20.960
would be on my mind.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.710
SARAH HANSEN: Do you
see this as something

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.567
that is potentially
scalable in the future?

00:07:25.567 --> 00:07:26.400
ANJALI SASTRY: I do.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.192
One question I've been
thinking about a lot

00:07:28.192 --> 00:07:30.630
is how you could also use peers.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:35.820
Could we craft project clusters?

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.160
So could we link the themes?

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.700
But could we also have students
helping each other, coaching

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.500
each other a little bit?

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:49.110
Could we use group meetings
as a way to surface a helpful

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.620
discussion about what's
working and what isn't?

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.550
I think that that's
the next step.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.870
So I think that will
get to some scalability.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.000
I do think-- mundane
as it sounds--

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.680
I think it's also important to
have good forms and paperwork.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.970
Having people really
articulate in writing briefly

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.780
what they want to do and having
a structured kind of update

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.490
process really helps.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.790
Keep the momentum,
and build the focus.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.910
SARAH HANSEN: How do you measure
success in projects like this?

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:22.493
ANJALI SASTRY: That's
a great question

00:08:22.493 --> 00:08:27.480
because students who are
following their passions really

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.560
get into it.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.450
You give them enough freedom,
they will have a good time.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.620
But part of our challenge
as their teachers

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:42.030
is to help make sure that we're
embedding into their approach

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:46.710
enough rigor, that we're looking
at the data and the evidence,

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.870
and that it's being linked
to the content we're

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.340
teaching here.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:55.370
So a passion project by itself
may or may not be academic.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.380
So there's a bit
of tension there

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:04.920
of us having to remind students
of the need to keep making

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.820
all of these connections.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.090
So I would really
view success as when

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:15.210
we're able to get the students
to not only pull out, develop,

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:19.890
polish a great new idea, but
also to link it to what they've

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:25.350
been learning here and test
their ideas with a level

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.870
of attention to the data--

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.400
even if it's qualitative--

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.290
that really we can
all stand behind.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:35.252
SARAH HANSEN: And how did you
do that in these projects?

00:09:35.252 --> 00:09:36.960
ANJALI SASTRY: So part
of the requirement

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.600
is to really make sure
that if a student--

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.100
there's actually
quite a lot of work

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:47.250
in trying to unpack the logic,
the thinking behind a new idea.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.520
And I would spend a lot of
time trying to help figure out,

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.150
where is it we need to drill
down to backup this idea?

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.510
Where is it that we use the
literature and the research,

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.200
where you're going to do
desk research to shore up

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.675
one leg of what you're doing?

00:10:02.675 --> 00:10:04.050
And where is it
that you're going

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.150
to gather new information--

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:10.800
whether it's by observation, by
interviews, by other methods--

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.160
that you can bring to bear?

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.000
So I really was
looking for both.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.120
Where's the link to other
people's work to the research

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.230
and the literature?

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.210
Where's the link to
something new that you've

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:24.090
uncovered using methods
that you were going

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.410
to describe systematically?

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:28.650
SARAH HANSEN: I see.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:30.570
ANJALI SASTRY: The
great thing about this

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.550
is that it helps me to learn.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:36.720
So part of what I think the
huge value in teaching this way

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.770
is that you, as the
instructor, have

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:47.490
this gift of hearing new
ideas that aren't necessarily

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.390
embedded into the
academic structure yet.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.720
So I discovered there
really is a need

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.640
to build a better
theory and framework

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.240
around public entrepreneurship.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.630
That's really interesting.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.500
That helps me think about
my own research goals

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.140
and where I might build
new collaborations here

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:11.415
on campus with other
faculty and researchers.

00:11:11.415 --> 00:11:13.290
SARAH HANSEN: And speaking
of collaborations,

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:18.870
what was the role of networking
in this experience for Fellows?

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.570
ANJALI SASTRY: So
students coming here

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:25.740
have varying predilections
for networking

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.350
and connecting with others.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:34.750
And many of them really benefit
from having a focus to that.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.990
So very often we
tell students-- you

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.240
have this gift of being
here on campus for a while.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.385
Make the most of it.

00:11:40.385 --> 00:11:41.760
But if you're just
trying to meet

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.940
people to fill up your Rolodex,
it's rather self-serving.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:45.840
And it's awkward.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.970
And there's no reason to meet.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.270
But if you can articulate a
really interesting question,

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.360
this gives students a
reason to contact people.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.820
So I really view
the two as linked.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.450
Develop a great problem
statement or research question.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:04.800
Use that to look at what you
have access to on campus.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:10.860
That might include faculty,
postdocs, research teams.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.440
That might include alumni.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:18.360
It includes folks within
the MIT ecosystems.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:23.700
You might head over to an
incubator or some other--

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.580
a venue, an event
where people are.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:31.500
And then because we get a lot
of people passing through--

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.950
as well as invitations
to meetings, conferences,

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:36.780
and events, globally--

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.090
I would shoot those
to my students.

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:42.360
So say, so-and-so is
coming to campus next week.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.910
See if you can get
on their agenda.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:48.320
And that would often work.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.850
SARAH HANSEN: How
are you looking

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.390
to tweak this experience
the next time you teach it?

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:55.400
ANJALI SASTRY: So I
think having the steps

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.370
in the process a
little bit clearer

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:04.370
and having the motivating
question of each step

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.810
in a project like this--

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.310
really central.

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:10.220
So early stages, here's what
you should be thinking about.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.260
Here's the questions
you need to answer.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.680
Middle stages, late-- so if
I have a better framework

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.960
for the steps in
the work, I think

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.020
that would be a big benefit.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:25.370
Another is to realize not
every student who comes in

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:30.140
with their passion project is
necessarily going to want to--

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.680
or should-- turn it
into an in-depth study.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.680
So I've learned that you
can't convert everyone.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.355
And that's OK.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.090
Because this is an offering
of a new learning experience.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:47.030
It's very much driven by
the students' interest.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:50.030
You need to really
be able to allow

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:52.400
the students to self select in.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.010
It's hard to offer something
like this as a requirement.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:59.720
So that's another piece is
striking the right balance

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:04.310
between opening the
door and inviting people

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:07.700
in versus cracking the whip
and following up on them.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.000
Students get really busy.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.410
So one downside of an
unstructured course

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:14.390
is that it can
fall by the wayside

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.670
because they have their
structured requirements

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:19.700
and course meetings for all
their other classes and this

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:23.430
begins to feel like
something on the side.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:28.070
So how you maintain the
momentum and make sure

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:32.690
that enough investment is
going in is really important.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:37.940
So better sourcing
and screening.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.210
Better process.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:41.510
And having regular
meetings are all really

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:43.880
important ingredients.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.380
SARAH HANSEN: Is
there anything else

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.840
you'd like to share
about facilitating

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.690
an experience like this that
we haven't touched on yet?

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:53.120
ANJALI SASTRY: I think
one of the challenges

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.010
that an instructor
has to balance

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.890
is, how far am I
willing to go outside

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.530
of my domain of expertise?

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.710
How much do I know
about the blockchain?

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:06.420
That's not an area
of my research.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:10.160
So how far do I want to
go down a set of projects

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.410
that take that on.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:15.530
I need to be able to
figure it out for myself

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.740
and then also be very
clear with the students.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.260
I'm interested in this topic.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.530
I'll learn with you.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.620
But my domain of expertise
relates to these areas.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.150
We can apply it
to your questions.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:31.160
We can apply systems thinking,
or organizational change,

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.730
or business models to the
questions you're articulating.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.760
But I am not the technical
expert on this domain.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.450
So you'll need to work
with someone else on that.

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:43.850
And different instructors
have different interests

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.650
in stepping out of
their comfort zone.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.920
So I think that's
really important.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:54.050
Another big question
is, how willing are you

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:59.300
as an instructor to have a
mishmash of projects that

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.790
take on very different domains?

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.850
Or would you like them to be
geographically or thematically

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:06.170
linked?

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:08.510
I suspect that I'm going
to evolve a little more

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.630
towards clustered projects.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.610
And I've seen some
of my colleagues

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:16.940
use such clusters of
projects over time

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.620
to build their own
research insights.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.920
So I think that's
really exciting.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.420
The idea of encouraging
students to take

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.750
on projects that motivate
them but that also speak

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:33.650
to an ongoing research
program and on which you

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:37.562
can start to build more
knowledge and evidence.

00:16:37.562 --> 00:16:39.020
SARAH HANSEN: Do
you have any words

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.660
of advice to your colleagues
out in the world who might

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.300
want to try something similar?

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.180
ANJALI SASTRY: Teaching this
way is incredibly rewarding

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.220
and also really scary.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.685
You'll often be invited
into domains where

00:16:52.685 --> 00:16:55.700
you don't have the expertise.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.500
And it's quite
hard to predict how

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:01.130
a given session or a
conversation will go.

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:04.010
It's not like running a case
where you know the story

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:07.910
and you know what you're going
to say at each moment in class,

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:09.560
or you at least
got a sense of what

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:13.099
that might look like because
very often students will

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.938
come in and say, I've
totally changed my mind.

00:17:16.938 --> 00:17:18.230
And you have to deal with that.

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.290
So there's both the
personal journey

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.660
of learning that's
less predictable

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.480
and the domain part
that's less predictable.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.060
But you, as the
instructor, get to set

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.320
some of those parameters.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.990
By, for instance,
requiring a written update

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.650
before a meeting, you can
manage the conversation better.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:40.580
And by specifying
the types of projects

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.690
that you would really
want to take on,

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.230
you can also ensure
that they're clustered

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:48.970
in areas that are relevant
to your own expertise.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.950
For me, one of the challenges--

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:52.750
I have to tell
you-- is branding.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.060
What do I call this?

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.700
Is it something
different than just doing

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.520
a bunch of independent studies?

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.020
I think it's a work in progress.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.910
So I think the
first few times you

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:06.070
try out something like
this, it doesn't yet

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:08.950
have a fully distinct identity.

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:11.020
And then, as I
hone it, I'm going

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.120
to give it a clearer name.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.230
But I've been using terms
that link to social impact,

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:21.760
that link to technology,
and that also frame--

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.950
perhaps because it's
focusing on the students

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:26.800
I'm teaching-- but the idea
of thinking strategically,

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.920
thinking as a leader,
and really putting

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:35.620
yourselves in the shoes of an
entrepreneur or an executive.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:39.880
So I want them to not simply
make general arguments

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.130
about what should
happen, but to think

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:45.760
about what they could do as
a leader, an entrepreneur,

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.130
an executive.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:49.930
So, yeah, come up
with a great name.

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:51.280
I'm still working on mine.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.880
All suggestions are welcome.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.560
I put in there terms
like new executive

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:02.210
thinking for social impact or
technology for social impact.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.330
So we'll see how that plays out.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:06.137
Check back later.

00:19:06.137 --> 00:19:07.470
SARAH HANSEN: Thank you so much.

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:08.303
ANJALI SASTRY: Sure.

00:19:08.303 --> 00:19:09.750
You're welcome.
