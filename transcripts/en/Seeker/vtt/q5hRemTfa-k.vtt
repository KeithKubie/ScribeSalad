00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.740
In high school, we learned ACGT ACGT ACGT
Adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.150
These are the bases…

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.390
And yet… there's more to this tiny story
than meets the eye.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:21.310
OR the rest of the body.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.739
In April of 1953, the double-helix of deoxyribonucleic
acid or DNA was announced in the journal "Nature."

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.180
The discovery of the building blocks of life
was celebrated worldwide, and earned James

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.789
Watson and Watson Crick a Nobel Prize, which
they shared with Maurice Wilkins.

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.649
Shout out to Rosalind Franklin for discovering
the final piece of the Watson-Crick model,

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.770
the helical structure.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.190
Tons of scientists and scholars worked on
the discovery of hereditary biology for almost

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.190
a century.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.429
If you've taken high school biology, you know
DNA and genes are used to create proteins

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:54.539
which carry out physiological functions in
cells.

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.399
Watson and Crick's final model indicated just
HOW this molecule is the most basic structure

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.549
life -- we thought DNA was like, the One Ring
that rules them all… but new research from

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.220
the University of Edinburgh, published in
Science, found DNA might just be a part of

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.979
the puzzle of biological inheritance.

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.399
All humans carry 2 meters of DNA in each of
their cell nuclei (except in sperm and egg

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:18.399
cells, of course).

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.330
That's a fantastic amount of genetic information.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:27.360
In fact, if you do the math, the human body
contains 100 trillion meters of DNA per person.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.380
That's enough to make a line of DNA to the
sun and back 300 times.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.110
Similar to a rope, it can get tangled if you
don't store it properly, so nature figured

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.690
out an efficient means of storage.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.380
The DNA molecule carries a negative charge,
so (like my hair to a balloon) DNA is attracted

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.490
to these positively charged proteins called
histones and form what looks like little beads

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.490
on a string.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.360
We've known this for decades, but this new
study found these histones are more than they

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.360
seem.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.960
DNA wraps itself around the histones like
a spool, storing the DNA safely and decreasing

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.119
its length by seven times, but it's not just
for storage.

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.270
It also can determine what genes near each
histone are switched on or off.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.610
Now, for the first time ever, research uncovered
histones can affect how DNA is expressed not

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.010
just in me, but in my offspring!

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.360
This discovery finds that DNA isn't the lonely
hero of inherited traits after all, but a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.830
member of a team.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.060
Assuming I'm a yeast cell, of course.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.879
By manipulating the histones inside yeast
cells, researchers were able to follow how

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.690
that affected the gene expression from one
generation to the next.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.030
Essentially, if they messed with a histone,
and that switched off some genes nearby, they

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.410
could see those same switches were off in
the next generation of yeast too!

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.340
Proving the histones are inherited and were
affecting gene expression in the yeast's offspring.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.260
Histones' effects on gene expression was known,
but that it is inherited is groundbreaking!

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.030
Histones are a major driver of epigenetics
through a process called histone methylation.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.879
When amino acids link up with histones, they'll
help switch on or off genes and which affects

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.900
genetic expression, DNA transcription (or
copying), and thus ultimately the organism

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.090
as a whole.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.819
And it's inherited!

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.360
We already know histone methylation can be
affected by stress and diet; that's basic

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.891
epigenetics, but if scientists can show histones
are inherited like DNA in humans, then we

00:03:18.891 --> 00:03:24.250
might be getting our first glimpse into how
YOUR stress could affect your kids, and their

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.250
kids!

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.250
WOW!

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.250
Does this stress you out?

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.250
STOP BEING STRESSED!

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.740
Its affecting your grandkids!

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.720
On the other hand, so what if you're stressed.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.290
We're getting so good at genetic modifications,
we should be able to just go in and tweak

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.290
our kids anyway?

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.290
Right?

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.470
