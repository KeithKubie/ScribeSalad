00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.820
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.150
In this video, I'd like us
to do some basic manipulation

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.710
of some power series that
you saw in the lecture.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.850
So I have four problems here,
and what I'd like us to do,

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.020
is figure out what function
each of these series represents.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.660
Now, you can assume that
the x-values that we

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.050
are going to insert
into this function

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.852
are only x-values that
let the sums converge.

00:00:30.852 --> 00:00:32.560
So you don't have to
worry about anything

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.020
to do with convergence
of these sums.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.590
Just assume the sums
converge, that we've

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.030
picked good x-values.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.530
OK?

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.530
And what I'd like you
to have in the end,

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.510
for (a), (b), (c), and
(d), is something like,

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.745
this sum is equal to
a specific function.

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:49.140
It should not include
a sum anymore.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.680
So why don't you work on those
for a bit, pause the video,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.550
and when you're done,
restart the video,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.800
and I'll come back, and show
you how I work with them.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.360
All right.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.020
Welcome back.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.660
Well, hopefully these were
a little bit fun for you.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.310
I always liked them,
the first time I

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.726
saw them, to see how one
could manipulate these series.

00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:14.100
So again, what
we're trying to do

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.540
is figure out what function
these series represent.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.360
We're assuming convergence.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.980
And we're going to try
and manipulate them

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.790
to look like things
we already know.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.904
So I'm going to start.

00:01:23.904 --> 00:01:26.445
I'm just going to go straight
through (a), (b), (c), and (d).

00:01:26.445 --> 00:01:28.850
And I'm going to rewrite the
problem each time, because I

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.141
don't want to keep coming back.

00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:38.550
So (a), we had the sum n equals
0 to infinity, x to the n

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.990
plus 2 over n factorial.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.840
Well, this looks very
close to something we know.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.060
It looks a lot like the one,
the function e to the x.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.710
The difference is that e to the
x just has a power x to the n.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.580
But the good news is that
I am really close to that.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.960
What I really have in the
numerator is x to the n times

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.450
x squared.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.260
Because this x to
the n plus 2, I

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.080
can write as x to the
n times x squared.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.470
So every term has an x squared.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.890
So as was mentioned
in the lecture,

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.970
you can treat this
really like polynomials.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.010
In some way, you
can factor this out.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.960
So I can rewrite this as-- well,
I'll rewrite it in two steps.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.330
0 to infinity of x squared,
x to the n over n factorial.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.570
So x squared times x to the
n gives me x to the n plus 2.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.320
Right?

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.990
But I can actually now, because
this belongs to every sum,

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.650
I can pull that all
the way out in front.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.150
Right?

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.070
And if I pull that all
the way out in front,

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.090
if I move this out
to the front, I

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.500
have an x squared
times this sum.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.730
Well, what is the sum?

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.240
The sum is e to the x.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.970
It's n equals 0 to infinity of
x to the n over n factorial.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.500
That's just e to the x.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.680
So this function is
x squared e to the x.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.666
That's what (a) is.

00:02:57.666 --> 00:02:59.040
If you were worried
about it, you

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.639
could write e to
the x as a series,

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.680
and then you could multiply
through by x squared,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.020
and see if that's what you get.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.760
But you'll see, that is
indeed how this problem works.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.650
OK.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.280
Let's look at (b).

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.775
OK, (b) is equal to the sum--
that's a weird summation

00:03:16.775 --> 00:03:20.390
sign, sorry about that-- (b)
is equal to the sum n equals 2

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.530
to infinity of x to the n.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.410
That's what we
wanted to look at.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.970
Well, this looks very close
to the geometric series,

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.680
but it's missing some terms.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.180
Right?

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.990
The geometric series starts
at n equals 0 to infinity.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.300
But the point I
want to make here

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.410
is that I can rewrite this
as the geometric series,

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.851
and then I can take
away what I've added in.

00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:43.350
OK?

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.550
So these do not agree right now.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.870
This equals sign
is not true yet.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:48.990
But what do I notice?

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.810
I notice that this one has two
more terms at the beginning

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.220
than this one has.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.710
What are those terms?

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.380
Those are when n equals
0 and when n equals 1.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.880
Right?

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.650
There's no n equals
0 or n equals 1 here.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.700
The formulas are
exactly the same.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.210
Right?

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.200
x to the n, x to the n.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.700
They both go to infinity, but
one is starting at n equals 2,

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.410
and one's starting
at n equals 0.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.620
Again, I want to remind you.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.400
Why did I bother to
write this thing at all?

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.240
Because this is a
function we know.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.180
But this equals sign
is not true right now.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.680
Right?

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.760
I have to get rid of
the extra stuff I added.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.760
What did I add?

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.040
I added-- let me
get this as a sum.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.530
What did I add on?

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.540
I added on x to the
zero and x to the first.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.360
So now I guess I should have
written subtract here, right?

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.570
I should subtract
x to the 0, and I

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.714
should subtract x to the first.

00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:42.130
I've already said
it once, but I'm

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.090
going to, just to make
sure everybody follows,

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.436
say it one more time.

00:04:46.436 --> 00:04:50.900
I now-- I've taken the
summation I started with,

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.180
which went from n
equals 2 to infinity.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.280
I added two more
terms to the sum.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.530
I made it go from 0 to infinity.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.150
So to keep equality,
I subtracted off

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.110
the two things I added in.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.230
I subtracted off x to
the 0 and x to the first.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.120
So now, what was the point
of this part of the exercise?

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.620
Well, the point is that
I know what this sum is.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.820
That's the geometric series.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.270
That's 1 over 1 minus x.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.810
And this x to the 0, it's minus
1; x to the first, minus x.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.720
So this I broke
up into something

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.490
I knew as a power series,
and then other pieces

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.370
that I had added in to make
it look like something I knew.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.709
I had to subtract those off.

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:40.500
So that's the idea.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.480
That one, if you wanted to
go on and simplify further,

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.490
you could do that.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.230
But I'm willing to
leave it just as is.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.160
'Cause the idea was really
this part up here, and then

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.471
translating it down to this.

00:05:53.471 --> 00:05:53.970
All right.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.500
Let me write (c) again.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.563
The sum n equals
0 to infinity, x

00:06:01.563 --> 00:06:05.901
to the n over n factorial
plus x to the n.

00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:06.400
OK.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.990
So the sum n equals
0 to infinity,

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.780
x to the n over n
factorial plus x to the n.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.400
And the point to
recognize here is, again,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.940
as Professor Jerison
mentioned, you're

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.420
really treating these
almost like polynomials.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.050
So you're taking a series, and
you're adding these terms up.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.800
But really, what you
can think about this,

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.860
is the two separate
series added up.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.770
And so this is the
sum from n equals 0

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.540
to infinity of x to the n over
n factorial, which we know,

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.560
plus the sum from n
equals 0 to infinity

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.340
of x to the n, which we know.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.687
The first one is
just e to the x,

00:06:42.687 --> 00:06:44.270
and the second one,
we've been dealing

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.387
a lot with these already today,
is just 1 over 1 minus x.

00:06:49.387 --> 00:06:50.970
So the point I want
to make, is if you

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.560
have this convergent
series, you can split it up

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.480
into pieces over the sum.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.510
And these two are both
convergent, we know,

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.480
separately, and so we
can write what they are.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.226
x to the n over n factorial from
0 to infinity is e to the x,

00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:12.740
x to the n from n equals 0 to
infinity is 1 over 1 minus x.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.700
So now we just have one more.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:21.180
Let me write that one. (d)
was summation n equals minus 1

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.530
to infinity x to the n plus 1.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.530
All right.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.550
This was not meant
to scare you, but it

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.730
was meant to test your
understanding of sigma

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.100
notation.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.240
So the problem is, we're
starting at n equals minus 1,

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.470
but x is starting-- the
exponent on x is at n plus 1.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.900
So I want to write it in
some form that I know.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.062
Well, let's try and get
the subscript to be 0.

00:07:47.062 --> 00:07:49.020
so what I'm going to do,
is I'm going to change

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.330
the name of the subscript.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.840
I'm going to let it be
m equals 0 to infinity.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.340
OK?

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:59.686
And I want m to count up by
1 just the way n counts up.

00:07:59.686 --> 00:08:00.560
So notice what I did.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.290
When m equals 0, n
equals negative 1.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.080
That's what we've set
up as the first term.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.850
That means n plus 1 is
equal to 0 when m equals 0.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.280
And since I'm going
up by one every time

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.630
in my summation, my
iteration, here that

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:20.980
means that for every m I have,
I just have to take n plus 1

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.420
to figure out what m is.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.044
So I should have said
it the other way.

00:08:24.044 --> 00:08:27.060
For every n I have, I just
have to add 1 to get m.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:27.560
OK?

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.410
So here, if I start at
negative 1, I start here at 0.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.920
The next term here
is 0, n equals 0,

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.620
but the next term
here is m equals 1.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.729
The next term here
would be n equals 1,

00:08:39.729 --> 00:08:41.520
and the next term here
would be m equals 2.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.510
So they're just off by
1, but they're still

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.530
catching every index.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.480
Now, I don't have to
change what's up here.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.100
Because infinity--
if I add 1 to it,

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.880
I'm still going off to infinity.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.840
So I don't have to
change what's up here.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.420
But I do want to write the
formula, or the formula I have

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.790
inside the sum in terms of m.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.180
But I've already got it.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.340
Because I know m is
always equal to n plus 1,

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:08.916
so I can replace this
n plus 1 by an m.

00:09:08.916 --> 00:09:10.290
And now we know
what that one is.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.810
Right?

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:14.670
m equals 0 to infinity
of x to the m.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.040
That's our geometric series.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.490
So it actually, even
though I wrote it

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:22.510
in kind of a funny way,
it was actually just still

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.000
the geometric series.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.430
I just moved the
indices a little bit

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:28.760
to make sure we could
play with those.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.830
So the idea here, the whole
point of this exercise,

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.740
just to recognize how
you can manipulate

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.520
these series a little
bit, so that if they're

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.770
in a form that looks kind
of like one of the functions

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.407
you know, you can see if
it actually is, you know,

00:09:42.407 --> 00:09:44.490
a product of something
with the function you know,

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.870
or the sum of two
functions you know,

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.390
or maybe one of the functions
you know is a power series,

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.210
and then you have to drop
off a couple of terms.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.930
So they each sort of
demonstrate a different idea

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:59.070
of how you can manipulate these
convergent power series, based

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.820
on functions you already know.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.370
So I'll stop there.
