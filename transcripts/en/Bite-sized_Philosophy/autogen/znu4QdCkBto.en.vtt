00:00:00.435 --> 00:00:02.485
By noon the dragon filled the house

00:00:02.485 --> 00:00:03.760
it's head hung over the front door

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.515
it's tail hung over the back door

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.000
and the rest of the rooms in the house that didn't have

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.740
some part of the dragon in it

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.960
[hmmm]

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.600
I bet that there is a house like that on

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.700
some of you live, you know

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.780
where there's a lot of houses

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.720
some of you live in appartments

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.000
doesn't really matter
but I bet you if you live in a house

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.160
on a block of houses

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.440
there's at least one house

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.220
on that street 
where the tail of the dragon

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.760
has started to come out of the house

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.700
and you know what that's like ey
because it's

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.120
the house that you don't really
want to look at when you walk by

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.640
you know?
and maybe, I dunno,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.180
it needs a new roof 
and like the door is a little bit crooked

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.420
'nd the lawn isn't cut 'nd 
you know there's some rusty things

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.760
laying around there 'nd like,
it's just not taken care of!

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.720
and you know!

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.060
and maybe you know from the gossip
in the neighborhood too

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.780
that there's something going on in that house

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.380
that is
just    not     good

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.635
and it's got to the pont where it's SO not good

00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:53.895
that it's starting to spread itself out beyond

00:00:53.895 --> 00:00:56.895
the domestic confines of the house, so

00:00:56.895 --> 00:00:58.655
you know you ru, 
you run into people like that

00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:01.075
now and then too you'll 
notice this so

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.340
you know sometimes,
I don't know if this has happened

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.700
to any of you but, it might've,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.360
It's happened to you in some ways

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.560
you know that there are 
those people who can't not

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.800
tell you everything about
what's going on in their life

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.760
even if you've hardly even met them

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.180
if ya, if you see someone who's
REALLY in trouble

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.860
you know, you'll sit on the bus 'nd

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.100
somebody who's

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.420
clearly

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.280
on the road to being
thoroughly deranged

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.260
will sit down 
beside you and they'll start

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.240
telling you about the problems 
of their life

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.520
's like you know that
the dragon that they're dealing with

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.740
is so big that they can't 
even contain it.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.220
they're so desperate

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.260
to have it DEALT with 
that they

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.100
CAN'T 
not talk about it.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.120
you know, and there's lots of
people like that

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.880
they're the ones, 
what is... that... stupid little phrase?

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.100
TMI right? too much information?
's like, yeah!

00:01:44.105 --> 00:01:46.435
well, w-why does that happen?

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.440
it's because 
people are dealing with anomalies

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.780
'n unexpected occurrences 'n tragedies

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.080
and they cannot articulate
a solution

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.840
and most people

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.340
think by talking

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.620
which is also part of the reason
that therapy works

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.480
well do you think?

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.720
I doubt it

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.420
you might!

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.820
but very few people think!

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.900
you know, so if you wanna 
solve a problem you wanna

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.320
talk it over with a friend.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.320
And so, you know you might just
think that you're talking about

00:02:11.325 --> 00:02:13.105
the problem, so that you know 
what the problem is

00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:15.560
but you're talking about it so
you don't

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.780
when you talk about it

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.920
you articulate the problem space.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.380
You start to generate potential 
hypothesis

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.580
about solutions, but

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.500
more than that, 
if you're talking to someone

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.040
you can watch them, 
just like the little kid with the mouse

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.760
would watch the mother, 'ts like well,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.180
here's what I think the problem is

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.900
'n if you go

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.284
you know you're listening 'n you go

00:02:32.284 --> 00:02:33.160
like that

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.780
you roll your eyes

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.280
you know, it's a hint!
to the person

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.960
that maybe that's not the most
appropriate way to formulate the problem

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.500
now maybe you don't roll your 
eyes but

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.620
you don't encourage them

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.240
or maybe they tell you
what the problem is

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.560
'n you're really actively
engaged

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.800
and you're nodding

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.880
well then they know that
maybe they formulated it

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.200
the way that someone half sane

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.080
and tolerable would formulate it

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.180
and then they can walk through
the solution.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.140
So...

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.120
so, when you sit down beside
someone

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.780
and theyhave to tell you everything

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.020
one of the things that you know is that

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.260
they don't have anyone to listen
to them

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.020
and

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.080
part of what happens in therapy

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.240
a huge part of it is that
you just listen.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.540
I have one client,

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.980
that's all I ever do with her!

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.020
She comes in once every
two weeks

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.500
and I just sit their and listen to her

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.420
for an hour

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.060
and

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.020
now I can maybe have
a bit of a discussion with her

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.580
for the last ten minutes.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.420
But if I try to say
anything

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.580
for the first 50 minutes

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.660
she just, 
looks kinda irritated 'n

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.420
you know, it's like I've

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.500
interrupted the flow of the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.700
of the interaction

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.540
and she's alone.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.520
She doesn't have anybody to talk to.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.020
so

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.980
you know

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.480
she wants to listen to herself think!

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.620
and she can't do that by herself

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.720
she has to have someone
to do it with

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:46.780
and so

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.820
you know

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.060
people think by talking

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.620
'n some people have no one 
to talk to

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.120
'n so

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.080
their problems start to
spill out

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.460
'n you know by that time
you can't even help them

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.440
usually, because

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.560
if you listen for three years

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.980
it wouldn't be enough listening

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.660
you'd just listen forever

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.220
n you'd never get to the bottom of it.
