00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.299
 
there is an example with the exponential

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:09.309
there is an example with the exponential
 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.020
there is an example with the exponential
function let's work through this I can I

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030
function let's work through this I can I
 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.100
function let's work through this I can I
can feel some yawns in the back but

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110
can feel some yawns in the back but
 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.990
can feel some yawns in the back but
let's work through this because the next

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000
let's work through this because the next
 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.990
let's work through this because the next
one is an example which uses this

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000
one is an example which uses this
 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.580
one is an example which uses this
particular case okay so let's say we

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590
particular case okay so let's say we
 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.819
particular case okay so let's say we
want to find the antiderivative of e to

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:29.829
want to find the antiderivative of e to
 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.790
want to find the antiderivative of e to
the K X K is a constant not equal to 0

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800
the K X K is a constant not equal to 0
 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:43.140
the K X K is a constant not equal to 0
okay so in that case you know so here

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150
okay so in that case you know so here
 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.810
okay so in that case you know so here
it's not we're not using the power rule

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820
it's not we're not using the power rule
 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.190
it's not we're not using the power rule
that we used in the past what was the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200
that we used in the past what was the
 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.310
that we used in the past what was the
what was the derivative of K to the K

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320
what was the derivative of K to the K
 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.980
what was the derivative of K to the K
times e to the K X from the last session

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:55.990
times e to the K X from the last session
 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:04.200
times e to the K X from the last session
anybody remember so if F let's say F X

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210
anybody remember so if F let's say F X
 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:12.559
anybody remember so if F let's say F X
is k e to the K X then the derivative

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:12.569
is k e to the K X then the derivative
 

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:20.730
is k e to the K X then the derivative
was what

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740
 
 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.710
 
okay let's just do eating mr. KX oh

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720
okay let's just do eating mr. KX oh
 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.280
okay let's just do eating mr. KX oh
that's right guy I in that case it's k e

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290
that's right guy I in that case it's k e
 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:37.590
that's right guy I in that case it's k e
to the K X right okay so e to the K X is

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600
to the K X right okay so e to the K X is
 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.310
to the K X right okay so e to the K X is
derivative of this inside function x

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320
derivative of this inside function x
 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.490
derivative of this inside function x
itself okay derivative of e to the x is

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500
itself okay derivative of e to the x is
 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.359
itself okay derivative of e to the x is
just e to the x and the derivative of

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369
just e to the x and the derivative of
 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.109
just e to the x and the derivative of
this inside function is k to k e to the

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119
this inside function is k to k e to the
 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:03.730
this inside function is k to k e to the
K X now so suppose that you have suppose

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740
K X now so suppose that you have suppose
 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.300
K X now so suppose that you have suppose
the derivative is actually e to the K X

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310
 
 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.090
 
okay you know that the exponent is not

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100
okay you know that the exponent is not
 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.729
okay you know that the exponent is not
going to change right that's the feature

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739
going to change right that's the feature
 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.610
going to change right that's the feature
of the exponential function when i took

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620
of the exponential function when i took
 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.550
of the exponential function when i took
this derivative the exponent didn't

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560
this derivative the exponent didn't
 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.970
this derivative the exponent didn't
change okay unlike those polynomial

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980
change okay unlike those polynomial
 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.090
change okay unlike those polynomial
functions so that's going to go back to

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100
functions so that's going to go back to
 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:39.220
functions so that's going to go back to
something like e to the K X ok but if I

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230
something like e to the K X ok but if I
 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.759
something like e to the K X ok but if I
had each of the KX and I took a

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769
had each of the KX and I took a
 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.680
had each of the KX and I took a
derivative i would get k e to the K X

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690
derivative i would get k e to the K X
 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.710
derivative i would get k e to the K X
but I don't have a que here so I'm going

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720
but I don't have a que here so I'm going
 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.319
but I don't have a que here so I'm going
to have to divide by K right so that's

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329
to have to divide by K right so that's
 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:03:02.520
to have to divide by K right so that's
going to be 1 over K

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530
 
 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.640
 
everybody with me know okay so let me do

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650
everybody with me know okay so let me do
 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.540
everybody with me know okay so let me do
that again you realize that if I were to

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550
that again you realize that if I were to
 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.660
that again you realize that if I were to
take a derivative of e to the K X then

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670
take a derivative of e to the K X then
 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.050
take a derivative of e to the K X then
I'm going to take this coefficient put

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060
I'm going to take this coefficient put
 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.110
I'm going to take this coefficient put
it in front and keep the exponent the

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120
it in front and keep the exponent the
 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.590
it in front and keep the exponent the
same okay so i would go from e to the K

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600
same okay so i would go from e to the K
 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.910
same okay so i would go from e to the K
X take a derivative I'd get ke to the KX

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920
X take a derivative I'd get ke to the KX
 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.280
X take a derivative I'd get ke to the KX
exponent stays the same and i'm taking

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290
exponent stays the same and i'm taking
 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.400
exponent stays the same and i'm taking
the coefficient in the exponent and

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410
the coefficient in the exponent and
 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.009
the coefficient in the exponent and
putting it in front but but here I've

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019
putting it in front but but here I've
 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.720
putting it in front but but here I've
just done it this way so as to help

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730
just done it this way so as to help
 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.040
just done it this way so as to help
remind you that this is a function and

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050
remind you that this is a function and
 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.800
remind you that this is a function and
this is its derivative it could be a

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810
this is its derivative it could be a
 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.680
this is its derivative it could be a
little F so there would be no difference

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690
little F so there would be no difference
 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.449
little F so there would be no difference
if I had simply done the important thing

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459
if I had simply done the important thing
 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.880
if I had simply done the important thing
here is that this is the prime of

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890
here is that this is the prime of
 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:07.110
here is that this is the prime of
whatever that function is ok so when I

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120
whatever that function is ok so when I
 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.319
whatever that function is ok so when I
take a derivative of an exponential

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329
take a derivative of an exponential
 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.990
take a derivative of an exponential
function the exponent stays the same and

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000
function the exponent stays the same and
 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.110
function the exponent stays the same and
I take the coefficient from the exponent

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120
I take the coefficient from the exponent
 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.460
I take the coefficient from the exponent
and put it in front so I know I'm being

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470
and put it in front so I know I'm being
 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.790
and put it in front so I know I'm being
told that i have a derivative equal to e

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800
told that i have a derivative equal to e
 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.880
told that i have a derivative equal to e
to the K X and I have to find its

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890
to the K X and I have to find its
 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.659
to the K X and I have to find its
antiderivative ie the function which

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669
antiderivative ie the function which
 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.200
antiderivative ie the function which
when differentiated gives me this as its

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210
when differentiated gives me this as its
 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.409
when differentiated gives me this as its
derivative I know that for exponential

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419
derivative I know that for exponential
 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.230
derivative I know that for exponential
functions the exponent didn't change so

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240
functions the exponent didn't change so
 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.560
functions the exponent didn't change so
I know that that antiderivative has to

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570
I know that that antiderivative has to
 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.520
I know that that antiderivative has to
have the term e to the K X there will be

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530
have the term e to the K X there will be
 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.420
have the term e to the K X there will be
no change in the exponent but I look at

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430
no change in the exponent but I look at
 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.490
no change in the exponent but I look at
this and I think well if I would take a

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500
this and I think well if I would take a
 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.430
this and I think well if I would take a
derivative with this I would end up with

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440
derivative with this I would end up with
 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.250
derivative with this I would end up with
ke to the KX I'd end up with a k in

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260
ke to the KX I'd end up with a k in
 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.860
ke to the KX I'd end up with a k in
front I know I didn't end up with a k

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870
front I know I didn't end up with a k
 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.190
front I know I didn't end up with a k
here so there must have been something

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200
here so there must have been something
 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.450
here so there must have been something
here which when multiplied by K

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460
 
 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.200
 
gave me a one well what is it that when

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210
gave me a one well what is it that when
 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:28.020
gave me a one well what is it that when
multiplied by K gives me a 1 1 over K

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030
multiplied by K gives me a 1 1 over K
 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.170
multiplied by K gives me a 1 1 over K
right okay yeah so you wouldn't do that

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180
right okay yeah so you wouldn't do that
 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.420
right okay yeah so you wouldn't do that
in other words you wouldn't you would

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430
in other words you wouldn't you would
 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.879
in other words you wouldn't you would
take the K and multiply it by the

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889
take the K and multiply it by the
 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:43.590
take the K and multiply it by the
coefficient but not the KX okay so just

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600
coefficient but not the KX okay so just
 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.060
coefficient but not the KX okay so just
look at this is the sort of the simple

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070
look at this is the sort of the simple
 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.050
look at this is the sort of the simple
example if you have e to the K X when

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060
example if you have e to the K X when
 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.510
example if you have e to the K X when
you take its derivative you're going to

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520
you take its derivative you're going to
 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.730
you take its derivative you're going to
take the K and put it in front and leave

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740
take the K and put it in front and leave
 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:03.240
take the K and put it in front and leave
e to the K X here because you have what

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250
e to the K X here because you have what
 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.730
e to the K X here because you have what
you have to do this is if you apply the

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740
you have to do this is if you apply the
 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.100
you have to do this is if you apply the
chain rule you know we didn't spend much

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110
chain rule you know we didn't spend much
 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.700
chain rule you know we didn't spend much
time on this but if you apply the chain

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710
time on this but if you apply the chain
 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:17.990
time on this but if you apply the chain
rule you could think of e to the FX as

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000

that that might help to fix ideas if we

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:09.770
that that might help to fix ideas if we
 

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.610
that that might help to fix ideas if we
think of oil consumption so remember

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:12.620
think of oil consumption so remember
 

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:17.159
think of oil consumption so remember
that the derivative is the speed and the

ok and I want you to have in mind let's

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:26.449
ok and I want you to have in mind let's
 

00:08:26.449 --> 00:08:29.680
ok and I want you to have in mind let's
see if I I don't think I did a picture

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:29.690
see if I I don't think I did a picture
 

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.230
see if I I don't think I did a picture
for you there ok I just want you to have

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240
for you there ok I just want you to have
 

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:41.560
for you there ok I just want you to have
a picture in mind for this so let's read

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:41.570
a picture in mind for this so let's read
 

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.180
a picture in mind for this so let's read
the problem a little bit during the

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:43.190
the problem a little bit during the
 

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:47.889
the problem a little bit during the
early 1970s the annual worldwide rate of

00:08:47.889 --> 00:08:47.899
early 1970s the annual worldwide rate of
 

00:08:47.899 --> 00:08:52.630
early 1970s the annual worldwide rate of
oil consumption grew exponentially with

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:52.640
oil consumption grew exponentially with
 

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.420
oil consumption grew exponentially with
the growth constant of 0 point 0 7 so

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:55.430
the growth constant of 0 point 0 7 so
 

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.240
the growth constant of 0 point 0 7 so
that's about seven percent okay so you

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:58.250
that's about seven percent okay so you
 

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.110
that's about seven percent okay so you
could think about it as seven percent

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120
could think about it as seven percent
 

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.980
could think about it as seven percent
annual growth at the beginning of 1970

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:05.990
annual growth at the beginning of 1970
 

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.889
annual growth at the beginning of 1970
the rate of consumption was sixteen

00:09:08.889 --> 00:09:08.899
the rate of consumption was sixteen
 

00:09:08.899 --> 00:09:13.260
the rate of consumption was sixteen
point 1 billion barrels annually okay so

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:13.270
point 1 billion barrels annually okay so
 

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:18.610
point 1 billion barrels annually okay so
january one 1970 the annual rate of

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:18.620
january one 1970 the annual rate of
 

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.120
january one 1970 the annual rate of
consumption is 16 point 1 billion

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:22.130
consumption is 16 point 1 billion
 

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:27.010
consumption is 16 point 1 billion
barrels per year and every moment it is

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:27.020
barrels per year and every moment it is
 

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.710
barrels per year and every moment it is
growing at the rate of seven percent per

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720
growing at the rate of seven percent per
 

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:34.440
growing at the rate of seven percent per
year so at the end of nineteen seventy

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:34.450
year so at the end of nineteen seventy
 

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:41.319
year so at the end of nineteen seventy
it would have grown from 16.12 16.1

00:09:41.319 --> 00:09:41.329
it would have grown from 16.12 16.1
 

00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:46.210
it would have grown from 16.12 16.1
x 1 point 0 7 approximately right okay

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:46.220
x 1 point 0 7 approximately right okay
 

00:09:46.220 --> 00:10:07.830
x 1 point 0 7 approximately right okay
so you could draw the following function

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:07.840
 
 

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.300
 
on the x axis I've got time and let's

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:12.310
on the x axis I've got time and let's
 

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:21.360
on the x axis I've got time and let's
say that starts at 1970 and at nineteen

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:21.370
say that starts at 1970 and at nineteen
 

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:25.710
say that starts at 1970 and at nineteen
seventy I know that the rate of

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:25.720
seventy I know that the rate of
 

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:36.020
seventy I know that the rate of
consumption was 16.1 okay and I know

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:36.030
consumption was 16.1 okay and I know
 

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.900
consumption was 16.1 okay and I know
that that rate of consumption is growing

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:39.910
that that rate of consumption is growing
 

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.540
that that rate of consumption is growing
exponentially at seven percent per annum

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:42.550
exponentially at seven percent per annum
 

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.240
exponentially at seven percent per annum
so when things grow exponentially it

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:45.250
so when things grow exponentially it
 

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:55.110
so when things grow exponentially it
usually looks like that okay it's okay

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120
usually looks like that okay it's okay
 

00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:03.750
usually looks like that okay it's okay
now it turns out that the area under

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760
now it turns out that the area under
 

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:10.380
now it turns out that the area under
this curve this is the rate of

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:10.390
this curve this is the rate of
 

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:14.460
this curve this is the rate of
consumption as a function of time the

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:14.470
consumption as a function of time the
 

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:20.700
consumption as a function of time the
area under this curve is going to give

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:20.710
area under this curve is going to give
 

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:28.010
area under this curve is going to give
you the total consumption of oil since

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:28.020
you the total consumption of oil since
 

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:33.030
you the total consumption of oil since
1970 okay you could just imagine that if

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040
1970 okay you could just imagine that if
 

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.940
1970 okay you could just imagine that if
you if i were to think of each of these

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:35.950
you if i were to think of each of these
 

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:40.620
you if i were to think of each of these
increments as one year then in the first

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:40.630
increments as one year then in the first
 

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.500
increments as one year then in the first
year approximately 16.1 barrels are

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:43.510
year approximately 16.1 barrels are
 

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:48.300
year approximately 16.1 barrels are
consumed in the next year 16.1 x 1 point

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:48.310
consumed in the next year 16.1 x 1 point
 

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:53.960
consumed in the next year 16.1 x 1 point
0 7 are consumed and then the third year

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:53.970
0 7 are consumed and then the third year
 

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:58.890
0 7 are consumed and then the third year
16.1 x 1 point 0 7 x 1 point 0 7 are

00:11:58.890 --> 00:11:58.900
16.1 x 1 point 0 7 x 1 point 0 7 are
 

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.900
16.1 x 1 point 0 7 x 1 point 0 7 are
consumed and so on and i could add up

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:00.910
consumed and so on and i could add up
 

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.740
consumed and so on and i could add up
all those rectangles of course it's not

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:04.750
all those rectangles of course it's not
 

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.080
all those rectangles of course it's not
exactly that because the growth is

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:07.090
exactly that because the growth is
 

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.810
exactly that because the growth is
happening instantaneously that is it's

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:09.820
happening instantaneously that is it's
 

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.330
happening instantaneously that is it's
growing at seven percent per year but

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:12.340
growing at seven percent per year but
 

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.830
growing at seven percent per year but
it's not that it grows for seven percent

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:15.840
it's not that it grows for seven percent
 

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.690
it's not that it grows for seven percent
it's not growing in discrete time it's

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:18.700
it's not growing in discrete time it's
 

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.180
it's not growing in discrete time it's
growing instantaneously so that's why we

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:21.190
growing instantaneously so that's why we
 

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.610
growing instantaneously so that's why we
have

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:21.620
have
 

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:26.110
have
this function okay so you can imagine

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120
this function okay so you can imagine
 

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.360
this function okay so you can imagine
certainly that the area under this curve

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:28.370
certainly that the area under this curve
 

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:33.640
certainly that the area under this curve
would approximate the total consumption

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:33.650
would approximate the total consumption
 

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:39.970
would approximate the total consumption
of oil up to whatever time T I had okay

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:39.980
of oil up to whatever time T I had okay
 

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:44.829
of oil up to whatever time T I had okay
so so let's let Artie denote the rate of

00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:44.839
so so let's let Artie denote the rate of
 

00:12:44.839 --> 00:12:47.350
so so let's let Artie denote the rate of
oil consumption at time T tease the

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360
oil consumption at time T tease the
 

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.329
oil consumption at time T tease the
number of years since the beginning of

00:12:49.329 --> 00:12:49.339
number of years since the beginning of
 

00:12:49.339 --> 00:12:56.910
number of years since the beginning of
1970 so the function RT is just 16.1 e

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:56.920
1970 so the function RT is just 16.1 e
 

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:12.990
1970 so the function RT is just 16.1 e
to the point 0 7 t okay now if you let

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:13.000
to the point 0 7 t okay now if you let
 

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.829
to the point 0 7 t okay now if you let
capital t of t be the total oil consumed

00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839
capital t of t be the total oil consumed
 

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:22.300
capital t of t be the total oil consumed
from 1970 to time T that's just the area

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:22.310
from 1970 to time T that's just the area
 

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:29.769
from 1970 to time T that's just the area
under the graph and of course the area

00:13:29.769 --> 00:13:29.779
under the graph and of course the area
 

00:13:29.779 --> 00:13:33.130
under the graph and of course the area
under the graph total oil consumption to

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:33.140
under the graph total oil consumption to
 

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.910
under the graph total oil consumption to
daty you know that RT is the rate of

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:36.920
daty you know that RT is the rate of
 

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:42.370
daty you know that RT is the rate of
consumption per year remember what is a

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:42.380
consumption per year remember what is a
 

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.750
consumption per year remember what is a
rate a rate is probably a derivative of

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760
rate a rate is probably a derivative of
 

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.430
rate a rate is probably a derivative of
something and it's going to be that the

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:48.440
something and it's going to be that the
 

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.670
something and it's going to be that the
rate is the derivative of the total

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680
rate is the derivative of the total
 

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:57.190
rate is the derivative of the total
consumption so the rate is going to be

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:57.200
consumption so the rate is going to be
 

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:07.170
consumption so the rate is going to be
the derivative of the total consumption

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:07.180
 
 

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:15.100
 
okay okay another way to put it the

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:15.110
okay okay another way to put it the
 

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:17.590
okay okay another way to put it the
reverse way to put it is that the area

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600
reverse way to put it is that the area
 

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:29.160
reverse way to put it is that the area
under this curve is given by capital T

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:29.170
 
 

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:34.240
 
ok as you increase t the rate is going

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:34.250
ok as you increase t the rate is going
 

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:44.230
ok as you increase t the rate is going
up and so is the area okay or you could

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240
up and so is the area okay or you could
 

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.480
up and so is the area okay or you could
think of capital T as the antiderivative

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:46.490
think of capital T as the antiderivative
 

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:55.930
think of capital T as the antiderivative
of our okay so suppose what was our

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:55.940
of our okay so suppose what was our
 

00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:00.160
of our okay so suppose what was our
question actually we don't have a

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:00.170
question actually we don't have a
 

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:04.269
question actually we don't have a
question but this is this is a way to to

00:15:04.269 --> 00:15:04.279
question but this is this is a way to to
 

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:08.139
question but this is this is a way to to
Anna is the way for us to use the

00:15:08.139 --> 00:15:08.149
Anna is the way for us to use the
 

00:15:08.149 --> 00:15:11.500
Anna is the way for us to use the
antiderivative in a problem that one

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:11.510
antiderivative in a problem that one
 

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:18.819
antiderivative in a problem that one
might care about so I said capital T is

00:15:18.819 --> 00:15:18.829
might care about so I said capital T is
 

00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:23.889
might care about so I said capital T is
the antiderivative of our okay so that's

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:23.899
the antiderivative of our okay so that's
 

00:15:23.899 --> 00:15:28.329
the antiderivative of our okay so that's
the same as saying that's the same as

00:15:28.329 --> 00:15:28.339
the same as saying that's the same as
 

00:15:28.339 --> 00:15:32.920
the same as saying that's the same as
saying that this is our I put it inside

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:32.930
saying that this is our I put it inside
 

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:37.540
saying that this is our I put it inside
the script s + DT so that's the

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:37.550
the script s + DT so that's the
 

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:41.290
the script s + DT so that's the
antiderivative this is the derivative

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:41.300
antiderivative this is the derivative
 

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:47.730
antiderivative this is the derivative
the rate now if I want to find out what

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:47.740
the rate now if I want to find out what
 

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:52.120
the rate now if I want to find out what
the total consumption at time period t

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:52.130
the total consumption at time period t
 

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:56.439
the total consumption at time period t
is I can take out this constant using

00:15:56.439 --> 00:15:56.449
is I can take out this constant using
 

00:15:56.449 --> 00:15:59.379
is I can take out this constant using
the rule that i just mentioned so i can

00:15:59.379 --> 00:15:59.389
the rule that i just mentioned so i can
 

00:15:59.389 --> 00:16:04.600
the rule that i just mentioned so i can
pull that 16.1 out of the integral 16.1

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:04.610
pull that 16.1 out of the integral 16.1
 

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:08.379
pull that 16.1 out of the integral 16.1
times the integral of this thing well

00:16:08.379 --> 00:16:08.389
times the integral of this thing well
 

00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:10.389
times the integral of this thing well
this you already know how to find the

00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399
this you already know how to find the
 

00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:13.689
this you already know how to find the
antiderivative of what is this this is

00:16:13.689 --> 00:16:13.699
antiderivative of what is this this is
 

00:16:13.699 --> 00:16:18.040
antiderivative of what is this this is
just e to the K X right and what did we

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:18.050
just e to the K X right and what did we
 

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:19.480
just e to the K X right and what did we
say that was that was going to be

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:19.490
say that was that was going to be
 

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:24.910
say that was that was going to be
1 over K times e to the K X so that's 1

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:24.920
1 over K times e to the K X so that's 1
 

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.320
1 over K times e to the K X so that's 1
over K that's the K times e to the K X

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:29.330
over K that's the K times e to the K X
 

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:37.900
over K that's the K times e to the K X
the X in this case is T ok so that's so

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:37.910
the X in this case is T ok so that's so
 

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.610
the X in this case is T ok so that's so
once you worked out that antiderivative

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:39.620
once you worked out that antiderivative
 

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.860
once you worked out that antiderivative
and there's also the plus see once you

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:41.870
and there's also the plus see once you
 

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:43.870
and there's also the plus see once you
work out that antiderivative you can get

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:43.880
work out that antiderivative you can get
 

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.380
work out that antiderivative you can get
rid of the script s in the dt okay we've

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:47.390
rid of the script s in the dt okay we've
 

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.889
rid of the script s in the dt okay we've
found the integral and then you just

00:16:50.889 --> 00:16:50.899
found the integral and then you just
 

00:16:50.899 --> 00:16:56.470
found the integral and then you just
distribute the 16.1 and you get this so

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480
distribute the 16.1 and you get this so
 

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.310
distribute the 16.1 and you get this so
the total consumption at time T is given

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:00.320
the total consumption at time T is given
 

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.250
the total consumption at time T is given
by this function now this is a class of

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:03.260
by this function now this is a class of
 

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.370
by this function now this is a class of
functions right this is not one function

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:06.380
functions right this is not one function
 

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:10.150
functions right this is not one function
it's a class of function I know that my

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160
it's a class of function I know that my
 

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.030
it's a class of function I know that my
total consumption at time T has to have

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:13.040
total consumption at time T has to have
 

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:18.160
total consumption at time T has to have
this characteristic well I can find the

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:18.170
this characteristic well I can find the
 

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.640
this characteristic well I can find the
exact see that I that applies because I

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:21.650
exact see that I that applies because I
 

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:25.210
exact see that I that applies because I
happen to know that by definition this T

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:25.220
happen to know that by definition this T
 

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:32.500
happen to know that by definition this T
of 0 is going to be 0 what you know so

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:32.510
of 0 is going to be 0 what you know so
 

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.950
of 0 is going to be 0 what you know so
let's say that that t hat if I've set T

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:35.960
let's say that that t hat if I've set T
 

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.410
let's say that that t hat if I've set T
well I've got some definition of tea

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:38.420
well I've got some definition of tea
 

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.650
well I've got some definition of tea
right t is the number of years since the

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:41.660
right t is the number of years since the
 

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.730
right t is the number of years since the
beginning of 1970 right so when T is 0

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:45.740
beginning of 1970 right so when T is 0
 

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:50.530
beginning of 1970 right so when T is 0
that's 1970 and I care about total oil

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:50.540
that's 1970 and I care about total oil
 

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.669
that's 1970 and I care about total oil
consumption since 1970 so i know that in

00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679
consumption since 1970 so i know that in
 

00:17:54.679 --> 00:17:57.940
consumption since 1970 so i know that in
nineteen seventy this function is equal

00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:57.950
nineteen seventy this function is equal
 

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:02.049
nineteen seventy this function is equal
to 0 in other words this function is

00:18:02.049 --> 00:18:02.059
to 0 in other words this function is
 

00:18:02.059 --> 00:18:08.350
to 0 in other words this function is
equal to 0 in 1970 and in 1970 t is

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:08.360
equal to 0 in 1970 and in 1970 t is
 

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.390
equal to 0 in 1970 and in 1970 t is
equal little t is equal to zero so

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400
equal little t is equal to zero so
 

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.370
equal little t is equal to zero so
that's equal to zero that's equal to 0 e

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:14.380
that's equal to zero that's equal to 0 e
 

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:22.360
that's equal to zero that's equal to 0 e
to the 0 is just 1 okay and so that's

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:22.370
to the 0 is just 1 okay and so that's
 

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:31.670
to the 0 is just 1 okay and so that's
going to be 230 plus c is equal to 0

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:31.680
 
 

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.120
 
ok and that's sorry that's another

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:36.130
ok and that's sorry that's another
 

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:38.640
ok and that's sorry that's another
problem so so by doing this I can work

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:38.650
problem so so by doing this I can work
 

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:44.790
problem so so by doing this I can work
out that C is minus 2 30 alright so T is

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:44.800
out that C is minus 2 30 alright so T is
 

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.140
out that C is minus 2 30 alright so T is
0 0 x 0 point 0 7 is 0 anything raised

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:49.150
0 0 x 0 point 0 7 is 0 anything raised
 

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:52.490
0 0 x 0 point 0 7 is 0 anything raised
to the power 0 is 1 so that's just 230

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:52.500
to the power 0 is 1 so that's just 230
 

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.340
to the power 0 is 1 so that's just 230
plus C is equal to 0 so c is equal to

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:56.350
plus C is equal to 0 so c is equal to
 

00:18:56.350 --> 00:19:00.720
plus C is equal to 0 so c is equal to
minus 2 30 so what i really have this

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:00.730
minus 2 30 so what i really have this
 

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:03.840
minus 2 30 so what i really have this
function now I've now I no longer have a

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:03.850
function now I've now I no longer have a
 

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.810
function now I've now I no longer have a
class of functions I have a single

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:06.820
class of functions I have a single
 

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:12.150
class of functions I have a single
function that's see I've been able to

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:12.160
function that's see I've been able to
 

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.360
function that's see I've been able to
pin down exactly right so we have we're

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:15.370
pin down exactly right so we have we're
 

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:18.240
pin down exactly right so we have we're
not done yet that this is a function

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:18.250
not done yet that this is a function
 

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:21.240
not done yet that this is a function
that tells me that gives me the total

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:21.250
that tells me that gives me the total
 

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.810
that tells me that gives me the total
oil consumption from 1970 to any period

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:24.820
oil consumption from 1970 to any period
 

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:28.820
oil consumption from 1970 to any period
t okay and that's a function of T well

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:28.830
t okay and that's a function of T well
 

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.990
t okay and that's a function of T well
total amount of work that would have

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:31.000
total amount of work that would have
 

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.620
total amount of work that would have
been consumed from 1972 1980 tea would

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:34.630
been consumed from 1972 1980 tea would
 

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:38.190
been consumed from 1972 1980 tea would
be 10 years so I just plug in the value

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:38.200
be 10 years so I just plug in the value
 

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:47.070
be 10 years so I just plug in the value
10 into T so 10 times point 0 7 is 0

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:47.080
10 into T so 10 times point 0 7 is 0
 

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:51.330
10 into T so 10 times point 0 7 is 0
point 7 so the answers to 30 e to the

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:51.340
point 7 so the answers to 30 e to the
 

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.670
point 7 so the answers to 30 e to the
point 7 minus 2 30 and that happens to

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:53.680
point 7 minus 2 30 and that happens to
 

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:57.650
point 7 minus 2 30 and that happens to
be approximately 233 bout billion

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:57.660
be approximately 233 bout billion
 

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:03.480
be approximately 233 bout billion
barrels okay so you could think about it

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:03.490
barrels okay so you could think about it
 

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:05.610
barrels okay so you could think about it
in the following way remember we started

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:05.620
in the following way remember we started
 

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:10.620
in the following way remember we started
out in 1970 consuming 16 billion barrels

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:10.630
out in 1970 consuming 16 billion barrels
 

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:15.090
out in 1970 consuming 16 billion barrels
a year if we just consumed 16 billion

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:15.100
a year if we just consumed 16 billion
 

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.210
a year if we just consumed 16 billion
barrels of year for 10 years we would

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:18.220
barrels of year for 10 years we would
 

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:23.610
barrels of year for 10 years we would
have consumed 160 right but because we

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:23.620
have consumed 160 right but because we
 

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:28.110
have consumed 160 right but because we
have exponential growth by 19 let's say

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:28.120
have exponential growth by 19 let's say
 

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.760
have exponential growth by 19 let's say
this is 1980 we're at a significantly

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:32.770
this is 1980 we're at a significantly
 

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:35.750
this is 1980 we're at a significantly
higher number so it's not 16 times ten

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760
higher number so it's not 16 times ten
 

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.210
higher number so it's not 16 times ten
at ten so it's not 160 but it turns out

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:39.220
at ten so it's not 160 but it turns out
 

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:43.590
at ten so it's not 160 but it turns out
to be 2 30 30 e is an actual number

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600
to be 2 30 30 e is an actual number
 

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:48.810
to be 2 30 30 e is an actual number
it's approximately 2.7 one so it's in

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:48.820
it's approximately 2.7 one so it's in
 

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.419
it's approximately 2.7 one so it's in
your calculator right he is a constant

00:20:51.419 --> 00:20:51.429
your calculator right he is a constant
 

00:20:51.429 --> 00:20:56.880
your calculator right he is a constant
eat so he is a constant okay so actually

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:56.890
eat so he is a constant okay so actually
 

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:58.320
eat so he is a constant okay so actually
this is going to go first because I

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:58.330
this is going to go first because I
 

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:00.539
this is going to go first because I
think you understand integration now and

00:21:00.539 --> 00:21:00.549
think you understand integration now and
 

00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:03.000
think you understand integration now and
we're really going to talk about its

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:03.010
we're really going to talk about its
 

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:06.750
we're really going to talk about its
interpretation and in particular instead

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:06.760
interpretation and in particular instead
 

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.210
interpretation and in particular instead
of talking about the indefinite integral

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:09.220
of talking about the indefinite integral
 

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.700
of talking about the indefinite integral
will talk about the definite integral so

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:11.710
will talk about the definite integral so
 

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:15.750
will talk about the definite integral so
you see from that last application that

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:15.760
you see from that last application that
 

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.029
you see from that last application that
you can think of the integral as a

00:21:18.029 --> 00:21:18.039
you can think of the integral as a
 

00:21:18.039 --> 00:21:21.149
you can think of the integral as a
function that gives you the area under a

00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:21.159
function that gives you the area under a
 

00:21:21.159 --> 00:21:24.210
function that gives you the area under a
curve okay just like you could think of

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:24.220
curve okay just like you could think of
 

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.159
curve okay just like you could think of
the derivative as a function that gives

00:21:26.159 --> 00:21:26.169
the derivative as a function that gives
 

00:21:26.169 --> 00:21:30.000
the derivative as a function that gives
you the slope of a curve you can think

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:30.010
you the slope of a curve you can think
 

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.430
you the slope of a curve you can think
of the integral as a function that gives

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:32.440
of the integral as a function that gives
 

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:40.260
of the integral as a function that gives
you the area under a curve now often and

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:40.270
you the area under a curve now often and
 

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:43.500
you the area under a curve now often and
so in this case I was looking for the

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:43.510
so in this case I was looking for the
 

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:51.799
so in this case I was looking for the
area under the curve starting at zero

00:21:51.799 --> 00:21:51.809
 
 

00:21:51.809 --> 00:21:54.779
 
the indefinite integral will give you

00:21:54.779 --> 00:21:54.789
the indefinite integral will give you
 

00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:57.960
the indefinite integral will give you
the area under the curve for the entire

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:57.970
the area under the curve for the entire
 

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:03.299
the area under the curve for the entire
function often we want to know the area

00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:03.309
function often we want to know the area
 

00:22:03.309 --> 00:22:06.810
function often we want to know the area
under the curve for a particular segment

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:06.820
under the curve for a particular segment
 

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:13.230
under the curve for a particular segment
of the x-axis let's say from the value

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:13.240
of the x-axis let's say from the value
 

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.539
of the x-axis let's say from the value
of x equal to a to the value of x equal

00:22:15.539 --> 00:22:15.549
of x equal to a to the value of x equal
 

00:22:15.549 --> 00:22:19.279
of x equal to a to the value of x equal
to B we only want to know this area well

00:22:19.279 --> 00:22:19.289
to B we only want to know this area well
 

00:22:19.289 --> 00:22:24.810
to B we only want to know this area well
in principle what I could do is I could

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:24.820
in principle what I could do is I could
 

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:29.010
in principle what I could do is I could
work out the area under this curve from

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:29.020
work out the area under this curve from
 

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:35.310
work out the area under this curve from
minus infinity to be and then work out

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:35.320
minus infinity to be and then work out
 

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.500
minus infinity to be and then work out
the area under this curve from minus

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:37.510
the area under this curve from minus
 

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:41.700
the area under this curve from minus
infinity to a and take the difference

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:41.710
infinity to a and take the difference
 

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:45.330
infinity to a and take the difference
between the two and that's generally

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:45.340
between the two and that's generally
 

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.789
between the two and that's generally
what we do when we compute the definite

00:22:47.789 --> 00:22:47.799
what we do when we compute the definite
 

00:22:47.799 --> 00:22:53.940
what we do when we compute the definite
integral okay and so here I talk about

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:53.950
integral okay and so here I talk about
 

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:56.690
integral okay and so here I talk about
the Riemann sum approximation but

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:56.700
the Riemann sum approximation but
 

00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:01.400
the Riemann sum approximation but
nothing here is more in depth than what

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:01.410
nothing here is more in depth than what
 

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:06.910
nothing here is more in depth than what
I already said so let's just skip that

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:06.920
 
 

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:11.630
 
so what's the definite integral it is

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640
so what's the definite integral it is
 

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.900
so what's the definite integral it is
simply if I didn't have these a's and if

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:14.910
simply if I didn't have these a's and if
 

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:17.630
simply if I didn't have these a's and if
I didn't have this a and B you know what

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640
I didn't have this a and B you know what
 

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.030
I didn't have this a and B you know what
this beast is it's simply the integral

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:20.040
this beast is it's simply the integral
 

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.230
this beast is it's simply the integral
of f of X that's the area under the

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240
of f of X that's the area under the
 

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:33.950
of f of X that's the area under the
curve f of x from minus infinity to plus

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960
curve f of x from minus infinity to plus
 

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.430
curve f of x from minus infinity to plus
infinity now if i put the integral from

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440
infinity now if i put the integral from
 

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.700
infinity now if i put the integral from
A to B then that's like saying i want

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:40.710
A to B then that's like saying i want
 

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:44.030
A to B then that's like saying i want
the area under the curve from A to B if

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:44.040
the area under the curve from A to B if
 

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.250
the area under the curve from A to B if
I don't have the a and B it's from minus

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:46.260
I don't have the a and B it's from minus
 

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:52.880
I don't have the a and B it's from minus
infinity to plus infinity ok so the

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:52.890
infinity to plus infinity ok so the
 

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:54.710
infinity to plus infinity ok so the
definite integral is the limit of the

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720
definite integral is the limit of the
 

00:23:54.720 --> 00:24:00.860
definite integral is the limit of the
Riemann sum as those Delta X's go to 0

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:00.870
Riemann sum as those Delta X's go to 0
 

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:06.590
Riemann sum as those Delta X's go to 0
that's the width of those rectangles and

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600
that's the width of those rectangles and
 

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.560
that's the width of those rectangles and
if FX is continuous and non-negative in

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:09.570
if FX is continuous and non-negative in
 

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:12.170
if FX is continuous and non-negative in
a B then the definite integral is the

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:12.180
a B then the definite integral is the
 

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.910
a B then the definite integral is the
area under the grub the thing that you

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:13.920
area under the grub the thing that you
 

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.500
area under the grub the thing that you
have to watch out for is that this is

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:15.510
have to watch out for is that this is
 

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:18.530
have to watch out for is that this is
non-negative if it were negative then

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:18.540
non-negative if it were negative then
 

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:22.130
non-negative if it were negative then
you'd have to switch some signs around

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:22.140
you'd have to switch some signs around
 

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.350
you'd have to switch some signs around
okay but it's helpful just to think of

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.360
okay but it's helpful just to think of
 

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:28.310
okay but it's helpful just to think of
it as a non negative function any time

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320
it as a non negative function any time
 

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.660
it as a non negative function any time
you have a negative function you can

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:29.670
you have a negative function you can
 

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.760
you have a negative function you can
always convert it into a non negative 1

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:31.770
always convert it into a non negative 1
 

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:34.790
always convert it into a non negative 1
by multiplying by minus 1 which is a

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:34.800
by multiplying by minus 1 which is a
 

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.100
by multiplying by minus 1 which is a
constant which you can take out of the

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:37.110
constant which you can take out of the
 

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:43.910
constant which you can take out of the
integral and so on right okay now what's

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:43.920
integral and so on right okay now what's
 

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.050
integral and so on right okay now what's
the fundamental theorem of calculus it

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:47.060
the fundamental theorem of calculus it
 

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.960
the fundamental theorem of calculus it
sounds it sounds like a big deal but

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:50.970
sounds it sounds like a big deal but
 

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:55.220
sounds it sounds like a big deal but
actually it's it doesn't it doesn't look

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:55.230
actually it's it doesn't it doesn't look
 

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:58.730
actually it's it doesn't it doesn't look
as intimidating as it sounds this is the

00:24:58.730 --> 00:24:58.740
as intimidating as it sounds this is the
 

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:03.770
as intimidating as it sounds this is the
fundamental theorem of calculus suppose
