00:00:00.562 --> 00:00:02.153
- [Voiceover] Hello
grammarians, we're gonna talk

00:00:02.153 --> 00:00:04.220
about that versus which but I would like

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.600
to start off by saying that
in the study of grammar

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.709
there's basically this
long, on-going fight

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.080
between two camps and it's
between the prescriptivists,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.334
who believe that language
has concrete rules

00:00:17.334 --> 00:00:19.185
that need to be abided by,

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.100
and the descriptivists, who also believe

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.680
that language has rules,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.466
but see language as more subject to change

00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.660
than the prescriptivists would like.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.189
Now I find myself to be right
in-between these two camps

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.197
which frequently makes me
feel like I want to stick out

00:00:33.197 --> 00:00:35.488
my hands and say, "You guys stop fighting.

00:00:35.488 --> 00:00:37.143
"You're both right."

00:00:37.143 --> 00:00:39.674
All of this is to say that Bryan Garner,

00:00:39.674 --> 00:00:42.879
the prescriptive author
of my main usage manual,

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.701
Garner's Modern American Usage,

00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:46.803
is not a fan of the word which.

00:00:46.803 --> 00:00:49.241
He thinks it's ruined more sentences

00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:53.188
than any other word in
English through its overuse.

00:00:53.188 --> 00:00:56.055
On the other hand Geoffrey
Pullum, one of the editors

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:58.889
of my descriptive Cambridge
Grammar of English

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:02.047
says that this position of
Garner's is utter bunkum

00:01:02.047 --> 00:01:05.111
and nonsense and that upon
review of the entire body

00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:08.432
of English literature, the
rules about which and that

00:01:08.432 --> 00:01:10.743
are largely made up.

00:01:10.743 --> 00:01:13.552
This is why it's so hard to
get a good straight answer

00:01:13.552 --> 00:01:15.711
to that versus which on the Internet

00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:18.765
because everyone is arguing at once.

00:01:18.765 --> 00:01:21.724
Because half the people say
that there are definite rules

00:01:21.724 --> 00:01:23.084
and then half the other people say,

00:01:23.084 --> 00:01:24.768
"The rules don't matter dude."

00:01:24.768 --> 00:01:28.375
But a prolonged study
of both camps has led me

00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:31.512
to determine that there
are distinctions in usage.

00:01:31.512 --> 00:01:34.404
There is a time to use that
and a time to use which.

00:01:34.404 --> 00:01:36.303
From this entire argument,

00:01:36.303 --> 00:01:39.323
from these generations of just bickering,

00:01:39.323 --> 00:01:42.283
I have sussed out two distinctions.

00:01:42.283 --> 00:01:45.912
Distinction one, that is bad with commas.

00:01:45.912 --> 00:01:49.513
Distinction two, which is bad with people.

00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:54.872
So, let's start with
distinction number one that

00:01:54.872 --> 00:01:57.659
that is bad with commas.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.690
Now Bryan Garner says
that most of the time,

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.467
nine times out of ten in fact, he says

00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:04.276
if you want to use a relative pronoun

00:02:04.276 --> 00:02:06.889
and you're trying to choose
between that and which

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:09.736
you should probably use
that and the one time out

00:02:09.736 --> 00:02:11.741
of ten that you do want to use which,

00:02:11.741 --> 00:02:14.284
you're supposed to use a comma first.

00:02:14.284 --> 00:02:16.687
So, a comma, which, as in,

00:02:16.687 --> 00:02:20.542
"The carrot, which was orange, was tasty."

00:02:20.542 --> 00:02:23.270
So you can write it that way
with this little comma-net,

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.523
but you can also write it without, as in

00:02:25.523 --> 00:02:27.763
"The carrot which was orange was tasty."

00:02:27.763 --> 00:02:29.482
Now the distinction
between these two sentences

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:33.208
is the distinction between non-restrictive

00:02:33.208 --> 00:02:35.611
and restrictive relative clauses.

00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:38.363
Because the carrot, comma,
which was orange, comma,

00:02:38.363 --> 00:02:40.128
was tasty means that you could take

00:02:40.128 --> 00:02:41.649
out the comma-bracketed clause

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:43.924
without changing the
meaning of the sentence.

00:02:43.924 --> 00:02:44.981
"The carrot was tasty."

00:02:44.981 --> 00:02:47.240
But, the carrot, no
comma, which was orange,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.971
no comma, was tasty that

00:02:49.971 --> 00:02:52.070
which part is a restrictive clause.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.090
The fact that the carrot
is orange is essential

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.797
to the sentence.

00:02:55.797 --> 00:02:57.632
"The carrot which was orange was tasty,"

00:02:57.632 --> 00:02:59.671
doesn't preclude the idea
that there might have been

00:02:59.671 --> 00:03:03.518
a non-orange, non-tasty carrot
involved somewhere else.

00:03:03.518 --> 00:03:07.697
However, if we try to use
that in a non-restrictive way,

00:03:07.697 --> 00:03:10.937
to say, "The carrot, that
was orange, was tasty,"

00:03:10.937 --> 00:03:13.897
it, to me, and to other
native English speakers,

00:03:13.897 --> 00:03:15.592
that just sounds a little weird.

00:03:15.592 --> 00:03:17.996
It's not ungrammatical, per se.

00:03:17.996 --> 00:03:20.919
There's nothing about the
word that or which that says,

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.329
"This is what it must be used for."

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.370
But, of all the combinations
that could be made

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.890
using either which or that or commas

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.782
or not commas, that, with commas,

00:03:32.782 --> 00:03:35.469
is the least common,
and that is why to me,

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:38.166
as a speaker and writer of
standard-American English,

00:03:38.166 --> 00:03:40.836
it doesn't look regular.

00:03:40.836 --> 00:03:42.566
And to try that once more, without commas,

00:03:42.566 --> 00:03:45.584
now we have, "The carrot
that was orange was tasty."

00:03:45.584 --> 00:03:48.212
This is restrictive usage again.

00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:51.645
And this one works.

00:03:51.645 --> 00:03:53.804
So, number one works.

00:03:53.804 --> 00:03:54.943
Number two works.

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:58.785
Number three is weird,
and number four is fine.

00:03:58.785 --> 00:04:01.426
So, the distinction here is that

00:04:01.426 --> 00:04:04.602
that just doesn't play well with commas.

00:04:04.602 --> 00:04:07.447
That's distinction number one.

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:10.012
Okay, so distinction number two,

00:04:10.012 --> 00:04:12.868
which is bad with people.

00:04:12.868 --> 00:04:14.726
So the way I like to remember this

00:04:14.726 --> 00:04:18.906
is that I imagine a witch who
does not like other people.

00:04:18.906 --> 00:04:21.111
So I just imagine a kind of a cranky witch

00:04:21.111 --> 00:04:23.187
who lives all alone in
a house in the woods,

00:04:23.187 --> 00:04:25.194
and anytime someone comes up to her house

00:04:25.194 --> 00:04:27.531
and asks her if she wants a
subscription to a magazine,

00:04:27.531 --> 00:04:28.832
or does she want to come over for dinner,

00:04:28.832 --> 00:04:31.293
she says, "Blah!", and she slams the door.

00:04:31.293 --> 00:04:34.625
The which witch doesn't like people.

00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:37.574
So the way this shakes out is that which

00:04:37.574 --> 00:04:39.188
doesn't refer to people,

00:04:39.188 --> 00:04:42.091
and that can refer to anything.

00:04:42.091 --> 00:04:45.132
This is also really strange
and it portrays a prejudice,

00:04:45.132 --> 00:04:48.092
in English, toward human beings.

00:04:48.092 --> 00:04:49.126
Check this out.

00:04:49.126 --> 00:04:52.807
To prove this, let me throw
some sentence fragments at you.

00:04:52.807 --> 00:04:55.930
"The dog that I saw, the snow that fell,

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.811
"the woman that boarded the plane,"

00:04:57.811 --> 00:04:59.493
all of these are fine.

00:04:59.493 --> 00:05:02.246
Let's try them again with which.

00:05:02.246 --> 00:05:05.624
"The dog which I saw, the snow which fell,

00:05:05.624 --> 00:05:07.644
"the woman which boarded the plane,"

00:05:07.644 --> 00:05:09.522
now, this to me, as a
native speaker of English,

00:05:09.522 --> 00:05:11.104
doesn't sound right.

00:05:11.104 --> 00:05:14.332
It should either be who or that.

00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:18.790
And again, this isn't
because of some kind of rule

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.485
of official grammar.

00:05:20.485 --> 00:05:24.803
This is just the way that
the language has shaken out.

00:05:24.803 --> 00:05:29.138
Which just doesn't have a
connotation of human beings.

00:05:30.028 --> 00:05:32.512
So that's the essential distinction.

00:05:32.512 --> 00:05:34.730
That doesn't like commas.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.911
Which is bad with people.

00:05:37.911 --> 00:05:39.374
You can learn anything.

00:05:39.374 --> 00:05:40.637
David out.
