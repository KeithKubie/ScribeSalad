00:00:00.304 --> 00:00:02.470
What I want to do in this
video is talk a little bit

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.750
about plate tectonics.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.370
And you've probably
heard the word before,

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.040
and are probably,
or you might be

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.630
somewhat familiar with
what it discusses.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.360
And it's really just the idea
that the surface of the Earth

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.620
is made up of a bunch
of these rigid plates.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.390
So it's broken up into
a bunch of rigid plates,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.950
and these rigid plates move
relative to each other.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.860
They move relative to
each other and take

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.740
everything that's
on them for a ride.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.610
And the things that are on
them include the continents.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.830
So it literally is talking about
the movement of these plates.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.720
And over here I have
a picture I got off

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.600
of Wikipedia of
the actual plates.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.440
And over here you have
the Pacific Plate.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.490
Let me do that in
a darker color.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.400
You have the Pacific Plate.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.527
You have a Nazca Plate.

00:00:50.527 --> 00:00:51.860
You have a South American Plate.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.540
I could keep going on.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.580
You have an Antarctic Plate.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.016
It's actually,
obviously whenever

00:00:55.016 --> 00:00:56.640
you do a projection
onto two dimensions

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.820
of a surface of a sphere,
the stuff at the bottom

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.990
and the top look much bigger
than they actually are.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.200
Antarctica isn't
this big relative

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.819
to say North America
or South America.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.040
It's just that we've
had to stretch it out

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.090
to fill up the rectangle.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.469
But that's the Antarctic
Plate, North American Plate.

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.010
And you can see that
they're actually

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.680
moving relative to each other.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.010
And that's what these
arrows are depicting.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.020
You see right over
here the Nazca Plate

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.680
and the Pacific Plate are
moving away from each other.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.079
New land is forming here.

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:24.870
We'll talk more about
that in other videos.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.000
You see right over here in the
middle of the Atlantic Ocean

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.434
the African Plate and the South
American Plate meet each other,

00:01:31.434 --> 00:01:33.350
and they're moving away
from each other, which

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.590
means that new land, more plate
material I guess you could say,

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.274
is somehow being
created right here--

00:01:40.274 --> 00:01:41.940
we'll talk about that
in future videos--

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.690
and pushing these
two plates apart.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.050
Now, before we go into the
evidence for plate tectonics

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.240
or even some of the more details
about how plates are created

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.039
and some theories as to
why the plates might move,

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.580
what I want to do
is get a little bit

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.900
of the terminology of plate
tectonics out of the way.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.070
Because sometimes people
call them crustal plates,

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.920
and that's not exactly right.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.360
And to show you the
difference, what I want to do

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.600
is show you two different
ways of classifying

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.025
the different
layers of the Earth

00:02:13.025 --> 00:02:15.400
and then think about how they
might relate to each other.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.400
So what you traditionally
see, and actually I've

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.800
made a video that goes into
a lot more detail of this,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.350
is a breakdown of the
chemical layers of the Earth.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.050
And when I talk about
chemical layers,

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.711
I'm talking about what
are the constituents

00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:29.710
of the different layers?

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.460
So when you talk
of it in this term,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.000
the top most layer, which is the
thinnest layer, is the crust.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.710
Then below that is the mantle.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.150
Actually, let me show
you the whole Earth,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.360
although I'm not going
to draw it to scale.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.470
So if I were to draw
the crust, the crust

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.200
is the thinnest outer
layer of the Earth.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.450
You can imagine the blue
line itself is the crust.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.300
Then below that,
you have the mantle.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.540
So everything between the
blue and the orange line,

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.890
this over here is the mantle.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.980
So let me label the crust.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.320
The crust you can literally
view as the actual blue pixels

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.310
over here.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.990
And then inside of the
mantle, you have the core.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.322
And when you do this
very high level division,

00:03:19.322 --> 00:03:20.530
these are chemical divisions.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.710
This is saying that
the crust is made up

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.630
of different types of elements.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.560
Its makeup is different
than the stuff that's

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.550
in the mantle, which is
made up of different things

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.460
than what's inside the core.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.889
It's not describing the
mechanical properties of it.

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.680
And when I talk about
mechanical properties

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:52.870
I'm talking about whether
something is solid and rigid.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.150
Or maybe it's so hot and
melted it's kind of a magma,

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.050
or kind of a plastic solid.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.940
So this would be the
most brittle stuff.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.260
If it gets warmed up, if rock
starts to melt a little bit,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.540
then you have
something like a magma,

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.030
or you can view it as like a
deformable or a plastic solid.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.570
When we talk about plastic,
I'm not talking about the stuff

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.279
that the case of your
cellphone is made of.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.230
I'm talking about
it's deformable.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.550
This rock is deformable
because it's so hot

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.820
and it's somewhat melted.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.380
It kind of behaves like a fluid.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.980
It actually does
behave like a fluid,

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.440
but it's much more viscous.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.999
It's much thicker
and slower moving

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:33.540
than what we would
normally associate

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.720
with a fluid like water.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.730
So this a viscous fluid.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.145
And then the most fluid would,
of course, be the liquid state.

00:04:45.145 --> 00:04:46.520
This is what we
mean when we talk

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.320
about the mechanical properties.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.880
And when you look at
this division over here,

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.570
the crust is solid.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.600
The mantle actually has some
parts of it that are solid.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.530
So the uppermost part
of the mantle is solid.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.140
Then below that, the
rest of the mantle

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.240
is kind of in this magma,
this deformable, somewhat

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.600
fluid state, and
depending on what depth

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.160
you go into the
mantle there are kind

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.780
of different levels of fluidity.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.000
And then the core,
the outer level layer

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.450
of the core, the
outer core is liquid,

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.040
because the
temperature is so high.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.660
The inner core is made
up of the same things,

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.590
and the temperature
is even higher,

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.010
but since the pressure is
so high it's actually solid.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.460
So that's why the mantle,
crust, and core differentiations

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.810
don't tell you whether it's
solid, whether it's magma,

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.380
or whether it's really a liquid.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.724
It just really tells
you what the makeup is.

00:05:40.724 --> 00:05:42.390
Now, to think about
the makeup, and this

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.765
is important for
plate tectonics,

00:05:43.765 --> 00:05:45.426
because when we talk
about these plates

00:05:45.426 --> 00:05:47.050
we're not talking
about just the crust.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.500
We're talking about
the outer, rigid layer.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.430
Let me just zoom
in a little bit.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.420
Let's say we zoomed
in right over there.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.230
So now we have the
crust zoomed in.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.060
This right here is the crust.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.540
And then everything
below here we're actually

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.344
talking about the upper mantle.

00:06:08.344 --> 00:06:10.510
We haven't gotten too deep
in the mantle right here.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.259
So that's why we call
it the upper mantle.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.530
Now, right below the
crust, the mantle

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.030
is cool enough that it is
also in real solid form.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:30.370
So this right here
is solid mantle.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.930
And when we talk
about the plates

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.640
were actually talking about
the outer solid layer.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.530
So that includes both the
crust and the solid part

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:40.480
of the mantle.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.920
And we call that
the lithosphere.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.220
When people talk
about plate tectonics,

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.970
they shouldn't say
crustal plates.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.635
They should call these
lithospheric plates.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.220
And then below the
lithosphere you

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.540
have the least viscous
part of the mantle,

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.580
because the temperature is high
enough for the rock to melt,

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.970
but the pressure
isn't so large as what

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.550
will happen when you go into
the lower part of the mantle

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.070
that the fluid can actually
kind of move past each other,

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.360
although still pretty viscous.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.340
This still a magma.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.930
So this is still kind
of in its magma state.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.530
And this fluid
part of the mantle,

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.210
we can't quite call
it a liquid yet,

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.420
but over large periods of time
it does have fluid properties.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.310
This, that essentially
the lithosphere

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.120
is kind of riding on top of,
we call this the asthenosphere.

00:07:41.109 --> 00:07:43.400
So when we talk about the
lithosphere and asthenosphere

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.340
we're really talking
about mechanical layers.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.140
The outer layer, the solid
layers, the lithosphere sphere.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.710
The more fluid layer right
below that is the asthenosphere.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.920
When we talk about the
crust, mantle, and core,

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.310
we are talking about
chemical properties, what

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.526
are the things
actually made up of.
