00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.779
And 2001 was important film for me because I didn't understand it when I saw it

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.520
Our dad had taken me and I was so frustrated by the movie

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.960
and kind of hated the movie

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.280
when I first saw it I was like

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.300
*grrrrr*

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.900
What is that stupid black thing?

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.080
*laughing*

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.540
*mumbling*

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.780
... Stupid...

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.280
*laughing*

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.180
And I was like "I didn't get what was the black thing" and he said that's a symbol and I kind of like knew what the word was

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.660
But then suddenly I had a visual understanding of what the word was

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.000
I was like "A symbol of what?"  and he said "Uh it's kind of like a symbol for the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.920
Consciousness of God", I didn't even understand what that meant

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.400
But it sounded amazing and so then I asked him to take me back to see it again

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.500
and I saw it again and then whenever I saw the symbol I thought of like "God" and

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.220
it made more sense to me suddenly and this was like a strange phenomenon that you could suddenly

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.448
Look at something and then have different eyes and see it again and understand it in a completely different way

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.560
"The answer is out there Neo

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:18.679
It's looking for you"

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.259
"Let me tell you why you're here

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.629
You're here because you know something. What you know, you can't explain but you feel it

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.428
You felt it your entire life. You don't know what it is, but it's there. It is this feeling that has brought you to me

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.120
Do you know what I'm talking about?"

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.020
Filmmaker Lily Wachowski formerly known as Andy came out publicly as transgender on Tuesday

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.800
Something her sister and creative partner Lana did years before

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.740
There's a critical eye being cast back on Lana's and my work through the lens of our transness

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.540
"It seems that you've been living... two lives"

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.920
I finally came out to my family

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.760
When I told my mom what was going on she jumped on a plane immediately

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.880
There was this big tear-soaked baptism

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.900
And she confessed that she'd been afraid to come here. To arrive and grieve the loss of her son

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.140
"Am I dead?"

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.120
"Far from it"

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.180
But when she arrived she found it wasn't so much as a death as it was a discovery.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.640
"I just thought um...

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.940
You were a guy..."

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.140
"Most guys do"

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.160
That there was this other part of me. An unseen part.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.180
She felt it was like a gift because now she could get to know that part of me

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.600
"One of this lives... Has a future. And one of them does not."

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.080
I stare into a mirror. Boy, mirrors can be tough for all of us, but trans people... That can be brutal.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.500
"Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.720
A prison for your mind."

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:09.860
I kept this strange relentless vigil staring in the mirror for hours afraid of what one day I might see

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.760
"You have to see it for yourself"

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.740
The enduring power of the Cinderella Myth is this catharsis, this fitting of a slipper

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.860
representing this intersection of who we see in the looking-glass with who we want to be

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.040
"Your appearance now is what we call Residual Self Image

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.680
It is the mental projection of your digital self"

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.500
"I'm going to show them a world without you

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.080
a world without rules and controls. Without Borders or boundaries

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.720
A world where anything is possible"

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.040
Here one checked box. One letter. an M

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:52.380
granted me access to legal social financial privilege while another box, another letter, an F, denied them to me

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.400
Early on I am told to get in line after a morning bell. Girls in one line, Boys in the other

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.580
I walk past the girls feeling this strange powerful gravity of association

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.340
As soon as I look towards the other line though, I feel a feeling of differentiation that confuses me

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.729
I don't belong there either. I stop in between them

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.358
"Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you"

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.380
"You hear that Mr. Anderson?

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.520
That is the sound of inevitability"

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.060
When I see the headlight I take off my backpack and I put it on the bench. And this is the note in front of it

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.500
I try not to think of anything but jumping as the train comes

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.820
"It is the sound of your death

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.060
Goodbye Mr. Anderson"

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.860
We went to dinner I dress as feminine as I could wanting to be seen by strangers as Lana

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.560
Hoping that waiters would not call me  "Sir", or "He"

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.260
"My name...

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.960
Is Neo!"

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.100
"Hi I'm Lynne, this is my daughter Lana" the waitress smiled and said "wow, she looks just like you"

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.080
Of all the things I love about my hair

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:25.080
High on the list is the way children stare at it with fascination and delight

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.900
I can sometimes see their imagination bright in their eyes, recalibrating the possible

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:37.780
It is my hope that a symbol like pink dreads might help them understand

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.920
"normal" is something that does not have to be defined for you, but rather by you

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.160
I am here because when I was young I wanted very badly to be a writer

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:56.420
I wanted to be a filmmaker, but I couldn't find anyone like me in the world and it felt that my dreams were foreclosed

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.580
Simply because my gender was less typical than others

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.880
It's an excellent reminder that art is never static and while the ideas of identity and transformation are

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.780
critical components in our work the bedrock that all ideas rest upon is love

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.360
You can't be dead

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.600
You can't be

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.240
Because I love you

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:27.540
I know I am also here because of the strength and courage and love that I'm blessed to receive from my wife my family and my friends

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.160
And in this way, I hope to offer their love in the form of my materiality

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:42.280
So this world that we imagined in this room that might be used to gain access to other rooms to other worlds previously unimaginable

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.420
He told me I wasn't really looking for him. I was looking for an answer

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.440
It's the question that drives us Neo

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.920
It's the question that brought you here. You know the question, just as I did

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.740
What is the Matrix?

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.120
The Matrix remains relevant today because there are so many different ways to interpret the movie

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.880
you could just as easily have made a video about the Matrix through the lens of Philosophy Marxism or even Buddhism

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:18.120
There's no correct way to interpret a movie but certain interpretations can give us powerful insights into the world we live in

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.500
Or even an idea of what some people are going through

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.240
Part of the power of the Internet is how it gives us access to these unique perspectives

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.840
But it can sometimes be tough to separate the good content from the bad

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.760
To save time and focus on great content I highly recommend the documentaries on Curiosity Stream
