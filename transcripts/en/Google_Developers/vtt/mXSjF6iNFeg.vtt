ADE OSHINEYE: OK, excellent,
good morning.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.350
In the immortal words of Kevin
Sorbo, let's bring it.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.300
So my name is Ade Oshineye.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.920
I'm a developer advocate
on the Google+ team.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.100
And I'd like to welcome you to
the very first Google+ session

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.100
anybody has ever done
at Google I/O.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.370
And let's begin.

00:00:35.218 --> 00:00:38.632
So as you can see, I wear this
leather jacket a lot.

00:00:38.632 --> 00:00:41.380
I'm Ade Oshineye, I'm a
developer advocate on Google+.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.740
I'm based in the
London office.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.120
And this.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.260
JULIE FARAGO: And I'm
Julie Farago.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.330
I'm an engineering manager
on Google+.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.430
And I'm based in the
Cambridge office.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.130
And I'm going to talk to you a
bit about all of the places

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.980
that you go when you
use Google+.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.930
So many of you, I believe,
use Google+ today.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.140
How many of you actually
used Google+ today?

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.445
Awesome, good, fantastic.

00:01:05.445 --> 00:01:07.800
And if you use Google+, you're
probably very familiar with

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.250
the stream, and have hopefully
been privy to a lot of really

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.240
excellent conversations that
happen on the steam.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.420
What we find is that when
conversations start on the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.130
stream that people engage
with them very deeply.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.500
I think you just saw some stats
about how our active

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.400
users are spending 12 minutes
a day on the stream.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.750
The comment threads are
rich, people +1 posts,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.950
they reshare them.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.820
There's a lot of engagement
that happens there.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.590
I work on a team that builds
tools for publishers.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.470
And when we saw all of this
incredibly rich engagement on

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.780
the stream, one thing that we
wanted to do is help highlight

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.470
that engagement and help you,
as publishers and as site

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.320
owners, understand it more.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.100
So have any of you
used Ripples?

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.420
Awesome.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.220
So if you haven't used Ripples,
I highly recommend

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.100
checking it out.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.830
Ripples is a data visualization
tool that our

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.120
team built in partnership with
a data visualization team and

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.270
research to help you better
understand what happens when

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.600
your posts go viral.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.670
So if a URL, if a link from your
site gets shared, if a

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.610
post that you create on your +
page gets reshared many, many

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.320
times, then you can actually go
and view the ripple effect,

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.180
the viral effect, of that
post on Google+.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.360
By using this tool, you
can see who the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.630
key influencers are.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.310
So this post right here is a
post that the PM that I work

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.692
with, Rick Borovoy, made about
one of the launches that we

00:02:26.692 --> 00:02:28.270
had earlier in the year,
the Share button.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.240
And you can see that after he
posted, he was able to see,

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.250
OK, well, it turns out that a
lot of the Google pages helped

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.720
his post actually go viral.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.080
So having those connections
helped him

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.370
reach a broader audience.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.580
In terms of audience, I think
you were all at the keynote,

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.300
but we've just announced that
we have 250 million upgraded

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.030
Google+ users.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.910
We're really excited about this
number of users because,

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.030
as many of you know, the product
is only a year old.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.110
And if you would have asked me
what I expected a year ago, I

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.340
don't think that I would have
thought of this at all.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.160
So we're really excited
about where we are.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.770
And I am particularly excited
about all of you using your

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.220
amazing content to engage all
of these users even more.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.410
Another great place where we
go when you use Google+ is

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.660
actually onto Google Search.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.240
So before I worked on Google+,
I actually worked on Google

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.050
Image Search.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.960
And one of the big things that
I worked on while there, with

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.750
a number of other engineers,
was working on getting your

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.700
friends' images into Google
Image Search.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.750
And at the same time we
were doing something

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:30.760
similar in web search.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.000
This is back in late
2009, early 2010.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.680
When Google+ started, we found a
much, much better channel to

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.450
be able to enable you, as
publishers, to get social

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.460
recommendations for your
content on to search.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:49.440
So today if Ade, for example,
shares a great place that I

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.720
should go in San Francisco to
me on Google+, or if he +1's

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.830
that place, or if he follows its
+ page, then when I search

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.240
for places to go in San
Francisco, or charities to

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.640
work with or to volunteer for
in San Francisco, then I can

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.480
see his social annotation,
his endorsement,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.470
on that search result.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.180
The reason why we believe that
this is incredibly meaningful,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.710
hopefully you do as well, is
because Google Search is many

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.105
people's portal onto the web.

00:04:15.105 --> 00:04:17.029
It is the way that
they discover.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.649
And so by taking social
recommendations off of just

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:21.790
the social destination site and
bringing it to places like

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.860
Search, we believe it really
dramatically increases

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.420
people's ability to
discover the best

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.132
content across the web.

00:04:30.132 --> 00:04:34.090
And then, one of the great
things about being on Google

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.750
Search is, of course, again
that we just announced, we

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.215
have 150 million 30-day actives,
and 75 million one

00:04:43.215 --> 00:04:44.110
day actives.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.405
So the opportunity to reach
people is overwhelming.

00:04:48.405 --> 00:04:51.290
It's wonderful.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.340
But we're not just
on Search, social

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.980
annotations also affect Ads.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.630
So earlier this week, I was
actually trying to find a

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.810
place to stay near a small
amusement park called Story

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:04.550
Land in New Hampshire.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.960
I don't know if any of you have
been there, but it's a

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.350
great place for little kids.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.880
We're heading up there
over July 4 weekend.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.400
And I did a search on Google for
Story Land places to stay

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.110
and I actually saw a
social endorsement

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.900
from one of my friends.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.050
I didn't look any further.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.420
I went, I booked the hotel, and

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.530
that's where we're staying.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.000
What we found is that social
annotations result in a 5% to

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.220
10% increase in CTR on Ads.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.790
So the impact there, again,
we believe is quite

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:38.550
marked and very real.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.210
Likewise, not just on Ads, but
my team has also been doing a

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.570
fair amount of investigation
into what the

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:44.860
impact is on Search.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.440
And again, we've seen that from
your friends, from close

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.500
social ties, there is a marked
impact on CTR when a friend

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.020
endorses a search result.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.970
So again, by being on the
stream, by being in Search, by

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.900
being in Ads, we believe that
social sharing and social

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.480
annotations can be a great
tool for discovery.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.460
Finally, I'm really excited
about this.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.280
I don't know if any of you
guys saw this yesterday.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.480
But my team was working late
nights, long weekends, a

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.970
couple all-nighters, to try and
launch recommendations in

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.230
the +1 Button.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.290
So as of today, if you're part
of the platform preview group,

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.800
you can now hover over a +1
Button on any site and see

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.860
recommendations for related,
popular, similar content on

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.130
that same site.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.990
What we're trying to do with
this is make +1, and sharing,

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.320
and following, all these
different tools that we have,

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.200
a discovery tool, not just on
Google but also where it

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.560
actually lives, so
on your site.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.300
And one of the big reasons why
we're doing this is because

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.050
Google+ plugins get many
billions of impressions a day.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.760
So with those billions of
impressions, we want to

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.690
convert that into more traffic
for you, more discovery for

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.910
our users, and just a better
experience overall.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.270
And so with that, I'm going to
hand off to Ade who will tell

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.160
you about how to get there.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:01.760
ADE OSHINEYE: Hello.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.230
Can I just check?

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.840
Who here in this room
is a member of the

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.370
platform preview group?

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.940
So about a third of the you.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:09.840
Great.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.670
So today I'm going to talk to
you about a Google+ platform.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:17.930
But first, I'd like to introduce
you to my family.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.630
Anybody want to guess which
of those people is me?

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.430
Clearly, it's 30-something
years old.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.500
So I'm the baby in this photo

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.890
And one of the interesting
things about the job that I do

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.110
and my family is that my family
are very, very sharp,

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.790
but they're not technical.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.790
So when they heard I had a job
at Google as a developer

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.880
advocate, they wanted to know
what exactly does that mean?

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.440
And then they asked a question
which my manager sometimes

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.260
asks, what exactly
do you do here?

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.510
Now my manager is currently
unable to be here through

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.340
illness, so I don't have to
explain to him, thankfully.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.210
But with my family, I say I work
on the Google+ platform.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.960
And because they're not
technical, their response is

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.040
usually, what's one of those?

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.120
And I say, because I'm an
engineer, a platform is a

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.280
combination of plugins,
and APIs, and SDKs.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.972
And then they get
more confused.

00:08:13.972 --> 00:08:17.920
And I say, OK, OK, I can explain
what a platform is.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.750
Think of it this way.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.280
We're Google and there are lots
of people out who have

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.440
got websites, who have got
web applications, native

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.100
applications, and they would
like Google to help them solve

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:30.635
hard problems.

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:33.090
They would like Google to do
the heavy lifting that they

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.990
can build on top of and then
use that to build better

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.510
businesses.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.510
And then they sort of say, wait
a minute, how is this

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.070
kind of thing going to work?

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.760
And I say, well, think
about it this way.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:49.720
If we can build tools, plugins,
to help people, we

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.300
can actually make a difference
to those developers.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.150
And since you're more technical
than my family, what

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.660
you're going to have by the end
of this section is you are

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.220
going to understand how our
plugins, our platform, can

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.610
drive traffic to your site,
how it make sure that that

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.240
traffic, those people, when
they get to your site, are

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.940
more engaged.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.260
I'm going to talk to you about
how you can increase the

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.940
clickthrough rate, how many
people click on your links in

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.810
Search, your links in the
stream, by modifying the

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.600
snippets to your pages.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.360
I'm hopefully going to tell you
how you can increase the

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.970
amount of times your content
is reshared on Google+.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.790
Small secret, cat pictures.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.110
Now the Google+ platform is
made up of a lot of tools.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.060
And what you've seen over the
last year is we've been slowly

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.060
adding to that toolbox.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.180
In this session, I'm going to
basically give you a broad

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.920
overview and then point you to
other sessions that are going

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.050
to be much deeper, much more
detailed, about these tools

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.300
and how you can use them.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.580
Now when I first started putting
together these slides,

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.810
I was going to give you lots
of examples based on the

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:00.460
well-known site, example.com.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.560
However, Google+ is a
social [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.090
It's social.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:07.440
Social is about people and the
connections between them.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.380
So it seems a bit weird
to have an abstract

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.600
example like that.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.440
So I switched to my own site.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.705
It's a superb little website.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.000
Now the problem with anybody who
builds a site is you build

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.900
your site and you hope
they will come.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.080
How do they find you?

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:31.610
Well, a little bit of hope, a
little bit of prayer, or this

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:32.150
little site.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.170
You may have of it.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.930
It's called google.com.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.450
Now what happens is somebody
hears of me, perhaps they see

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:41.420
my hat passing in the street.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.945
And they say, who was
that man in the hat?

00:10:43.945 --> 00:10:49.180
They type my name into Search
and they get the classic

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.000
Google Search results.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.500
Now for those of you who don't
know what a snippet is, it's

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.170
the little box of text that
appears below the link.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:59.740
This is how Google is telling
you this page, this link, is

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.100
about this.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.400
This is what the person who is
searching is going to use to

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.650
make their decision.

00:11:06.865 --> 00:11:09.220
Now google.com is fantastic.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.350
And we asked ourselves, how
can we improve on that?

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:13.925
How do you upgrade
that experience?

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.520
Well the way you upgrade
the experience of using

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.550
google.com, the way you give
users better results, more

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:28.120
relevant results, the way you
give publishers more traffic,

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.390
more engagement, is you give
publishers more control over

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.900
their search results.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.370
You give them more power
to control the snippet.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:39.200
This is the snippet that turns
up for my own website,

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.750
oshineye.com.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.230
It's fantastic.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.490
But as you'll see, the same
snippet appears in the web

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.910
search results and in
the Google+ stream.

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.750
It shows my face, it shows my
name, it shows a catchy little

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.310
phrase I came up with
a long time ago.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.490
The way we give people like
you and me control of the

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.050
snippet is with a technology
called schema.org.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:07.140
Who here has not heard
of schema.org?

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.330
OK, great, this is for you.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:14.130
Schema.org is a community driven
project where Google,

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.590
Bing, Yahoo, Yandex, and the
community got together and

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:21.140
said, what if we could markup
web pages in a way that showed

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.420
you the entities inside the
pages, that took us from a web

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.090
of pages with text in them to
a web of entities where you

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.610
understood that a page was about
a person, or a place, or

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.590
a review, or a recipe?

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.930
And if you could do that in some
way that didn't involve

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:39.350
breaking the web, that didn't
involve rewriting the web.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:43.340
So you want some method where
you can embed a few extra

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:47.200
invisible attributes into your
web page and now search

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.310
engines and other tools can know
what the page is about.

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.580
They don't have to
guess anymore.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.860
When we talk about an entity,
which can be a person, a

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.110
place, a review, and it's an
extensible ontology, so you

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:03.500
can add many, many more entity
types, it's four basic things.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:07.140
The type, is it a person, is
it a place, is it a review?

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.410
The name, obviously, if it's a
person, the name is the name.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:12.840
If it's a book, it's a title.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.550
An image, so for me, of course,
it's a photo of me.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:17.800
And, of course, you
get a description.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.310
So those are the four things you
need to describe an entity

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.120
within Google.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.690
Now we've already been doing
a lot of work in web search

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.270
around rich snippets.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.760
And we extended the rich
snippets testing tool to also

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.000
support schema.org.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.310
And what this means is you can
point a URL in there and we'll

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:39.930
show you, not just the rich
snippets in there, not just

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.170
the micro formats, but a
schema.org markup in there,

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.240
and show you the entities
in that web page.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.430
The other thing we got when we
spoke to people was they said,

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:55.740
it's not enough just to have
rich snippets testing, I need

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.400
help in creating my web
page in the beginning.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.770
So we built this snippet
config tool.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.870
As you can see, it has a
drop-down where you can pick

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:08.140
the most common entity types,
put in your title or name, the

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.530
URL, the description, and we'll
show you what the markup

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:11.780
will look like.

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:18.410
For example, on this rather nice
little website, you can

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:20.450
see this is a web page.

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:23.080
Now as a human, you look at
that and you say this is a

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.860
page about a person.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.980
For a search engine,
that's hard.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.710
What you want is some way
to markup the HTML.

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:37.870
So if you look at the red
sections, what I've done is I

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:42.320
basically said that I want to
say this whole page, so from

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.360
the body element downwards to
the closing body element, is

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.150
about a person.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:50.025
And that I want to say the
name of the person.

00:14:50.025 --> 00:14:52.740
So as you can see, just by
adding those red sections,

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.380
I've said this page is
about an entity.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.820
I've said the description of
the entity, I've given the

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.965
image, and now you know what
the page is about.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.660
So now I have a website.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.250
Google and other search
engines know what

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:11.190
this website is about.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:12.440
And it's rather cool.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.920
But how are people going
to connect to this?

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.310
They go to the website
and they say,

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:21.580
well nothing's changed.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.220
They go back and nothing's
changed.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.930
What you need is a mechanism
where they can choose to

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:31.080
follow a Google+ page, perhaps,
and be notified when

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.100
new things happen.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.940
So with Google+ pages, you can
create a connection with

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.600
people who visit your website,
and use that to tell them when

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.200
interesting things happen.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.510
Here's an example of something
me and some friends built.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.380
It's about Developer
Experience.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.700
Who here has heard of Developer
Experience?

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.620
Excellent, our marketing
campaign is working

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:52.660
brilliantly.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.110
It's just me and a couple of
friends, so we don't exactly

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.840
have a massive budget.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.660
We do have a Google+
page, however.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:02.490
And on that, we post links to
the new articles we write, we

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.680
post links to events
we attend.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.580
Whenever one of us writes
something interesting about

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.920
Developer Experience,
we put links here.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.030
And as you can see, we've got
a pretty big following for

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:14.170
something done by three people
in their spare time.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:17.000
And the beauty of this is that
this is something that lets

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.960
those people know when we do
something new and interesting.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:27.090
Now the thing about Google+
pages is that for me and my

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:30.120
two friends, who you may have
heard of, Pamela Fox, Michael

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.610
Mahemoff, we all want to manage
the page, but we don't

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:34.720
want to share a password.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.340
So Google+ lets multiple
people manage one page.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:41.490
At the same time, Google+
lets one person

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.050
manage multiple pages.

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:45.890
As you can see there, I
have one, two, three,

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:48.310
four Google+ pages.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:51.330
The last one is particularly
funny.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:53.960
Who here has a Google+ page?

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.000
Keep your hands up.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.700
OK, who here has two?

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.800
Four?

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.050
Six?

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.970
Who has five?

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.890
Gerwin wins.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.890
So the nice thing about Google+
is you can create

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:13.410
many, many pages for
interesting things,

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:17.429
interesting concepts, brands,
books, your blog, whatever.

00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:20.930
And you can use this to build a
community around that idea.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:23.819
So we have a community around
Developer Experience.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:26.230
There's a much smaller community
around my book, it's

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:27.400
really good.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.360
There's an incredibly small
community around my blog.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.850
And of course, there's my You've
Never Heard Of Google+

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:36.420
page, which is where I make
mocking comments about my

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:39.420
colleagues when they've never
heard of Richard Dawkins or

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.640
Neil Gaiman and I post a
link so they can learn.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:50.770
Speaking of my colleagues, if
you want to learn more about

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:54.490
how you connect with the people
who visit your page,

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.900
your website, you realize
something pretty important.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.790
The best way to connect with
people is face to face or, as

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.435
we say, face to face to face.

00:18:01.435 --> 00:18:03.750
And if you're interested in
that, you should go to

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.980
Jonathan Beri's talk this
afternoon at 1:30 where he'll

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.070
tell you about Hangouts, Hangout
applications, and the

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.940
power of the Hangout button as
a way to connect with people

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.720
who visit your web page.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.550
And of course, and those of you
at home will miss this, if

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:21.800
you want to know who Jonathan
Beri is, he's over there.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.050
So you can see his face.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.890
At this point, I have a website,
people can find it in

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:34.530
Search, they can choose to
stay informed about it by

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:35.956
following it on Google+.

00:18:35.956 --> 00:18:40.600
But how do they discover
I have a Google+ page?

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.960
Well, the way we do that
is quite simple.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.060
We have something we call
the Google+ badge.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.370
And what this does is gives you
a little snippet of code

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:50.750
that you could put on your
website and people can choose

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:54.150
to use that to follow
your page.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.380
Now here's where it
gets interesting.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.560
You spend a lot of time and
effort getting these people to

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.320
come to your site.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.980
The last thing you want
is a badge that takes

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.190
them off your site.

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.350
So what you'll see in our badge
is that the user can

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:12.240
follow your Google+ page without
leaving your website.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.790
This is pretty cool.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:18.100
The general principles behind
the badge and the way we want

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.280
you to use it is the idea that
you want to keep the people on

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.390
your website.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:26.000
You want them to say,
this page is cool.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.270
You want to [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.120
who thinks your page is cool, so
you could put little faces

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.450
at the bottom of the badge.

00:19:35.196 --> 00:19:37.990
For everything we're doing in
Google+, everything Julie's

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:40.860
team is building, we've been
building these config tools.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.770
The idea is that whilst we could
have given you a long

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:46.275
complicated manual telling you
how to write correct code, it

00:19:46.275 --> 00:19:49.370
would be better to give you a
config tool where you pick the

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:52.500
options you want and we say,
here's the code, now cut and

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.870
paste it into your website.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.570
Those of you who have been
following along with our

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.640
adventures in Developer
Experience will know that

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.910
that's one of our principles.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:04.880
So as you can see here, you can
basically say, I want to

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.720
create a Google+ badge for
Developer Experience.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.480
In a recent change we made last
week, one of many changes

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.850
we make, we changed
the drop-down.

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:17.730
So that now when you go there,
because we know who you are,

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.960
we just say, well here
are your pages.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.490
It's a small optimization, but
it's the kind of thing we've

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.500
been trying to do, trying to
say, what if we make people

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.720
the heart of this?

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.640
Well, we wouldn't ask a person,
please go off and find

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.100
a list of your pages and then
type the number in here.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.090
If we already know this, we
can make this experience

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:37.270
simpler, easier, better.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.640
So you pick your page.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.850
We generate the code for you.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.960
You'd say how wide
you want it.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.860
For those of you who like the
Blues Brothers, we have both

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:51.030
kinds of Google+ badges here.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.130
We have badges for people.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:56.970
So that's the badge for Jenny
Murphy, one of my colleagues.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.830
And we have badges for, in that
case, it looks like the

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.570
Google+ developers'
Google+ page.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:06.650
As you can see, that's got
54,000 +1's so far.

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:10.890
But from that page, you can
configure badges for you,

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:13.270
badges for your website,
and then you cut

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:14.850
and paste the code.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:17.880
Speaking of the code, we'll
get to that in a moment.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.260
But first, you can configure the
size, you can choose the

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:22.970
faces that turn up.

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:25.430
This is what it looks on my
website where, as you can see,

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:26.910
I'm plugging my book.

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:29.335
Please buy my book, it's
available for free.

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:34.465
This is what the code
looks like.

00:21:34.465 --> 00:21:36.800
As you can see, there's
not a lot of code.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.060
What you do is you take this
chunk of code, you put it into

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.700
the head of your document.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.520
And for those of you who are
good at JavaScript, you'll see

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.170
that what we're doing is we're,
in lining your web

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:52.330
page, we are creating a script
tag which is going to be

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.840
loaded, and then that script tag
is going to asynchronously

00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:05.660
walk your DOM and then find this
G+ tag, and then replace

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.530
it with the badge.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.285
So this means you can control
where the badge will appear in

00:22:10.285 --> 00:22:13.040
your website, which means it
can fit in with whatever

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.300
you've already got.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.790
You get a choice of
width, the theme.

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:21.320
We've got a light version,
a dark version.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.810
And of course, we have a
rel="publisher" indication

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:27.660
which is how we tell that this
website owns this Google+

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.260
page, because there's
a bidirectional

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.510
link between them.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:40.180
So at this point, I have
a rather nice website.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:45.390
People can find it, they can
click on the badge, follow the

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:48.250
Google+ page for it, and
they can keep you

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.720
informed about changes.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.010
But how do they tell other
people that it's cool?

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:54.080
How do they tell other
people that the

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.690
articles in it are cool?

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:59.090
Well, last March, we put
out the +1 button.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:02.170
This came about because we've
seen that people trust

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:03.780
recommendations from
other people.

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:06.120
They know whose taste
they can trust.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.710
They know, for example, that
if I recommend a camera to

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:13.130
you, it'll almost certainly come
from, it will probably be

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:13.790
something like this.

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:16.680
It will be large, and
heavy, and hurt your

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.320
hands after a while.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.830
However, if somebody else
recommends a camera to you, it

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:23.790
may be smaller, it may
be a phone camera.

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:27.750
But you know the people and
you can act accordingly.

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:31.380
When people buy things like
cameras or cars, they want

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.440
recommendations from
people they trust.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:38.730
But the time you're buying the
device and the time the person

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:40.920
is looking for the
recommendation are separate.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.270
With the +1 button, we bring
those two things together, so

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:47.220
that whilst you're doing your
initial research, you +1 the

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.810
things that you think
are good.

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:50.664
Then when other people who know
you or who are following

00:23:50.664 --> 00:23:54.020
you on Google+ are searching for
similar things, we'll show

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.530
you the recommendation, the
endorsement, you gave to that.

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:02.290
You can, of course, always +1
then hit Share if you want to

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:05.580
tell people immediately, I found
a great camera shop.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:08.220
The +1 button has a config tool,
like everything else

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:08.980
we're doing.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:12.410
As you can see, you can control
the width, you can

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.990
specify if you want it to load
asynchronously or not, you can

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:18.200
choose if you want the markup
to be HTML5 valid or not.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.590
Thanks to Gerwin for
spotting that one.

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:24.460
This is what it looks
like on my website.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:28.410
As you can see, you +1 the
snippet we talked about

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:30.880
earlier turns up there, you
choose the circles you want to

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.385
see it, you can have a little
section of faces.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.680
The code is going to seem
very, very familiar.

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.940
It's the same snippet you've
seen before, which is going to

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.270
be put into your web page.

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.600
The code is going to be
asynchronously loaded, it's

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:55.410
going to walk the DOM because
it's going to be looking for

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.294
this G+ tag.

00:24:57.294 --> 00:24:59.460
As you can see, you
can control the

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.540
formatting of the +1 button.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.400
But that's going to be
replaced with the

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.066
code for the +1 button.

00:25:09.042 --> 00:25:11.310
So I've got a great site.

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:12.290
People are coming to it.

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:14.780
They're choosing to follow the
page associated with it, so I

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.680
can tell them about
cool new things.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.820
They've got a +1 button, so
they can tell other people

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.510
this is a great website.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.730
Now imagine my website had,
I don't know, something

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:26.790
controversial, like perhaps an
article comparing Nikon versus

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:30.875
Canon or an article saying that
maybe hats are awesome

00:25:30.875 --> 00:25:33.150
and you should really
be wearing a hat.

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:35.466
And you want to tell people
about this, but you don't want

00:25:35.466 --> 00:25:36.600
to +1 this.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:40.740
You don't want people to think
that you're pro hats or

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.155
perhaps you've chosen
Nikon over Canon.

00:25:43.155 --> 00:25:44.850
But you want to tell people,
look at this

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:46.210
guy, he's so wrong.

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.840
So we need a way to share
without endorsing.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.990
So we put together
the Share button.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:56.610
Like everything else we do,
it has a config tool.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:58.880
This may sound familiar.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.050
You can control a variety of
things about the feeling,

00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:06.160
whether it's HTML5
valid or not.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.300
It looks very similar
to the +1 button.

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.270
We're building a set of tools
that are internally consistent

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:15.850
that reuse aspects of each
other so that if you

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.820
understand part of the system,
you can use that understanding

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.856
to learn the rest.

00:26:21.856 --> 00:26:26.050
The code, tell me if this sounds
familiar, there's a bit

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:29.860
of JavaScript, which is going to
be put into your web page,

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.660
it's going to get loaded, it's
going to asynchronously walk

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:37.820
the DOM And then, it's
going to find a G+

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.010
tag and replace it.

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.850
As you can see, you can always
hard code a Share button to

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:45.190
talk about a particular URL.

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:48.380
But by default, it will load
or point to the current

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:49.630
website, the current page.

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:55.340
You may remember this gentleman
from last year.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:56.890
This is Timothy Jordan.

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:59.740
If you want to learn more
about how you can do

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:03.190
interesting things with the
Google+ button with other

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:05.310
aspects of Google+, if you want
to learn, for instance,

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.300
how yo can use the JavaScript
call back in the +1 button to

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.720
use with analytics tools or
other things, you should

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.480
attend Timothy's talk tomorrow
at 2:45 where he'll go into

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.730
how you can get more
with Google+.

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:25.570
Now my website, I like to think
that my website isn't so

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:28.700
much HTML5 as HTML3.2.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.650
It's very simple, I'm
a simple person.

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:34.170
But imagine a world where I
wasn't a simple person and I

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:37.500
had a website and it was latency
sensitive or it was

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.130
written in Flash.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:42.010
And I was the kind of person who
was good enough at design

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:46.480
that I wanted control of every
single pixel on my website.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.730
Well I can't use the
existing buttons

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:50.260
because I give up control.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:53.180
So what you need is
something else.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.420
What we've built for you is a
little thing we called URL

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:56.500
Share Endpoint.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:00.440
Who here has used this?

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.690
OK, so this is cool.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:05.870
Basically we have that
special URL.

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:07.970
It takes two parameters, HL for

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:11.690
language and a URL parameter.

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:16.130
So what this does is you say,
give me a share box pointing

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:18.000
to that URL.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.670
And that's just a link.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.880
And you can basically put
any image you want in

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.462
front of that link.

00:28:23.462 --> 00:28:25.620
And because it's just
a link, nothing

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.290
gets loaded from Google.

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:30.360
Well, it's just a link,
so it's instant.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.220
There's no worries
about latency

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:33.550
because it's just a link.

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:36.300
It'll fit into your Flash
website with no problems

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.400
whatsoever.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.740
We give you an icon if you
want to use our icon.

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.480
You can, of course,
use your own.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.250
You can choose to serve the icon
from us or from your own

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:48.770
website if you're particularly
sensitive about latency.

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:51.240
But what we noticed with a lot
of people, they would just

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.520
write in this code.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.880
They just wanted a button with
a graphic served from Google,

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.095
might as well save costs, and
when you clicked on it, it

00:28:58.095 --> 00:29:01.210
popped up in a new window and
it had a share box in it.

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:04.250
So we said, if everybody's doing
the same thing, perhaps

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.380
we should just give
them the code.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.260
So we did.

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:08.960
This is what we call
the URL Share Link.

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:13.750
If you're interested in what
we've done when you start

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:16.930
taking this idea that you could
have URLs that perform

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:19.340
actions, if you can start
thinking about what happens

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.280
when multiple sites have these
kinds of endpoints and you

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.580
could do server to server
integration, you should go to

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:28.160
Paul Kinlan's talk tomorrow at
11:45 where he'll talk to you

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.200
about Web Intents and how things
like our URL Share Link

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.420
play a part in that.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:38.060
If you're interested in how all
of these buttons load so

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:42.120
quickly at the scale we are, if
you think about it, we have

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.620
billions of impressions a
day, how do we do that?

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:46.020
How do we make that fast?

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:50.120
You should go and see John and
Malte who are talking at 5:15

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.490
and they'll tell you exactly
how we do this.

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:55.030
Now I don't want to give
you the impression that

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:56.950
we only do the web.

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:59.560
As you saw in Vic's talk this
morning, we've crossed the

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.350
point where we have more mobile
traffic, more mobile

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:04.500
usage, than web usage.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:09.020
So if you go to tomorrow's
talk at 1:30, Julia and

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:12.030
Francis will tell you
interesting things about

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:14.340
Android and iOS development
for Google+.

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:15.590
You should really go there.

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:19.620
But that's not all.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.730
Let's go back to my family
for the moment.

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:25.155
We talked about all the
things you can do

00:30:25.155 --> 00:30:26.950
with the Google+ platform.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.850
But they're not technical, so
most of these details would

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:30.830
have gone over their heads.

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:33.860
And they would say, hold on,
explain this to me in the

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:35.930
context of a real world shop.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.756
Pick something real, don't
make something up, not

00:30:38.756 --> 00:30:39.974
abstract, concrete.

00:30:39.974 --> 00:30:43.030
And I'd say, well,
this is Le Monde.

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:45.050
They're where I got
this hat from.

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:49.250
Beautiful shop run by a little
old couple, and as you can see

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:50.940
from the review, I
love the shop.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.890
I go there once a year
and I buy a vintage

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:56.760
hat and I buy a suit.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.050
But I only go there once
a year, so if anything

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:00.900
interesting happens at
that shop during that

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.350
year, I miss it.

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:04.560
If they have a sale,
I miss it.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.470
They're not the kind of people
who are going to

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:08.130
run a mailing list.

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:11.150
They want something simple, easy
to understand, easy to

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:14.100
use, where Google does the
heavy lifting for them.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.280
And because they're an old
fashioned kind of shop--

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.010
I mean, they sell vintage
outfits--

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:21.630
they want something simple.

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:24.480
So they also think of their
metrics very differently to

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.160
developers.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.520
They're not thinking in terms
of increasing traffic and

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.910
increasing engagement.

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:31.230
They're thinking in terms of how
do we get more customers

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:34.470
through the door of our shop?

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:36.680
How do we get more business,
so that when the customer

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.280
comes in, they come back?

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.490
How they do that?

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:42.490
How do they go to a world
where you've got more

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:45.790
customers who are happier and,
thus, more business?

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:49.470
And how do they go from people
that come into their shop

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:51.850
regularly to a community
of people?

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:55.630
Well this is why we
did Google+ Local.

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:57.880
Now this is still in
a very early form.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.160
And we have a small number of
trusted testers who have got

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.060
the fully integrated
experience.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:05.070
But what those people get is
a Google+ page for their

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:07.500
particular shop, their
particular business.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:11.300
And you can follow that page and
you can see who else likes

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.870
to follow that page and you can
engage in discussions with

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:15.640
the page and with the
other people.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.080
And you can discover that you
have things in common.

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.300
You can connect those other
people, in my case, around my

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:24.345
love of hats.

00:32:24.345 --> 00:32:26.816
Now I'm going to finish up.

00:32:26.816 --> 00:32:29.920
And I'm going to finish
up with two quotes.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.500
One is from Leo Rosten.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.620
You probably have never
heard of him Anybody

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.760
heard of Leo Rosten?

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.040
OK, anybody heard of
Margaret Mead?

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:40.730
Hooray .

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:42.860
So he's her brother-in-law.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.700
He also wrote lots of books,
but that's his

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.650
biggest claim to fame.

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:48.980
And one of the things he talks
about is this idea about why

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.530
do we share.

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:53.740
At Google+ we believe it's
important to share the right

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:54.800
things with the right people.

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.390
It should be controlled
sharing.

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:59.210
And that's because you want
to be in control of who

00:32:59.210 --> 00:32:59.900
understands you.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.870
You want to choose who you
want to have a better

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:02.980
understanding of.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:05.360
You want to choose
your community.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.840
So if you're a Google+ page,
you're building a community,

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.830
you want to have some
control over that.

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:13.080
But in the wider context of
Google, in the wider context

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.070
of the world where we're
thinking about upgrading the

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:17.620
Google experience, I want to
finish with this quote from

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.380
Clay Shirky.

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:23.680
And he talks about how important
it is to connect

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.300
with other people, not just
with information.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:30.400
So when we talk about Google
and our mission to give

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.540
everybody access to information,
we've got to

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:33.670
think beyond and above.

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.590
And we've got to start saying,
how do we upgrade Google?

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:39.590
How do we upgrade the Google
experience so that it's about

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:43.010
connecting and sharing
with people?

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:45.060
And that includes, of
course, my family.

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.463
Thank you very much.

00:33:47.463 --> 00:33:52.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:56.900
So I think we have a few
minutes for questions.

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.620
Does anybody have
any questions?

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:01.390
If so, please use the
microphones there and there.

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:02.880
I'll try to repeat them
for the people

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.630
watching the live stream.

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:06.665
Oh, and by the way,
hello, London.

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:10.710
Any questions?

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.449
Oh, we have one question
at the back.

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:13.860
AUDIENCE: Yes, hi.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:20.540
How do you see the development
of Google+ for enterprises?

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:23.414
There's a lot of businesses that
have gone up into Google

00:34:23.414 --> 00:34:27.580
Apps and those businesses are
getting bigger and bigger.

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:31.659
And most of my customers, we
do implement Google Apps.

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:35.750
I'm asking, now we need a sort
of Google+ environment, but

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:38.070
for the company.

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:40.429
I mean social, but
for the company.

00:34:40.429 --> 00:34:42.320
ADE OSHINEYE: So the question
was, how do we see the

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.800
development of Google+
for the enterprise?

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.250
When we built Google+, we
started with the enterprise we

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:50.480
know best, Google.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:54.810
We have 30,000 employees,
maybe more nowadays.

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:58.210
And we have a Google+ instance
we run for ourselves.

00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:01.200
We put out Google+ for
enterprise a few months ago

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.500
and it's seen incredible uptake,
as companies have

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.180
realized that they can actually
bring the benefits of

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:09.110
Google+ within their company.

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:12.500
They can connect people within
the company to each other

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:14.980
around things beyond just
the department.

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.330
And all the features we're
rolling out here, those are

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:19.640
also rolling out for
enterprises.

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.720
And I think you're going to be
pleasantly surprised as we

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.050
keep working and adding
new features.

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:28.360
I think we're up to about
a feature a day now?

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.270
JULIE FARAGO: I think about
a feature a day.

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.545
That's right.

00:35:29.545 --> 00:35:32.965
ADE OSHINEYE: And most of those
features are rolling out

00:35:32.965 --> 00:35:34.060
to Enterprise as well.

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:37.070
Obviously, there are more
complications for Enterprise.

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:41.300
But given that I have 30,000
people who know where I sit,

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:45.100
who want these features, I think
you'll be seeing many

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:47.380
more Enterprise features rolling
out for Google+ as

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:48.976
time goes on.

00:35:48.976 --> 00:35:50.600
I believe there was a gentleman

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.143
there with a question.

00:35:52.143 --> 00:35:53.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I have
a curiosity.

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:56.240
At the beginning you showed us
how to create the snippets so

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:59.130
we can see our picture
or something, and the

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:00.950
description, in the
search results.

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:03.600
How long does it take for Google
to recognize that my

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.260
website has those snippets?

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:08.780
ADE OSHINEYE: So the question
was, how long does it take for

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:12.490
Google to recognize that my
site has a new snippet?

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:14.300
AUDIENCE: Is it real time?

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:15.480
Or does it need to wait?

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.960
I don't know.

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.650
ADE OSHINEYE: So what
we have in Google

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:20.850
is we have a crawler.

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:24.130
And it crawls your site based on
a lot of signals including

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:26.680
things like, do you a site map,
how often does your site

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.710
change, things like that.

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:31.320
So it's not guaranteed.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.540
There are things you can do
within Webmaster Tools that

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.880
can accelerate the time it'll
be crawled, but it's not

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.130
guaranteed.

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:43.590
If you look on the rich
snippet site, there's

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:46.600
information about things like
Webmaster Tools and site maps

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.310
and how you can use those to
accelerate your recrawl rate.

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:51.970
But that's all we can
really tell you.

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:52.660
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:55.050
JULIE FARAGO: I will say that
if you do use rich snippets,

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:57.960
then as soon as people start
sharing or +1ing from your

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.840
site, then that will immediately
work with Google+.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:05.000
So that is real time
guaranteed.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.230
AUDIENCE: We created a
Google+ Local page.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.770
ADE OSHINEYE: Thank you.

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:11.420
AUDIENCE: It got migrated
over for us.

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:15.150
And the ability to maintain
hours there is helpful.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:16.890
One of the things I was
wondering is, is there an

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:20.360
ability to automatically push
and update the hours for that

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.770
page from somewhere?

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:24.160
Is there a writable API
for that purpose?

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.390
Because we don't want to have to
maintain the hours in five

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:28.760
different web pages and
a couple of different

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:29.065
applications.

00:37:29.065 --> 00:37:30.690
We would like to be able
to push in one spot

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:32.075
and then get it pulled.

00:37:32.075 --> 00:37:35.020
ADE OSHINEYE: So the question
is, if I have a Google+ Local

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:38.190
page, is there a programmatic
way to update the opening

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:39.610
hours for that page?

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:40.360
AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.530
ADE OSHINEYE: So when we
announced Google+ Local, we

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:45.800
said that it was part of a
migration of the 80 million

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.846
place pages into Google+.

00:37:47.846 --> 00:37:50.490
And that as part of that, we
would start adding other

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:53.190
features you were used to in
Place pages as time goes on.

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:54.530
So I think that's your answer.

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:57.550
We're going to give you a lot
of the functionality you've

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:59.540
seen in Place pages.

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.600
Remember, the goal is
to upgrade Google.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.740
So that includes things
like Place pages.

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:07.000
And that is coming, but
I can't tell you when.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.250
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:10.218 --> 00:38:13.760
ADE OSHINEYE: I think we have
a question in the back.

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.430
AUDIENCE: My question is about
how different types of content

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:18.430
perform on Google.

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:21.400
A lot of focus is on
events and photos.

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.280
My specific question is about
the video experience, sharing

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.640
video content from different
sites and popular shows, et

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.680
cetera, et cetera, if
there's any plans.

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:31.170
ADE OSHINEYE: Do you
want to take this?

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:32.010
JULIE FARAGO: I can tell
you anecdotally.

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:33.350
ADE OSHINEYE: You should
probably repeat the question

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:33.790
for [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:34.510
JULIE FARAGO: Ah, sorry,
thank you.

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:37.580
So the question was about how
different content performs on

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.830
Google+ in terms
of engagement.

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:42.620
What we've seen is that
multimedia content does

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:43.540
particularly well.

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:48.320
So videos, images, links with
photos associated with them,

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.420
are the ones that get
the most engagement.

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:53.960
So if you can make the visual
representation in the stream

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.840
engaging, then it is much more
likely to get higher levels of

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.600
engagement from the users.

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.190
ADE OSHINEYE: I will
add one thing.

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:03.660
Gerwin, who's sitting in front
here, built a tool that

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:07.410
actually shows you what times
you should post to reach the

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:09.140
most members of the audience.

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:11.190
It's really cool and he built
it on top of the API.

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:17.800
If there are no more questions,
then I think we

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.130
should all go to lunch.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:19.820
Thank you very much.

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.070
You've been wonderful.
