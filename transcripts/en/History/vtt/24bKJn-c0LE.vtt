00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:05.338
NARRATOR: The measurements
of the length and width

00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:08.633
of the perimeter of the
Great Pyramid correspond

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:11.970
to an exact fraction of both
the latitude and longitude

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.889
measurements at the equator.

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.519
Scaled up, this means the Great
Pyramid directly corresponds

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.730
to the circumference
of the equator

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.400
as well as the measurement
from the equator to the pole.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.486
Making it a scale model of
the northern hemisphere.

00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:36.870
Recently, using
satellite technology,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.165
researchers have realized
yet another advanced formula

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:43.626
encoded in the design.

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:45.962
If you take the location
of the Great Pyramid

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:49.883
as a coordinate, this number
sequence of this coordinate

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:54.387
matches exactly the speed of
light traveling through space

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:56.431
measured in meters per second.

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:57.599
This is amazing stuff.

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:03.354
When you consider the
vast amount of information

00:01:03.354 --> 00:01:07.400
about the Earth that's encoded
into the Great Pyramid,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.779
you can't just dismiss all
of this as pure coincidence.

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:16.785
NARRATOR: Although, the
Great Pyramid at Giza

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:20.872
offers an astounding example
of encoded information,

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:24.125
other sites around the world,
such as the Mesoamerican

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:28.213
pyramids and the
ziggurats of Mesopotamia,

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:30.131
have also been
found to be aligned

00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:34.469
to exact cardinal points and
embody mathematical concepts.

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:43.019
These buildings were
built under divine guidance.

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:44.646
This is a mark of the gods.

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:46.856
They put certain things
in these buildings

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:51.027
to let us know they are not
entirely of human origin.

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:55.031
They represent something
larger than we are.

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:57.617
The builders
wanted to make sure

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:00.537
that a future generation
would know that there

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:03.039
is a discrepancy in knowledge.

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.333
And what I'm
suggesting is that all

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:08.586
these ancient structures
are calling cards

00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:11.965
left by extraterrestrials.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.591
NARRATOR: Ancient
astronaut theorists

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:17.762
suggest that evidence of
extraterrestrial intervention

00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:19.639
in the construction
and placement

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.016
of these incredible
structures can

00:02:22.016 --> 00:02:25.645
also be found by examining
their alignments with the stars.

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:34.696
If I wanted to leave behind a
piece of evidence that suggests

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:38.575
where I'm from, one
way, for example,

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:41.327
is by creating
monuments that are

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.997
in the shape of constellations.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:47.333
In ancient Egypt,
the three pyramids

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:52.130
are aligned with the
constellation of Orion's belt.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.717
The pyramids are not the
only monuments that have

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:59.220
this particular configuration.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.141
NARRATOR: The ancient site
of Teotihuacan in Mexico

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:07.061
also contains three pyramids
that are oriented to match up

00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:10.315
with the belt stars of Orion.

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:12.567
And other sites
throughout the world

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:17.155
have been found to have similar
astronomical alignments.
