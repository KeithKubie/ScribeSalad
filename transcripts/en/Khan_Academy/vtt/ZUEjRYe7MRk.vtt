00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.650
In the next series of videos,
I'm going to give my best

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.770
attempt at trying to get a
handle on the bailout and the

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.780
financial crisis.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.740
So I'm going to try to explain
different concepts in more

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.340
than one way.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.900
Then I think hopefully
it'll all sink in.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.260
But the big picture really is
that there's a lot of fancy

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.900
terminology being thrown around,
but the underlying

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.860
concepts really aren't
that fancy.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.700
So I think a good place to start
is just with the idea of

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.300
the balance sheet.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.300
And you could watch some of the
videos that I did before

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.000
the whole financial mess on the
balance sheet and that'll

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.930
give you good primer,
but it doesn't hurt

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:33.650
to review it here.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.180
So a balance sheet is just a
snapshot of what you have and

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.990
what you owe and the difference
between, and the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.720
difference between is kind
of like your wealth.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.910
So if I just had a personal
balance sheet, I

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.160
could write my assets.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.410
They mean what you
think they mean.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.270
These are things that will
give you future benefit.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:03.090
So let's say I have
$1,000 cash.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:13.340
Let's say I have a
$100,000 house.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:21.030
Let's say I have
a $10,000 car.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.440
And let's say everything else,
I'll call it other, my

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.660
furniture, my TV and everything

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.670
else, is another $5,000.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.590
So those would be my assets.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.050
And so what are my
total assets?

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.730
It's $101,000, $111,000,
$116,000.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.000
Well, it would be great
if we lived in a

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.310
world of only assets.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.650
But, unfortunately, let's
say that I had

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.050
liabilities as well.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.300
So liabilities.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.740
And a liability is what
you think it means.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.780
It means something that you have
to give future economic

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.770
benefit for.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.620
You're kind of on the
hook for something.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.860
And so let's say, my
liabilities, I have a $20,000

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.000
student loan.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.240
And let's say on that house,
unfortunately, I

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.400
don't own it outright.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.300
Let's say that I have an $80,000
mortgage on that

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.570
house, so essentially
I borrowed

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.320
$80,000 from the bank.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.760
And let's throw some credit
card debt in there.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.140
Just to make this realistic
relative to I think a lot of

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.050
households out there, let's
say that there's $5,000 of

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.520
credit card debt, although for
most households right now,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.530
this house is a lot more and
this mortgage is a lot more.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.120
But anyway, I won't make
social commentary.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.070
This is just to explain what
a balance sheet is.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.550
So what is left over for me?

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.530
What is my assets minus
my liability?

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.860
Let's calculate our
total liabilities.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.800
So this is total assets.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.970
I'll use an A colon.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.960
So what are my total
liabilities?

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.390
20 plus 80 plus 5,
so it's $105,000.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.740
$105,000 total liabilities.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.720
So the difference between these
two, my assets minus my

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.960
liabilities, this is essentially
my net worth.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.760
If I just liquidated everything
tomorrow, if I sold

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.260
all of this and paid off all
this, this is what I would be

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.260
left standing with.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.440
That's my net worth.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.030
Or you could view that
as that is my equity.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.410
You often hear equity in
the context of a house.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.450
In the context of a house, it's
just the asset of the

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.830
house minus the liability, but
I'm talking about in the

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.610
context of my personal balance
sheet, not that these are the

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.700
actual numbers.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.280
I don't want to give away too
much about my life just yet.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.820
But anyway, so what is
that number here?

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.210
So my equity, and I'll do that
in green since if it's

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.720
positive it's a good number.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.380
My equity is $116,000
minus is $105,000.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.950
So what is that?

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.100
That's $11,000.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.610
That's my equity.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.070
So there's a couple of things
to think about here.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.140
You'll meet people with a
$100,000 house or a $1 million

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.450
house, and they say, oh,
I am worth $1 million.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.830
And you're like, well, you're
not really worth $1 million

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.160
unless you own that house
outright and you could

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.630
actually sell that house
for $1 million.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.670
It's not what you paid for it.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.870
It's what the market is willing
to give for it.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.860
But your real net worth is your
assets minus all of your

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:24.340
liabilities.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.130
So in this case, your net
worth is actually

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.300
$11,000, not $116,000.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.910
And this is another important
thing to think about.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.740
Assets are always equal to
liabilities plus equity.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.540
That just comes out of the
definition of what equity is.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.400
Equity was assets minus
liabilities.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.910
If you take an MBA, they'll
write it down, and it looks

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.380
like an equation, but it's
assets is equal to liabilities

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.080
plus equity.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.060
But that's almost by definition
that that's going

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.750
to be true.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.040
So what can we do with this?

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.850
How does this help us?

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.670
Well, there's a couple of ways
that we can think about this.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.590
First of all, what happens
if my liabilities are

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.910
larger than my assets?

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.770
So if I owe the world more
than the world owes me?

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.500
Well, then this number is
going to be negative.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.640
And if this number is negative,
then there's no

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.410
really good reason for me, maybe
to preserve my credit

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.260
score, but other than that,
if we take that out of the

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.240
equation, there's no good reason
for me to continue

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.570
living this existence.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.230
If my liabilities are greater
than my assets, let's think

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.950
about that situation.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.240
Let's say that my house is only
worth $100,000, but for

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.750
whatever reason, I owe
$120,000 to the bank.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.500
Let's say maybe I originally
bought the house with a

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.060
no-money down payment
for $120,000.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.190
And now I'm honest
with myself.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.580
I'm like the value
has gone down.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.300
It's only worth $100,000 now.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.325
So I'm in the situation where
you could say I'm upside down

00:05:52.325 --> 00:05:53.460
in my mortgage.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.250
Well, one, you could say there's
no incentive for me to

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.600
continue paying this house.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.690
An even bigger picture, if I now
look at my balance sheet,

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.200
what are my liabilities now?

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.660
My liabilities would
be $145,000.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.660
And my equity would be my assets
minus my liabilities.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.680
So $116,000 minus $45,000,
what is that?

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.825
Minus $29,000.

00:06:15.825 --> 00:06:17.110
I'll do that in red.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.570
That's a bad number
for your equity.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.790
So in this situation, there's
really no reason for me to

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.000
continue living like the way
I am, at least financially.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.660
As long as you're breathing,
there's no reason not to

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.590
continue breathing.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.690
But you wouldn't want to live
like this financially anymore,

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.210
so there's no reason not to go
seek bankruptcy protection.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:45.340
And bankruptcy protection is
admitting I am insolvent,

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.880
which means that there's no way
that I'm going to be able

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.040
to unwind all of
my liabilities.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.270
Courts protect me.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.210
My lenders can't come
back after me.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.340
Everything is going
to be erased.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.890
They're going to take all my
assets, all my liabilities,

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.040
and they're essentially going to
take these and divide them

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.420
up amongst the people
that I owe stuff to.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.330
So that's bankruptcy.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.290
That's insolvency.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:12.510
And I want to highlight the word
insolvency because that's

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.100
a word that we're going touch on
when we actually talk about

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.130
the credit crisis.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.630
And that is opposed
illiquidity.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.140
So what is illiquidity?

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.830
So insolvency means there's no
reason for you to continue

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.500
with this type of a financial
situation.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.320
You're bankrupt.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.820
You go get bankruptcy
protection.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.480
That's insolvency.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.140
Illiquidity is a different
situation.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.200
Illiquidity says no,
I actually do

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.250
have positive equity.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.850
So let me go back to the
original circumstance.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.680
It really was I only owe $80,000
on the house, so my

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.690
liabilities really are
only $105,000.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:08:02.390
So I really do have a positive
equity of $11,000.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.900
So this isn't insolvency
anymore.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.010
So I'm going to describe what
illiquidity means to you.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.340
Or to me, in this case,
because this

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.970
is my balance sheet.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:19.120
So let's say that my wife comes
to me and says we need

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.260
to pay our child's tuition.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.890
It is $5,000 for the
upcoming year.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.630
I need to pay $5,000
in tuition.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.990
Actually, let me take a better
situation because if I'm

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.620
talking about tuition, it
should have shown up on

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.450
liabilities.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:40.080
Let's say that I have to
make a $5,000 payment

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.200
on my student loan.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.040
So I have some kind of weird
student loan, where $5,000

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.200
comes due all of a sudden.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.490
So I have to make a $5,000
payment on the student loan.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.740
Let me do that in red.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:57.120
Make $5,000 payment.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.010
And it could be for anything,
but let's say it's to satisfy

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.100
part of one of these
liabilities.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.690
So if you look at my equity, if
you look at my assets minus

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:09.210
my liabilities, I clearly
have $11,000.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.190
I'm worth $11,000.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.460
And if I could liquidate all
my assets and all my

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.840
liabilities overnight, I would
have $11,000 in cash, and then

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.920
I could pay that $5,000.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.240
In fact, in the process of doing
it, I would have paid

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.920
that $5,000.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.190
But in this circumstance, if I
just look at my situation,

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.340
let's say that student loan
payment is due tomorrow.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.380
I only have $1,000 of cash.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.920
I only have $1,000
maybe sitting

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.940
in my checking account.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.400
So I can't make that $5,000
payment just with my cash.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.510
And then I look at everything
else, and I'm like, boy, can

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.270
unload any of these
assets overnight?

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:45.560
Well, a house, absolutely not.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.790
There's no way I'm going
to be able to

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.170
unload my house tomorrow.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.460
Maybe I could find someone who
would buy it for $50,000

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.260
tomorrow, but that wouldn't
help my situation.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.900
Then my equity would
go negative again.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:56.680
So that won't help.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.200
I can't sell my car overnight.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.480
Maybe I could sell it at a super
low price for $4,000,

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.610
just to kind of make this
payment, but I don't want to

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:05.510
do that either.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.660
And same thing, your furniture,
you'd have to go on

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.890
Craigslist and take
pictures of it.

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:10.930
You couldn't do it.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.390
So this is a situation
where you are

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.800
having a liquidity crisis.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.540
You are illiquid, but you're
not insolvent.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:23.870
You have a positive net worth,
assuming that you're not lying

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.240
about what's going on in
your balance sheet.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.240
And that's another issue.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.650
So how do you get past a
liquidity crisis like this?

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.560
Well, someone has to give
you-- we could call it a

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.980
bridge loan because they're
giving you a financial bridge

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.980
from here to where
you need to go.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.160
Or they're giving you
a bridge that

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.360
essentially buys you time.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.860
Let's say your dad says, OK,
Sal, or my dad, I guess, I'll

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.800
give you a $5,000 loan for
the next two months.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.190
And over the next two months,
I expect you to find some

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.160
other source of cash.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.510
Maybe sell your car, buy a
cheaper car, sell some of your

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:56.640
furniture or something.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.750
So that is a loan to prevent
a liquidity crisis.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:03.250
And that loan wouldn't be a
bad idea because if this

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:05.640
person isn't lying about their
balance sheet, or I'm not

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.600
lying about my balance sheet,
then I actually am

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.610
good for the money.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:12.200
On the other hand, that loan
be a bad idea if I had

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.730
insolvency because it would
just be throwing

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.330
good money after bad.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.170
I'm not able to pay my current
loans, and you're just giving

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.430
me another loan that I wouldn't
be able to pay.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.730
Anyway, I'm out of time.

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.890
I'll see you in the
next video.
