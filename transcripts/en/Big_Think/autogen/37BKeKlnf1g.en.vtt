if I was trying to you know get people

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160
if I was trying to you know get people
 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.210
if I was trying to you know get people
into the lab I would I mean I think

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220
into the lab I would I mean I think
 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.910
into the lab I would I mean I think
first and foremost the work that we do

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920
first and foremost the work that we do
 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.009
first and foremost the work that we do
is just really fun and engaging and I

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019
is just really fun and engaging and I
 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.189
is just really fun and engaging and I
love what I do like I said I before that

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199
love what I do like I said I before that
 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.429
love what I do like I said I before that
I get to apply math mathematics and sort

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439
I get to apply math mathematics and sort
 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.170
I get to apply math mathematics and sort
of problem-solving in mathematics to

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180
of problem-solving in mathematics to
 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.170
of problem-solving in mathematics to
understanding you know to make

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180
understanding you know to make
 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.700
understanding you know to make
observations of the natural world to

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710
observations of the natural world to
 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.609
observations of the natural world to
understand the natural world and how you

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619
understand the natural world and how you
 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.169
understand the natural world and how you
know we're connected to nature how we

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179
know we're connected to nature how we
 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.870
know we're connected to nature how we
adapt to our environment how pathogens

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880
adapt to our environment how pathogens
 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.270
adapt to our environment how pathogens
and humans have this arms race that we

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280
and humans have this arms race that we
 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.150
and humans have this arms race that we
are exploring so to me that's really fun

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160
are exploring so to me that's really fun
 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.010
are exploring so to me that's really fun
is that you know especially working in

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020
is that you know especially working in
 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.720
is that you know especially working in
infectious disease it's very interesting

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730
infectious disease it's very interesting
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.229
infectious disease it's very interesting
because these passes these infectious

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239
because these passes these infectious
 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.389
because these passes these infectious
diseases these agents they evolve over

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399
diseases these agents they evolve over
 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.910
diseases these agents they evolve over
time so it's you know it's very much an

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920
time so it's you know it's very much an
 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.000
time so it's you know it's very much an
arms race and understanding how each

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010
arms race and understanding how each
 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.560
arms race and understanding how each
changes to protect itself and to

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570
changes to protect itself and to
 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.279
changes to protect itself and to
continue and so it's very much this

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289
continue and so it's very much this
 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.770
continue and so it's very much this
puzzle solving but with this great you

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780
puzzle solving but with this great you
 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.049
puzzle solving but with this great you
know urgency and importance in what you

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059
know urgency and importance in what you
 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.090
know urgency and importance in what you
find and the kinds of discoveries we

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100
find and the kinds of discoveries we
 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.429
find and the kinds of discoveries we
make have great implications to human

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439
make have great implications to human
 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.320
make have great implications to human
health and so for me I you know enjoy

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330
health and so for me I you know enjoy
 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.740
health and so for me I you know enjoy
very much there's the day to day

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750
very much there's the day to day
 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.359
very much there's the day to day
application so in order to do the work

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369
application so in order to do the work
 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.499
application so in order to do the work
that I do in Lassa fever

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509
that I do in Lassa fever
 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.020
that I do in Lassa fever
as I said before that that's an area

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030
as I said before that that's an area
 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.070
as I said before that that's an area
that's there's it's been so neglected in

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080
that's there's it's been so neglected in
 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.300
that's there's it's been so neglected in
a way it's actually because I think

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
a way it's actually because I think
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.550
a way it's actually because I think
enough West Africans are are immune to

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560
enough West Africans are are immune to
 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.230
enough West Africans are are immune to
it because probably natural selection

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
it because probably natural selection
 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.539
it because probably natural selection
that it kind of it actually almost

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549
that it kind of it actually almost
 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.460
that it kind of it actually almost
clouds over how deadly this disease is

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470
clouds over how deadly this disease is
 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.710
clouds over how deadly this disease is
and that if it actually spread how how

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720
and that if it actually spread how how
 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.100
and that if it actually spread how how
actually catastrophic it could be and so

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110
actually catastrophic it could be and so
 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.340
actually catastrophic it could be and so
that's that's a disease that's been very

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350
that's that's a disease that's been very
 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.539
that's that's a disease that's been very
very well neglected so there aren't

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549
very well neglected so there aren't
 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.450
very well neglected so there aren't
really good Diagnostics there's only one

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460
really good Diagnostics there's only one
 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.550
really good Diagnostics there's only one
treatment ribavirin and it's not known

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560
treatment ribavirin and it's not known
 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.219
treatment ribavirin and it's not known
exactly its efficacy right now and so a

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229
exactly its efficacy right now and so a
 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.330
exactly its efficacy right now and so a
lot of what we need to do is build

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340
lot of what we need to do is build
 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.160
lot of what we need to do is build
infrastructure just to study that so on

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170
infrastructure just to study that so on
 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.840
infrastructure just to study that so on
a day to day basis the work that I do

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850
a day to day basis the work that I do
 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.490
a day to day basis the work that I do
also involves infrastructure building in

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500
also involves infrastructure building in
 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.060
also involves infrastructure building in
Africa and infrastructure building in in

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070
Africa and infrastructure building in in
 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.429
Africa and infrastructure building in in
this in the States towards application

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
this in the States towards application
 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.859
this in the States towards application
in Africa so we're building diagnostics

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869
in Africa so we're building diagnostics
 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.719
in Africa so we're building diagnostics
based on recombinant DNA in order to

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729
based on recombinant DNA in order to
 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.820
based on recombinant DNA in order to
test people very quickly to see whether

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830
test people very quickly to see whether
 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.170
test people very quickly to see whether
or not they've been exposed to the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180
or not they've been exposed to the
 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.000
or not they've been exposed to the
disease and so on a day to day basis

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010
disease and so on a day to day basis
 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.259
disease and so on a day to day basis
so it's nice about the work that we do

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269
so it's nice about the work that we do
 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.780
so it's nice about the work that we do
is that in order to do research we

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790
is that in order to do research we
 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.670
is that in order to do research we
actually have to build capacity and that

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680
actually have to build capacity and that
 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.309
actually have to build capacity and that
capacity has direct implications we also

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319
capacity has direct implications we also
 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.809
capacity has direct implications we also
have to do a lot of training of African

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819
have to do a lot of training of African
 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.539
have to do a lot of training of African
scientists and it's tremendous I mean

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549
scientists and it's tremendous I mean
 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.280
scientists and it's tremendous I mean
African scientists and doctors are some

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290
African scientists and doctors are some
 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.660
African scientists and doctors are some
of the most hard-working people that

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670
of the most hard-working people that
 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.400
of the most hard-working people that
I've ever met you know they wake up in

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410
I've ever met you know they wake up in
 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.369
I've ever met you know they wake up in
the morning they work into the night you

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379
the morning they work into the night you
 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:35.750
the morning they work into the night you
know they're very very focused are very

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760
know they're very very focused are very
 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.130
know they're very very focused are very
very committed because they see the day

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140
very committed because they see the day
 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.140
very committed because they see the day
to day implications of the diseases and

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150
to day implications of the diseases and
 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.210
to day implications of the diseases and
so right now we're working with the

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220
so right now we're working with the
 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.770
so right now we're working with the
University of Ibadan in Nigeria with

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780
University of Ibadan in Nigeria with
 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.990
University of Ibadan in Nigeria with
Christian happi and it's amazing I mean

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000
Christian happi and it's amazing I mean
 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.900
Christian happi and it's amazing I mean
so for me it's just wonderful to see him

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910
so for me it's just wonderful to see him
 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.670
so for me it's just wonderful to see him
and the commitment he's had to building

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680
and the commitment he's had to building
 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.080
and the commitment he's had to building
the site and training a lot of the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090
the site and training a lot of the
 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.150
the site and training a lot of the
doctors of this hospital called hourua

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160
doctors of this hospital called hourua
 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.140
doctors of this hospital called hourua
in Inner Rua

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150
in Inner Rua
 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.960
in Inner Rua
that has many many patients of Lhasa and

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970
that has many many patients of Lhasa and
 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.210
that has many many patients of Lhasa and
so direct implications there but then

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220
so direct implications there but then
 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.979
so direct implications there but then
once we actually are able to investigate

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989
once we actually are able to investigate
 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.990
once we actually are able to investigate
the disease we can understand the virus

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000
the disease we can understand the virus
 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.509
the disease we can understand the virus
and how its what might be the pathogenic

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519
and how its what might be the pathogenic
 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.949
and how its what might be the pathogenic
traits of the virus and there might be

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959
traits of the virus and there might be
 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.770
traits of the virus and there might be
causing disease if there's different

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780
causing disease if there's different
 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.660
causing disease if there's different
variants in the virus community some

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670
variants in the virus community some
 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.979
variants in the virus community some
that are more deadly than others

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989
that are more deadly than others
 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.360
that are more deadly than others
understanding what it is that causes

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370
understanding what it is that causes
 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.330
understanding what it is that causes
that kind of you know virility and

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340
that kind of you know virility and
 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.879
that kind of you know virility and
strong outcome we can understand those

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889
strong outcome we can understand those
 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.470
strong outcome we can understand those
individuals that have immunity how

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480
individuals that have immunity how
 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.140
individuals that have immunity how
they've maintained immunity and and

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150
they've maintained immunity and and
 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.030
they've maintained immunity and and
hopefully use that towards understanding

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040
hopefully use that towards understanding
 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.500
hopefully use that towards understanding
the disease and the pathogenesis of the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510
the disease and the pathogenesis of the
 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.330
the disease and the pathogenesis of the
disease and then maybe with therapeutic

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340
disease and then maybe with therapeutic
 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.940
disease and then maybe with therapeutic
implications so what's great about this

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950
implications so what's great about this
 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.580
implications so what's great about this
kind of work is that at every step you

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590
kind of work is that at every step you
 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.650
kind of work is that at every step you

like solving puzzles and I think

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680
like solving puzzles and I think
 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.250
like solving puzzles and I think
probably societally I like science I

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260
probably societally I like science I
 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.440
probably societally I like science I
like people and so I kind of began to

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450
like people and so I kind of began to
 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.149
like people and so I kind of began to
think I should be a doctor but it was I

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159
think I should be a doctor but it was I
 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.649
think I should be a doctor but it was I
don't know if that was necessarily like

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659
don't know if that was necessarily like
 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.619
don't know if that was necessarily like
just I enjoy I like biology a lot and I

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629
just I enjoy I like biology a lot and I
 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.899

the one thing that was always true is

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919
the one thing that was always true is
 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.099
the one thing that was always true is
that I always loved math a lot I just

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109
that I always loved math a lot I just
 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.650
that I always loved math a lot I just
adored the puzzles it was I just yeah

I'm never I'm not really much like I

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610
I'm never I'm not really much like I
 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.170
I'm never I'm not really much like I
wasn't much into geometry or a lot of

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180
wasn't much into geometry or a lot of
 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.820
wasn't much into geometry or a lot of
the sort of spatial calculus or anything

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830
the sort of spatial calculus or anything
 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.980
the sort of spatial calculus or anything
like that I just really liked number

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990
like that I just really liked number
 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.750
like that I just really liked number
crunching in different ways I like I

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760
crunching in different ways I like I
 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.590

love calculus I love linear algebra

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600
love calculus I love linear algebra
 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.640
love calculus I love linear algebra
probability and statistics that kind of

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650
probability and statistics that kind of
 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.090
probability and statistics that kind of
stuff I just really like that well there

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100
stuff I just really like that well there
 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.879
stuff I just really like that well there
I mean I had I had a long list of really

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889
I mean I had I had a long list of really
 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.370
I mean I had I had a long list of really
great math teachers too many to name and

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380
great math teachers too many to name and
 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.250
great math teachers too many to name and
not I think all along I had great like

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260
not I think all along I had great like
 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.500
not I think all along I had great like
math instruction actually probably my

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510
math instruction actually probably my
 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.180
math instruction actually probably my
best teacher the one that got me excited

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190
best teacher the one that got me excited
 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.890
best teacher the one that got me excited
about it from the earliest age was my

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900
about it from the earliest age was my
 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.020
about it from the earliest age was my
sister who used to teach me and she was

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030
sister who used to teach me and she was
 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.430
sister who used to teach me and she was
two years ahead of me sis used to teach

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440
two years ahead of me sis used to teach
 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.890
two years ahead of me sis used to teach
me what she learned in school in the

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900
me what she learned in school in the
 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.719
me what she learned in school in the
summers before so like I'd learned it

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729
summers before so like I'd learned it
 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.400
summers before so like I'd learned it
like a year and a half ahead in advance

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410
like a year and a half ahead in advance
 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.159
like a year and a half ahead in advance
and and she probably was the earliest

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169
and and she probably was the earliest
 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:14.480
and and she probably was the earliest
person that got me really excited about

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490
person that got me really excited about
 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.189
person that got me really excited about
math so she always taught me like

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199
math so she always taught me like
 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.379
math so she always taught me like
addition subtraction multiplication and

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389
addition subtraction multiplication and
 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.050
addition subtraction multiplication and
algebra like two years before schools

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060
algebra like two years before schools
 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.909
algebra like two years before schools
were teaching it and I think that got me

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919
were teaching it and I think that got me
 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.200
were teaching it and I think that got me
really excited about it so when I would

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210
really excited about it so when I would
 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.270
really excited about it so when I would
go into school it was weird because I

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280
go into school it was weird because I
 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.439
go into school it was weird because I
already knew everything that I was being

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449
already knew everything that I was being
 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:28.760
already knew everything that I was being
taught that year so I just got really

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770
taught that year so I just got really
 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.710
taught that year so I just got really
obsessive about it like I'd have to do

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720
obsessive about it like I'd have to do
 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.210
obsessive about it like I'd have to do
my multiplication to like multiplication

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220
my multiplication to like multiplication
 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.700
my multiplication to like multiplication
tables like faster than any but you know

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710
tables like faster than any but you know
 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.350
tables like faster than any but you know
I mean like to half time that kind of

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360
I mean like to half time that kind of
 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.899
I mean like to half time that kind of
stuff so I got really into because I was

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909
stuff so I got really into because I was
 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:40.279
stuff so I got really into because I was
learning it so early that I just got

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289
learning it so early that I just got
 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.939
learning it so early that I just got
really into like excellence in it of

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949
really into like excellence in it of
 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:45.649
really into like excellence in it of
yeah just doing the same stuff everyone

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:45.659
yeah just doing the same stuff everyone
 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:46.939
yeah just doing the same stuff everyone
was doing but just doing it faster and

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:46.949
was doing but just doing it faster and
 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:48.890
was doing but just doing it faster and
better like really enjoying that and so

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900
better like really enjoying that and so
 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.659
better like really enjoying that and so
that was probably like the spark that I

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669
that was probably like the spark that I
 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.189
that was probably like the spark that I
got really excited about that kind of

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199
got really excited about that kind of
 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.300
got really excited about that kind of
thing and then

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310
thing and then
 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.730
thing and then
I mean yet lots of teachers so I would

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740
I mean yet lots of teachers so I would
 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.110
I mean yet lots of teachers so I would
say that if there was a teacher that

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120
say that if there was a teacher that
 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.150
say that if there was a teacher that
kind of really inspired me it was mr.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160
kind of really inspired me it was mr.
 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.310
kind of really inspired me it was mr.
bluish my biology teacher and ap biology

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320
bluish my biology teacher and ap biology
 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.620
bluish my biology teacher and ap biology
teacher in high school he got me really

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630
teacher in high school he got me really
 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.740
teacher in high school he got me really
excited about biology and mrs. people's

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750
excited about biology and mrs. people's
 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.150
excited about biology and mrs. people's
I took an anatomy and physiology course

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160
I took an anatomy and physiology course
 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.640
I took an anatomy and physiology course
and those courses in my high school were

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650
and those courses in my high school were
 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.550
and those courses in my high school were
incredibly good and so when I left by my

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560
incredibly good and so when I left by my
 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.930
incredibly good and so when I left by my
senior year I just really thought I was

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940
senior year I just really thought I was
 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.629
senior year I just really thought I was
going to be a biologist and genetics I

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639
going to be a biologist and genetics I
 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:20.370
going to be a biologist and genetics I
was really excited about so I think

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380
was really excited about so I think
 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.680
was really excited about so I think
that's so that's what I went into I had

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690
that's so that's what I went into I had
 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.990
that's so that's what I went into I had
to do it again I would have been a math

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000
to do it again I would have been a math
 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.750
to do it again I would have been a math
major probably a double major it did

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760
major probably a double major it did
 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.860
major probably a double major it did
take a lot of math classes but I would

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870
take a lot of math classes but I would
 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.470
take a lot of math classes but I would
taken a lot more
