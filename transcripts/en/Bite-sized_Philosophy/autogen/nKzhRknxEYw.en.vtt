well so then Geppetto shows up and he's
a kindly old guy which is pretty much

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600
a kindly old guy which is pretty much

a kindly old guy which is pretty much
exactly what you'd expect and you know

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520
exactly what you'd expect and you know
 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.460

he he's a careful craftsman and he likes
 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.930
he he's a careful craftsman and he likes
kittens and you know that's always a

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940
kittens and you know that's always a
 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.110
kittens and you know that's always a
good thing

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120
good thing
 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.039
good thing
and he has some fish and you know he's

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049
and he has some fish and you know he's
 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:17.240
and he has some fish and you know he's
and he's good at making things and he's

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250
and he's good at making things and he's
 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.680
and he's good at making things and he's
got a sense of humor and he's kind of

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690
got a sense of humor and he's kind of
 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.810
got a sense of humor and he's kind of
playful and so he's the good father

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820
playful and so he's the good father
 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.450
playful and so he's the good father
fundamentally he's the wise King he's

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460
fundamentally he's the wise King he's
 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.670
fundamentally he's the wise King he's
the positive archetype of the masculine

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680
the positive archetype of the masculine
 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.870
the positive archetype of the masculine
that's what he is

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
that's what he is
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.570
that's what he is
and so he's culture in its positive

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580
and so he's culture in its positive
 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.310
and so he's culture in its positive
manifestation and he gives rise to this

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320
manifestation and he gives rise to this
 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.680
manifestation and he gives rise to this
creation which is his puppet which is

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690
creation which is his puppet which is
 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.030
creation which is his puppet which is
what culture does because you're a

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040
what culture does because you're a
 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.440
what culture does because you're a
puppet of your culture you're a

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450
puppet of your culture you're a
 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.959
puppet of your culture you're a
marionette of your culture and so maybe

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969
marionette of your culture and so maybe
 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.560
marionette of your culture and so maybe
you could be more than that and that's

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570
you could be more than that and that's
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.880
you could be more than that and that's
the other thing that's strange about

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890
the other thing that's strange about
 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.350
the other thing that's strange about
this movie and it's strange about the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360
this movie and it's strange about the
 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.850
this movie and it's strange about the
mythological way of looking at the world

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860
mythological way of looking at the world
 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.200
mythological way of looking at the world
because scientifically deterministically

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210
because scientifically deterministically
 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.209
because scientifically deterministically
there's nature and there's culture and

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219
there's nature and there's culture and
 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.970
there's nature and there's culture and
you are the deterministic product of the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980
you are the deterministic product of the
 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.350
you are the deterministic product of the
interaction between nature and culture

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360
interaction between nature and culture
 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.240
interaction between nature and culture
there's nothing else to you than that

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250
there's nothing else to you than that
 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.510
there's nothing else to you than that
that's that but the mythological world

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520
that's that but the mythological world
 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.920
that's that but the mythological world
doesn't say that it says something

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930
doesn't say that it says something
 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.170
doesn't say that it says something
different it says that there's nature

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180
different it says that there's nature
 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.100
different it says that there's nature
and culture and then there's you and the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110
and culture and then there's you and the
 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.920
and culture and then there's you and the
you that's in there has choices and a

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930
you that's in there has choices and a
 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.350
you that's in there has choices and a
destiny and that you actually affect the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360
destiny and that you actually affect the
 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.060
destiny and that you actually affect the
interplay of nature and culture in

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070
interplay of nature and culture in
 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.640
interplay of nature and culture in
determining your own character and it

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650
determining your own character and it
 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.830
determining your own character and it
insists upon that the oldest stories we

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
insists upon that the oldest stories we
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.490
insists upon that the oldest stories we
have there's always the hero and the

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500
have there's always the hero and the
 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.390
have there's always the hero and the
archetypal mother and the archetypal

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400
archetypal mother and the archetypal
 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.160
archetypal mother and the archetypal
father there's always those three things

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170
father there's always those three things
 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.980
father there's always those three things
there's never just two so from the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
there's never just two so from the
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.590
there's never just two so from the
narrative perspective there's always the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
narrative perspective there's always the
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.030
narrative perspective there's always the
implication that there's something

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040
implication that there's something
 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.539
implication that there's something
autonomous about the the hero of the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549
autonomous about the the hero of the
 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.359
autonomous about the the hero of the
story and you know you can't account for

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369
story and you know you can't account for
 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.679
story and you know you can't account for
that we don't have a good way of

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689
that we don't have a good way of
 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.450
that we don't have a good way of
accounting that for that from a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460
accounting that for that from a
 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.580
accounting that for that from a
scientific perspective I was having a

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
scientific perspective I was having a
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.260
scientific perspective I was having a
discussion with Sam Harris the other day

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270
discussion with Sam Harris the other day
 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.380
discussion with Sam Harris the other day
which was very what would you say

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390
which was very what would you say
 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.330
which was very what would you say
he said we got wrapped around an axle

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340
he said we got wrapped around an axle
 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.490
he said we got wrapped around an axle
which is pretty much FM Harris is one of

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500
which is pretty much FM Harris is one of
 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.429
which is pretty much FM Harris is one of
the four famous you know atheists along

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
the four famous you know atheists along
 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.469
the four famous you know atheists along
with Christopher Hitchens and Richard

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479
with Christopher Hitchens and Richard
 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.219
with Christopher Hitchens and Richard
Dawkins and Dan Dennett yeah and so we

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229
Dawkins and Dan Dennett yeah and so we
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.830
Dawkins and Dan Dennett yeah and so we
were having a discussion and he's a

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840
were having a discussion and he's a
 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.900
were having a discussion and he's a
determinist just right down to the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910
determinist just right down to the
 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.450
determinist just right down to the
bottom it's like you're dieter

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460
bottom it's like you're dieter
 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.490
bottom it's like you're dieter
and you're determined there's no free

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500
and you're determined there's no free
 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.650
and you're determined there's no free
will you're a deterministic machine and

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660
will you're a deterministic machine and
 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.540
will you're a deterministic machine and
you know if you're a coherent scientist

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550
you know if you're a coherent scientist
 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.550
you know if you're a coherent scientist
and you're a Newtonian roughly speaking

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560
and you're a Newtonian roughly speaking
 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.380
and you're a Newtonian roughly speaking
you don't really have much choice other

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390
you don't really have much choice other
 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.180
you don't really have much choice other
than to think that way but that isn't

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190
than to think that way but that isn't
 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.400
than to think that way but that isn't
how it seems to people and we don't

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410
how it seems to people and we don't
 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.710
how it seems to people and we don't
treat each other that way and our entire

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720
treat each other that way and our entire
 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.510
treat each other that way and our entire
legal system is predicated on the idea

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520
legal system is predicated on the idea
 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.810
legal system is predicated on the idea
that you do in fact have free will so

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820
that you do in fact have free will so
 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.370
that you do in fact have free will so
well can we account for it

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380
well can we account for it
 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.500
well can we account for it
well no and do we have a scientific

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510
well no and do we have a scientific
 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.050
well no and do we have a scientific
model for it no but then I would also

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060
model for it no but then I would also
 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.000
model for it no but then I would also
say we do not have a scientific model

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010
say we do not have a scientific model
 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.010
say we do not have a scientific model
for consciousness we don't know a damn

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020
for consciousness we don't know a damn
 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.320
for consciousness we don't know a damn
thing about consciousness which is why

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330
thing about consciousness which is why

Dan Bennett's book which was called

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190
Dan Bennett's book which was called
 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.790
Dan Bennett's book which was called
consciousness explained was referred to

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800
consciousness explained was referred to
 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.490
consciousness explained was referred to
its critics as consciousness explained

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500
its critics as consciousness explained
 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.190
its critics as consciousness explained
away which is exactly right as far as

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200
away which is exactly right as far as
 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.300
away which is exactly right as far as
I'm concerned because he took a

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310
I'm concerned because he took a
 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.430
I'm concerned because he took a
mechanistic approach and I just don't

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440
mechanistic approach and I just don't
 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.350
mechanistic approach and I just don't
think you get to do that because there's

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360
think you get to do that because there's
 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.670
think you get to do that because there's
something really weird about

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680
something really weird about
 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.060
something really weird about
consciousness I mean the phenomenologist

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070
consciousness I mean the phenomenologist
 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.460
consciousness I mean the phenomenologist
like Heidegger who tried to radically

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470
like Heidegger who tried to radically
 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.560
like Heidegger who tried to radically
transform Western philosophy right from

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570
transform Western philosophy right from
 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.780
transform Western philosophy right from
the bottom-up he basically said well you

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790
the bottom-up he basically said well you
 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.300
the bottom-up he basically said well you
know you can treat the world as if

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310
know you can treat the world as if
 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.400
know you can treat the world as if
consciousness is primary and that human

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410
consciousness is primary and that human
 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.460
consciousness is primary and that human
experience is reality that's reality and

experience is reality that's reality and

that it doesn't exist independently of

that it doesn't exist independently of

that it doesn't exist independently of
