HENRY SHACKLETON: Be
a long 15 minutes.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.775
There you go.

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:12.900
All right, hello everybody.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.420
My name's Henry and today,
I'll be presenting my findings

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.270
on an experiment that I
conducted with my lab partner

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.200
Adin over there.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.610
Thank you, Adin

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.550
During our experiment,
we determined the angular

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.610
dependency of the scattering
rate of alpha particles

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.050
through gold foil.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.390
Using this relation, we
are able to determine

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.700
that Rutherford's
scattering presents

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.740
an accurate model for these
scattering of effects.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.600
In doing so, we are able
to extract some information

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.682
about the actual nature of
atoms and their atomic makeup.

00:00:43.682 --> 00:00:45.140
So to give a bit
of background, I'm

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.610
going to go through two
different historical models

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.120
of the atom and talk about
the different experimental

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.580
predictions that they predict.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.320
So back in the
early 19th century,

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.700
people weren't too sure
what made up an atom.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.190
They knew there
were some electrons

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.900
and some positive
stuff going around

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.840
somewhere, but other than
that, they weren't too sure.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.700
Now, the predominant
theory at the time

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.090
was JJ Thomson's Plum
Pudding Model, shown here.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.120
In this model, you have these
negatively charged electrons

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.960
that sort of float around in
this soup of positive charge.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.957
I apologize for the plum
pudding and the soup.

00:01:17.957 --> 00:01:20.040
If you're getting hungry
from all these metaphors,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.750
there is food back there.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.630
Now, the experimental
predictions

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.580
that we want to get
out of this model

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.117
is what it says
about scattering.

00:01:28.117 --> 00:01:30.450
So if we take one of these
atoms and we shoot it through

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.610
a material made
up of other atoms,

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.130
what kind of scattering
do we expect to see ?

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.020
And you can see in
this model here,

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.950
we don't really expect
that much scattering.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.116
So the atom will go through.

00:01:40.116 --> 00:01:43.710
It might pass through a slightly
more negatively charged region

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.860
here and move a bit that way,
deflect a little bit that way.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.500
But you don't expect that
much scattering, overall.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.280
Doing out all the math, we see
that this predicts small angle

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.200
scattering that dies
off exponentially

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.660
as a function of angle.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.600
This dying off is
controlled by this theta sub

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.030
m called the mean
multiple scattering rate.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.090
For gold, we predict
this is about 1.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.810
So Rutherford comes along and
he looks at this and says,

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.290
I don't know about this.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.656
Let me try something else.

00:02:12.656 --> 00:02:14.280
This right here is
the Rutherford model

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.510
that he proposes.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.540
In this model we have our
negatively charged electrons.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.040
But instead of this
soup of positive charge,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.760
we have a densely packed
nucleus in the middle.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.080
Now because this nucleus is so
dense and so tightly packed,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.960
it allows for much stronger
interactions between atoms,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.370
when it comes to scattering.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.992
For example, you can imagine
if two atoms collided head on.

00:02:36.992 --> 00:02:38.700
The nuclei would
interact and they'd just

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.440
bounce straight off.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.300
So doing out all
the math again, we

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.420
see that this larger scattering
angle dies off as 1 over sine

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.730
to the fourth of theta over 2.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.660
Now, this predicts much higher
rate at larger angles than this

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.560
exponential fall
off, right here .

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.800
A small point to clarify
about this equation

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.550
here is that this equation is
derived assuming large angles.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.959
So for theta, roughly,
larger than or equal to 10.

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.500
This is not a limit
of the Rutherford

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.090
theory in and of itself.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.770
You can derive a
Rutherford model

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.200
for scattering for
any angle, but it

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.470
starts to get really
gross at small angles.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.210
You can actually
see this diverges

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.470
for theta equals to
0, which is not good.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.930
So this equation
right here is only

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.356
valid for theta roughly
greater than or equal to 10.

00:03:25.356 --> 00:03:26.980
So for the purposes
of this experiment,

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.820
we will restrict our viewing
to theta greater than

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.710
or equal to 10.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.950
And these two models give
us two different predictions

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.960
that we can compare
against actual data.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.370
So we experimentally
measure scattering rates

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.540
at various angles.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.730
And by taking this
data we can fit it

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.700
to both the predicted
Rutherford and Thomsom model,

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.650
and come to a conclusion
about which one more

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.425
accurately predicts our model.

00:03:52.425 --> 00:03:55.440
Now let's talk a bit about the
apparatus that lets us do this.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.560
The first part of our efforts
is an alpha particle howitzer.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.902
This howitzer contains
an Americium-241 source

00:04:01.902 --> 00:04:03.360
which emits alpha
particles-- which

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.045
are two protons and two
neutrons-- at, approximately,

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:07.942
a constant energy.

00:04:07.942 --> 00:04:09.900
These alpha particles
shoot out of the howitzer

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.500
right here in a sort of
concentrated beam directed out

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.780
of the howitzer.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.300
These awful particles hit a gold
foil where something happens,

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.430
we don't know yet.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.040
And it scatters off at an
angle theta, which is then

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.320
detected by our state detector.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.240
This detector registers
the count, as well as

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.310
the energy of the
incoming particle,

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.840
and sends it to an
MCA to be analyzed.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.480
Now, there's a bit
of a complication

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.370
in the geometry of our set up.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.110
You see, what we
want to measure is

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.840
this angle, theta, here,
our scattering rate.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.370
What we actually
control and what

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.920
we measure in our
experiments is this angle,

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.990
phe which is the
angle of our howitzer

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.190
relative to our detector.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.140
So at phe equals
to 0, the howitzer

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.170
points dead on at our detector.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.510
Now, in a sort of
theoretical world

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.990
where this solid state detector
is infinitesimally small

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.190
and our beam is also this
infinitesimally point source,

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.160
we would expect phe to
correspond exactly to theta.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.650
So at phe equals to 0, the
howitzer pointed dead on,

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.860
we would expect any
non-zero scattering

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.440
to cause the particles to
shoot off in a direction

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.110
and not be detected
by our detector.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.690
However, in practice, this
is not actually the case.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.810
Our solid state detector
is a few centimeters wide.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.290
And because of this, it allows
for a range of angles theta

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.110
that are detected given
a certain howitzer angle.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.420
In addition, our
beam has some width,

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.780
which allows for further angles
that can be detected given

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.269
a certain howitzer angle phe.

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:36.810
So this is a bunch
of stuff going on.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.810
We've got a lot of different
things contributing

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:39.860
to uncertainty.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.080
But we can account for
this by, essentially,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.390
asking the simple
question, all right, we

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.850
have a howitzer at an angle phe.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.770
What is the probability
of a detection

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.180
that we see having come from
a particle being scattered

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.740
at an angle theta?

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.780
Again, in this
theoretical case, where

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.270
we have point sources
and point detectors,

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.790
this probably would just
correspond to a delta function

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.260
centered at phe.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.810
However this is not
practically the case.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.880
And from simple
geometric considerations,

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.040
which I can go into
more detail later,

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.200
we expect as a
first approximation

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.490
a sort of triangle shaped
distribution around phe.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.530
This is called the
angular response function.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.660
And we determine it by
removing the gold foil

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.910
from our detectors, so
we just have our howitzer

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.320
and our detector, and we see
how deviations in our phe

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.030
affect our counting rates.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.910
Now, again, to reference back
in this theoretical scenario

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.190
with point sources
and point detectors,

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.880
we would expect to only
see counts at phe equals

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.670
to 0, with our howitzer
pointed dead on the detector.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.610
And as soon as we move it a
little bit, the counts go away.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.474
However, this is not
actually the case.

00:06:45.474 --> 00:06:46.890
And by measuring
these deviations,

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.195
we can determine our
angular response function.

00:06:49.195 --> 00:06:50.570
So we move or
howitzer around, we

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.960
determine how our angle
phe affects our counts,

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.220
and we get something like this.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.850
This is fitted to a
triangle distribution.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.190
Now, we can take a few
things out of this.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.780
I see a fellow in the crowd
laughing at my chi squared.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.070
The chi squared
is not that good.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.580
This is because we acknowledge
that a triangle is only

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:11.780
a first approximation.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.440
We don't expect our data
to actually perfectly model

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.190
this triangle distribution.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.670
However, it simplifies
our math greatly.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.290
So we use this
triangle distribution,

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.480
and try to extract
some data from this.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.270
The second thing that
we can see from this

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.320
is that this distribution
is actually a bit off center

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.590
at theta equals to negative 2.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.490
Now, normally, we would expect
the highest count rate when

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.580
our howitzer is pointed dead
on at our detector at theta

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.870
equals to 0.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.024
This offset indicates
that the protractor

00:07:41.024 --> 00:07:42.440
that we used to
measure our angles

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.480
is actually a little bit off.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.560
And putting that on actually
corresponds to theta

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.150
equals to 2.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.930
Finally, this gives us our
angular response function.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.290
If we replace zero with
our howitzer angle phe,

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.200
this gives us the spread
around phe of scattering

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.170
angles theta that we detect.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:04.020
We accommodate this in our
equations via a convolution.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.230
Now, this can
intuitively be thought

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:11.000
as taking these two rates
which are given Thomson

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.050
and Rutherford the probability
of having a scattering at angle

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:15.910
theta.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.080
We then multiply it
by the probability

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.970
of a scattering
angle theta being

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.330
detected by our howitzer
positioned at an angle phe.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.790
And then we integrate
over all theta.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:27.920
This gives us two
different counting rates

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.290
as a function of our
howitzer angle phe,

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.950
one for our Rutherford theory,
and one for our Thomson theory.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.100
This gives us two equations that
we can use to compare our data,

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:41.720
given geometric considerations
about our apparatus.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.850
So after that, we are
finally ready to go.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.310
So we take our gold
foil, we put it back in.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.985
We measure at different
angles between phe

00:08:48.985 --> 00:08:51.930
equals to 10 degrees
and 60 degrees.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.320
We let a detector
detect for a while.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.430
And over the period of time at
any one of our measuring rates,

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.230
we get something that
looks a bit like this.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.800
Now, this MCA bin number
down here corresponds

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.440
to the energy of the particles
that we're detecting.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.970
And on the y-axis,
here, is our count rate.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.790
Now, the first thing
that you might think,

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:13.430
and the first thing that we
thought as well, is well,

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.354
this is about a
Gaussian right here.

00:09:15.354 --> 00:09:17.270
That's our particle, and
everything below that

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.890
is just noise.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:23.390
However, as we found out, the
energy loss through a material

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.270
is actually described by a
Landau distribution, which

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.730
is a Gaussian, but with
a slightly longer tail

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.082
on one side.

00:09:30.082 --> 00:09:32.540
What you see here is a Gaussian
with a slightly longer tail

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.710
on one side.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.800
So by fitting this
Landau distri--

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.170
We fit this to a
Landau distribution

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:43.340
and get chi squared's
between 0.5 and 2,

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.620
which suggests that all
this did actually come

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.280
from a Landau distribution.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.600
And all of these are valid
scattering data points, and not

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.800
just noise.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.840
We further confirm this
by measuring our noise,

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.900
by taking our howitzer pointed
away from our detector,

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.960
and just letting our
detector collect.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.090
We ultimately determined that
the noise within our energy

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.690
range of interest is very small,
much smaller than any count

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.460
rate that we care about
in our experiment.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:12.900
Therefore, because of this and
the fact that our distribution

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.900
models a Landau distribution,
which is what we expect,

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.940
we conclude that we can
use all of the points

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.870
that we detect as valid
scattering data points.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.380
But of course, it comes
with some good old counting

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.670
uncertainty.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.700
In addition, we have some
uncertainty in our angles.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.280
We read the angles
of our howitzer

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.450
by eye from a little protractor
that we have in our apparatus.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.250
But our eyes aren't
so good, so we

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.260
tack a plus or minus
1 degree uncertainty

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.760
to angular measurements.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.560
My lab partner thinks 0.5.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.680
I think 1 because
I'm not as certain.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.416
So we take all
these measurements.

00:10:48.416 --> 00:10:50.040
We divide by the
amount of time that we

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.110
collected to get a count rate.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.720
We graph this as a
function of our angle

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.570
that we measure to that,
and fit this to a Rutherford

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.640
and Thomson convolved fit.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.800
And we see something like this.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.450
And I think this really
speaks for itself.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.340
This is not an error in my code.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.390
Thomson is really just that
bad in accounting for our data.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.910
But we see here that the
Rutherford scattering

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.690
prediction more accurately
describes the gradual falloff

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.840
of our scattering rates as the
howitzer angle gets bigger, as

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:27.070
opposed to the Thomson fit,
with the chi squared of 2000.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.790
Now, there are different ways
of potentially giving Thomson

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.650
a better shot,
accommodating for it,

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.350
may be giving it a better
chance of describing our data.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:36.210
And I can go into
this in more detail

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.800
later, if people are interested.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.430
But, ultimately, we see that
Thomson is fundamentally unable

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.950
to account for this data.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.870
Whereas Rutherford
describes it quite well.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.000
Now, there's an
additional caveat

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.050
to this chi squared
that we have here.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.500
So this chi squared
comes from fitting

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.970
from our Rutherford and
Thomson data convolved

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.750
with our beam profile.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.600
However, our beam
profile does have

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.860
some uncertainty associated.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.320
In that fit that we had,
there is some uncertainty

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.830
in the triangle.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:09.570
So to sort of estimate how this
uncertainty affects our data,

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:13.170
we vary our beam profile
within one standard deviation

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:15.780
of its fit parameters, and
see how our goodness of fit

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:16.810
changes.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.500
And we see here that
the goodness of fit

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.170
for a Rutherford model,
while it varies somewhat

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.890
depending on the
convolution that we use,

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:28.320
it doesn't change a
significant amount.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.840
And it certainly doesn't
change enough to warrant

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.550
considering the Thomson model.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.260
The discrepancy between
the chi squareds

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.080
and the visual discrepancy
you see here very

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.910
clearly suggests
that Rutherford does

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:42.250
a much better job of predicting
our data than Thomson.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:46.620
Which, again, suggests a more
Rutherford make up of the atom,

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:50.020
as opposed to the Thomson
Plum Pudding model.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.500
So in conclusion, Thomson's
Plum Pudding model

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.650
is found to fundamentally
be unable to describe

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.860
the scattering rates that
we observe at large angles.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.990
The Rutherford model
more accurately predicts

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:06.000
this gradual fall off, which
suggests a more Rutherford-like

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.230
view of our atom.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.940
And that's it.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:09.717
Thank you.

00:13:09.717 --> 00:13:17.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:22.489
INSTRUCTOR: All right, the
paper is open for questions.

00:13:22.489 --> 00:13:23.447
HENRY SHACKLETON: Yeah.

00:13:23.447 --> 00:13:27.085
AUDIENCE: Did you try the fit
without using the triangular

00:13:27.085 --> 00:13:27.644
correction?

00:13:27.644 --> 00:13:28.810
HENRY SHACKLETON: Yes I did.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.930
And this is another
interesting point, which

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:35.350
shows that our convolution
does benefit our data,

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:38.680
does a much better-- not a much
better, not as bad as Thomson,

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.570
relatively speaking.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:41.950
But it does a
noticeably better job

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:46.020
at describing our data than the
pure Rutherford scattering, 1

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.051
over sine to the fourth fit.

00:13:49.051 --> 00:13:52.390
AUDIENCE: So the
difference between 2.14--

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:54.660
HENRY SHACKLETON:
And, sorry, 8.18.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.002
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see it.

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:57.960
HENRY SHACKLETON: That's
a chi squared of eight

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.084
for just fitting with the
raw Rutherford scattering

00:14:00.084 --> 00:14:01.565
without the convolution.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:05.776
Yes.

00:14:05.776 --> 00:14:08.584
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
plots that show your Landau

00:14:08.584 --> 00:14:10.930
distribution fits to the data?

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:12.347
HENRY SHACKLETON:
I thought I did.

00:14:12.347 --> 00:14:13.805
You saw me switch
forward and then,

00:14:13.805 --> 00:14:15.070
realize that it wasn't there.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.280
So I switched back.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.640
No, so I don't have a
picture of the Landau fit.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.140
One thing that I
can describe, which

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:24.850
is a small caveat to this, is
that the Landau distribution

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:26.160
describes energy loss.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.210
And this is usually a
Gaussian with one tail on--

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:31.450
this isn't too well.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.450
It's a Gaussian with a slightly
longer tail on the right hand

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.115
side.

00:14:35.115 --> 00:14:37.240
Now, this is a Gaussian
with a slightly longer tail

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.200
on the left hand side.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.600
However, what we
see here is energy.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.660
And energy loss is sort
of the inverse of this.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.360
So we actually fit this to a
reverse Landau distribution.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.770
And throughout all our data,
we get reduced chi squareds

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.850
between 0.5 and 2, which
indicates a good fit.

00:14:57.746 --> 00:15:02.129
INSTRUCTOR: A different
question for Henry?

00:15:02.129 --> 00:15:02.930
All right, let's--

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.301
HENRY SHACKLETON: Yep, Shawn?

00:15:04.301 --> 00:15:06.209
SHAWN: What was the
largest angle you

00:15:06.209 --> 00:15:07.500
were able to use the data from?

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:07.860
HENRY SHACKLETON: Sorry?

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.234
SHAWN: What was
the largest angle

00:15:09.234 --> 00:15:10.732
you were able to get your data?

00:15:10.732 --> 00:15:11.940
HENRY SHACKLETON: 60 degrees.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.847
60 degrees, we collected
over the course of five days.

00:15:15.847 --> 00:15:17.930
And I don't think we could
have actually collected

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:23.150
data at much higher angles
than that because our noise

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.390
rate right here is 0.0002.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.830
Now, this is still a bit
smaller than our counting

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:30.902
rate for 60 degrees.

00:15:30.902 --> 00:15:32.360
But if we started
to go further, we

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.570
would start to enter the regime
where noise becomes much more

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:36.869
dominant.

00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:39.119
SHAWN: Do you happen to know
how many total counts was

00:15:39.119 --> 00:15:40.766
that over five days?

00:15:40.766 --> 00:15:42.140
HENRY SHACKLETON:
Over five days?

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.150
Off the top of my
head, I believe 400.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.637
You can actually see--

00:15:45.637 --> 00:15:47.720
I know the rate here, which
you can very easily go

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.462
backwards in the math, I guess.

00:15:49.462 --> 00:15:50.420
SHAWN: So if the rate--

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:51.425
HENRY SHACKLETON: This
is somewhere down here.

00:15:51.425 --> 00:15:52.730
SHAWN: --100 counts per day--

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:53.540
HENRY SHACKLETON: Yeah,
something like that.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.249
SHAWN: Or a couple
counts per hour.

00:15:55.249 --> 00:15:57.040
HENRY SHACKLETON: Yes,
something like that.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.557
SHAWN: All right, thank you.

00:15:59.557 --> 00:16:01.390
The noise that we
mentioned here is actually

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:03.070
restricted to our
energy of interest.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.560
So there's a fair bit of
noise at much lower energy

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:10.240
levels, specifically
between this MCA bin

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.610
number of 0 and 50, down here.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.080
There's a fair bit
of noise there.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.580
But once you start getting up
to this larger area right here

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:20.050
between 50 and 1500, we
start to see much less noise.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:27.550
INSTRUCTOR: Another question?

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:29.050
All right, let's
thank Henry again.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:30.898
[APPLAUSE]
