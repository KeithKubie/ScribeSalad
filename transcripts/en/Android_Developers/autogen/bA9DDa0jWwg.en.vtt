kind of light sleep cycle and it's a
 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.420
kind of light sleep cycle and it's a
very detailed app you could if you take

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430
very detailed app you could if you take
 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.250

view they have made some effort to kind

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710
view they have made some effort to kind
 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.070

of get towards the kind of hollow and

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080
of get towards the kind of hollow and
 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.850
of get towards the kind of hollow and
design guidelines and but my overall

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860
design guidelines and but my overall
 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.429
design guidelines and but my overall
feeling of the application was that

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439
feeling of the application was that
 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.840
feeling of the application was that
while it's very very functional and

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850
while it's very very functional and
 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.330
while it's very very functional and
powerful I found it kind of hard to get

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340
powerful I found it kind of hard to get
 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.700
powerful I found it kind of hard to get
into and understand how to operate and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710
into and understand how to operate and
 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.780
into and understand how to operate and
to prioritize what tasks are should be

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790
to prioritize what tasks are should be

doing first and what information was

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
doing first and what information was
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.640
doing first and what information was
important so if we take a look at the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650
important so if we take a look at the
 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.960
important so if we take a look at the
application here this is the first

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970
application here this is the first
 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.609
application here this is the first
screen you see when you when you start

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619
screen you see when you when you start
 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.109
screen you see when you when you start
up this is that where you can create

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119
up this is that where you can create
 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.960
up this is that where you can create
different alarms as well as there's a

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970
different alarms as well as there's a
 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.389
different alarms as well as there's a
prompt unlock and some of the key

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399
prompt unlock and some of the key
 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.950
prompt unlock and some of the key
functionality on this feeling is is down

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960
functionality on this feeling is is down
 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.130
functionality on this feeling is is down
there on the bottom left I have kind of

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140
there on the bottom left I have kind of
 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.660
there on the bottom left I have kind of
like a split action bar but kind of not

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670
like a split action bar but kind of not
 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.300
like a split action bar but kind of not
a split action bar at the same time and

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310
a split action bar at the same time and
 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.889
a split action bar at the same time and
you can see some of the function access

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899
you can see some of the function access
 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.139
you can see some of the function access
to kind of add a new alarm start the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149

straight into

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800
straight into
 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.890
straight into
and we hope to see what we cooked up so

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900
and we hope to see what we cooked up so
 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.100
and we hope to see what we cooked up so
here you can see we've done it's not a

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110
here you can see we've done it's not a
 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.570
here you can see we've done it's not a
huge departure but it's definitely kind

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580
huge departure but it's definitely kind
 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.920
huge departure but it's definitely kind
of we try to apply some of the hollow

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930
of we try to apply some of the hollow
 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.360
of we try to apply some of the hollow
look and feel to the application so

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370
look and feel to the application so
 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.740
look and feel to the application so
straight off there is a standard action

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750
straight off there is a standard action
 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.030
straight off there is a standard action
bar giving you that kind of sense of

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040
bar giving you that kind of sense of
 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.770
bar giving you that kind of sense of
where you are and a common place to look

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780
where you are and a common place to look
 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.760
where you are and a common place to look
for some of the actions and I felt like

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770
for some of the actions and I felt like
 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.410
for some of the actions and I felt like
we had to kind of reorganize some of the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420
we had to kind of reorganize some of the
 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.970
we had to kind of reorganize some of the
functionality a little bit because this

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980
functionality a little bit because this
 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.560
functionality a little bit because this
main screen while I offered the alarms

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570
main screen while I offered the alarms
 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.540
main screen while I offered the alarms
and there's a lot of functionality kind

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550
and there's a lot of functionality kind
 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.610
and there's a lot of functionality kind
of hanging off sub screens as well and I

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620
of hanging off sub screens as well and I
 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.830
of hanging off sub screens as well and I
felt like this app has two main purposes

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840
felt like this app has two main purposes
 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.360
felt like this app has two main purposes
which is like setting alarm to wake at

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370
which is like setting alarm to wake at
 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.800
which is like setting alarm to wake at
the right time and for monitoring your

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810
the right time and for monitoring your
 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.630
the right time and for monitoring your
sleep and seeing kind of how that sleep

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640
sleep and seeing kind of how that sleep
 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.400
sleep and seeing kind of how that sleep
pattern and it's going so I wanted to

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410
pattern and it's going so I wanted to
 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.990
pattern and it's going so I wanted to
float those write it up as your primary

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000
float those write it up as your primary
 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.080
float those write it up as your primary
kind of options into these two main tab

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090
kind of options into these two main tab
 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.710
kind of options into these two main tab
settings it alarms and stats tab as you

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720
settings it alarms and stats tab as you
 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.530

can see we've also am really really kind

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540
can see we've also am really really kind
 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.960
can see we've also am really really kind
of emphasized the track and track sleep

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970
of emphasized the track and track sleep
 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.030

at the bottom with equal weighting to
 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.170
at the bottom with equal weighting to
all the other options it's now this

gigantic kind of purple button and

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060
gigantic kind of purple button and
 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.660
gigantic kind of purple button and
finally a little note on the on the

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670
finally a little note on the on the
 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.910

coloring and a palette I found some of

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920
coloring and a palette I found some of
 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.530
coloring and a palette I found some of
the kind of green highlights to be kind

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540
the kind of green highlights to be kind
 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.270
the kind of green highlights to be kind
of like grabbing your focus thing look

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280
of like grabbing your focus thing look
 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.000
of like grabbing your focus thing look
at me on the divider which kind of felt

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010
at me on the divider which kind of felt
 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.300
at me on the divider which kind of felt
slightly off to me so you kind of

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310
slightly off to me so you kind of
 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.890
slightly off to me so you kind of
redress the palate a little bit here and

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900
redress the palate a little bit here and
 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.520
redress the palate a little bit here and
it's taking quite a lot of cues from the

how good or bad it was so these are
 

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.130
how good or bad it was so these are
really kind of like details which we

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:09.140
really kind of like details which we
 

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.230
really kind of like details which we
kind of change information architect and

a subsequent screen yeah I think it's

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:15.470
a subsequent screen yeah I think it's
 

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:18.280
a subsequent screen yeah I think it's
just a great job just I mean splitting

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:18.290
just a great job just I mean splitting
 

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.350
just a great job just I mean splitting
up the I guess a very very complex

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:20.360
up the I guess a very very complex

screen a complex screen that you know
 

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.030
screen a complex screen that you know
has good data but it's just not as easy

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040
has good data but it's just not as easy
 

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.910

that's like you know letting you really
 

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:32.290
that's like you know letting you really
look at the content or one specific

piece of content right the specific day
 

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.699
piece of content right the specific day
and see all the details and I think it's

00:10:36.699 --> 00:10:36.709
and see all the details and I think it's
 

00:10:36.709 --> 00:10:38.199
and see all the details and I think it's
just like a good combination of

00:10:38.199 --> 00:10:38.209
just like a good combination of
 

00:10:38.209 --> 00:10:41.350
just like a good combination of

go into the application and start it to

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:52.510
go into the application and start it to
 

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.660

people like me probably plug their phone

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:58.360
people like me probably plug their phone
 

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.110
people like me probably plug their phone
in at night as charging overnight and so

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.120
in at night as charging overnight and so
 

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.320
in at night as charging overnight and so
just doing that is enough to say kick

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:04.330
just doing that is enough to say kick
 

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.240
just doing that is enough to say kick
off a daydream which will then start

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:06.250
off a daydream which will then start
 

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.090

probably put some logic in there if it's
in the middle of the day or something

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:11.890
in the middle of the day or something
 

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.050
in the middle of the day or something
like this you wouldn't actually kick off

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:13.060
like this you wouldn't actually kick off
 

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.150
like this you wouldn't actually kick off
daydream but yeah just just the act of

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:15.160
daydream but yeah just just the act of
 

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.890
daydream but yeah just just the act of
plugging in the device and putting it

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:16.900
plugging in the device and putting it
 

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.840
plugging in the device and putting it
down on your bed could then kick off the

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:18.850
down on your bed could then kick off the
 

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.270
down on your bed could then kick off the
functionality so I really find anything

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:21.280
functionality so I really find anything
 

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.430
functionality so I really find anything
which means you know it's a bit of a

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440
which means you know it's a bit of a
 

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.140
which means you know it's a bit of a
burden on the user to have to go into

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:25.150
burden on the user to have to go into
 

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.400

remember to do it hit the start button

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:28.330
remember to do it hit the start button
 

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.240
remember to do it hit the start button
hit the stop button remember to do that

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:30.250
hit the stop button remember to do that
 

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.610
hit the stop button remember to do that
in the morning so anything you can do to

in the morning so anything you can do to
 

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.590
in the morning so anything you can do to
automate that process I think it's going

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:34.600
automate that process I think it's going
 

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.200
automate that process I think it's going
to make the user will regular they're

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:37.210
to make the user will regular they're
 

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.670
to make the user will regular they're
going to keep keep on using it and see

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:38.680
going to keep keep on using it and see
 

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.620
going to keep keep on using it and see
the value of replication so i thought id

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:40.630
the value of replication so i thought id
 

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.300
the value of replication so i thought id

it's fairly easy to just create a you
know a simple clock daydream that just

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:05.070
know a simple clock daydream that just
 

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:06.200
know a simple clock daydream that just
shows the current time in the kind of

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:06.210
shows the current time in the kind of
 

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.750
shows the current time in the kind of
date but then you know after a certain

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.760
date but then you know after a certain
 

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.670
date but then you know after a certain
point it kicks in to kind of tracking

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680
point it kicks in to kind of tracking
 

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.410
point it kicks in to kind of tracking
mode and shows the clock and maybe even

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:12.420
mode and shows the clock and maybe even
 

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.269
mode and shows the clock and maybe even
maybe this is a way to you know play

00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279
maybe this is a way to you know play
 

00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:17.210
maybe this is a way to you know play
like you know soothing sounds in the

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:17.220
like you know soothing sounds in the
 

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.400
like you know soothing sounds in the
background or something as you're

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:19.410
background or something as you're
 

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.230
background or something as you're
sleeping so since this app is already

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240
sleeping so since this app is already
 

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.170
sleeping so since this app is already
doing all this data capture maybe you

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:24.180
doing all this data capture maybe you
 

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.910
doing all this data capture maybe you
can use that intelligently to even

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920
can use that intelligently to even
 

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.550
can use that intelligently to even
improve your sleep as you're you know as

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560
improve your sleep as you're you know as
 

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.079
improve your sleep as you're you know as
you're sleeping maybe by playing sounds

00:13:30.079 --> 00:13:30.089
you're sleeping maybe by playing sounds
 

00:13:30.089 --> 00:13:32.030
you're sleeping maybe by playing sounds
or something like that so lots of lots

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040
or something like that so lots of lots
 

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.560
or something like that so lots of lots
of ideas here i think that the daydream

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:33.570
of ideas here i think that the daydream
 

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.930
of ideas here i think that the daydream
idea is really good here I think and of

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:35.940
idea is really good here I think and of
 

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.310
idea is really good here I think and of
course you can interact with daydreams

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320
course you can interact with daydreams
 

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.870
course you can interact with daydreams
as well so I mean you could still have

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880
as well so I mean you could still have
 

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.280
as well so I mean you could still have
something that you could touch and

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:40.290
something that you could touch and
 

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:43.010
something that you could touch and
resize all or potentially graphs during

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:43.020
resize all or potentially graphs during
 

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.030
resize all or potentially graphs during
the day that you could look at or

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040
the day that you could look at or
 

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.630
the day that you could look at or
something like that all right so overall

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:47.640
something like that all right so overall
 

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.490
something like that all right so overall
a really nice app with lots of lots of

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:49.500
a really nice app with lots of lots of
 

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.519
a really nice app with lots of lots of
functionality I hope and the developer

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:51.529
functionality I hope and the developer
 

00:13:51.529 --> 00:13:53.810
functionality I hope and the developer
like some of the ideas we've thrown

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:53.820
like some of the ideas we've thrown
 

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.910
like some of the ideas we've thrown
around there and perhaps tix runs with

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920
around there and perhaps tix runs with
 

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.400
around there and perhaps tix runs with
them yeah and if you're watching for the

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:58.410
them yeah and if you're watching for the
 

00:13:58.410 --> 00:13:59.360
them yeah and if you're watching for the
developer of this app and you're

developer of this app and you're
 

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:00.920
developer of this app and you're
watching that to you know let us

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:00.930
watching that to you know let us
 

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:04.490

minutes left need to fly through

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:56.730
minutes left need to fly through
 

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.880
minutes left need to fly through
backward compatibility so we have a lot

00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:58.890
backward compatibility so we have a lot
 

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:00.110
backward compatibility so we have a lot
of slides and backward compatibility

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120
of slides and backward compatibility
 

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.460
of slides and backward compatibility
fortunately a lot of them are

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:01.470
fortunately a lot of them are
 

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.220
fortunately a lot of them are
screenshots but let's get started so

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:04.230
screenshots but let's get started so

designing for backward compatibility not

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:12.030
designing for backward compatibility not
 

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.730
designing for backward compatibility not
so much for developing for that I mean

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:13.740
so much for developing for that I mean
 

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.200
so much for developing for that I mean
we have lots and lots of training

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:15.210
we have lots and lots of training
 

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:17.660
we have lots and lots of training
sessions and all that for developers but

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:17.670
sessions and all that for developers but
 

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.010
sessions and all that for developers but
this is really more targeted at

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:19.020
this is really more targeted at
 

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.980
this is really more targeted at

designers out there are looking at the

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480
designers out there are looking at the
 

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.410
designers out there are looking at the
design guidelines for compatibility the

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:30.420
design guidelines for compatibility the
 

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.180
design guidelines for compatibility the
the guidelines page for compatibility is

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:32.190
the guidelines page for compatibility is
 

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:35.120
the guidelines page for compatibility is
fairly you know fairly short it only

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:35.130
fairly you know fairly short it only
 

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:37.010
fairly you know fairly short it only
talks about a few important things some

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:37.020
talks about a few important things some
 

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.300
talks about a few important things some
of the things include you know the

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:38.310
of the things include you know the

legacy menu button how action overflow
 

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.970
legacy menu button how action overflow
behaves across different devices so it's

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:43.980
behaves across different devices so it's
 

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:44.870
behaves across different devices so it's
definitely stuff that you should be

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880
definitely stuff that you should be
 

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.700
definitely stuff that you should be
aware of before you know jumping in too

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:46.710
aware of before you know jumping in too
 

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:49.220

do have a lot to cover so backward

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:56.700
do have a lot to cover so backward
 

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.090
do have a lot to cover so backward
compatibility so the way we view

00:15:59.090 --> 00:15:59.100
compatibility so the way we view
 

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.220

backward compatibility is that for for

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:01.230
backward compatibility is that for for
 

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:02.690
backward compatibility is that for for
each screen in your app and you can

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:02.700
each screen in your app and you can
 

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.430
each screen in your app and you can
extend this to you know your entire app

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440
extend this to you know your entire app
 

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.350

interaction design can boil or can can
 

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:18.410
interaction design can boil or can can
operate along a spectrum of of how close

operate along a spectrum of of how close
 

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.440

it is to the the primary version of the
 

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:24.920
it is to the the primary version of the
app so for example you know if I have an

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:24.930
app so for example you know if I have an
 

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:27.080
app so for example you know if I have an
ad design you know for android 4.1 plot

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:27.090
ad design you know for android 4.1 plot
 

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.330
ad design you know for android 4.1 plot
and above and I have you know hollow

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:29.340
and above and I have you know hollow
 

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.880
and above and I have you know hollow
elements in there on earlier versions on

whatever you can make a choice of either

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:36.450
whatever you can make a choice of either
 

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.110
whatever you can make a choice of either
you know taking that holo design or

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120
you know taking that holo design or
 

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.670
you know taking that holo design or
you're completely custom design and and

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680
you're completely custom design and and
 

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:44.120
you're completely custom design and and
using it on that device or you can kind

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:44.130
using it on that device or you can kind
 

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:47.360
using it on that device or you can kind
of say whatever the device default is

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:47.370
of say whatever the device default is
 

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.370
of say whatever the device default is
for example for checkboxes on

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:49.380
for example for checkboxes on
 

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.960
for example for checkboxes on
gingerbread they were green instead of

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:50.970
gingerbread they were green instead of
 

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:54.260
gingerbread they were green instead of
blue and some devices back then it was

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:54.270
blue and some devices back then it was
 

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.540
blue and some devices back then it was
like blue red or whatever you can make

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:56.550
like blue red or whatever you can make
 

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.579
like blue red or whatever you can make
the choice that you know I should use

00:16:58.579 --> 00:16:58.589
the choice that you know I should use
 

00:16:58.589 --> 00:17:00.650
the choice that you know I should use
the device default or you could just

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:00.660
the device default or you could just
 

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.910
the device default or you could just
choose something in the middle

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920
choose something in the middle
 

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.270
choose something in the middle
so you know usually the the it's a

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280
so you know usually the the it's a
 

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.189
so you know usually the the it's a
little harder to make everything hollow

00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199
little harder to make everything hollow
 

00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:10.280
little harder to make everything hollow
back to Gingerbread and fry em it's very

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:10.290
back to Gingerbread and fry em it's very
 

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:13.100
back to Gingerbread and fry em it's very
very easy for developers to you know

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:13.110
very easy for developers to you know
 

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:16.340
very easy for developers to you know
just use the device default and then you

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:16.350
just use the device default and then you
 

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:17.840
just use the device default and then you
know this hybrid is kind of somewhere in

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:17.850
know this hybrid is kind of somewhere in
 

00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:20.990
know this hybrid is kind of somewhere in
the middle so the hybrid solution it's

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.000
the middle so the hybrid solution it's
 

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.280
the middle so the hybrid solution it's
it's you have to be kind of careful

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:22.290
it's you have to be kind of careful
 

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.169
it's you have to be kind of careful
about it it can still really work and

00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:24.179
about it it can still really work and
 

00:17:24.179 --> 00:17:25.789
about it it can still really work and
we'll show you guys in the screenshots

00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799
we'll show you guys in the screenshots
 

00:17:25.799 --> 00:17:28.039
we'll show you guys in the screenshots
coming up that you know hybrid UI is

00:17:28.039 --> 00:17:28.049
coming up that you know hybrid UI is
 

00:17:28.049 --> 00:17:29.780
coming up that you know hybrid UI is
where some components are Hollow and

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:29.790
where some components are Hollow and
 

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.450
where some components are Hollow and
some components are using the device

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:32.460
some components are using the device
 

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:37.010
some components are using the device
default styling they can work so we'll

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.020
default styling they can work so we'll
 

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.570
default styling they can work so we'll
show a couple of examples of those but

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:38.580
show a couple of examples of those but
 

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.299
show a couple of examples of those but
this is really how we see this kind of

00:17:40.299 --> 00:17:40.309
this is really how we see this kind of
 

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:43.190
this is really how we see this kind of
the way you you decide on the back of a

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200
the way you you decide on the back of a
 

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.990
the way you you decide on the back of a
paddleboat strategy right you you kind

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000
paddleboat strategy right you you kind
 

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.690
paddleboat strategy right you you kind
of pics somewhere along the spectrum and

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:46.700
of pics somewhere along the spectrum and
 

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.620
of pics somewhere along the spectrum and
depending on where you choose now you

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:48.630
depending on where you choose now you
 

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:49.789
depending on where you choose now you
need to work with your developers on

00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:49.799
need to work with your developers on
 

00:17:49.799 --> 00:17:51.560
need to work with your developers on
this but depending on where you choose

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:51.570
this but depending on where you choose
 

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.299
this but depending on where you choose
that'll you know change the amount of

00:17:53.299 --> 00:17:53.309
that'll you know change the amount of
 

00:17:53.309 --> 00:17:55.610
that'll you know change the amount of
effort involved for developers and

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:55.620
effort involved for developers and
 

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.770
effort involved for developers and
certainly it'll it'll change the final

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:57.780
certainly it'll it'll change the final
 

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.720
certainly it'll it'll change the final
outcome but just be aware that you know

00:17:59.720 --> 00:17:59.730
outcome but just be aware that you know
 

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.730
outcome but just be aware that you know
you know these are the different options

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:01.740
you know these are the different options
 

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.460
you know these are the different options
and there's really no correct choice i'd

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:04.470
and there's really no correct choice i'd
 

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.830
and there's really no correct choice i'd
say like i said before you can do it

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840
say like i said before you can do it
 

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.780
say like i said before you can do it
correctly you can do it right using any

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:08.790
correctly you can do it right using any
 

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.120
correctly you can do it right using any
one of these different options it's

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:11.130
one of these different options it's
 

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.230
one of these different options it's
really up to you to make sure that it

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240
really up to you to make sure that it
 

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.789
really up to you to make sure that it
just works well it's really just a

00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799
just works well it's really just a
 

00:18:13.799 --> 00:18:14.630
just works well it's really just a
trade-off between these different

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640
trade-off between these different
 

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.100
trade-off between these different
options like there's more effort

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:16.110
options like there's more effort
 

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:17.240
options like there's more effort
involved on the left side of the

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:17.250
involved on the left side of the
 

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.760
involved on the left side of the
spectrum but you'll have a more

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:19.770
spectrum but you'll have a more
 

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.220
spectrum but you'll have a more
consistent look on the right side it can

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:22.230
consistent look on the right side it can
 

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.870
consistent look on the right side it can
still work as will show you in the

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880
still work as will show you in the
 

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.180
still work as will show you in the
screenshots shortly so a bit more effort

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:26.190
screenshots shortly so a bit more effort
 

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.430
screenshots shortly so a bit more effort
there's some tools LOL absolutely and

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440
there's some tools LOL absolutely and
 

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.600
there's some tools LOL absolutely and
we'll talk about the tools out there

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:29.610
we'll talk about the tools out there
 

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.820
we'll talk about the tools out there
that are more relevant to developers and

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:31.830
that are more relevant to developers and
 

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.430
that are more relevant to developers and
designers but i'm still definitely their

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440
designers but i'm still definitely their
 

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.520
designers but i'm still definitely their
stuff out there to help so having said

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:37.530

that hollowly a lot of people ask us new
is hollow for android 4.0 and above

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320
is hollow for android 4.0 and above
 

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.409
is hollow for android 4.0 and above
right i mean like should I even try to

00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:45.419
right i mean like should I even try to
 

00:18:45.419 --> 00:18:46.880
right i mean like should I even try to
use hollow and earlier versions of the

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:46.890
use hollow and earlier versions of the
 

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:49.280
use hollow and earlier versions of the
platform and our answer is yes I mean

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:49.290
platform and our answer is yes I mean
 

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.409
platform and our answer is yes I mean
hollow is not designed just for the

00:18:51.409 --> 00:18:51.419
hollow is not designed just for the
 

00:18:51.419 --> 00:18:53.900
hollow is not designed just for the
latest devices out there hollows really

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:53.910
latest devices out there hollows really
 

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:55.909
latest devices out there hollows really
is designed for all people for all

00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919

00:19:00.419 --> 00:19:03.169
language for human-computer interaction
not just human android 4.0 plus

00:19:03.169 --> 00:19:03.179
not just human android 4.0 plus
 

00:19:03.179 --> 00:19:05.990
not just human android 4.0 plus
interaction you know it can work

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000
interaction you know it can work
 

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.320

everywhere

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:07.330
everywhere
 

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.270

it obviously takes some effort to make

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280
it obviously takes some effort to make
 

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.190
it obviously takes some effort to make
it work but again as a designer you need

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200
it work but again as a designer you need
 

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.530
it work but again as a designer you need
to think of it less as the styling of

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:13.540
to think of it less as the styling of
 

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.690
to think of it less as the styling of
Android 4.0 and really as the identity

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:15.700
Android 4.0 and really as the identity
 

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.600
Android 4.0 and really as the identity
of Android so that's an important point

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:18.610
of Android so that's an important point
 

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:20.580
of Android so that's an important point
to make another is that you know the

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:20.590
to make another is that you know the
 

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:22.680
to make another is that you know the
core experience across all platforms

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:22.690
core experience across all platforms
 

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:24.300
core experience across all platforms
should really be consistent you

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:24.310
should really be consistent you
 

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:25.740
should really be consistent you
shouldn't really have to design an

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:25.750
shouldn't really have to design an
 

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:29.850
shouldn't really have to design an

like the action bar you know those

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.240
like the action bar you know those
 

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.360
like the action bar you know those
should be visible and persistent across

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:36.370
should be visible and persistent across
 

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:38.190
should be visible and persistent across

switch into a completely different UI on
 

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.750
switch into a completely different UI on
earlier versions just because there's no

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:42.760
earlier versions just because there's no
 

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.520
earlier versions just because there's no
built-in framework component and again

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:44.530
built-in framework component and again
 

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.620
built-in framework component and again
we'll talk about them so things like

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:46.630
we'll talk about them so things like
 

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:48.630
we'll talk about them so things like
layouts of the core layouts the

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640
layouts of the core layouts the
 

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.270
layouts of the core layouts the
navigation like swiping between tabs and

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280
navigation like swiping between tabs and
 

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.400
navigation like swiping between tabs and
the core interactions like the the basic

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:53.410
the core interactions like the the basic
 

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:56.280
the core interactions like the the basic
way you you know you choose you know

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:56.290
way you you know you choose you know
 

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.560
way you you know you choose you know
choose a contact for example those

00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:58.570
choose a contact for example those
 

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:00.000
choose a contact for example those
should really behave the same across

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.010
should really behave the same across
 

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:04.230
should really behave the same across
different OS versions and I think that

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240
different OS versions and I think that
 

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.390
different OS versions and I think that
you know for for design this is really

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400
you know for for design this is really
 

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.570
you know for for design this is really
the last point is more about developers

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:08.580
the last point is more about developers
 

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.790
the last point is more about developers
but you know be opportunistic beyond the

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:11.800
but you know be opportunistic beyond the
 

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.280
but you know be opportunistic beyond the
core experience the core navigation look

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:14.290
core experience the core navigation look
 

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:15.900
core experience the core navigation look
really the core feel of the app you know

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:15.910
really the core feel of the app you know
 

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:18.030
really the core feel of the app you know
like the individual checkboxes and the

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:18.040
like the individual checkboxes and the
 

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.610
like the individual checkboxes and the
spinners and things like that you know

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:20.620
spinners and things like that you know
 

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.410
spinners and things like that you know
be opportunistic about it make sure that

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:22.420
be opportunistic about it make sure that
 

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.900
be opportunistic about it make sure that
nothing looks really bad obviously but

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:24.910
nothing looks really bad obviously but
 

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:26.580
nothing looks really bad obviously but
the opportunistic and don't you know put

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:26.590
the opportunistic and don't you know put
 

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:28.590
the opportunistic and don't you know put
yourself in the position where you must

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:28.600
yourself in the position where you must
 

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.840
yourself in the position where you must
have everything pixel perfect because

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:30.850
have everything pixel perfect because
 

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:32.700
have everything pixel perfect because
that's just a losing battle it's going

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:32.710
that's just a losing battle it's going
 

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:33.900
that's just a losing battle it's going
to take too much time and you're going

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:33.910
to take too much time and you're going
 

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:36.600
to take too much time and you're going
to kind of lose focus from what's really

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:36.610
to kind of lose focus from what's really
 

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.100
to kind of lose focus from what's really
important that is the core experience at

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:38.110
important that is the core experience at
 

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:42.180
important that is the core experience at
the app so before we go on any other

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:42.190
the app so before we go on any other
 

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:44.400
the app so before we go on any other
points guys but um

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:44.410
points guys but um
 

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:48.030
points guys but um
III know okay let's go salad let's go

let's do it another thing to mention

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:49.990
let's do it another thing to mention
 

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:52.980
let's do it another thing to mention
this is more on the tactical side so one

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:52.990
this is more on the tactical side so one
 

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:54.180
this is more on the tactical side so one
of the big differences and you'll see

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:54.190
of the big differences and you'll see
 

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.220
of the big differences and you'll see
this in screenshots between android 4.0

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:56.230
this in screenshots between android 4.0
 

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:59.370
this in screenshots between android 4.0
android 2.3 and such is the typography

00:20:59.370 --> 00:20:59.380
android 2.3 and such is the typography
 

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.250
android 2.3 and such is the typography
is the font right so roboto is the

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:02.260
is the font right so roboto is the
 

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.490
is the font right so roboto is the
default on android 4.1 higher and droid

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:05.500
default on android 4.1 higher and droid
 

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.490
default on android 4.1 higher and droid
sans was the default everywhere else so

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:08.500
sans was the default everywhere else so
 

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.990
sans was the default everywhere else so
this is one area where you really

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000
this is one area where you really
 

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.150
this is one area where you really
shouldn't try to just take Roboto and

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:12.160
shouldn't try to just take Roboto and
 

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.470
shouldn't try to just take Roboto and
use it everywhere on Android 2.3 the

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480
use it everywhere on Android 2.3 the
 

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.540
use it everywhere on Android 2.3 the
reason being that you know users are

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:18.550
reason being that you know users are
 

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.580
reason being that you know users are
really accustomed to see like their eyes

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:20.590
really accustomed to see like their eyes
 

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:23.430
really accustomed to see like their eyes
almost expect to read text in a certain

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:23.440
almost expect to read text in a certain
 

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.770
almost expect to read text in a certain
way on on their device and so you should

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:25.780
way on on their device and so you should
 

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.450
way on on their device and so you should
really just use the system default font

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:27.460
really just use the system default font
 

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.220
really just use the system default font
the good thing is that for designers you

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:29.230
the good thing is that for designers you
 

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:30.840
the good thing is that for designers you
know when you're planning out the the

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:30.850
know when you're planning out the the
 

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:33.600
know when you're planning out the the
widths of your your elements and things

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:33.610
widths of your your elements and things
 

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:35.460
widths of your your elements and things
you have to think obviously you know how

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:35.470
you have to think obviously you know how
 

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:38.760
you have to think obviously you know how
many characters will fit in this line or

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:38.770
many characters will fit in this line or
 

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:40.410
many characters will fit in this line or
in this UI widget and the good thing is

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:40.420
in this UI widget and the good thing is
 

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.090
in this UI widget and the good thing is
that Roboto Android Santa's or metrics

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:42.100
that Roboto Android Santa's or metrics
 

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.070
that Roboto Android Santa's or metrics
compatible meaning that if you take the

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080
compatible meaning that if you take the
 

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.900
compatible meaning that if you take the
same piece of text in Roboto Android

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:45.910
same piece of text in Roboto Android
 

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:48.240
same piece of text in Roboto Android
sand on android 2.3 device an Android

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:48.250
sand on android 2.3 device an Android
 

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.580
sand on android 2.3 device an Android
4.2 device you'll notice that there

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:50.590
4.2 device you'll notice that there
 

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:52.860
4.2 device you'll notice that there
they're pretty much the same with so

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:52.870
they're pretty much the same with so
 

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:54.240
they're pretty much the same with so
what's more important here is like

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:54.250
what's more important here is like
 

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:56.790
what's more important here is like
things like translations where you know

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:56.800
things like translations where you know
 

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.040
things like translations where you know
for example the German version or the

00:21:59.040 --> 00:21:59.050
for example the German version or the
 

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.020
for example the German version or the
German strings for something will cause

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:01.030
German strings for something will cause
 

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:03.420
German strings for something will cause
things to be really really wide that's

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:03.430
things to be really really wide that's
 

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.670
things to be really really wide that's
more important to think about then like

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:05.680
more important to think about then like
 

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.260
more important to think about then like
just saying all I need to choose the

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:07.270
just saying all I need to choose the
 

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.510
just saying all I need to choose the
right font here so be be more aware of

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520
right font here so be be more aware of
 

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.130
right font here so be be more aware of
that then just like the difference

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:11.140
that then just like the difference
 

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.140
that then just like the difference
between droid sans Roboto in English for

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:13.150
between droid sans Roboto in English for
 

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:17.340
between droid sans Roboto in English for
example and then also this is this is

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:17.350
example and then also this is this is
 

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:19.770
example and then also this is this is
again more for tactics but in your

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:19.780
again more for tactics but in your
 

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:21.510
again more for tactics but in your
process it's really important for

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520
process it's really important for
 

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.810
process it's really important for
designers to participate in the device

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:24.820
designers to participate in the device
 

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.700
designers to participate in the device
testing process so you know usually

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:26.710
testing process so you know usually
 

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.490
testing process so you know usually
you'll have you know a QA team or maybe

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:29.500
you'll have you know a QA team or maybe
 

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.900
you'll have you know a QA team or maybe
a developer that has a whole bunch of

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:30.910
a developer that has a whole bunch of
 

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:33.150
a developer that has a whole bunch of
devices and they're kind of you know

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:33.160
devices and they're kind of you know
 

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.420
devices and they're kind of you know
testing the apks on all those devices

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:36.430
testing the apks on all those devices
 

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:38.310
testing the apks on all those devices
designers should really participate

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320
designers should really participate
 

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.900
designers should really participate
because you know sometimes designers in

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:39.910
because you know sometimes designers in
 

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:41.910
because you know sometimes designers in
a team are some of the most kind of

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:41.920
a team are some of the most kind of
 

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.980
a team are some of the most kind of
visually sensitive folks so they'll be

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:43.990
visually sensitive folks so they'll be
 

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:46.680
visually sensitive folks so they'll be
able to you know pick out what the what

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:46.690
able to you know pick out what the what
 

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:48.210
able to you know pick out what the what
the in thick with the little quirks are

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:48.220
the in thick with the little quirks are
 

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.700
the in thick with the little quirks are
and so as a designer you should try to

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:50.710
and so as a designer you should try to
 

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:52.890
and so as a designer you should try to
you know introduce yourself into the QA

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:52.900
you know introduce yourself into the QA
 

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.630
you know introduce yourself into the QA
process and not obviously full time but

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:55.640
process and not obviously full time but
 

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.800
process and not obviously full time but
then some time making sure that you're

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:56.810
then some time making sure that you're
 

00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:00.460
then some time making sure that you're
testing you know the output on earlier

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:00.470
testing you know the output on earlier
 

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:02.230
testing you know the output on earlier
versions of the platform as well as

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240
versions of the platform as well as
 

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.460
versions of the platform as well as
different devices you just get a feel

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:03.470
different devices you just get a feel
 

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:05.260
different devices you just get a feel
for it looks like and there's a bunch of

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:05.270
for it looks like and there's a bunch of
 

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:06.730
for it looks like and there's a bunch of
continuous integration tools that you

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:06.740
continuous integration tools that you
 

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:09.730
