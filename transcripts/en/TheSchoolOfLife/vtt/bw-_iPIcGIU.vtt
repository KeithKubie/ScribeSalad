00:00:01.042 --> 00:00:08.372
The world is sick for a surprisingly modest-sounding
reason: we don’t understand love – and

00:00:08.372 --> 00:00:13.852
yet we are rather convinced that we do. We
talk a lot of love of course, but generally

00:00:13.852 --> 00:00:38.582
in terms of a dizzying rapture lasting a few
months focused on someone’s beauty, intelligence

00:00:38.582 --> 00:00:48.392
and strength. The most convincing discussion
of love in the West came from Jesus of Nazareth,

00:00:48.392 --> 00:00:58.472
which has been unfortunate, given how easy
it is to overlook everything he had to say

00:00:58.472 --> 00:01:05.432
once you don’t ‘believe’. We might require
a new philosophy of love, in effect, a powerful

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:38.792
secular religion of love. Here would be seven
possible ingredients in

00:01:38.792 --> 00:01:57.172
Love redefined: CHARITY Love means, above
anything else, benevolence and gentleness

00:01:57.172 --> 00:02:04.862
towards what is failed, disgraced, broken,
unappealing, angry and foul in other people

00:02:04.862 --> 00:02:11.792
and in ourselves. Love isn’t about an admiration
for strength, it’s about directing sympathy

00:02:11.792 --> 00:02:17.471
in a most unexpected direction: at what is
messed up, lost and in pieces, and at what

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:24.062
we might hate, resent and be frightened of.
Anyone can express an interest in perfection,

00:02:24.062 --> 00:02:30.472
to love is to devote an active charity towards
the mistakes and aberrations. One day, we

00:02:30.472 --> 00:02:36.511
will all require the charity of others. In
one way or another, we’ll be on our knees

00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:42.322
– and we will need people to look past our
evident failings in a tender search for our

00:02:42.322 --> 00:02:50.381
deeply hidden merits. IMAGINATION To love
with imagination is to look beneath the surface

00:02:50.381 --> 00:02:56.801
– where there may be rage, cynicism, brittleness
or transgression – and to picture the suffering

00:02:56.801 --> 00:03:02.301
and pain that got a person to this place.
To love with imagination is to fill in the

00:03:02.301 --> 00:03:08.101
better reasons why others are behaving as
they do. Imaginative love knows that we are

00:03:08.101 --> 00:03:15.471
all, somewhere, desperate: it seeks out that
desperation and treats it with sorrowful gentleness.

00:03:15.471 --> 00:03:20.732
KINDNESS There are so many fighters for social
justice, so many people determined to make

00:03:20.732 --> 00:03:25.612
a better world. They denounce their enemies,
and feel certain of their cause, but along

00:03:25.612 --> 00:03:32.551
the way, they have a fateful habit of forgetting
to be kind. In their denunciations of the

00:03:32.551 --> 00:03:39.081
evils of others, there is precious little
mercy, humility, tenderness or grace. It is

00:03:39.081 --> 00:03:44.721
not enough to be right or just, to be kind
is to know that everyone, even sinners, and

00:03:44.721 --> 00:03:51.202
in a way, especially sinners, deserve ongoing
sympathy and mercy. It is never simply because

00:03:51.202 --> 00:03:57.481
someone is wrong that we have any right to
cease showing them the greatest kindness.

00:03:57.481 --> 00:04:03.081
FORGIVENESS To forgive is to know that we
are, in our own way, as guilty as the next

00:04:03.081 --> 00:04:09.201
person. Given what we all are, we have no
option but to cut each other slack. Of course

00:04:09.201 --> 00:04:14.292
we have failed and been hasty and less than
admirable. But that is no reason forever to

00:04:14.292 --> 00:04:19.922
withhold love. We learn to forgive when we
are no longer self-righteous, that is, when

00:04:19.922 --> 00:04:27.582
we’re brave enough to fathom the darker
sections of our own hearts. LOYALTY To love

00:04:27.582 --> 00:04:32.832
means being loyal to people (this could be
ourselves) even though the crowd no longer

00:04:32.832 --> 00:04:39.832
agrees. Outside the mob may be jeering, but
we continue on the same side, with steadfastness

00:04:39.832 --> 00:04:47.681
and an unbudgeable resilient faith. GENEROSITY
Love overflows. It isn’t about loving just

00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:52.792
one person, it encompasses the love of someone
you have just met, of strangers in another

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:58.102
land, of the earth, of plants, weevils, house
bats and a moth by the window who might be

00:04:58.102 --> 00:05:05.771
dead by nightfall. PATIENCE We want others
to meet our hopes right now. But true love

00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:10.412
means giving people the time to mature and
develop; to go wrong, to wander in another

00:05:10.412 --> 00:05:15.352
direction, and not to shout at them but to
give them every chance to grow, at their own

00:05:15.352 --> 00:05:21.552
pace, towards their better selves. If we can
believe wholeheartedly in some of the above,

00:05:21.552 --> 00:05:26.832
it won’t matter who we vote for or what
our cause is, we can count as part of what

00:05:26.832 --> 00:05:32.472
is helping. We should be almost done with
Romantic love by now. We should be setting

00:05:32.472 --> 00:05:37.192
our sights on the challenge of this sort of
love. Yet it’s not surprising if we’re

00:05:37.192 --> 00:05:42.852
still only at the beginning, we’re just
starting on the path to being human.

00:05:44.852 --> 00:05:54.452
Love is a skill that we can learn.  Our Relationships book calmly guides us with calm and charm through the key issues of

00:05:54.452 --> 00:06:04.052
relationships to ensure that success in love need not be a matter of good luck.  for more click the link now.
