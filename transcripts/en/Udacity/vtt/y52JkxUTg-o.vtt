00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:01.791
So the answer here is that what we're going to want to do

00:00:01.791 --> 00:00:03.749
is look at the least significant bit.

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:07.845
That means we'll take the bit representation of i and end it with the value 1,

00:00:07.845 --> 00:00:11.055
which is only going to leave us with the value of the least significant bit.

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:14.494
And then we're going to test whether that bit is 0 or 1.

00:00:14.494 --> 00:00:16.930
And we only want to keep the ones that are 0.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.598
We only want this to return true if that least significant bit is 0.
