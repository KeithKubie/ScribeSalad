00:00:00.485 --> 00:00:03.608
- [Instructor] We're told
that point P was rotated

00:00:03.608 --> 00:00:07.196
about the origin (0,0) by 60 degrees.

00:00:07.196 --> 00:00:10.400
Which point is the image of P?

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.152
Pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:13.152 --> 00:00:14.371
All right, now let's think about it.

00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:16.054
This is point P.

00:00:16.054 --> 00:00:18.875
It's being rotated around the origin

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:21.940
(0,0) by 60 degrees.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.785
So if originally point
P is right over here

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:28.250
and we're rotating by positive 60 degrees,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.237
so that means we go counter
clockwise by 60 degrees.

00:00:33.237 --> 00:00:37.080
So this looks like about
60 degrees right over here.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.123
One way to think about 60 degrees,

00:00:39.123 --> 00:00:42.676
is that that's 1/3 of 180 degrees.

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:45.358
So does this look like 1/3 of 180 degrees?

00:00:45.358 --> 00:00:48.388
Remember, 180 degrees would
be almost a full line.

00:00:48.388 --> 00:00:52.881
So that indeed does look
like 1/3 of 180 degrees,

00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:55.714
60 degrees, it gets us to point C.

00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.326
And it looks like it's the same distance

00:00:58.326 --> 00:00:59.510
from the origin.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.447
We have just rotated by 60 degrees.

00:01:02.447 --> 00:01:06.743
Point D looks like it's more
than 60 degree rotation,

00:01:06.743 --> 00:01:09.239
so I won't go with that one.

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:12.406
All right, let's do one more of these.

00:01:14.185 --> 00:01:18.659
So we're told point P was
rotated by negative 90 degrees.

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.292
The center of rotation is indicated.

00:01:20.292 --> 00:01:22.022
Which point is the image of P?

00:01:22.022 --> 00:01:23.346
So once again, pause this video

00:01:23.346 --> 00:01:24.684
and try to think about it.

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:26.609
All right, so we have
our center of rotation,

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:27.943
this is our point P,

00:01:27.943 --> 00:01:30.973
and we're rotating by negative 90 degrees.

00:01:30.973 --> 00:01:33.202
So this means we are going clockwise.

00:01:33.202 --> 00:01:34.688
So we're going in that direction.

00:01:34.688 --> 00:01:36.017
And 90 degrees is easy to spot.

00:01:36.017 --> 00:01:37.558
It's a right angle.

00:01:37.558 --> 00:01:39.599
And so it would look like
that and it looks like

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.432
it is getting us right to point A.

00:01:43.473 --> 00:01:46.798
So this is a negative 90 degree
rotation right over here.

00:01:46.798 --> 00:01:48.465
Gets us to point A.
