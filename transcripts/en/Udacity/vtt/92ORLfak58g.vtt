00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.550
Believe it or not, we've just finished our first order

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.450
of the Critical Rendering Path. Let's do a quick review.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.880
&gt;&gt; Hold on. What about JavaScript?

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.610
&gt;&gt; Okay. Fair enough So, JavaScript can manipulate both the DOM and

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.475
the CSS object model. But otherwise, the Render process is the same.

00:00:15.475 --> 00:00:19.280
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. I see So, what kind of performance

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.950
optimization should I keep in mind when I'm using JavaScript?

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.820
&gt;&gt; That's a great question. And, we'll get into

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.840
a lot of details on how to optimize JavaScript

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.610
in one of the future lessons. But before

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.090
we get to that, let's do a quick review.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.890
&gt;&gt; Try summarizing what we've learned so far

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.160
about the first path through the Critical Rendering Path.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.270
You don't need to write an essay. Just list

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.000
the steps in order that they happen, and post

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.510
your answers to the forum, under the post called,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.340
Steps to Render a Page. Or, if you don't

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.520
have access to the forms right now, find a

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.930
friend and explain the Critical Rendering Path to them.
