1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.870
The thing with the proud boys is the ruling elite are freedom men. You know,

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.440
it is a huge soy boy movement coming down at gun and put down a pipe, right?

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.860
I mean soy everywhere. If anybody's listening right now,

5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.550
everybody that's listening right now, soy is bad for you. It's not good.

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.620
It is very bad. It's processed nonsense and estrogen. Oh yes. Well, it,

7
00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:26.320
it uh, activates the phytoestrogens. No,

8
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.610
it has Actify phyto estrogens that, uh,

9
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.230
attacked the endocrine endocrine gland system.

10
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.730
Now when you look at the endocrine gland system of people in the spiritual

11
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:36.001
world,

12
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:40.110
endocrine gland system is the physical manifestation of the so called shockers

13
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.140
right now at the heart shock where what we have is called the thymus gland and

14
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:49.380
the diamonds. Glenn is the one that controls your sexual maturity.

15
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.360
And when you have an endocrine gland disruptor,

16
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.180
your sexual maturity is affected.

17
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.980
So a man who would ordinarily, like women now likes,

18
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.263
you see what I'm saying?

19
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.810
But wouldn't you have to have massive quantities of soy for that take place?

20
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.870
That's that subjective based upon your biological structure.

21
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.740
I always think of it as more as like a fun thing to say. I don't think you know,

22
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.470
well, here's a total fool. You turn into a bitch. Well, here's the thing,

23
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.400
you can't go in a grocery store and find something that doesn't have soy.

24
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.910
When you go look at your cheeses or your crackers, it wasn't say soy lecithin,

25
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.500
soy and everything. So yeah, you were right. Uh,

26
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.250
they use it as phyllo for some meats. So the whole vegan movement, right?

27
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.440
You go when you go get your, your, your, your burger burger. Yeah. Right? Uh,

28
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.280
a lot of these burgers are soy-based. A lot of them are plant-based for sure.

29
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.700
Plant-based oils, right? But so it's not good for you. Right?

30
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.800
And then you also look at the links between soy and cancer,

31
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:50.880
but that's a whole nother story.

32
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.560
But when you have something that's disrupting your so-called chorus,

33
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.270
you can see how you can start affecting an entire population of people, right?

34
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.070
You start affecting their development at an early age. And then, you know,

35
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.360
you got these men who are, uh, acting like women who can't even, you know,

36
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.720
control their wives. You got some men out here that uh,

37
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.720
let another man sleep with their girlfriend. Right.

38
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.160
And I don't know about her here. Well, you're saying out here,

39
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.380
well what I say out here, I mean it's everywhere,

40
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.690
but just people just kinky in the weird shit.

41
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.610
Well no, you don't think so? No. Wait, what do you think it is?

42
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.650
I think it's pushed. I think a [inaudible] is highly pushed. Yeah. By who?

43
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.890
The ruling elite ruling class. I want to say really,

44
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.170
because they're not elite to sit around and go, you know what we need to do?

45
00:02:43.171 --> 00:02:47.760
We need to push the Boucher. Well, when you look at, uh, the degradation of, uh,

46
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.120
Russia, right? Um, before the Bolshevik revolution,

47
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.040
what they do is they come in first, uh, with alcohol, right?

48
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.040
So they purchase your hops and your barley and he produced alcohol.

49
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.340
Then what they do is they sell the alcohol to the farmer on credit.

50
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.320
Cause he ain't got no money. Right. Cause he'd been drunk.

51
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:08.440
He hasn't been producing a crop. Psyche should, he falls into credit.

52
00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:11.500
He falls into debt when he falls into the debt. He's now a slave to the land.

53
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:15.340
He wants old now and I can sell, uh,

54
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.210
whatever I want to this population or give this population whatever I want

55
00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:21.100
because they are now technically my sleeve.

56
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.270
But in order to rule a nation of people,

57
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.410
you have to destroy morality. You have to destroy integrity.

58
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.020
So you feed them drugs, alcohol and sex,

59
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.020
and then tear apart the family.

60
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.810
But do you think that that's just a natural progression of people's slovenly

61
00:03:41.181 --> 00:03:44.870
instincts or do you think that some sort of a grand plan will have a slovenly

62
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.550
instinct? Some people do. Yeah.

63
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.030
I think some people are lazy and some people are weak and some people are greedy

64
00:03:50.031 --> 00:03:54.440
and some people just, they lean towards,

65
00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.280
they lean towards just pleasure without sacrifice and discipline because it's

66
00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:03.650
easy and they just lay in bed and jerk off.

67
00:04:03.651 --> 00:04:04.700
I don't think anybody's telling them,

68
00:04:04.701 --> 00:04:08.360
I don't think there's any sinister government manipulating their strings that

69
00:04:08.361 --> 00:04:12.110
makes them watch porn all day. I think they just, yeah, it actually, you know,

70
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.440
Instagram is a gateway to porn. Instagram.

71
00:04:15.441 --> 00:04:19.340
You can't go on Instagram without looking at some booty, right? Yeah.

72
00:04:19.341 --> 00:04:24.341
But it's also a gateway to sunsets and people's kids and muscle cars and come,

73
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.030
Joe, cool shit. By going on Instagram, it has sunset.

74
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.760
People are going to Instagram and look at booty. There's a lot of that.

75
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.650
No dog yoga community has went from, Hey,

76
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.480
check out my Bakasana to check out my backside pants.

77
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.350
Right. A lot of yoga pants, pics, booty, booty, booty.

78
00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:50.150
Just booty alone is an industry. It is a giant industry. Instagram. Yeah.

79
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.070
So what happens is you wake up in the morning, you check your notifications,

80
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.480
then your homie tags you. Oh, look at this chick DePaul right now.

81
00:04:59.481 --> 00:05:01.820
You have an erection. What's the first thing you do? You like, ah,

82
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.690
let me go to my browser, open an incognito browser and hit PornHub. Boom.

83
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.800
Now you outta here. Right now your day's done. You just depleted your energy.

84
00:05:09.801 --> 00:05:12.320
Right? And this coming out in my book where I talk about, you know,

85
00:05:12.321 --> 00:05:14.570
why you sent our golf and all that stuff, but you right,

86
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.460
that you shouldn't jerk off. Yeah. Yeah. Never a well, there's a calculation.

87
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.700
You have a jerk-off algorithm yet is a jerk off algorithm. Uh,

88
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.390
it's created by the tower, the tower, sta sexology.

89
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.230
And I think it's your age times to know your age divided by two times 100.

90
00:05:35.961 --> 00:05:38.810
I forget what it is. It's in my book. I can't remember it. Uh,

91
00:05:38.811 --> 00:05:42.080
but I got it from the Tao. Right. Which is why I don't have it memorized.

92
00:05:42.081 --> 00:05:46.730
Time point. It's age times 0.2 things, age times, 0.2. Um,

93
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.860
and then it'll tell you how many days. Right? So at my age, I'm 38 now my age,

94
00:05:51.861 --> 00:05:56.720
it's about seven and a half days between ejaculation to mean to maintain who I

95
00:05:56.721 --> 00:06:00.290
am. Really? Yeah. And damn. Yes.

96
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.220
So a main strength is his balls, right? Right.

97
00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.220
Every time you deplete yourself, you're not the same man anymore.

98
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:10.880
You lose your superpowers. Now,

99
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.950
when you lose your superpowers to some, you know, IgG model,

100
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.630
it's not even worthy.

101
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.670
Your orgasm doesn't feel the same as a natural interaction with a woman,

102
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.580
right. You know what I mean? True. So you're, you're wasting your superpower on,

103
00:06:26.581 --> 00:06:29.000
on, on like a fictional fantasy,

104
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.060
so you're wasting a percentage of your vital energy, your,

105
00:06:33.061 --> 00:06:37.040
your vital energy as well as the proteins and minerals and zinc and magnesium

106
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:39.710
and all that stuff that you know is lost. Yeah,

107
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.770
I think it's equivalent to like two New York strip steaks, eggs,

108
00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:46.910
oranges and apples or something like that. Oh yes. A lot of vitamins.

109
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.570
This is why I have a woman on the size of the loads you shoot though. Know? Oh,

110
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.020
ladies should swallow. Whoa. Jesus ladies. I'm sorry.

111
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.220
That's why you should ingest it.

112
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.590
If the man is healthy because it's a, it's a full meal. It's a full meal.

113
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.860
It's a full meal of nutrients that a man loses.

114
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.570
There's a vial available that way. I wonder if anyone has done studies.

115
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.410
I bet they have a bet people have done like nutrition slash load studies.

116
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.840
Probably a startup out there like trying to do this right now.

117
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.010
Calculate it into an app.

118
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.290
<v 1>Where's this conversation going now? What are we talking about?</v>

119
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.760
Manipulating you, turning you into a soy boy? [inaudible] it's you,

120
00:07:35.761 --> 00:07:37.530
you think does actual this, this is where we differ.

121
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.080
You think there's actual manipulation taking place?

122
00:07:40.081 --> 00:07:45.081
I think it's just natural instincts and then I think that people see it around

123
00:07:45.151 --> 00:07:48.810
them and then they cater to those natural instincts and then they support those

124
00:07:48.811 --> 00:07:49.680
natural instincts.

125
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.240
But I think people have a natural instinct to be undisciplined and lazy and just

126
00:07:54.241 --> 00:07:56.550
gratuitous and you know,

127
00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.960
dive into pleasure before sacrifice and commitment.

128
00:08:00.961 --> 00:08:04.780
And so we make an excuses for not making excuses. I think it's a, uh,

129
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.100
also the softness of the world we live in. Oh yeah. I mean,

130
00:08:08.101 --> 00:08:12.270
we live in this incredibly easy to get buy in world, right? You know,

131
00:08:12.271 --> 00:08:14.310
where the poor people are fat. Yeah.

132
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.320
There's never been a time in history where poor people are fat. Yeah. Yeah.

133
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:22.470
That, that comes down to the actual food so-called. It's certainly,

134
00:08:22.471 --> 00:08:25.680
that is certainly the food is garbage, but it's also that

135
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.500
there's this strange lack of discipline because it's not, it's not necessary.

136
00:08:31.501 --> 00:08:32.970
I have to do is just show up to your job,

137
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:36.600
put in the least amount of effort you can without getting fired.

138
00:08:36.601 --> 00:08:38.310
And you can exist. That didn't,

139
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:42.120
that didn't happen in the wild world when people are hunters and gatherers of

140
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.580
you didn't put 100% effort. If you didn't really struggle,

141
00:08:44.581 --> 00:08:47.430
you didn't make it and you weren't a benefit to the tribe and they kicked your

142
00:08:47.431 --> 00:08:49.980
ass out and you got eaten. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

143
00:08:49.981 --> 00:08:50.850
That's how it's supposed to be.

144
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:55.080
<v 0>I do agree with that. Yeah. I do agree with that. Um, discipline is, is,</v>

145
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.850
you know what we have to demand from people, you know? Um,

146
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.440
but you know, your, your culture has to recognize the Boucherie and, and,

147
00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:08.970
and shun it and ban it and say like, Hey, you know, we don't want this here.

148
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.240
You know, um, uh,

149
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.570
porn is readily available on Twitter and watch it right in your feet.

150
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:16.650
Sometimes I'm scrolling my feet.

151
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:21.060
<v 1>I know that's a weird thing about Twitter, isn't it? That it's a giant platform,</v>

152
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:25.260
but they allow porn. Yeah. So, you know, when I had Jack on with Tim Poole,

153
00:09:25.261 --> 00:09:28.320
and I think Tim Poole didn't even know that porn was legal on it. Yeah.

154
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.550
I showed up. Yeah. I have found that a little bit of information,

155
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.010
I don't know how accurate pools Twitter use. No.

156
00:09:35.011 --> 00:09:39.150
On the ejaculation frequency recommended by the towels.

157
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:44.430
It said the most respected of the town theorist sun SIM Meow [inaudible] quoted

158
00:09:44.431 --> 00:09:48.990
above recommends ejaculations no more than once every 20 days for men over 50

159
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.150
cheeses and no more than once every hundred days for men over 60 would that I

160
00:09:54.151 --> 00:09:58.080
should be dead. Okay. And it has to do with it says no energy.

161
00:09:58.081 --> 00:09:59.070
How am I getting everything done?

162
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.270
You're getting age retarding hormones as you're about to ejaculate and then

163
00:10:03.271 --> 00:10:07.380
there's a level you want to keep before you ejaculate.

164
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.420
So balance what you're before you excrete the hormones. That's what it's saying.

165
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.680
So tantra quick, supposed to come and turn.

166
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:20.990
There's a level you can like optimize yourself in Jackie [inaudible],

167
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.830
they call it those people out of their fucking minds.

168
00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:24.760
I'm trying to get rid of this shit. I,

169
00:10:24.761 --> 00:10:29.520
I've always said that it helps you think because too many times with a man your,

170
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.400
your mind is clouded by sexual desire.

171
00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:36.240
If you could just jerk off and then you can think clearly. I always tell him,

172
00:10:36.241 --> 00:10:39.060
I said a bit about it. I say jerk off first, then think about it.

173
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.460
Like if you jerk off and then you want to call a girl,

174
00:10:41.461 --> 00:10:42.330
it's because you love her.

175
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.470
You're not just trying to fuck you actually like her as a human being.

176
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:47.520
You want to be around her.

177
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:49.830
You don't just be one to want to be around him for sex.

178
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.880
You actually really love her. Yeah. I think there's a level of discipline,

179
00:10:53.881 --> 00:10:57.990
right? So, um, yeah. If you're about to make that,

180
00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.870
that risky text message, yeah.

181
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.560
You might want to shoot your low and recessive. That's what I'm talking about.

182
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.450
What though? I'm going to watch him fucking documentary, put that phone down.

183
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.540
But that's Ford. Undisciplined man. Yes. Right.

184
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:18.320
<v 0>The man's going to say, no, I'm not going to send this thirst trap. You know,</v>

185
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.150
uh, this, this thirsty comment.

186
00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:24.230
I'm going to stay disciplined in who I am because in order to get the woman I

187
00:11:24.231 --> 00:11:26.750
have to stay away from the woman, you know,

188
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.420
in order to get the woman I have to stay away from the woman. Yeah. And, and,

189
00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:35.300
and, and, and keeping your, you're at your vital man.

190
00:11:35.301 --> 00:11:38.780
Energy for me keeps me like on edge.

191
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:42.440
Like I'm always like an animal, you know what I mean? Um,

192
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:46.280
because I want to release, you see what I'm saying? So, um,

193
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:51.500
what I do is I'll work up that energy and then channel it into work.

194
00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.040
Hmm. I'll just immediately

195
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.690
<v 1>pull my laptop out. Just bang out.</v>

196
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.610
Cause it's like that frustration here and then you just,

197
00:11:57.611 --> 00:12:00.040
you got to release it that way. Or I'll go running, I'll go work out.

198
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.650
But when I get around women, what a full sec.

199
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:11.050
Oh, I'm not the same as when I'm empty. Yes. And they see,

200
00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.500
you can see the difference in how they attracted you. You sit up different,

201
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:15.670
your chest pokes out.

202
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:20.800
When you're around other men you're like a little bit more edgy. Yeah, yeah.

203
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:25.030
You know what I mean? And you blow your load, you're kind of like chilled out.

204
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.390
Yay. Non competitive. Noncompetitive. Yes.

205
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.840
You hold on to that. Like fighters, you know how to fight the fight.

206
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.990
Mike Tyson never did that. Mike Tyson said, no,

207
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:40.030
I always lied to calm with much as possible fun and not distracted and just

208
00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.190
shoot his loads and a beat the fuck out of everybody,

209
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.330
but I think Mike had a lot of extra loads. I think if you had a guess,

210
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.850
it's level. He was just the ultra man. You know there was,

211
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.920
it was not a regular man.

212
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.670
A research published by the U S national library of medicine and national

213
00:12:57.671 --> 00:13:01.030
institutes of health found that after seven days of not ejaculate,

214
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:06.010
men's testosterone levels reached 145.7% of the baseline.

215
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:07.520
Damn.

216
00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:12.520
Interesting thing is that they didn't observe significant fluctuations from the

217
00:13:12.851 --> 00:13:15.130
baseline on days two through five.

218
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:20.080
The research also showed that the peak levels were at day seven. Yeah,

219
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:24.150
risks Dow, it's actually Dow by the way. It's T a. O. It's a,

220
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.750
it's you say it as Dow,

221
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.220
the Dow of G condo risks of too frequent ejaculation.

222
00:13:30.221 --> 00:13:34.180
When sex is performed with the recommended Dow frequency,

223
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:39.130
it becomes an inexhaustible source of energy, like a well that never runs dry.

224
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:40.810
However,

225
00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:45.190
when ejaculations frequency exceeds the capacity of the body to fully replenish,

226
00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:49.150
the seamen man could experience chronic fatigue, low resistance,

227
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.510
loss of sex drive, loss of focus, and irritability.

228
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:57.250
Longterm excessive ejaculation can cause chronic low zinc conditions,

229
00:13:57.251 --> 00:14:00.700
which can cause chronic fatigue, mental confusion,

230
00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.070
and significant loss of sexual drive.

231
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.320
But what have you with a freak like that girl will,

232
00:14:05.321 --> 00:14:08.470
Harris was talking about my friend will house was in here the other day and he

233
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.310
was saying any human he needs to meet these girls and explore, see, Oh,

234
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:16.930
it's also considered harmful to ejaculate when ill drunk or go Gorge with food.

235
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.170
Whoa. Here's the next, the next line. Oh which one?

236
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:24.700
Ejaculation control and discipline is not to be confused with a frequency of

237
00:14:24.701 --> 00:14:29.230
sex. There are significant physiologic fizz.

238
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.530
What's that word? Physiological. There's supposed to be a period there.

239
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:36.310
Oh physiologic. Again, therapeutic benefits to having sex.

240
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:41.760
Frequent sex intercourse maintains a man's interest in the acts as well as his

241
00:14:42.011 --> 00:14:46.930
capacity to continue indefinitely until his partner is fully satisfied.

242
00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.120
So they're saying fuck, but don't come. Yes,

243
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.010
those people out of that fucking mind. I come every time I fuck yo.

244
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.880
<v 0>I, I used to uh, try and get rid of this stuff. I used to fuck in three words.</v>

245
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.510
I used to fuck with girls heads like that. We would not come. Yeah. Real.

246
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:03.500
They start crying. Wow. I had a girl like straight down and break up cry.

247
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.070
I can't please you. Is it me? Is it? Nah. I'm just like, no.

248
00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:10.070
I just wanted you to be happy. How you feel? I feel good. Good.

249
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:14.270
Then I go and I hit the laptop and it just, Oh really?

250
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.950
Oh kitty let it cause like nature wants them to get you to come.

251
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:23.960
Yes. Women only respected discipline, man. You don't want,

252
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.930
it's true. Once a woman can drop your defenses,

253
00:15:26.931 --> 00:15:30.560
she's no longer attracted to you. If she can control you,

254
00:15:30.561 --> 00:15:33.290
she's not attracted to you. A woman wants a man she could chase.

255
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.630
In my book I talk about how women are the apex predator.

256
00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:39.050
They're the ones that chase after sex. I mean they can have sex endlessly,

257
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:42.250
right? Once we know it's like we're pretty much done. Like, I mean,

258
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.540
give me a couple of minutes to recharge, but it could keep going.

259
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.320
You see what I'm saying? So they're, you know, technically like, you know,

260
00:15:48.321 --> 00:15:49.220
freaks or whatever.

261
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.760
But just because she's undisciplined and her sexual energy doesn't mean you have

262
00:15:54.771 --> 00:15:55.490
to be.

263
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:59.060
And if she feels like she has to go outside of the relationship to go get her

264
00:15:59.061 --> 00:16:02.270
fixed, that's the one hood that has nothing to do with you.

265
00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:05.390
Your aspirations as a man are higher than sex.

266
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:09.140
A woman's role is to create life and support the man.

267
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:13.140
The man's role is to create the, the, the,

268
00:16:13.141 --> 00:16:16.640
the afforded in the future of, of humanity. You know,

269
00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:18.290
building things and innovating.

270
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.920
And it's true that a woman is not attracted to a guy without discipline.

271
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:26.510
Like men are lazy and weak, dah, dah, dah. The giant turnoff to a woman.

272
00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.040
But if a woman is hot, she could be pretty lazy. Absolutely.

273
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:35.870
They are the laziest people don't care. Mendo I don't care if a girl's lazy,

274
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:40.130
she's hot. Well, long as her body holds up well, she can get to the gym.

275
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:44.090
I used to make girls work to get me, man. Really? Yeah. Like, you know,

276
00:16:44.091 --> 00:16:46.220
I would say I'm, you know, I'm working on this project, you know,

277
00:16:46.221 --> 00:16:48.440
I'm going to send a spreadsheet over. I need you to go organize it.

278
00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:50.840
And if she'd say no, I'd just be like, all right,

279
00:16:50.841 --> 00:16:53.750
well you're worthless to my life. Right. I need,

280
00:16:53.751 --> 00:16:55.160
I need someone that's going to build with me. Right.

281
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.070
What if she's building on her own shit? Fuck her shit.

282
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.610
Go Pilcher shit. You know, if you need help, I'll help you. But you know,

283
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.080
she want to partner. Yeah. Want just a lover. That's what you're saying. No,

284
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:14.630
no. You want someone to help you? No. I want her to prove her worth. Whoa.

285
00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.540
She gotta be worried to get me like, you know,

286
00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:20.870
it's easy to get a girl then he's gonna get them. Good man. You know,

287
00:17:20.871 --> 00:17:22.820
you only gonna find one Hotep Jesus in your life.

288
00:17:22.821 --> 00:17:25.100
I could find a ton of you showed him. Wow.

289
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:28.370
You everywhere on Instagram after Joe Rogan is going to be,

290
00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:29.283
they going to be everywhere.

291
00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:36.940
So now some would say that that's a sexist generalization.

292
00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:41.540
Sure. I don't care what the Donald care like we can have that conversation.

293
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.000
I bring you in your platform. We can talk and I'll, you know,

294
00:17:44.001 --> 00:17:46.190
if you want to call it sexist, it is what it is.

295
00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:48.830
Have you ever had a conversation with like a radical feminist about this kind of

296
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.600
thinking? Oh they won't talk to me. They all blocked me.

297
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.440
They block the all black, you know the whole,

298
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.630
the whole black left feminists.

299
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.480
The reason why he blocked me is cause they can't beat me. Right.

300
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:02.370
When we have conversations,

301
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:06.570
I'm so objective that it's too dangerous for them to engage with me. How so?

302
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:11.310
Cause I'll be like, it's sexist. Yes. And so let's,

303
00:18:11.311 --> 00:18:15.390
let's continue the conversation and then that's where they don't want to go.

304
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.220
Cause then they're going to have to provide reinforcement and evidence and

305
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.270
you're dealing with an educated man and I'm going to come with my evidence and

306
00:18:21.271 --> 00:18:25.530
facts so you don't have a problem being sexist. That's what the problem is.

307
00:18:25.531 --> 00:18:29.160
Because if someone calls you sexist and you go, yeah, yeah, I'm sexist.

308
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.550
Yeah it is. What is this? It's like somebody called me racist or whatever.

309
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:34.590
I don't care what your opinion is.

310
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:38.970
I don't care about these isms that you create. I understand nature.

311
00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:40.620
I understand myself.

312
00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:48.610
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
