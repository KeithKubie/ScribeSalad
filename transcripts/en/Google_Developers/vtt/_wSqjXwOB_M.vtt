ASA DOTZLER: Thank you
for the introduction

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:03.580
and for the invitation.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.100
Hello, my name is Asa Dotzler.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.950
I'm a Mozillian.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.250
I've been with Mozilla
for about 15 years now.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.080
My business card says
storyteller and spokesmodel,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.860
but my real work at Mozilla
has been mostly nontechnical

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.900
and mostly focused
on lowering barriers

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.051
to participation in
Mozilla projects.

00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:24.550
I'm sure most of you know, but
there may be a few of you who

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.320
don't.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.153
So I'll tell you a
little bit about Mozilla.

00:00:27.153 --> 00:00:29.960
Mozilla is a nonprofit
organization.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.490
Our shareholders are the
people of planet Earth,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.590
the several billion
people who are already

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.880
developing, participating in,
and consuming web experiences,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.930
and the 5 or 6
billion more that will

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.510
come online over the
next decade or so.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.390
We do a lot of
things at Mozilla,

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.160
but we're most well known
for the Firefox web browser

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.930
and more recently for a
mobile operating system

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.350
called Firefox OS.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.900
Like everything we do,
Firefox and Firefox OS

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.480
are open-source software.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.070
In addition to being
licensed open source,

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.150
there are also open projects.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.630
We focus a lot of
attention on making sure

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.830
that our projects are
approachable and participatory.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.190
From the initial planning
stages through development

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.160
and support, from the top of the
stack the bottom of the stack,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.350
everything we do is meant to be
open, approachable, accessible,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.190
and participatory.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.530
That means that I don't have any
secrets to reveal here, today,

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.420
any new product announcements
or anything like that.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.900
And virtually
everything I say you

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.710
can find behind one
of these three links.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.286
I hope that that
doesn't disappoint,

00:01:33.286 --> 00:01:34.660
and I hope that
the talk is still

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.870
valuable for a
whole bunch of you.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.520
In the next 10 or
15 minutes, I'm

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.103
going to share with
you the work we've

00:01:41.103 --> 00:01:43.500
done to bring WebRTC
to our browsers

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.620
over the last couple years,
our ongoing work to put WebRTC

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.734
into the Firefox OS
mobile operating system.

00:01:50.734 --> 00:01:52.650
And I'm going to give
you a brief introduction

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.070
to an application we're building
into Firefox, the browser,

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.790
and Firefox OS--
currently code named

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.320
Loop-- that will give consumers,
give users of the product

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.680
a chat experience.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.770
I don't need to go into
the full history of WebRTC

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.259
because you all got a great
briefing in the earlier

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.500
first couple of sessions.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.640
But one year ago
this week, Mozilla

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.220
shipped Firefox Version
22 on the desktop

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.280
to Mac, Windows, and Linux
with the full WebRTC stack,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.250
that is, getUserMedia,
PeerConnection,

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.650
and DataChannel.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.330
Two releases after that,
about three months later,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.180
we added the full stack
to our Android browser

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.740
so that we had-- Gecko
is Gecko is Gecko.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.370
Our web run time inside of our
desktop browser Mac, Windows

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.080
and Linux, and our
Android mobile browser all

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.834
run the same software,
virtually the same software,

00:02:41.834 --> 00:02:44.000
and you should get the same
experiences out of them.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.987
We started on the desktop
for a couple of reasons.

00:02:52.987 --> 00:02:55.320
A lot of people ask why we
didn't start on mobile first,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.126
where everyone else is.

00:02:57.126 --> 00:02:59.250
The first reason is the
desktop had the horsepower.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.940
A couple of years ago, mobile
wasn't where it is today.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.280
The processing power made a
big difference-- connectivity

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.760
of Wi-Fi versus less solid
connectivity on mobile devices

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.670
as well as the fact that Google
was starting its implementation

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.581
on the desktop and pushing
mobile till later as well.

00:03:17.581 --> 00:03:20.080
And so we worked with Google
and the Chrome team quite a bit

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.070
to develop the WebRTC standards
and to design and build

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.420
an interoperable
WebRTC implementation

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.100
between the Chrome browsers
and the Firefox browsers.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.075
I think this is really
important as we demonstrate

00:03:33.075 --> 00:03:35.580
that the web is about
multivendor solutions.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.790
And the fact that we
could produce WebRTC video

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.010
chats from the Chrome browser
to the Firefox browser

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.240
over a year ago
is, I think, proof

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.730
that WebRTC is on
its way to becoming

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.790
a fundamental
component of the web.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.920
After the desktop
and the mobile work,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.740
we moved on to integrating
Firefox-- sorry, WebRTC

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.030
into Firefox OS.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.420
How many people
here are familiar

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.721
with our mobile
operating system?

00:04:05.721 --> 00:04:07.970
And how many people are
familiar with the architecture

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.740
of our mobile operating system?

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.660
So I'll start there real quick.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.806
Firefox OS is an open-source
mobile operating system.

00:04:17.806 --> 00:04:19.180
And what we've
done here is we've

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.140
taken the Linux kernel
and Howl and other drivers

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.390
down to the various low level.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.860
We packaged that up into
a module we called Gonk.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.485
I call it Gonk.

00:04:26.485 --> 00:04:28.840
It's all the ugly stuff I
don't like to think about.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.264
But above that, we dropped
Gecko onto it right on top.

00:04:31.264 --> 00:04:32.430
There's no in-between layer.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.490
We drop our web run
time right on top

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.710
of the kernel and drivers.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.710
And above that,
we've built using

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.890
web languages-- all pure
HTML, JavaScript, CSS,

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.170
the things you know and love--
a series of system components

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.280
and applications that ship
on Firefox OS mobile phones.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.500
This includes things
like our start screen,

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.760
a dialer-- you need a dialer on
a phone-- address book, camera,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.070
interfaces, all of
these kinds of things.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.435
Firefox OS is a web
native platform.

00:05:04.435 --> 00:05:06.560
I hear a lot of people talk
about the native stacks

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.260
out there and the web
versus the native stacks.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.410
I'm just old enough
to remember when

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.500
Java wasn't really
considered a native stack.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.580
It was a plug-in to the browsers
or a server side technology.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.890
And with Firefox OS,
what we're trying to do

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.180
is assert that JavaScript,
HTML, CSS, and friends

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.750
are the native platform.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.190
They are as close to the
metal as we can get them,

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.160
as highly tuned and
performant as we can get them.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.410
And the purpose of building
this new architecture

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.060
in this new product
is because we

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.020
think the web is the greatest
platform ever invented

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.370
and that the next 4, 5 6
billion people who come online

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.850
are going to be coming
online and experiencing that

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.550
through mobile devices, first.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.530
And we want the web
to be a first class

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.870
citizen on those mobile devices.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.430
Mozilla employees, our global
community of tens of thousands

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.469
of volunteers, and a bunch of
Firefox OS ecosystem partners,

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:03.010
these are the people
who are building

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.970
the handsets, the carriers and
operators, our retail partners,

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.160
all work together in the
open to build Firefox OS.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.830
One of the unique aspects
of this development

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.460
is that any of you can
be involved as well.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.560
We don't batch up a
whole bunch of changes

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.070
and toss them over the wall
every three or six months.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.775
Everything we do, like I said,
from design to implementation

00:06:24.775 --> 00:06:26.400
from the top to the
bottom of the stack

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.590
is open and participatory
from day one.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.790
But mobile and the web have
had a tricky relationship

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.580
over the last four
or five years.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.400
And one of the major
reasons for that

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.835
is that mobile
browsers are what we

00:06:43.835 --> 00:06:45.710
think of when we think
of mobile and the web.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.010
And the mobile browsers have
typically been fairly crippled.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.770
If you look at the browsers on
iOS over the last few years,

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.090
you didn't get any of the
really nice JavaScript

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.320
performance out of it.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.800
I think Apple's rectifying that.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.440
Google is also bringing some
of that really nice performance

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.670
to upcoming versions of Android.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.140
But with Firefox
OS, where we don't

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.015
have to think about it
in terms of a browser,

00:07:06.015 --> 00:07:09.180
and we can actually deliver
the full capability of the web

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.690
platform without any of
the legacy of what you need

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.610
to put on to something
to make it a browser,

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.260
we were able to achieve some
pretty significant performance

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.050
wins.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.300
And on top of that,
we started closing

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.710
the gap between the
actual device capabilities

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.030
available to you in
the native stacks

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.040
and those available to
you in the web stack.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.120
We did this through a
project called Web API.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.870
Web API is everything
we know and love

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.800
from the last 20 years of
web development from HTML

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.520
and JavaScript and CSS.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.520
But it's also a new class of
APIs that will fill those gaps.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.860
The pieces of hardware, the
sensors and the services

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.700
and other capabilities that
we find on mobile devices

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.770
that we don't typically
find on desktops and laptops

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.570
should all be
accessible through APIs

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.860
that are comfortable familiar
and accessible to web

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:56.410
developers.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.240
And that's what we're building
into Firefox OS today.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.120
And we've got 30 or
40 of these going.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.170
All of them are intended to
be standardized, ultimately.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.150
And a few of them are available
in the desktop browser

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.040
to try out.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.150
A few of them are available
on our mobile browser.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.040
But the real focus of the
web API development effort

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.460
is in Firefox OS, which
is available for download

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.980
and testing just as
the Firefox browser is.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.820
So where are we with
Firefox OS and WebRTC?

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.995
We shipped our first version
of Firefox OS about a year ago.

00:08:31.995 --> 00:08:33.870
It was a year and a half
ago that we declared

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.610
Version 1.0 done, but
it was about a year

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.679
before our partners were able to
get those devices into market.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.500
That went into about 15 markets.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.650
That is up to about 35 today.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.150
And by the end of
this year, I think

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.720
we're closer to 40 markets.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.670
I'll have to double
check on that.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.540
Sorry, we'll be up
to 30 geographies

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.190
by the end of this year.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.971
We shipped Firefox
OS Version 1.3

00:08:56.971 --> 00:08:58.220
at the beginning of this year.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.380
It's the current
in-market newest release.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.770
And all of our team are hard
at work on Firefox 2.0 and 2.1.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.120
2.0 is where we
introduce WebRTC.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.970
We've had some pieces-- I
think we had getUserMedia there

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:11.360
for a little while.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.560
But Firefox OS
Version 2.0, which

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.730
is wrapping up in the
next couple of months

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.780
and hitting devices in market
by the end of this year, maybe

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:24.260
mid fourth quarter, will have
getUserMedia PeerConnection

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.700
and DataChannel, and
an implementation that

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.420
should be highly compatible--
given that this is the Gecko

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.180
stack-- with our Mac, Windows,
Linux and Android browser

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:33.680
views.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.138
And that should
make it really easy

00:09:35.138 --> 00:09:38.480
for you to take the work
you've done on WebRTC apps

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.450
and to deploy those to any of
the Firefox or Chrome browsers

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:48.480
out there as well as with
only hopefully minor changes,

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.380
packaging them up and shipping
them as Firefox OS apps.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.310
In addition, you can also load
up the browser inside a Firefox

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:58.750
OS and treat it just as
a regular web-based app.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.650
We've still got a lot
of bugs to iron out,

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:04.890
and we're especially focused
on performance optimizations.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:08.020
As you move to mobile and as
you move into the Firefox OS

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.920
mobile space, which is targeting
the mid-tier and low end

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.910
of the market and not the Hero
phones with 8-core processors

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.280
and running at 2.5
gigahertz, but more

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.050
like these $100 to
$150 devices that

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:24.670
have a dual-core processor
and 512 megs of RAM.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.130
So getting into those
spaces with performance

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:29.450
is our big challenge and
where most of our effort

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:29.997
is right now.

00:10:29.997 --> 00:10:32.080
But we think we've made
some really good progress,

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.610
and we'd love for you
all to check that out.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.010
Once again, we're
working very hard

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.490
to make sure that Gecko
is Gecko is Gecko.

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:41.540
Whether you're hitting
on a desktop browser,

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.040
a mobile browser,
or Firefox OS, when

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.150
you develop a WebRTC application
or solution for our platform,

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:52.127
it should work on all
of these form factors.

00:10:52.127 --> 00:10:54.210
I'm going to wrap with a
little bit of information

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.720
on a project that's
pretty new to Mozilla.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.710
And this is to take a bunch of
the work we've done in WebRTC,

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.890
which empowers you all in
our developer community

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:05.670
to build great experiences,
and surface some of that

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.300
to our users of
the Firefox browser

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.060
and of the Firefox OS
mobile operating system.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.600
We want to build an actual
app, a user experience that

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.120
will let people very quickly
and easily chat between them

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.840
and their friends
on their browsers

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.460
and in an app on the
mobile operating system.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.710
Right now, Loop is very
early in development.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.180
It's meant to be quick an easy.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.950
We're not trying
to-- I don't believe

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.890
we're trying to take
on any of the highly

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.800
successful, commercial video
chat applications out there.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.210
We want to make it super simple.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.740
And so the first implementation
looks kind of like this.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.680
You'll open up your
Firefox web browser.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.430
You'll click on a
little chat icon,

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:45.020
and it will give you
a URL to yourself.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.370
You give that to your friend.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:47.990
Your friend clicks on it.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:51.190
You get a little pop-up "accept
call from friend," say yes,

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:52.870
and you get a
video pop-up window

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:54.691
that floats in
your browser on top

00:11:54.691 --> 00:11:56.190
of the tab you're
currently viewing.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.231
You can pop that out into
a free standing window.

00:11:58.231 --> 00:11:59.230
You can go full screen.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.310
You can navigate all
your other browser tabs

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:04.870
and move between Windows, and
the call continues and stays

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:05.370
functional.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.120
And that allows you
to surf around the web

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.340
while you're talking
to one of your friends.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.760
That's an anonymous experience.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.230
We're also working to integrate
with Firefox accounts,

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.020
and that will allow
you to communicate

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.030
to people via their Firefox
account email addresses.

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.750
It will also give you the
opportunity to store an address

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.410
book, import, edit and store
address book information,

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.220
to set who can and
cannot call you.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.530
Maybe we'll have like
auto answer or block

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:35.700
answers for certain people
that are calling you too often.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.390
And then all of this will
be similarly packaged up

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.530
and deployed as an application
that users can download,

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.280
install, and run on
Firefox OS devices.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.920
So it is basic and it
is anonymous today.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.852
We're growing out the
further functionality.

00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:51.560
I think you can get
a look at this today.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.590
There's a URL up here
that will give you

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.530
all the architectural
information about Loop

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:57.630
as well as some of the
design documentation.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.160
And I think it's a
nightly build of Firefox.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.950
So any of you who are on the
very tip of our development

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:06.290
there can get a good look at it
through the Firefox web browser

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.157
nightly channel.

00:13:08.157 --> 00:13:09.740
And as I come to the
conclusion, here,

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.800
I want to wrap with something
that one of my good friends,

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.400
Maire Reavy, our media
goddess at Mozilla

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.290
and one of the core
members of the WebRTC team.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.430
Please help us bring real-time
communications to the web.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:23.450
We're not done yet.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:27.830
We need your help to build great
applications and experiences.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:30.910
We need your help in feedback
as we develop the APIs

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:34.480
and work toward a next version
and additional capabilities.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.980
We need you to report bugs
on our implementations

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.780
and our competitors'
implementations

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.010
and to seek out
interoperability and call us

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:43.090
out when we don't have it.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.610
We need you to help
us test and develop.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:49.299
With your help, and your
ideas, and your enthusiasm,

00:13:49.299 --> 00:13:51.340
we're going to take the
web to a whole new level.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.480
Thank you.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.030
[APPLAUSE]
