00:00:00.427 --> 00:00:03.623
- [Voiceover] Graph
0.04 on the number line.

00:00:03.623 --> 00:00:05.369
So here we have this number line

00:00:05.369 --> 00:00:09.917
that goes from zero to 0.1, or 1/10,

00:00:09.917 --> 00:00:11.884
and between zero and 1/10,

00:00:11.884 --> 00:00:14.999
we have one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:18.703
seven, eight, nine, ten equal spaces.

00:00:18.703 --> 00:00:23.566
So each of these spaces
represents 1/10th of the distance,

00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:26.149
is one out of ten equal spaces.

00:00:26.986 --> 00:00:31.956
Or we could say, it is
1/10th of this tenth,

00:00:31.956 --> 00:00:35.298
it's a tenth of the way to 1/10th.

00:00:35.298 --> 00:00:36.456
That's a little bit tricky,

00:00:36.456 --> 00:00:38.138
maybe let's pause and
look at that visually

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:42.034
and think about what does a
tenth of a tenth really mean.

00:00:42.034 --> 00:00:44.425
So here I have already drawn

00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:47.733
a picture that's divided
into 10 equal pieces.

00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:51.900
And if we shade one of them,
then we're shading 1/10th.

00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:55.204
This right here is 1/10th.

00:00:55.204 --> 00:00:58.830
And this amount right here is
what the number line showed,

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.835
the whole number line showed 1/10th.

00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:05.698
But then we had divided that
tenth into 10 equal pieces,

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:09.576
so if we split that 10
into 10 equal pieces,

00:01:09.576 --> 00:01:12.478
we're gonna have something like this.

00:01:12.478 --> 00:01:17.058
So here again this top row would
represent the entire tenth,

00:01:17.058 --> 00:01:19.128
from the whole number line,

00:01:19.128 --> 00:01:23.295
but each little piece would
be 1/10th of that whole tenth.

00:01:26.938 --> 00:01:29.342
Or, so this is what each little piece

00:01:29.342 --> 00:01:31.673
on the number line represents,

00:01:31.673 --> 00:01:35.653
or we could say that's 1/100th,

00:01:35.653 --> 00:01:38.057
a tenth of a tenth is a 1/100th,

00:01:38.057 --> 00:01:40.930
'cause when you divide
10 into 10 equal pieces,

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.574
you're gonna end up with 100 pieces.

00:01:43.574 --> 00:01:47.407
So a tenth of a tenth is a 1/100th.

00:01:48.414 --> 00:01:50.177
So looking back at the number line,

00:01:50.177 --> 00:01:53.463
now we know that this distance,

00:01:53.463 --> 00:01:57.662
a tenth of our tenth, is 1/100th.

00:01:57.662 --> 00:01:59.829
And we want to graph 0.04.

00:02:02.357 --> 00:02:06.550
Well this four right here,
let's think about place value.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.063
The zero's in the ones,
the next zero in the tenth,

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:12.396
and this four is in the hundreds,

00:02:12.396 --> 00:02:16.366
so we could call this four hundredths,

00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:19.616
or even the fraction, 4/100.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.401
So if one of these lengths is 1/100

00:02:24.401 --> 00:02:26.464
and we wanna go 4/100,

00:02:26.464 --> 00:02:28.990
then we're gonna need to
go four of these lengths.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.018
One, two, three, four of these lengths

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:35.435
would be four of the hundredths, or 0.04.
