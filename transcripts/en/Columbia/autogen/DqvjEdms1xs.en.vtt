01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:21.600

unlike the other two people on my panel

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:21.610
unlike the other two people on my panel
 

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:24.540
unlike the other two people on my panel
but topic that I spoke about today isn't

01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:24.550
but topic that I spoke about today isn't
 

01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:27.840
but topic that I spoke about today isn't
actually my primary line of research but

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:27.850
actually my primary line of research but
 

01:21:27.850 --> 01:21:32.040
actually my primary line of research but
I find that my interest is in refugees

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:32.050
I find that my interest is in refugees
 

01:21:32.050 --> 01:21:36.420
I find that my interest is in refugees
and I find you don't you can't you can't

01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:36.430
and I find you don't you can't you can't
 

01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:38.700
and I find you don't you can't you can't
think about an architecture related to

01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:38.710
think about an architecture related to
 

01:21:38.710 --> 01:21:40.290
think about an architecture related to
refugees without thinking about the law

01:21:40.290 --> 01:21:40.300
refugees without thinking about the law
 

01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:42.900
refugees without thinking about the law
the real estate law behind them or any

01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:42.910
the real estate law behind them or any
 

01:21:42.910 --> 01:21:46.070
the real estate law behind them or any
other sort of law so I've certainly

01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080
other sort of law so I've certainly
 

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:48.660
other sort of law so I've certainly
danced around this problem as I was

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:48.670
danced around this problem as I was
 

01:21:48.670 --> 01:21:51.270
danced around this problem as I was
writing this paper that can you write in

01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280
writing this paper that can you write in
 

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.680
writing this paper that can you write in
architectural history paper that is

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:52.690
architectural history paper that is
 

01:21:52.690 --> 01:21:54.959
architectural history paper that is
effectively a paper about real estate

01:21:54.959 --> 01:21:54.969
effectively a paper about real estate
 

01:21:54.969 --> 01:21:59.160
effectively a paper about real estate
law and I think I received many

01:21:59.160 --> 01:21:59.170
law and I think I received many
 

01:21:59.170 --> 01:22:01.680
law and I think I received many
assurances that you can but it's an

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:01.690
assurances that you can but it's an
 

01:22:01.690 --> 01:22:03.990
assurances that you can but it's an
awkward moment I think just because this

01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000
awkward moment I think just because this
 

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.360
awkward moment I think just because this
is a field in a sort of transition but I

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:06.370
is a field in a sort of transition but I
 

01:22:06.370 --> 01:22:08.580
is a field in a sort of transition but I
do think that I see the opportunity for

01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:08.590
do think that I see the opportunity for
 

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:10.890
do think that I see the opportunity for
architectural historians to to kind of

01:22:10.890 --> 01:22:10.900
architectural historians to to kind of
 

01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:13.470
architectural historians to to kind of
take ownership of that problem I don't

01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:13.480
take ownership of that problem I don't
 

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:15.450
take ownership of that problem I don't
think it's really been done until

01:22:15.450 --> 01:22:15.460
think it's really been done until
 

01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:20.729
think it's really been done until
recently yeah I mean I guess the the

01:22:20.729 --> 01:22:20.739
recently yeah I mean I guess the the
 

01:22:20.739 --> 01:22:22.890
recently yeah I mean I guess the the
explicit question I was trying to to

01:22:22.890 --> 01:22:22.900
explicit question I was trying to to
 

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:25.680
explicit question I was trying to to
address regarding the the traditional

address regarding the the traditional
 

01:22:25.690 --> 01:22:30.000
address regarding the the traditional
periodization and and kind of opposite a

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:30.010
periodization and and kind of opposite a
 

01:22:30.010 --> 01:22:32.459
periodization and and kind of opposite a
traditional position between these two

01:22:32.459 --> 01:22:32.469
traditional position between these two
 

01:22:32.469 --> 01:22:34.320

directly at those there's sort of the

01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:42.510
directly at those there's sort of the
 

01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:44.750

obviously this this this seems to sort

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:51.310
obviously this this this seems to sort
 

01:22:51.310 --> 01:23:00.570

as interventions as well so this is you

01:26:59.080 --> 01:26:59.090
as interventions as well so this is you
 

01:26:59.090 --> 01:27:00.880
as interventions as well so this is you
know this is exactly that I think that's

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:00.890
know this is exactly that I think that's
 

01:27:00.890 --> 01:27:05.320

01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:23.160
working on this yeah I mean I what I
found really challenging is the the way

01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:23.170
found really challenging is the the way
 

01:31:23.170 --> 01:31:26.790
found really challenging is the the way
that working in the spatial archive

01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800
that working in the spatial archive
 

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:30.300
that working in the spatial archive
enables us to understand literally the

01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:30.310
enables us to understand literally the
 

01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:34.980
enables us to understand literally the
concrete temporality and and and the gap

01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:34.990
concrete temporality and and and the gap
 

01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:38.160
concrete temporality and and and the gap
of the temporal gap between exactly

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:38.170
of the temporal gap between exactly
 

01:31:38.170 --> 01:31:42.210
of the temporal gap between exactly
national imagination and it's it's it's

01:31:42.210 --> 01:31:42.220
national imagination and it's it's it's
 

01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:44.490
national imagination and it's it's it's
prolonged and protracted implementation

01:31:44.490 --> 01:31:44.500
prolonged and protracted implementation
 

01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:47.130
prolonged and protracted implementation
and all the possibilities that that that

01:31:47.130 --> 01:31:47.140
and all the possibilities that that that
 

01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:53.020
and all the possibilities that that that
opens up

01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:53.030
 
 

01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:58.690
 
I mean I think in the post colonial

01:31:58.690 --> 01:31:58.700
I mean I think in the post colonial
 

01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:01.060
I mean I think in the post colonial
context that there's a set of other

01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:01.070
context that there's a set of other
 

01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:02.710
context that there's a set of other
questions that go along with this but

01:32:02.710 --> 01:32:02.720
questions that go along with this but
 

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:05.080
questions that go along with this but
maybe this isn't the right moment there

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:05.090
maybe this isn't the right moment there
 

01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:09.490
maybe this isn't the right moment there
will be a lot of chances to talk perhaps

01:32:09.490 --> 01:32:09.500
will be a lot of chances to talk perhaps
 

01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:12.460
will be a lot of chances to talk perhaps
you can see mission is the narrative

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:12.470
you can see mission is the narrative
 

01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:14.800
you can see mission is the narrative
through which the steel captures the

01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:14.810
through which the steel captures the
 

01:32:14.810 --> 01:32:19.990
through which the steel captures the
subject yeah that is necessarily needed

01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:20.000
subject yeah that is necessarily needed
 

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.280
subject yeah that is necessarily needed
and whites point I have a question to

01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:24.290
and whites point I have a question to
 

01:32:24.290 --> 01:32:27.460
and whites point I have a question to
know you mentioned that there was sort

01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:27.470
know you mentioned that there was sort
 

01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:32.110
know you mentioned that there was sort
of clear aesthetic or cultural aspect to

01:32:32.110 --> 01:32:32.120
of clear aesthetic or cultural aspect to
 

01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:34.420
of clear aesthetic or cultural aspect to
the judgment which settlements which

01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:34.430
the judgment which settlements which
 

01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:37.150
the judgment which settlements which
abandoned of displaced Arab settlements

01:32:37.150 --> 01:32:37.160
abandoned of displaced Arab settlements
 

01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:40.780
abandoned of displaced Arab settlements
to destroy and which to develop those

01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:40.790
to destroy and which to develop those
 

01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:42.640
to destroy and which to develop those
tourist areas could you talk a little

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:42.650
tourist areas could you talk a little
 

01:32:42.650 --> 01:32:46.030
tourist areas could you talk a little
bit on on the criterias and those

01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:46.040
bit on on the criterias and those
 

01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:48.520
bit on on the criterias and those
aesthetic criteria which were put into

01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:48.530
aesthetic criteria which were put into
 

01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:51.520
aesthetic criteria which were put into
this decision and maybe who produced

01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:51.530
this decision and maybe who produced
 

01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:53.320
this decision and maybe who produced
this great theories architects or urban

01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:53.330
this great theories architects or urban
 

01:32:53.330 --> 01:32:56.110
this great theories architects or urban
planners or politicians I think that

01:32:56.110 --> 01:32:56.120
planners or politicians I think that
 

01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:57.670
planners or politicians I think that
ties really well with the question of

01:32:57.670 --> 01:32:57.680
ties really well with the question of
 

01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:00.760
ties really well with the question of
imagination and how do how do we how do

01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:00.770
imagination and how do how do we how do
 

01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:04.690
imagination and how do how do we how do
we use that that sort of physical

01:33:04.690 --> 01:33:04.700
we use that that sort of physical
 

01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:07.990
we use that that sort of physical
archive to expose that exactly the

01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.000
archive to expose that exactly the
 

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:13.060
archive to expose that exactly the
criteria of imagining nationhood I think

01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:13.070
criteria of imagining nationhood I think
 

01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:15.790
criteria of imagining nationhood I think
in the Israeli case it was it was a

01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:15.800
in the Israeli case it was it was a
 

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:20.080
in the Israeli case it was it was a
combined effort of both architects

01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:20.090
combined effort of both architects
 

01:33:20.090 --> 01:33:23.230
combined effort of both architects

the the term the the boundaries between

01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:26.320
the the term the the boundaries between
 

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:29.880
the the term the the boundaries between
these kind of professional categories

01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:29.890
these kind of professional categories
 

01:33:29.890 --> 01:33:35.350
these kind of professional categories
were extremely blurry as I hope Sevilla

01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360
were extremely blurry as I hope Sevilla
 

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:37.420
were extremely blurry as I hope Sevilla
thoughts is going to talk about tomorrow

01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:37.430
thoughts is going to talk about tomorrow
 

01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:40.890
thoughts is going to talk about tomorrow
about the exactly the participation of

01:33:40.890 --> 01:33:40.900
about the exactly the participation of
 

01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:43.350
about the exactly the participation of
Architects in the production and

01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:43.360
Architects in the production and
 

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:48.100
Architects in the production and
imagination of space but I guess what is

01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:48.110
imagination of space but I guess what is
 

01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:50.500
imagination of space but I guess what is
interesting and is just to note the

01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:50.510
interesting and is just to note the
 

01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:53.680
interesting and is just to note the
tension in the Israeli case between old

01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:53.690
tension in the Israeli case between old
 

01:33:53.690 --> 01:33:55.520
tension in the Israeli case between old
and new and

01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:55.530
and new and
 

01:33:55.530 --> 01:33:59.170
and new and
and the effort to on the one hand

01:33:59.170 --> 01:33:59.180
and the effort to on the one hand
 

01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:04.040
and the effort to on the one hand
trumpet modern ideals and modern

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:04.050
trumpet modern ideals and modern
 

01:34:04.050 --> 01:34:07.450
trumpet modern ideals and modern
imaginations of space with the

01:34:07.450 --> 01:34:07.460
imaginations of space with the
 

01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:11.120
imaginations of space with the
recreation of the sort of a biblical

01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:11.130
recreation of the sort of a biblical
 

01:34:11.130 --> 01:34:14.900
recreation of the sort of a biblical
ideal of sovereignty and how to bridge

01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:14.910
ideal of sovereignty and how to bridge
 

01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:18.410
ideal of sovereignty and how to bridge
that gap literally bridge the gap

01:34:18.410 --> 01:34:18.420
that gap literally bridge the gap
 

01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:20.540
that gap literally bridge the gap
between biblical times in contemporary

01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:20.550
between biblical times in contemporary
 

01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:24.890

sometimes physically the those

01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:27.090
sometimes physically the those
 

01:34:27.090 --> 01:34:30.580
sometimes physically the those
discrepancies that could not be

01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:30.590
discrepancies that could not be
 

01:34:30.590 --> 01:34:34.460

conveniently compartmentalised into into

either that is on the grand scale but as

01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:38.790
either that is on the grand scale but as
 

01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:41.150
either that is on the grand scale but as
as I think it shows there was a lot of

01:34:41.150 --> 01:34:41.160
as I think it shows there was a lot of
 

01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:43.790
as I think it shows there was a lot of
uncertainty especially in those first

01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800
uncertainty especially in those first
 

01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:48.830
uncertainty especially in those first
years about where exactly one draws the

years about where exactly one draws the
 

01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:50.960
years about where exactly one draws the
borders between old and new and and what

01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:50.970
borders between old and new and and what
 

01:34:50.970 --> 01:34:54.380
borders between old and new and and what
exactly constitutes then the old that

01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:54.390
exactly constitutes then the old that
 

01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:56.150
exactly constitutes then the old that
develops and the new and that also

01:34:56.150 --> 01:34:56.160
develops and the new and that also
 

01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:59.450
