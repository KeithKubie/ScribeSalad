00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.690
People can be mean.

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.899
If only there was a pill that made people
be kinder to one another.

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:08.280
Yep, got that, check.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.110
Hi there everyone, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.770
If you’ve ever been on a little place called
the internet you may have noticed sometimes

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.300
it’s a bubbling cauldron of festering impotent
rage.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.300
Sometimes.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.060
Some people just need to take a chill pill,
and now scientists have discovered that a

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.270
pill already used to treat parkinsons will
increase someone’s level of chillness.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.800
Scientists from UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco
recently brought in 35 participants and had

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.830
half take a placebo and the rest take a drug
called tolcapone.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.180
Tolcapone is already being used to treat parkinsons
by prolonging the effects of dopamine, which

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.170
is a hormone and neurotransmitter commonly
associated with pleasure and reward.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.400
Then they had participants play a game where
they divided money between themselves and

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.400
a stranger.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.470
At the end of the double blind study the researchers
noticed people on tolcapone tended to divide

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.140
the money more fairly than the people who
took the sugar pill.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.690
They concluded that just by increasing dopamine
with a pill we can make people treat each

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.720
other better.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.570
And thus all the world’s problems were solved.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.829
Ha, kidding, of course it’s more complex
than that.

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:08.549
First off there’s the problem of possible
side effects.

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.350
The thing about dopamine is it’s addictive
as all get out.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.389
Like I said, dopamine is associated with pleasure
and reward.

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:17.840
It’s a big part of what makes Facebook so
addictive.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.429
When you see you got a like or a comment,
your brain rewards you with a little dopamine,

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:22.429
you feel good, and then you’re hooked.

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:23.580
Yes, Mark Zuckerberg is basically the biggest
drug dealer in history

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.259
Parkinsons patients sometimes become addicted
to their own medication, or develop new addictive

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.810
behaviors like compulsive gambling, shopping,
or hypersexuality.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.340
So taking a drug that keeps dopamine from
being broken down in your prefrontal cortex

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.520
can have some gnarly unintended consequences.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.429
There’s also the issue of what this means
for us as human beings.

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.700
Should you take a pill that changes your behavior?

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.100
There are some instances where I say absolutely
yes.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.810
Particularly with depression, where a common
problem is people don’t want to take their

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.429
medication because it feels like “cheating.”

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.039
But just to make yourself a little nicer?

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.320
It’s a great point to add to the philosophical
discussion on human nature, but I’m not

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.320
a philosophy guy.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.909
I’m a science guy.

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:00.990
And I just don’t know.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.109
For more proof chemicals affect your behavior,
check out Laci’s video on hangryness down

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:06.109
here.

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:07.109
Where do you stand on this issue?

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.030
Is it ok for people to take a pill to make
them nicer?

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.030
Would you do it?

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.980
Let us know in the comments or you can find
me on twitter @JHug00, and I’ll see you

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.400
next time on DNews.
