Here's a grisly fact: Britain's first serial
killer wasn't Jack the Ripper, but a Victorian-era

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:14.000
woman named Mary Ann Cotton who was hanged
in 1873 for murdering three husbands and 15 children.

Hi, I'm Cristen Conger of Stuff Mom Never
Told You in today for DNews.

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.689
Fortunately, murder is a rare crime, but when
it happens, the perpetrator is usually male.

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.420
According to the U.S. Justice Department,
for instance, roughly 9 out of 10 homicides

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.420
are committed by men. And similarly, from
2002 to 2012, 93.9% of people convicted of

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:45.519
murder in England and Wales were men.

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:51.749
So what provokes women like Mary Ann Cotton
and triple-murderer Joanna Dennehy, whose

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:55.929
gruesome crimes have recently captured British
attention?

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:02.379
Criminologists have identified certain differences
in how women murder, compared to men:

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.620
Women tend to murder people they know, for
instance: According to U.S. data collected

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:13.600
between 1976 and 2005, about 42 percent female
murderers' victims were intimate partners

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.210
or other family members.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:23.210
Perhaps because of that, women are less likely
to kill more than once, and since 2000 women

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.830
have comprised only around 6 percent of serial
killers.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.920
And finally, women use poison or arson more
commonly, rather than wielding a weapon that

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.800
might demand more physical strength to claim
victims' lives.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.060
But as for the whys of women killing, it involves
a range of motives such as greed, jealousy

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.350
and psychopathy, just as they do with men
who murder.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.430
Speaking to the BBC, clinical psychologist
Elie Godsi also noted that the public might

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.240
seek out a specific explanation for why women
murder since the crime is such a violent violation

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.130
of female gender norms.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.130
We tend to think of women as society's nurturers
and caregivers -- not bloodthirsty killers.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.739
Now we want to hear from you -- why do you
think murderous women are so attention-grabbing?
