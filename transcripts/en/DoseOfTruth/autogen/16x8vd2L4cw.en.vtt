it's not your will because your will
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.760
it's not your will because your will
would be the thing that would allow you

your will that's actually directing your

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280
your will that's actually directing your
 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.280
your will that's actually directing your
attention and you could say well it's

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
attention and you could say well it's
 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.800
attention and you could say well it's
random but of course it's not it's maybe

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810
random but of course it's not it's maybe
 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.450
random but of course it's not it's maybe
random if you have a serious case of

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460
random if you have a serious case of
 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.270
random if you have a serious case of
schizophrenia but and I think in some

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280
schizophrenia but and I think in some
 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.010
schizophrenia but and I think in some
sense that's actually the definition of

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020
sense that's actually the definition of
 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.140
sense that's actually the definition of
schizophrenia but it's not random if

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150
schizophrenia but it's not random if
 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.999
schizophrenia but it's not random if
you're a functioning human being the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009
you're a functioning human being the

thing that grips your attention and
 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.660
thing that grips your attention and
directs it to one place or another is

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670
directs it to one place or another is
 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.149
directs it to one place or another is
something that's what's a deep instinct

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159
something that's what's a deep instinct
 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.920
something that's what's a deep instinct
it's a manifestation of what Jung called

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930
it's a manifestation of what Jung called
 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.719
it's a manifestation of what Jung called
the self which is a very interesting

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729
the self which is a very interesting
 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.450
the self which is a very interesting
idea so Jung thought there's such a cool

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460
idea so Jung thought there's such a cool
 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.210
idea so Jung thought there's such a cool
idea he thought that the mechanism that

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220
idea he thought that the mechanism that
 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.249
idea he thought that the mechanism that
directed your attention in the present

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259
directed your attention in the present
 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.649
directed your attention in the present
was your future self attempting to

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659
was your future self attempting to
 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.319
was your future self attempting to
manifest itself in the present world so

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329
manifest itself in the present world so
 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.630
manifest itself in the present world so
you might say well you have a potential

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640
you might say well you have a potential
 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.240
you might say well you have a potential
and that potential is what you could be

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250
and that potential is what you could be
 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.730
and that potential is what you could be
in time and in order for that potential

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
in time and in order for that potential
 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.800
in time and in order for that potential
to manifest itself it has to be palpable

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
to manifest itself it has to be palpable
 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.740
to manifest itself it has to be palpable
in the present and the way that instinct

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750
in the present and the way that instinct
 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.690
in the present and the way that instinct
for further developed manifests itself

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700
for further developed manifests itself
 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.399
for further developed manifests itself
in the present is by directing your

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409
in the present is by directing your
 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.960
in the present is by directing your
attention towards things that are likely

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970
attention towards things that are likely
 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.029
attention towards things that are likely
to increase your competence and further

your growth right now
and that's just an unbelievable idea you

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400
and that's just an unbelievable idea you
 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.400
and that's just an unbelievable idea you
know it's like your your potential

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410
know it's like your your potential
 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.559

present amazing and I really can't think
 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.090
present amazing and I really can't think
of a better explanation for it than that

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100
of a better explanation for it than that
 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.380
of a better explanation for it than that
that's if that's a really good

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390
that's if that's a really good
 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.080
that's if that's a really good
explanation but a very frightening one

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090
explanation but a very frightening one
 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.970
explanation but a very frightening one
because it means in some sense that

of voluntary control over them like you

of voluntary control over them like you
can interact with the forces to some

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980
can interact with the forces to some
 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.440
can interact with the forces to some
degree but you know you're not one of

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450
degree but you know you're not one of
 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.420
degree but you know you're not one of

those perky creatures that can just tell
 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.800
those perky creatures that can just tell
yourself what to do

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810
yourself what to do
 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.600
yourself what to do
life would be really easy if that's what

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610
life would be really easy if that's what
 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.880
life would be really easy if that's what
it was like right you'd it's time to go

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890
it was like right you'd it's time to go
 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.590
it was like right you'd it's time to go
to the gym three days a week two hours a

in two years you can eat properly and

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200
in two years you can eat properly and
 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.199
in two years you can eat properly and
you know you're not gonna drink too much

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209
you know you're not gonna drink too much
 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.729
you know you're not gonna drink too much
and you're not gonna take cocaine and

and you're not gonna take cocaine and
 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.050
and you're not gonna take cocaine and
all of these things you just tell

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060
all of these things you just tell
 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.390
all of these things you just tell
yourself that and bang you quit and it's

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400
yourself that and bang you quit and it's
 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.060
yourself that and bang you quit and it's
kind of weird that it isn't that way but

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070
kind of weird that it isn't that way but
 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.780
kind of weird that it isn't that way but
it's really seriously not that way
