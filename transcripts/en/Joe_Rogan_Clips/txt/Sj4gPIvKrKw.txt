Speaker 1:          00:00          Losing their job. Maybe one of those things could also cause this trigger. We know with all mental health, all aspects of mental health or mental health problems. There were three kinds of calls, right? There's, I'm a bit lost connections, which about depression, anxieties, a lot about this. There are biological causes, things like your jeans, real brain changes, things like the introduction of a drug. There are psychological causes, how you think about yourself and your place in the world. And then there's environmental causes like you know, how we live with each other, things like loneliness, that sort of thing. Um, and in all mental health phenomena to some degree these three sets of courses play out. So let's think about even something very dementia. Dementia has a very, obviously has a heavy biological driver, right? Dementia is a physical degeneration of the brain or a disease like Alzheimer's.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Um, but even with dementia, which has this very heavy biological driver, we know there are big social and psychological effects that can mitigate it. So if you're part of a strong community and have lots of social connections, if you have a positive self image, if you speak other languages, you're dementia will develop significantly more slowly than if you don't have any of these factors. Right? So with things like psychosis, there's a brilliant person called Tanya Lurman, Professor Tanya Lurman at Stanford University who's done really interesting, uh, research and is having listened to in great detail, but I interviewed her, um, who, who, who's shown. So we know recovery from psychosis or schizophrenia is much stronger in African countries than it is in the United States. Right? And it's not a genetic thing because Africans who come to the United States end up having the American level of recovery, not the African level of recovery.

Speaker 1:          01:37          And again, it's a while since I spoke turnout, I don't want to overstate my confidence about this, but there are other people, there are people I think including her who argue in part. What's going on is in many, not all. Some places it's really brutal, but in many parts of Africa, you remain part of the community. Even if you have these mental health problems, right? They have much stronger social connections is a study that asks Americans, how many close friends do you have, who you could tend to in a crisis? And when they started doing it years ago, the most common answer was five. Today, the most common answer is none, right? It's not the average, but it's most common answer. Half of all Americans asked, how many people know you? Well say nobody, right? So a huge amount of evidence, loneliness is toxic for human beings.

Speaker 1:          02:21          Lonely people as guided a lot of experiments on this here in la, lonely people exposed to the flu virus and the cold virus and the coulds, um, are way more likely to actually get them to non lonely people, right? Um, it's just devastating for your physical and mental health to be lonely. There's other things going on. So I think there's a whole range of things that are going on with all mental health problems. I don't know how this relates to cannabis and psychosis. I don't want to, I don't know. But we know with psychosis, yeah, there's, there's a big debate about this. Immigrants are more likely to have psychosis. The nonimmigrant says there's a whole, um, lots of environmental factors playing out, even in extreme mental health problems. Like now I wanna stress they're not the only thing. There are real aspects as

Speaker 2:          02:59          well, uh, which are clearly very significant and things like schizophrenia and play some role in things like depression for a lot of people. But, but yeah. Does that make sense? Was it, I mean, sort of, yeah. I mean, obviously there's varying biological factors, but the cultural factors make sense. The fact that these people in Africa are not, they're not expelled from the community, so they have a sense of bond and maybe it's more easy to recover. And one of the things that you hear about, part of the problem with mental illness is that people with Melton mental illness are pushed away. People don't want to deal with their problem, and it exacerbates whatever is causing it in the first place.
