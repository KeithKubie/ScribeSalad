[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.130
SPEAKER 1: Thank you so
much for all coming today.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.810
I thoroughly enjoy
hosting these few talks,

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.320
but I must admit
today is definitely

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.480
one of my highlights.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.688
I've been following "Deliciously
Ella" for some time,

00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:20.780
and really looking forward
to hearing her story.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.347
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ella Mills.

00:00:23.347 --> 00:00:25.335
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.794
Thank you for coming in today.

00:00:29.794 --> 00:00:31.710
Can you please start by
telling us a bit about

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.355
how you came up with
"Delicious Ella," and why?

00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:35.980
ELLA MILLS: First of
all, hi, everyone.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.380
Thank you so much
for coming today.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.990
I'm honored to be
in your offices.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.280
So "Delicious Ella,"
it's a long story,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.650
and I will keep it really
nice and short for you guys.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.830
But I started it really
accidentally, back in 2012.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.150
In 2011, I was at university,
and I got really unwell.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.010
And I spent about four
months in that hospital,

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.010
and I was diagnosed
with a condition called

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.760
postural tachycardia syndrome,
which is quite a mouthful.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.100
And it affects your
autonomic nervous system,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.330
and that affected my
ability to control my heart

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.360
rate, my immune system,
blood pressure, digestion,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.830
and lots of other things.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.170
And so I spent most of
the following year in bed,

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.390
taking steroids and all
kinds of other medication.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.600
And unfortunately, it didn't
really work very well for me,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.860
and I still wasn't able
to kind of maintain

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.830
normal bodily functions.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.880
And which meant I couldn't
really do anything.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.460
And so I really struggled with
the physical side of that,

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.010
but I really struggled with
the mental side of that.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.990
And the kind of isolation of it
and I had quite bad depression.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.990
And I really hit my
personal rock bottom,

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.150
and I realized
that, to be honest,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.741
I was taking all
this medication,

00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:54.990
and I was relying on everybody
else to try to help me.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.700
And I wasn't really doing
much to help myself.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.890
And so I started googling,
as you do, as you guys do.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.140
And I came across
lots of people who

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.340
had used diet and
lifestyles as ways

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.250
of managing all kinds
of different illnesses

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.220
and conditions, and I was
really interested in that.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.200
And I thought that,
that was worth a try.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.160
But I had kind of a couple
of major issues, which was

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.050
that I had no idea how to cook.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.090
And I had no idea
what healthy food was.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.350
So my grand plan was not going
to be executed very well.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.837
And so-- and then,
the third thing

00:02:30.837 --> 00:02:32.670
being the fact that I
was really struggling,

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.220
kind of with any
kind of motivation

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.780
or really interest
in life in general.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.347
And so I decided
what I would do is

00:02:38.347 --> 00:02:39.930
I'd kind of put these
things together,

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.304
and I would start
writing a blog.

00:02:41.304 --> 00:02:43.380
Because then I could
channel some of my time

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.450
into that, rather than
watching the Kardashians,

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.150
and all the other
good stuff on repeat.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.467
And I could learn how
to do food photography,

00:02:50.467 --> 00:02:52.050
and I could learn
how to use a camera,

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.690
and I can learn all
about editing pictures,

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.650
and then also using a
blog, writing a blog.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.260
And at the same time, I
would learn how to cook,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.550
and I'd learn how to put
these meals together.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.820
And the WordPress site needed
a name, and my name is Ella.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.280
And I was about as
unimaginative as to think

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.290
that hopefully the
food will be delicious,

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.920
and that's "Deliciously Ella."

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.240
And people ask me all the
time where the name came from,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.380
and I always want to come up
with a really clever, genius

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.880
reply.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.010
And I'm just like no.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.590
10 seconds of lack
of thought actually.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.210
Great.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.020
And so I started writing,
and, to be honest,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.710
I was super skeptical
when I started.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.500
And I had this image that
healthy food all meant

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.440
iceberg lettuce, and grated
carrots, and cucumbers

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.360
and that's kind of my
worst nightmare food,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.780
actually still is.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.790
And I didn't want it to be that.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.287
And so I started writing,
and I started creating,

00:03:53.287 --> 00:03:55.620
and I started playing around
the kitchen, experimenting,

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.440
and I really, really enjoyed it.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.300
And so I was recording on this
online, and to start with,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.880
my mom was definitely
my only reader.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.840
And probably at her book club.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.480
And then it started to grow,
and it grew really slowly

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.530
in the first six months.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.200
I had 100,000 hits, but
in the second six months,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.302
I had 900,000.

00:04:17.302 --> 00:04:19.260
That was really interesting,
because I've never

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.339
tried to do anything with that.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:21.760
And that was like
really organic growth

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.680
through friends and friends.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.090
And there was a
map, and you could

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.673
see where people
were reading it from,

00:04:25.673 --> 00:04:29.300
and it was no longer
kind of UK, America, then

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.766
sort of the rest of Europe.

00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:32.140
It was suddenly
all these places,

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.790
like in the middle
of the Pacific.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.250
I knew no one in my
mom's book club was that.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.199
So it couldn't just
be them refreshing it.

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.240
And so there were really
people engaging with it,

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.460
and I was really enjoying it.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.376
And it was starting to
really, really help me.

00:04:44.376 --> 00:04:47.250
So I decided that I
would take it further,

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.060
and I started
doing social media.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.600
Which is also great,
but on a personal level,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.310
just inspired me
to keep cooking.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.890
And I think there's always
such a link between anything

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.780
being sustainable and
it being enjoyable.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.450
And the more I was doing,
and trying new things,

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.480
and getting better at it,
the more I enjoyed it.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.350
And the more
sustainable it became.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.147
And then when I started
doing social media,

00:05:08.147 --> 00:05:09.730
that's when it started
really growing.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.300
And then people said, oh do
you teach cooking classes?

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.580
And I was like, I have no
idea what I'm doing it.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.130
In no shape or
form am I qualified

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.330
to teach a cooking class.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.150
But I've always tried
to be a yes person,

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.741
and I thought,
yeah let's try it.

00:05:22.741 --> 00:05:23.240
Why not?

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.995
And I found a kitchen an
Old Street that I rented,

00:05:25.995 --> 00:05:28.710
and it's this really
sweet community kitchen.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.195
But it's pretty random, because
there's this big kitchen,

00:05:31.195 --> 00:05:33.320
and then in front of that
is this community center.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.017
And it's filled with lots of
old people having their lunch,

00:05:36.017 --> 00:05:37.600
and their having
their fish and chips.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.570
And I was like come on
through, come to make kale

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.530
with me in the back.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.240
And so I did that for about
six months, and it was great.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.032
And actually, it was the first
time that I realized that--

00:05:49.032 --> 00:05:50.740
I guess from my own
personal perspective,

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.656
the power of the internet
in what I was doing.

00:05:52.656 --> 00:05:55.870
Because they'd sell
out within 24 hours

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.900
each time, just through
putting them on my channels,

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.950
which was amazing.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.842
And so then, after I
did that, I decided

00:06:01.842 --> 00:06:04.050
I'd test it further, because
the cooking classes were

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.700
quite small.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.770
It was 10 to 14
people in a class.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.650
So although that was
great, it wasn't really

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.149
a great way of
seeing whether or not

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:12.250
this was a more viable
business, and such

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.880
a small number of people.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.210
So I decided that I
would do an app next,

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.772
because I felt that
while blogs are great,

00:06:18.772 --> 00:06:20.730
and it's been an amazing
place for me to start,

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:21.889
but they're quite annoying.

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:23.430
If you want to make
dinner, you don't

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.596
want to have to scroll
through 30 pages of something

00:06:25.596 --> 00:06:27.050
to find your idea.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.620
So I thought I would do a
really simple recipe app.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.756
And so I created that,
thinking that would

00:06:31.756 --> 00:06:33.130
be a really long
time investment,

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.620
and it would take a long
time to earn the money back.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.717
And it was the polar
opposite, and overnight it

00:06:38.717 --> 00:06:41.050
went to number one in food
and drink in the iTunes store

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.910
in the UK and the
US, and it stayed

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.880
in the top three of the UK food
and drink really ever since,

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.890
and that was 2014.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.180
So that's been amazing.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.471
And then after that came out,
and that did really well,

00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:53.620
someone approached
me to write a book.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.490
Which was also hilarious,
because I was like, again,

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.340
I don't really know if
I'm qualified to do this.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.010
But in the spirit of
saying yes, I said yes.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.020
And wrote my first
book, and that

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.662
was something, where again
I remember saying to my mom,

00:07:07.662 --> 00:07:08.870
what do you think about this?

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.036
Do you think this will work?

00:07:10.036 --> 00:07:12.965
And she was like, yeah, I bet
you can sell 1,000 copies.

00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:15.340
And I was like, yeah we can
definitely sell 1,000 copies,

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.380
and we're now about over
1.2 million copies later.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:25.060
So I'm proud that we finally
exceeded her expectations.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.770
And we turned 20
languages, and it's

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.936
been in New York Times Best
Sellers, and since then,

00:07:28.936 --> 00:07:31.750
two other number one
best selling cookbooks.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.390
I met my husband a couple of
months after the book came out,

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.100
and it was one of those
things that, it was amazing.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.417
And it took off overnight,
and that was incredible.

00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:41.750
But it kind of have gone from
being a small, niche thing

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.610
that I was doing at my
parents' kitchen, on my time,

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:45.517
on my schedule.

00:07:45.517 --> 00:07:47.350
And suddenly it was out
there, and the press

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:48.724
are talking about
you, and people

00:07:48.724 --> 00:07:50.590
start talking about
you, rather than to you.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:54.360
From a personal perspective,
that was quite a strange thing.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.320
I'd also really struggled
with self-esteem,

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.528
and self-confidence, and
everything while I was sick.

00:07:58.528 --> 00:08:01.000
And I'm not sure
I was completely,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.590
really in the right
place for all this

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:03.844
to necessarily be happening.

00:08:03.844 --> 00:08:05.260
And I was quite
overwhelmed by it.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:06.130
And although it was
really exciting,

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.680
the opportunities
were amazing, I

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.350
was quite anxious about it all.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.370
And I met Matt, who's my husband
and our business partner,

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:13.010
as well.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:14.718
And we started talking
about it, and then

00:08:14.718 --> 00:08:17.123
we started work-- this
is the longest answer

00:08:17.123 --> 00:08:18.724
to your question, I'm sorry.

00:08:18.724 --> 00:08:20.140
SPEAKER 1: That's
OK, that's fine.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.348
ELLA MILLS: Talking forever--

00:08:21.348 --> 00:08:23.340
but we started talking
about it, because I

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.600
was feeling like i was
quite outside my control.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.304
And it just snowballed,
and he, a bit

00:08:28.304 --> 00:08:30.220
older, and had been doing
business development

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.190
and finance, and so had a
much better understanding

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.080
of how things actually
work than I did.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.590
I just love cooking, I love
food, I love communicating,

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:39.360
I love visuals.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.380
And I was so enjoying
creating the brand,

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.463
and doing all the events
and everything around it.

00:08:43.463 --> 00:08:45.640
But I didn't really
understand spreadsheets

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.970
or any of the practical
stuff, and so Matt and I

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.240
started working together.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.490
And he really drove the
business development forward,

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.073
and I stayed working really on
the creative side and the brand

00:08:55.073 --> 00:08:56.314
side.

00:08:56.314 --> 00:08:57.730
And that's been
amazing, and we've

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:00.310
decided we'd take it further,
and see whether or not

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.740
we could take what was
so successful online,

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:07.180
and make it work on something
a little bit more tangible.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:12.310
So we opened our first
deli site in December 2015,

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.130
so just over a year ago.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.570
And that was hilarious, again
that was a real experiment,

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.650
and we wanted to
take the cheapest

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.390
rent that we could
find in London

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.387
that was vaguely accessible.

00:09:24.387 --> 00:09:26.470
It's on a small street
called Seymour place, which

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.440
is-- we always say
Marylebone, it's really not.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.350
It's Edgware Road, it's
like prime shisha-ville.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.820
And that's not really much
footfall on that street,

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.430
but the rents was
really, really good.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.509
By a long way, the
best thing we'd found.

00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:39.550
And its like a seven minute
walk from Selfridges,

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.140
it's a three minute
walk from Marble Arch,

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.790
so it's a good location,
but it just doesn't

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.081
have a huge amount of footfall.

00:09:44.081 --> 00:09:47.770
And neither of us
had ever run anything

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:49.739
like this before
in our life, and we

00:09:49.739 --> 00:09:51.280
didn't have the
money, at that point,

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.350
to hire any managers who
knew better than we did.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.470
And so we opened
it, and in four days

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.560
we had like 80 RQs out the door.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.540
We were like, go away.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.440
We don't know what
to do with you.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.232
But it was amazing.

00:10:04.232 --> 00:10:06.273
And so for the first two
months we were in there,

00:10:06.273 --> 00:10:08.634
we literally had a system
where I would do the tills.

00:10:08.634 --> 00:10:10.550
And so you'd come in,
and I could talk to you,

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.520
and learn a little bit more
about you, and what you wanted,

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.930
and what you were interested in,
what you thought of the food.

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.169
And Matt was the cleaner, and
he cleaned everyone's plates.

00:10:17.169 --> 00:10:18.960
And so he could find
out what your thoughts

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.230
were after you had it.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:23.230
And, although it was like-- it
was a completely insane couple

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.660
of months, because the same
time I was finishing my book,

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.493
and then started promotion
for my next book,

00:10:27.493 --> 00:10:30.150
and started a book tour,
and doing those events.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.149
But then we will
also like managers,

00:10:32.149 --> 00:10:33.190
we were doing everything.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:34.770
And after 3 and
1/2 weeks, our chef

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.022
quit, because she said
she wanted to Barcelona,

00:10:37.022 --> 00:10:38.730
and she didn't want
to be a chef anymore.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:39.564
And I was like--

00:10:39.564 --> 00:10:40.980
Matt was really
sick with the fly,

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.750
and I was standing on
the street outside,

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.083
just watching all these people
queuing up, and I'm like,

00:10:45.083 --> 00:10:46.890
you're joking.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.930
So anyway, then we
started hiring people,

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.540
and that's when things changed.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.610
And that was really amazing.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.380
But it did, of
course, small sites,

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.880
so we really quickly decided
on finding our next site, which

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.070
we opened mid last year.

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:02.750
And then we'll open our next
site in a couple of weeks time.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.500
So the second one is
on Weighhouse Street,

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.020
which is just where
crossrails are going by,

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:06.810
up on street tube.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.510
And then, the third
site is in Herne Hill.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.759
It's all funded, and that's
it, really, on the site front.

00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:15.300
That's kind of what we want to
use as our marketing suite, is

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.674
places where people can come
in, they can feel the brand,

00:11:17.674 --> 00:11:18.950
they can touch the brand.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:20.885
But where we're really
scaling is in product.

00:11:20.885 --> 00:11:22.260
So we launched
our first product,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.480
which is our energy balls.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.240
Which is the most popular
recipe on the blog,

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.780
and had been in the delis, and
we launched that last August.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:34.060
And we're really lucky to
have the platform that we did,

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.730
and people were really
receptive to it,

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.760
so we've gone into
2,500 stores already

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.434
with an enough for 6 months.

00:11:40.434 --> 00:11:41.850
So we're in places
like Starbucks,

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:43.680
as well as Waitrose,
Sainsbury's, Holland

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.680
and Barrett, WHsmith's, Ocardo.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.200
And then places like Selfridges
and Fortnum and Mason.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.720
And then we've got
two more recipes

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.820
that we're adding
next week, and then

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.180
a whole new range that sits
outside out snacking, coming

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:57.980
in August.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.070
So that's the longest
answer to your question.

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:01.930
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.305
ELLA MILLS: But that's how
"Deliciously Ella" came about,

00:12:04.305 --> 00:12:06.330
and what it is now.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.030
SPEAKER 1: You've been busy.

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:12.345
So going back to your
diet, before you changed it

00:12:12.345 --> 00:12:15.692
to more of a plant-based diet,
what were you eating before?

00:12:15.692 --> 00:12:17.400
ELLA MILLS: To be
honest, I didn't really

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.260
think much about it before.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.232
It was just something--

00:12:21.232 --> 00:12:23.190
I'd always enjoyed food,
and if you said to me,

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:24.810
Ella, do you want to come to
this delicious restaurant,

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.143
I made you this delicious thing.

00:12:26.143 --> 00:12:28.140
I'd be really appreciative
and really enjoy it,

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.030
but it wasn't
something that I really

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.054
would think of outside of that.

00:12:32.054 --> 00:12:33.720
And I ate anything
and everything,

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.340
but I also never
really connected

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.366
what you ate, and the
impact on how you feel,

00:12:37.366 --> 00:12:39.240
and your energy levels,
and things like that.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.560
So yeah, people would be
like, oh you are what you eat.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.130
And I was like, well, I
eat a lot gummy bears.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.990
So I know I never
really believed it.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.500
And then, as I said reading,
and learning, and understanding

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.126
more about how the
human body works,

00:12:54.126 --> 00:12:56.000
and then all about the
different compositions

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.208
of different foods, and the
reasons why it would make

00:12:58.208 --> 00:13:00.370
sense to eat things
like broccoli.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:02.595
I started to have an
appreciation for it,

00:13:02.595 --> 00:13:04.511
and that's really where
my interests came.

00:13:04.511 --> 00:13:05.760
So it was a really big change.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.551
And also as a student
when I changed terms.

00:13:07.551 --> 00:13:10.470
So although-- my
mom gets so upset,

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.770
because I'm doing interviews,
and they're like, so

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.306
did you eat really
badly beforehand?

00:13:14.306 --> 00:13:15.930
And I'd be like,
yeah, it wasn't great.

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:19.028
And she'll read it, and be like,
I just sound like the worst

00:13:19.028 --> 00:13:20.462
mother ever.

00:13:20.462 --> 00:13:23.119
All you talk about
Haribo, like that is not

00:13:23.119 --> 00:13:24.160
the only thing I fed you.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.570
But I was so resistant
to fruit and vegetables.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.590
Her best story ever
to tell everyone,

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:32.940
now that I do what I do, is
that-- there's four of us,

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.100
and the other three was
so much better than I was.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.879
And I would refuse to
eat basically any fruit

00:13:37.879 --> 00:13:39.670
and vegetable, but
every now and again when

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.220
she'd get really
upset about it, I'd

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.680
be like, no, no I like bananas,
you know I like bananas.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.150
She's like, well, then eat one.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.380
So I would chop it up, and
I'd just slice it really,

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:47.963
really thinly.

00:13:47.963 --> 00:13:50.276
And I make concentric
circles on a big plate,

00:13:50.276 --> 00:13:51.900
and then I'd do eeny,
meeny, miny, moe.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.050
But it wouldn't be
like eeny, meeny, miny,

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:55.133
moe I will eat you, it was
eeny, meeny, miny, moe,

00:13:55.133 --> 00:13:56.100
I will not eat you.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.942
And then that would
go on another plate

00:13:58.942 --> 00:14:00.900
to make circles until
there was one piece left,

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.010
and then I would eat that.

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:03.450
So it was a resistance game

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:04.532
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:04.532 --> 00:14:06.490
It was like an hour and
a half to eat a banana.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.960
And she tells the story to
anyone and everyone now,

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.939
she loves it so much.

00:14:10.939 --> 00:14:12.480
And yeah, it was a
really big change,

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.450
going from someone who's
eating like everything.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:20.340
From just sandwiches, and
bagels, and a lot of ice cream,

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:24.000
and candy, and cereal, but
just never kind of putting--

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.590
I'm sure I got my
five a day like once

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.800
a month, like five a
month, rather than a day.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.280
And I just wasn't really
connecting to fresh food,

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.410
and I never really thought
about the impact of it.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.660
So then, I think everyone
was really confused,

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.874
and I said, oh I'm really
interested in a vegan diet.

00:14:39.874 --> 00:14:42.040
And everyone was like, but
you don't eat vegetables,

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:42.987
so you'll die.

00:14:42.987 --> 00:14:43.901
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:43.901 --> 00:14:46.560
What are you going to eat?

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.520
Just like plain
pasta, and that's it.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.040
So I was like, I should
really think about that.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.300
My mom was like, oh gosh,
where is this going to go?

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.419
And I told my then
boyfriend-- who is great,

00:14:56.419 --> 00:14:58.710
but who isn't always reflected
that well in the story--

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.510
that I was going to
start a food blog.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.385
And he was like, that's
the worst idea I ever

00:15:02.385 --> 00:15:06.170
heard, you don't cook, you're
not interested in food,

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.140
like why would anybody
ever read that?

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.490
It is so ironic now that it's
had over 100 million hits,

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.764
and people really like it.

00:15:13.764 --> 00:15:16.860
But, it wasn't something
that I'd really connected to

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.722
before, it was, from a
positive perspective,

00:15:19.722 --> 00:15:21.180
it was a really,
really big change.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.112
And it was hard as well,
because I didn't really

00:15:24.112 --> 00:15:24.820
know how to cook.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.490
And so the first things I
cooked were pretty gross.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.545
And one night-- I didn't
really know anything

00:15:30.545 --> 00:15:32.420
about quinoa and kale,
let alone almond milk,

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.120
and so to start with I was
like, OK, well, porridge

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.790
seems like an obvious
swap from cereals.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:41.170
Because I was mainly eating
Cheerios-type cereals.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:44.510
And I didn't really know
about almond milk and things

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.510
like that, so I was just
eating basically gruel.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:50.350
It was just oats and
water, not very nice.

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:54.530
And things like that, so it
took me a while to really start

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:58.140
to enjoy it, because I
think enjoying something

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.590
is so key to sustainability.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:02.450
And what I was
cooking, I don't think

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:04.580
anyone would have
found enjoyable,

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:05.842
for the first few months.

00:16:05.842 --> 00:16:07.550
SPEAKER 1: So what
point, and which dish,

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.450
did you taste and think,
wow, this is really nice,

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.500
and I can carry
on eating this Way

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.537
ELLA MILLS: Yeah, I think
it was probably just

00:16:14.537 --> 00:16:17.120
after a couple of months, once
I was feeling a little bit more

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.340
comfortable with it.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:22.870
And it was just little things,
but I think it wasn't until I

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.370
had a grasp on the whole thing.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.902
Even the sweet things, like
I'm a big fan of saying,

00:16:27.902 --> 00:16:29.735
I don't think you should
ever feel deprived.

00:16:29.735 --> 00:16:31.790
So I think if you do
want to something sweet,

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:33.140
you should try and
have something sweet,

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.765
rather than like
always suppressing it,

00:16:34.765 --> 00:16:37.580
and then just been craving
it so much that you

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.920
have like seven bags of Haribo.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.590
So I didn't really know how to
do that, I didn't love fruit,

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.780
and I'd never come across
things like dates before,

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:51.301
and so I just hadn't really
put two and two together.

00:16:51.301 --> 00:16:52.800
But once I started
doing that, and I

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.890
started learning to make things,
like the energy bills and stuff

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.510
like that, that made a
really big difference.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.400
Because then, if I
wanted something sweet,

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.350
I could have something
sweet, and that just

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:05.304
changed the whole enjoyability
factor of everything.

00:17:05.304 --> 00:17:06.970
SPEAKER 1: And so,
as well as your diet,

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:10.921
what else were you changing
with your lifestyle?

00:17:10.921 --> 00:17:12.920
ELLA MILLS: I guess it's
quite cheesy, isn't it?

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.569
But it was like a kind of--

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:17.060
I'm a big believer, that
I think feeling good.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.069
I think diet plays a
really big role in it,

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:21.079
but I don't think it's
the be-all and end-all,

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:23.829
and I think sometimes we
put too much pressure on it.

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:26.599
And I think feeling good comes
from every aspect of your life,

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:28.569
from managing things
like exercises.

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:31.550
By exercise, I don't necessarily
mean going to a boot camp,

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:35.140
but just like moving and walking
and kind of getting outside.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:39.137
And managing stress levels,
and sleep, and relationships,

00:17:39.137 --> 00:17:41.220
both with yourself and
with the people around you.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.680
And I just kind of
generally creating a more,

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.070
I guess more positive
space around you,

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:47.330
makes such a big difference.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.220
And so I guess I
try to kind of shape

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.884
and focus on all those
different aspects of my life.

00:17:53.884 --> 00:17:55.800
So I got into things
like meditation and yoga,

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.258
which is like the
most cheesy thing

00:17:57.258 --> 00:17:58.880
ever for like a health writer.

00:18:01.337 --> 00:18:03.170
SPEAKER 1: And so you've
touched on earlier,

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:05.295
when did you notice that
"Deliciously Ella" started

00:18:05.295 --> 00:18:07.520
to get more of a following
than you expected?

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.840
And why do you think that was?

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.040
Why do you think the
masses turned to your blog.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.255
ELLA MILLS: Yeah, I think--

00:18:14.255 --> 00:18:15.880
I'd love to take
credit for everything,

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.910
but I think timing is such
a big element of anything.

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.730
I think so much success
comes down to timing,

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.540
and I think it was
something I think people--

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.980
there's been so many things,
you know all the things

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.770
you read every time about sugar,
everyone talking about, well,

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.680
now you're 10 a day, the impact
of the Mediterranean diet,

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.970
there's so much.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:37.850
And then at the same time having
like a global obesity crisis,

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.820
and all the problems of
having NHS, and things

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.230
like the cost of
type 2 diabetes.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:45.932
And all these-- lots of
lifestyle-related illnesses

00:18:45.932 --> 00:18:47.390
and things that
we're having that's

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:48.980
getting a lot of
attention, I think.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.530
And also the food industry
is quite confusing,

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:54.020
it's become quite complicated,
things about crisis of food.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:58.260
And I think the debate had
become quite intense around it,

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.050
so I think people were becoming
very interested in the way they

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:04.260
ate, and aware of how much
sugar, how much salt was

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.180
in everything.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.217
And so but I don't think
there was much in it.

00:19:09.217 --> 00:19:11.300
I mean, when I decided I
wanted to change my diet,

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.980
and I was really
interested in this,

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.820
I went online and
went on Amazon.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:18.470
And I was trying to
find some inspiration.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.510
I would never, ever have
done "Deliciously Ella"

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:22.354
if that day I'd found
some good inspiration.

00:19:22.354 --> 00:19:24.020
And I would never be
sitting here today,

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.540
because I would've
just used what I found.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.950
I didn't find anything.

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:30.920
The only book that I
found was a paperback,

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.620
basically just like a novel,
there was no pictures in it.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.725
And then there was
things like almond pate,

00:19:35.725 --> 00:19:38.450
and I was like, oh come on.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.820
That's like all those
kind of old stereotypes

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.860
of vegetarianism, it's
like super hippie.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.490
Yeah, you do yoga,
and meditate, and you

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:48.800
don't shave your armpits,
and eat almond pate.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.100
It's not exactly very
aspirational, or fun,

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.217
or exciting.

00:19:53.217 --> 00:19:55.050
And it was just that
there were no pictures.

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.470
There was just nothing
to make it engaging.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:59.895
And yeah, that
was my inspiration

00:19:59.895 --> 00:20:01.520
for starting "Deliciously
Ella," I just

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.500
didn't feel like there
was that much there.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:04.970
And I think-- you
read all these things.

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.136
I was reading all these
books and all these studies,

00:20:07.136 --> 00:20:08.870
and I was so interested
in the science,

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:10.670
find it in the nutrition,
and understanding

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.070
how the body works, and why
it would make sense for--

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.710
like a car, so give
it the right fuel.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.810
But I was finding I'd get
to the end of the book,

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:19.601
and then sometimes it'd
have recipes in it.

00:20:19.601 --> 00:20:21.740
It that literally like
kale wrapped in chard

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.950
with a cucumber stick inside
it, it was just so healthy,

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:25.940
and it was so green.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.590
And this was talking
to someone that

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.910
ate loads of burgers,
and pizza, and ice cream,

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:33.590
and I could not go from burger,
and pizza, and ice cream

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.540
to raw kale three times a day.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.140
It's just too much.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.836
And I felt like there
was really a space,

00:20:39.836 --> 00:20:41.210
or like a middle
ground, that was

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:44.330
trying to take this idea
of eating your five a day,

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.670
eating your ten a day,
eating more fiber,

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:48.460
celebrating vegetables.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.450
But in a way that
was actually as

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.790
simple as possible,
as quick as possible,

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:54.860
and hopefully delicious.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.800
And making it just
a bit more fun.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.715
And I always say that
that's my number one

00:20:59.715 --> 00:21:01.340
aim, is I want to
make vegetables cool.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.420
You don't need to
be a vegan, you

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.410
don't need to be a vegetarian,
you don't to be an anything.

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:05.720
It's not about
labeling yourself,

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.180
it's just about trying to have a
bit more of this kind of stuff.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.890
And it's never going to
happen if we don't change

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:10.910
the way we think about it.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.130
I read that-- well, everyone
would have read all the stuff

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:14.180
about your ten a
day, and then I read

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.355
this really interesting
article in The Guardian

00:21:16.355 --> 00:21:17.614
like a week later.

00:21:17.614 --> 00:21:19.780
The journalist was like, I
tried to do my ten a day,

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.738
it was the most miserable
thing I've ever done.

00:21:21.738 --> 00:21:24.950
And he was literally just eating
a big carrot out of a bag,

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.460
because he was like, I
don't know how to do it.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.860
He ate like seven clementines
one day, and he just--

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:31.780
and I understand it.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.920
And I think everyone's the
same, if we don't change

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.500
our mindset with how we
put a plate together,

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.574
it's never gonna change.

00:21:37.574 --> 00:21:39.740
And you know, you go to so
many amazing restaurants,

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.980
where the food is so good,
the chef's so talented,

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.205
and you eat amazing,
appetizing dish after another.

00:21:44.205 --> 00:21:46.080
And then you get to the
bottom, and it's just

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.730
spinach and broccoli.

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:51.390
Like is anybody here excited
about steamed broccoli?

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:53.280
I mean I'm not, and
I love vegetables.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.820
Like it's not gonna
get people excited.

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.800
And that's why I realize,
and I think that.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.540
From what I understand,
that's been the success

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.498
of "Deliciously Ella,"
is trying to give people

00:22:01.498 --> 00:22:04.460
a way of eating broccoli,
sauteed in garlic and chili,

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.320
with sesame and
tahini, or something

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.840
like that, that actually makes
you maybe want to have it.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.298
And that's why I'm
saying, you only

00:22:10.298 --> 00:22:11.990
need to eat broccoli--
absolutely not.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:14.198
But if you are ever going
to include it in your diet,

00:22:14.198 --> 00:22:17.352
in a sustainable way,
it's got to switch

00:22:17.352 --> 00:22:18.560
and it's got to be enjoyable.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:22.530
And I think there was such
a lack of that around.

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:24.780
And I think that's
been the success of it.

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.870
And I think the story
helped, like I've always

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:30.170
tried to be as open and honest
as I could be with anybody

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.075
and everyone about
my own journey,

00:22:32.075 --> 00:22:33.450
and why I got
interested in this.

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.616
And I think that helps,
because sometimes again, you

00:22:35.616 --> 00:22:37.959
read things and you're
like, I could never do that.

00:22:37.959 --> 00:22:40.250
Because it feels like people
have been doing it forever

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:41.416
and it's quite intimidating.

00:22:41.416 --> 00:22:43.530
And like I was really
a Haribo person,

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:47.155
and I think it's the idea of,
if you could do it, I can do it.

00:22:47.155 --> 00:22:49.280
SPEAKER 1: So, you're going
to come up with a vegan

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.196
version of Haribo then?

00:22:52.196 --> 00:22:54.680
ELLA MILLS: No, I think
there's enough people doing

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.750
things like that already.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.150
SPEAKER 1: So then what are your
tips on being an entrepreneur

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:04.607
and growing a business?

00:23:04.607 --> 00:23:06.440
ELLA MILLS: The best
piece of advice anybody

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.290
ever gave me, which
really resonated with me,

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:10.850
was to be an optimist.

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:12.830
Which always seems like
probably a silly answer

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:15.080
to obviously such a big
question, which obviously does

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.760
involve important things,
like your cash flow

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.635
and things like that.

00:23:17.635 --> 00:23:22.000
But actually, I think that when
you're starting something out,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.897
which is going to
be 3,000 problems,

00:23:23.897 --> 00:23:25.730
and you're going to be
really small compared

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:26.927
to everybody else.

00:23:26.927 --> 00:23:29.010
We're really a small
business, we're a small team,

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:30.230
we have a small budget.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:32.570
And then we're dealing
with big businesses,

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:35.420
with big budgets, and big
teams who don't always

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.910
care about the small businesses,
although people claim they do.

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:40.820
And how do you go out--

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.830
and not take out the
big stakeholders.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:45.330
Like how do you go and compete
with a company that's already

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:46.549
been trading for 12 years?

00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:48.590
And they do now have a
bit of a marketing budget,

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:50.010
people do know how they are.

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:52.214
And I think being an
optimist is so important,

00:23:52.214 --> 00:23:53.630
because you've got
to always think

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.280
that you can find a solution.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.590
I think you have to be a
bit naive and a bit crazy

00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:00.170
in lots of ways, because
if someone had sat me down

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:01.670
and said like, let
me just list you,

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:03.470
maybe like the 12
biggest problems you're

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:04.610
going to have in the next year.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.770
I would've been like, OK,
I'm not going to do this.

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:08.186
I'm going to keep
writing my blog,

00:24:08.186 --> 00:24:10.190
because that is so much easier.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.490
And I'll do collaborations
with this and I'll do that,

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.050
and maybe I'll license my name,
but I'm not doing it myself.

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:17.560
But actually having done it, I
wouldn't do it any other way.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.450
But it's so scary, and there's
so many different things

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:21.040
to deal with.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.050
And even things, like I
said, after 3 and 1/2 weeks

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:26.510
of trading, we still don't--

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:29.275
just beginning to find our
feet, and then the chef's

00:24:29.275 --> 00:24:30.650
like, no I'm moving
to Barcelona,

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:32.740
I don't really want
to do this anymore.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.662
And you have to be like, bye.

00:24:34.662 --> 00:24:36.370
I'm not going to have
a mental breakdown,

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.922
I'm just going to try
to find a solution.

00:24:38.922 --> 00:24:40.880
And there's just been so
many things like that.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.289
Like the day before we were
meant to leave for a wedding,

00:24:43.289 --> 00:24:45.080
and I had to go on my
book tour in America,

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.080
and then we were
going to a wedding.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.240
So basically, I was not
really here for a month,

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:55.100
and that same chef, who
was tricky, was leaving.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.484
And she just
couldn't be bothered

00:24:57.484 --> 00:24:58.650
for the last couple of days.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:01.980
And so she got to the point
that she literally sent--

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.860
there was a third of
the food we were meant

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.990
to have for that day, and
there was one dessert,

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.948
we normally have eight.

00:25:06.948 --> 00:25:09.050
And someone had misread
the recipe, instead

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.350
of it being oats, it
was coconut chips.

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:14.075
They picked up the desserts,
and the bottom ledge

00:25:14.075 --> 00:25:14.974
went on the floor.

00:25:14.974 --> 00:25:15.890
And I was like, right.

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:17.598
So we've got on
Saturday, our busiest day

00:25:17.598 --> 00:25:19.670
of trading, we really
need these numbers,

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:23.140
because we're about to pay a
deposit for our second site.

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.814
And we have no food,
and we have no dessert,

00:25:25.814 --> 00:25:27.980
because the only dessert,
the bottom just falls off.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.530
And you just have to find a
way to be so positive and so

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:31.950
creative about it.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:35.450
And I think-- yeah, we've
gone from a team of 44 people

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:39.000
to 60 people in 18 months, and
that comes with so many growing

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:39.500
pains.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.000
Like we're trying
to find an office,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.440
and we've been
outbid three times.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.320
Even when we got into
legal, someone comes

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.430
and they just have that bit
more money, and we're like,

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:48.513
we need an office, our
lease is up in three weeks,

00:25:48.513 --> 00:25:49.580
we don't have a space.

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:52.640
But we're small, we
can't afford to be like,

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.580
yeah we'll give you that extra
15,000 pounds, we don't have.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:58.319
And so I think, just trying
to always have a smile,

00:25:58.319 --> 00:26:00.110
and always be like,
yeah that's a solution,

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.730
rather than get sucked
into the problem.

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:03.855
Because as soon as you get
sucked into the problem,

00:26:03.855 --> 00:26:06.235
you're gonna have five other
problems in the same day.

00:26:06.235 --> 00:26:08.360
Even if they're minor ones,
they're still problems.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.340
And so trying to
just be optimistic,

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.520
and always feeling
like there's an answer.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.960
And that's being my number one.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.650
And That I think
the second one is

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:19.280
people, and recognizing
where your strengths are,

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.270
and where they're not.

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:22.188
I was so young when I
started my business,

00:26:22.188 --> 00:26:23.896
I'm the first person
to acknowledge that.

00:26:23.896 --> 00:26:26.851
And as much as I feel like I
know "Deliciously Ella" better

00:26:26.851 --> 00:26:28.850
than anybody, and therefore
I think our audience

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:29.766
better than everybody.

00:26:29.766 --> 00:26:31.362
And that is a big
audience, and I

00:26:31.362 --> 00:26:33.320
think I have a good
understanding of the space,

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.960
and I love creating the
brand and the communication

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.740
and everything.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.050
I've never worked
in an FMCG business

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:41.360
before, I don't know it.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.354
And Matt had worked
in finance, and he'd

00:26:43.354 --> 00:26:45.020
worked in business
development, and he'd

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.320
done lots of other things,
but neither did he.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.289
And so actually, going
out and to hire--

00:26:50.289 --> 00:26:51.830
so we went and hired
this amazing guy

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:54.650
called Dan, who was the head of
innovation at Innocent Drinks.

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:56.901
And he came to be the MD of
that side of our business,

00:26:56.901 --> 00:26:58.858
and that was the best
decision we've ever made.

00:26:58.858 --> 00:27:01.255
And it's quite scary, because
you're bringing someone in.

00:27:01.255 --> 00:27:03.380
And I've done it all on my
own up until this point.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.840
And I was like, wait what,
now you tell me what to do,

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.580
that's strange.

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:08.840
It's my name, it's my face.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.790
But actually it's the best thing
that we could have ever done,

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:13.250
because he has experience,
understanding, and knowledge

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:15.730
that we can't even begin
to pretend that we have.

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:17.570
And we've now been
doing this 18 months,

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:20.560
I can't compare to 15
years of experience.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.180
And so I think trying to
take as much of a step

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.729
back and get the best
people that you can get,

00:27:26.729 --> 00:27:28.520
I think that makes the
world of difference.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.799
Because Matt always says,
which people always laugh at,

00:27:31.799 --> 00:27:34.340
but I think it's trying to be
the dumbest person in the room.

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.294
Like surround yourself
with the best people

00:27:36.294 --> 00:27:38.710
that you can learn from, and
that you can get better from,

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:40.850
and that can help you be
the better version of you,

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:42.860
and therefore your company
be the better version

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.210
of your company.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:46.880
Rather than saying like,
no this is my thing,

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.639
and really holding on to that.

00:27:48.639 --> 00:27:50.180
SPEAKER 1: Have
there been any points

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:52.501
where you thought, no I
really want to go this way,

00:27:52.501 --> 00:27:54.500
and you've been persuaded
to go a different way?

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.090
Or you stuck t your values.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:57.230
ELLA MILLS: Yeah, well,
when Matt and I started

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:58.813
working together,
we made an agreement

00:27:58.813 --> 00:28:00.850
that with any big
decision we would

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:03.290
both have to agree on it fully.

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:06.349
And if one person didn't 100%
agree, then we wouldn't do it.

00:28:06.349 --> 00:28:08.640
So we've had a couple of
moments with things like that,

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.520
especially with finding
different sites.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:14.180
And we were gonna open a site
in a big department store,

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:16.400
and then Matt changed
his mind about an hour

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.870
before we were meant to sign.

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:20.840
And I completely
disagreed with him.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.519
In retrospect, he was right,
and I was definitely not.

00:28:23.519 --> 00:28:25.310
And actually having a
partner in that sense

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:26.994
is great, because
I think sometimes

00:28:26.994 --> 00:28:28.910
it helps give you a new
perspective on things.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:30.770
But, yeah, and
actually honestly,

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.021
like on a personal level,
that was a big ego thing.

00:28:33.021 --> 00:28:35.270
Because obviously I had done
it on my own for a while.

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:37.144
I was like this is my
thing, this is my name,

00:28:37.144 --> 00:28:38.130
this is my face.

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:41.000
And to just take a step back
and let other people have

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.080
their opinions that can override
yours was quite a strange--

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.520
the first couple of months
of that, was quite strange,

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.680
it was quite an
adjustment for me.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.290
But it's definitely
made everything

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:53.574
that we do so much better.

00:28:53.574 --> 00:28:55.490
SPEAKER 1: And do you
have to take a step back

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:57.031
when you get home,
and say, well, OK,

00:28:57.031 --> 00:29:00.290
that's the business side,
this is now our relationship.

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:02.740
Or do you still talk about
business over dinner?

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:03.980
ELLA MILLS: That's the
only thing we talk about.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:04.896
SPEAKER 1: Oh, really?

00:29:04.896 --> 00:29:05.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.460
ELLA MILLS: We have a
business, watch this face,

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:11.266
I know what's gonna happen
with this relationship.

00:29:11.266 --> 00:29:12.890
I don't know, it's
one of those things,

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:16.790
like I feel every now and again
you just get an opportunity.

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:19.010
And we've done a lot
in the last year,

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:21.680
and I think more
than a lot of people

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.520
who have a lot more
experience than we do,

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.120
being like you're doing too
much, it's not a good idea.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.030
But I just-- it's
so rare in life

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.980
that you get to-- we're
really lucky people

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:34.580
want to work with us now, we get
invited to do amazing things.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.400
And I just think
we're mad to say no.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.540
I don't think--

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.150
And also , when Matt and I
first started really taking it

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:43.980
further into the production,
the sites, and things like that,

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.680
"Deliciously Ella"
was doing very well.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.999
Sure, it was the fastest
selling debut cookbook ever,

00:29:47.999 --> 00:29:49.790
and we were growing
really, really quickly,

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:50.870
and people were
talking about us,

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:52.453
and we were in this
magazine and that.

00:29:52.453 --> 00:29:54.410
And that was great, but
that gets quite boring

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:55.310
after a while.

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:57.310
And if we hadn't have
developed it further,

00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:59.311
I don't think "Deliciously
Ella" would still be

00:29:59.311 --> 00:30:00.560
doing as well as it was today.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.620
I'm not sure I'd necessarily
be sitting here with you guys.

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:05.180
And so actually
again, it was one

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.790
of those things of being
like, here's the opportunity.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:10.130
If we want to take it
further, we just got to do it.

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:12.800
And it also, if we don't do
it now, someone else will.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.410
And the cards were all
in our favor to do it,

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:17.830
so it was just a moment
of running with it.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:21.260
And I think we said quite early
on that we weren't going to--

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.674
and I really respect
everyone who does do it--

00:30:23.674 --> 00:30:25.340
but we were like,
we're going to give up

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.965
on the concept of
a work/life balance

00:30:26.965 --> 00:30:28.690
for the next couple of years.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:30.730
And just say it's
work/life integration.

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:33.200
Like I love what I
do, Matt loves what he

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.855
does, like we love our company.

00:30:34.855 --> 00:30:36.230
And we've but
everything into it,

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:38.630
like our house is
mortgaged against it,

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:43.082
we've borrowed everything
we could from our parents,

00:30:43.082 --> 00:30:45.290
every penny both of us has
earned is in the business.

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:48.050
Like if we go bust,
we're completely screwed,

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:49.670
and our parents will
be very unhappy.

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:56.092
So everything's in it,
and I think we just said,

00:30:56.092 --> 00:30:57.800
it's one of those
things you just, you've

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:58.980
got to take the opportunity.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:00.680
And if it doesn't
work-- and it's just

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.564
come above everything,
and that's weired,

00:31:02.564 --> 00:31:03.980
because obviously
your social life

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:05.480
is like very much
in the back foot.

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.360
Not sure the last time
I saw really friends.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.204
But it's just what it is, and
it's so fun, it's so exciting.

00:31:11.204 --> 00:31:12.620
And how many times
in life are you

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.411
ever gonna get an
opportunity where you can

00:31:14.411 --> 00:31:16.499
hire 60 people in 12 months?

00:31:16.499 --> 00:31:19.040
We're so young, and to be able
to start a business like that,

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.999
and to have Starbucks
take a meeting with you,

00:31:20.999 --> 00:31:23.540
and say we're gonna stock your
products when they're not even

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:24.248
on the shelf yet.

00:31:24.248 --> 00:31:26.300
Like it's so incredible.

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:28.280
And I think we both
felt like we would

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:32.229
be mad to not run with it.

00:31:32.229 --> 00:31:34.020
SPEAKER 1: I'm gonna
ask one more question,

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.180
and then I'm going to
hand it over to you guys.

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:36.440
Sorry.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.830
So what's been the highlight?

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:40.960
ELLA MILLS: So many things.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.910
Honestly, I think our teams are,
like for me, is the highlight.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:45.800
They're just amazing.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.130
And I feel like I've learned
so much from the people

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:52.650
that we work with
over the last year,

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:55.620
and it's been the most amazing
learning experience for me.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:59.840
And like being able-- yeah,
I find it really inspiring.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.120
So on a personal level,
that's probably it.

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.860
On, I guess on a
professional thing,

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.397
in terms of what we've done,
I think going into Starbucks

00:32:06.397 --> 00:32:07.230
is a real highlight.

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:10.030
Although people then said
that we were selling out,

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:12.050
and were a bit upset
online for a little bit.

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:15.570
But to be able to take
a a healthy thing,

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:19.260
and be able to make it
that mainstream is amazing,

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.820
and something that I
think we, as a company,

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.100
we're really, really proud of.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:26.210
And not many people get
the opportunity to do that,

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:30.750
and so to have that was kind
of a real testament to how

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:34.800
far the company has come
and what we we created.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.211
So that was incredible.

00:32:36.211 --> 00:32:37.710
And then I think,
the other one, was

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:40.637
that we did Wilderness Festival
last summer with the deli,

00:32:40.637 --> 00:32:41.970
and we did this big pop-up deli.

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:44.790
And I think-- we weren't
really sure how it would go,

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:50.280
and we did 1.5 metric
tons of food in 36 hours.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.640
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.690
ELLA MILLS: It was
a really intense.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:57.890
That was the-- but it was
amazing, it was so cool.

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:01.601
And to have done that
much food, and people

00:33:01.601 --> 00:33:03.850
would come and be like, why
is there no avocado toast?

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:06.480
And I'm like, we've done
50 kilos of avocado toast

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.160
in an hour.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:12.150
We did not see that coming,
it's a very small town.

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:14.050
And that was really
amazing again,

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:16.110
just because I think
that sometimes you

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:19.101
have those moments where you
realize how well something's

00:33:19.101 --> 00:33:19.600
doing.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.930
And when you get so in
the nitty-gritty of it,

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:24.810
sometimes you get a bit snowed
under with the problems.

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:27.470
Implementation in the
store, development

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:31.740
with this, or a complication
with this, or building

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:32.940
work delays or something.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.650
But actually when
you stand there,

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:38.130
and you see queues that
don't stop for 12 hours,

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:41.770
and getting through that
much food from something

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:46.260
that's not even a third of the
size of this room in 36 hours.

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:49.710
That many people wanting
it, it was just amazing.

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:50.550
So that was--

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:52.187
I really-- Allen,
who's our chef,

00:33:52.187 --> 00:33:53.270
he's the most amazing man.

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:55.964
I was like, please don't
quit, just keep going.

00:33:55.964 --> 00:33:58.380
And then we go to the end, he
was like, I need to go home.

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.640
And I was like, yep!

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.056
Thank you.

00:34:02.056 --> 00:34:04.045
But yeah, that was amazing.

00:34:04.045 --> 00:34:04.920
SPEAKER 1: Fantastic.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.690
All right, I'm just going
to grab some microphones,

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:09.500
and I'll pass these
out to everybody.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:13.990
So who would like to
ask some questions?

00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.962
Wonderful.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.750
AUDIENCE: Hi, just
a quick question,

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:24.730
in terms of how
much it's affected

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:28.704
your health, from having an
illness and sort of helping it

00:34:28.704 --> 00:34:29.920
through food.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.350
It seems that--

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:33.790
I hear a lot of
different conditions,

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:37.300
and how much food helps
people, but you're

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.870
given medication when
you go to the doctors.

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:42.850
Have you done anything-- tried
to do anything down that route,

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:47.860
in terms of changing the
perception from the health

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:48.774
side?

00:34:48.774 --> 00:34:50.440
ELLA MILLS: Yeah,
it's a great question.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:55.040
I mean, no is the short answer.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:35:02.200
But just as more of an answer
is that it's so, so tricky.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:07.010
It's a very emotional,
complicated topic for people.

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:09.360
And I think also that
everybody is different,

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.000
and it's really hard to prove
science behind a lot of this.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.800
A lot of it is anecdotal,
and anecdotes aren't enough

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.600
unfortunately.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.460
So it's really, really tricky.

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.090
But at the moment,
my interest is just

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:28.110
trying to give people the tools,
that if they are interested,

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:29.692
that they may actually do it.

00:35:29.692 --> 00:35:31.150
And they'll enjoy
it, and therefore

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:32.370
hopefully keep doing it.

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:35.246
And I get e-mails and notes
from people every day,

00:35:35.246 --> 00:35:37.120
and it's made such a
big impact in their life

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.244
for very different reasons.

00:35:38.244 --> 00:35:39.920
I meet people all the time.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.650
But as I said, that's
always anecdotal.

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:43.350
I think it's one of
those things that'll

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:45.490
be interesting to see how
we go, because I think

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:47.440
more and more of
those people who

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:50.789
are very interested in this, and
who see real success with it.

00:35:50.789 --> 00:35:52.330
But then there's
more and more people

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:55.240
who are very resistant to
anything that kind of changes

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.230
the status quo, or that's
a little bit controversial.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:00.695
And so I think there's
a bit of a head-to-head

00:36:00.695 --> 00:36:02.320
that I'm sure that
we're going to have,

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.060
maybe in a decade's time.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:05.560
There are a lot of
people who really

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:08.185
want to push forward in I guess
a slightly more holistic sense.

00:36:08.185 --> 00:36:09.540
And that's not to dis--

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.623
doctors are the most amazing
people on the planet,

00:36:11.623 --> 00:36:15.040
like if I'm in a car accident
I don't want a nutritionist.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.590
But I do think there's an
element of working together,

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:19.960
that we miss out so
much of the time.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.250
And is so often is not noted.

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:26.020
It's like the two
remain so separate.

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.742
I took medication
for three years

00:36:27.742 --> 00:36:29.950
until I felt like I was
strong enough to come off it.

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:32.740
And it was 100% the right
thing for me to keep doing,

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:34.435
rather than me being like,
oh I'm not going to take it,

00:36:34.435 --> 00:36:35.560
I'm just going to eat kale.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:39.620
Like I wasn't in a position
for that to be enough.

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:42.461
So I think it's going to be
interesting to see how it plays

00:36:42.461 --> 00:36:44.710
out, because I do think there
are more and more people

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:47.080
who feel very, very
passionate about both sides

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.470
of the argument.

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:51.310
But I think that it will
change as people do so,

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:52.870
but I think that's
also by education,

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:57.040
or more open collaboration
between the side of nutrition

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.480
and conventional medicine.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.430
Because at the moment,
they're so separate.

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:02.560
And so there either needs
to be more education,

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.160
in terms of doctor
training, where

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.760
that includes more nutrition.

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:11.400
Or patients need to have
much easier access to experts

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.740
and people in that field, who
can assist them side by side.

00:37:18.259 --> 00:37:18.800
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.692
So my first question is, you've
hired 60 people in the last 12

00:37:21.692 --> 00:37:22.900
months, are you still hiring?

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.700
ELLA MILLS: Yeah we--

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.560
much, much, much slower now.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:33.740
That was almost all
within six months.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:35.650
So now, I think--

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:37.330
well, we're opening
another site,

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:39.340
and then we're doing
a big two month

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:41.260
pop-up on Liverpool Street.

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.372
So we'll hire quite a
few people around that,

00:37:43.372 --> 00:37:45.080
and we'll expand our
kitchen quite a lot.

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.780
We're doing a lot more
catering and events,

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:47.500
and things like that.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.260
So that's quite a big
growth in that area.

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.710
But I think within
the office scene,

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:52.930
there will probably be about
another eight to 10 people

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:54.346
that we've earmarked,
that we want

00:37:54.346 --> 00:37:57.270
to hire over the next
three to six months.

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:59.892
But so no, it won't keep
growing at that rate,

00:37:59.892 --> 00:38:01.600
but I think probably
by then of the year,

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.396
it will probably
be just over 80.

00:38:04.396 --> 00:38:08.020
AUDIENCE: OK, Interesting
And my other question is--

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:11.160
I'm a firm believer of what
you do, I'm really passionate.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.260
I stopped eating sugar,
and dairy, and yeast,

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.650
and a lot of things.

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:16.906
But what I feel
is like socially,

00:38:16.906 --> 00:38:18.280
I feel like I'm
high maintenance.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.405
I go into a restaurant with
friends, and it's like,

00:38:20.405 --> 00:38:22.030
does this have this or this?

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:24.202
And it sort of stops
me from wanting to go.

00:38:24.202 --> 00:38:25.660
I sort of feel like
eating at home,

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:27.040
and then going to
see my friends.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.715
Like, no I've already
eaten, like play cool.

00:38:29.715 --> 00:38:30.715
Do you know what I mean.

00:38:30.715 --> 00:38:32.048
Have you been in that situation?

00:38:32.048 --> 00:38:33.160
How did you deal with it?

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:36.359
ELLA MILLS: Yeah, I
think that it is tricky.

00:38:36.359 --> 00:38:38.025
I totally agree with
you, it's obviously

00:38:38.025 --> 00:38:39.733
something I feel very
passionately about,

00:38:39.733 --> 00:38:41.470
in terms of more natural food.

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:44.050
But it's not always that easy
when you're out and about.

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:47.794
And for me when I was getting
started, I was much more like,

00:38:47.794 --> 00:38:49.960
I was like, I'll eat at
home and I'll come join you.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.857
And then as I got
better, and I felt

00:38:51.857 --> 00:38:53.440
like everything was
a bit more stable,

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.990
I've relaxed on it more.

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:57.759
And so I'd probably
eat most of the time.

00:38:57.759 --> 00:38:59.800
But then if I'm out for
dinner two nights a week,

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.174
then I'll just be
out for dinner,

00:39:01.174 --> 00:39:03.430
and I'll do the best I can.

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:06.430
But I'll also enjoy
it, and go back

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:08.980
to my green juice
in the morning.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.120
And yeah, try and find
that kind of balance.

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.330
And I guess, for me, and I think
it's different for everyone,

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:14.830
but trying to find
that balance that

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:16.900
makes you happy physically,
but also mentally.

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.650
And I found sometimes
I was sitting there,

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:20.420
and I was like, oh
just one more question.

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:21.550
AUDIENCE: And you
felt like judged?

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:22.810
ELLA MILLS: Yeah, and I
was a bit embarrassed,

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:24.226
and it was just a
bit complicated.

00:39:24.226 --> 00:39:26.950
And what I was getting started,
like each thing that I had,

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:30.870
had such a big impact on me,
because I had a problem called

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:32.616
mast cell activation.

00:39:32.616 --> 00:39:33.990
It's about your
mast cells, which

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:35.170
is involved in
allergic reactions,

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:36.550
and I was having allergic
reactions to things

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:37.975
that I wasn't allergic to.

00:39:37.975 --> 00:39:39.360
So basically
anything that wasn't

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:43.762
like super, super
plain, like soy sauce,

00:39:43.762 --> 00:39:45.220
like all those
little things, which

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:46.460
are so often in
any kitchen, they

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:47.710
were causing loads of problems.

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:49.270
And you go on holiday,
and you'd want

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:50.980
to be really excited about
it, and after two days

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:51.999
I was just so much pain.

00:39:51.999 --> 00:39:53.790
And my stomach hurt so
much, I felt so ill,

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:56.290
that I had to be so difficult.
Whereas now that I've

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:59.380
stabilized so much more,
four or five years later,

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.470
I find that much easier.

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:02.303
So I'd rather like relax
a couple of nights,

00:40:02.303 --> 00:40:05.740
just enjoying myself, and not
be too weird with my friends.

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.470
And then kind of take it into my
own hands the rest of the time.

00:40:14.469 --> 00:40:15.010
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:16.426
Thank you very
much for your talk.

00:40:16.426 --> 00:40:19.110
I follow your Instagram page,
and I really, really love it.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:20.630
And I notice that
sometimes you post

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:23.580
like yoga photos of like
headstands and things

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:24.340
like that.

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:28.080
So I was wondering, has exercise
played a role in your recovery?

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:32.520
And to what extent do you
think your lifestyle and food

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:38.414
diet impacts your well-being
and exercise routine?

00:40:38.414 --> 00:40:40.080
ELLA MILLS: Yes, so
what I said earlier,

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.450
like I think that
everything's really connected.

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:45.990
And I think feeling good
comes from a whole mix

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.870
of different things.

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:48.286
And I think exercise
is important.

00:40:48.286 --> 00:40:51.540
When I was getting better,
my doctor was doing a study,

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.610
and he did a nine
month exercise program

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:56.490
with lots of different of
his patients, and I did it.

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:57.750
And that was really amazing.

00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:59.470
And it started off
literally two minutes

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:00.830
on one of those reclined bikes.

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:02.746
And I stopped for like
three hours afterwards.

00:41:02.746 --> 00:41:05.040
And then each week you'd
go up by a minute or so,

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:08.305
and then after three months, we
went onto a normal bike, rather

00:41:08.305 --> 00:41:09.180
than a reclined bike.

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:10.680
And then after
another three months,

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.055
or six months from
the beginning,

00:41:12.055 --> 00:41:14.632
we went onto a cross-trainer,
and built up from that.

00:41:14.632 --> 00:41:16.840
And by the end of the nine
months, it was 45 minutes.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:20.010
Slow, but like 45 minutes
on a cross-trainer.

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:23.880
And that was really important,
I think, for my recovery.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:28.300
Now I find exercise plays
a big role mentally for me.

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:30.780
Just because I find there's
a lot going on, and managing

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:34.170
stress, I find exercise is
my best way of doing it.

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:36.570
Just because I feel like
it's the easiest way to kind

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:40.890
of offload quite a lot, and
just like be quiet for an hour

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:41.520
or so.

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.978
No phone, no email, or anything,
and the rest of the time I

00:41:43.978 --> 00:41:45.830
find that quite impossible.

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:48.220
And I notice the weeks
where I don't exercise,

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:50.686
I go a little bit crazy.

00:41:50.686 --> 00:41:51.560
Just like a tiny bit.

00:41:55.425 --> 00:41:57.050
AUDIENCE: Well, first
of all, thank you

00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:59.710
for your books and your
Instagram, I love them.

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:03.910
And I made the mistake of giving
my mom the book for Christmas,

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:07.550
and now she constantly WhatsApps
me pictures of protein bowls.

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:12.100
And I'm like, I get
it, you can cook.

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:14.910
I just had a question, there's
like a lot of negative press

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:16.840
recently around
clean eating, and it

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.012
feels like a bit of
an attack on like--

00:42:19.012 --> 00:42:20.470
I'm not sure if
you were mentioned,

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:23.320
but specifically people like
Hemsley Hemsley, and a lot

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:24.500
of people in the space.

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.500
And I wanted to know if
you had any views on it,

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:30.220
or whether you
actively spoke out,

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:33.270
trying to counter
their argument,

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:34.987
or whether you
just left it alone.

00:42:34.987 --> 00:42:36.070
ELLA MILLS: Yeah, I guess.

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:38.980
Yeah, so I tried to
mostly leave that alone,

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:41.252
just because I think
that sometimes when

00:42:41.252 --> 00:42:42.710
people have an
opinion, it's easier

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:44.950
to let people have an opinion.

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:48.340
But I think it's complicated,
because it's like anything,

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:50.350
you've got to find
what works for you.

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:52.730
And I'm a big believer that
there's no one size fits all.

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:54.310
And that you should take
inspiration from places,

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:56.580
but then your lifestyle's
different than everyone else's

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:56.920
lifestyles.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.628
So you need to take
inspiration, and then

00:42:58.628 --> 00:43:01.210
make it work for you in
whatever capacity that is.

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:05.070
And I know nothing should
be taken to an extreme.

00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:07.510
But it's tricky,
because just because you

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:09.177
find an interesting
way to eat broccoli,

00:43:09.177 --> 00:43:11.343
it doesn't mean you should
only ever broccoli again.

00:43:11.343 --> 00:43:12.910
Likewise, like a
great baking book,

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:15.250
you should know to
not only eat cake.

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:16.997
And it's just quite complicated.

00:43:16.997 --> 00:43:18.580
And I think the thing
with that debate

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:20.080
is that it kind of missed that.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:23.200
But also from my perspective,
if somebody-- sometimes

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.759
will say to me, so do you
never have anything else?

00:43:25.759 --> 00:43:26.800
And I'm like, yeah, sure.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.630
Sometimes I'll be out for
dinner and I'll try this

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:29.530
or I'll try that.

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:31.530
But that's not what
"Deliciously Ella" is about.

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:33.400
"Deliciously Ella" is
trying to give people

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.860
a way of eating broccoli,
cauliflower, and chickpeas,

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:37.510
to be excited about them.

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:40.210
No one needs another way to
be excited about a burger,

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:41.472
like everyone has done it.

00:43:41.472 --> 00:43:43.930
Like no one needs another way
to be excited about chocolate

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:44.980
cake, it's done.

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:48.130
Everyone already eats chocolate
cake, and cookies, and chips,

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:50.530
and burgers, and pizza,
and pasta, and they're cool

00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:52.120
and they're socially acceptable.

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:54.250
And there's 1,001
restaurants serving them,

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:56.710
and 3 trillion cookbooks
dealing with them.

00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:59.950
No one needs me to share a
picture of a bite of this

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:01.810
that I had, it's not relevant.

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:04.480
And what I think is frustrating,
is that's why I'm trying to do.

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.950
And I think that's what the
other people you mentioned

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:07.699
are trying to do, is
trying to give people

00:44:07.699 --> 00:44:09.460
a way of eating these foods.

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:12.130
To me, it's a ridiculous
concept to print newspapers

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:14.290
that you should
eat your ten a day,

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:16.000
and yet not change anything.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.006
Because nobody is going to
even get close to doing that,

00:44:19.006 --> 00:44:20.380
if restaurant
menus don't change,

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:22.777
if education doesn't change,
if the way that we think

00:44:22.777 --> 00:44:23.860
about food doesn't change.

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.410
And it's really ironic, to
me, to print all this stuff

00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:29.499
about how much it's going to
lessen your chances of getting

00:44:29.499 --> 00:44:31.540
this disease, and this
disease, and this disease.

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:33.665
And yet give nobody the
tools to actually implement

00:44:33.665 --> 00:44:34.734
what you're saying.

00:44:34.734 --> 00:44:36.400
And that's to me, is
what's frustrating.

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.084
I do believe that everyone does
what they want, and I'm not--

00:44:39.084 --> 00:44:41.500
I don't think you should ever
feel guilty for what you do.

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:43.999
And if you want to go and enjoy
burger and pizza on a Friday

00:44:43.999 --> 00:44:45.640
night, go ahead.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.740
But you should also
eat more broccoli,

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:49.802
and you're not going
to do that if you

00:44:49.802 --> 00:44:51.010
don't get the recipes for it.

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:52.600
I think the eat clean
thing completely

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:53.600
missed that whole point.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.840
Like no one needs help
making burgers cool,

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.989
but they do need help
making cauliflower cool,

00:44:58.989 --> 00:45:01.530
And I'm sure you guys saw that
KFC advert that just came out,

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:02.738
they're doing the same thing.

00:45:02.738 --> 00:45:04.930
And it's like, if we keep
making fun of these foods,

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:06.160
no one is going to eat them.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.710
And we need to talk
to this audience

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:10.090
that you're talking to,
especially the young audience,

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:12.670
and educate them on how
to cook these foods.

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:18.060
And showing them a raw piece of
cauliflower with crushed ice,

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:20.010
it's just so rank.

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:22.360
And it's so far from making
these things appealing,

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:24.460
and if we don't make them
appealing, we'll never do them.

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:26.584
And we're already doing
the burgers and the pizzas,

00:45:26.584 --> 00:45:29.420
and 27% of the country say
they get their five a day.

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:31.990
So god knows how many people
are getting their ten a day.

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:35.530
And it's just I find it
frustrating, because yeah--

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:37.420
go ahead, eat
everything and anything,

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:39.520
but also eat more
fruit and vegetables,

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.730
and find a way to do that.

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:43.660
And if you keep, I've said, if
you vilify people for doing,

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:46.080
that just seems so ridiculous,
especially in light

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.951
of having an obesity crisis.

00:45:47.951 --> 00:45:50.200
And I think it's a great
show, but we celebrate things

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.614
like the bake-off
which seems ironic.

00:45:52.614 --> 00:45:55.030
We need to celebrate both
sides, and if we don't celebrate

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:56.860
both sides, people
are never going

00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:59.110
to get to that middle ground
that they need to get to.

00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:00.984
Like it's always going
to be a bit one-sided.

00:46:08.219 --> 00:46:09.760
AUDIENCE: It's great
to see you be so

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.570
passionate about healthy food.

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:14.722
I have a question on
recipe development.

00:46:14.722 --> 00:46:16.180
So how do you come
up with recipes,

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:20.620
do you pick like an
ingredient, and go off that.

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:24.487
Or do you focus on like a
category, like salads, you

00:46:24.487 --> 00:46:25.320
have a lot of salad.

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:26.290
But you know what I mean?

00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:27.370
ELLA MILLS: Yes,
and it normally is

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:29.980
based around an ingredient,
or a couple of ingredients,

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:32.780
and trying to find new and
interesting ways to do that.

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:34.770
I definitely find that--

00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:37.410
I think because most online
people used "Deliciously Ella"

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:41.140
for quite simple, easy,
Monday night recipes, things

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:41.720
like that.

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:44.187
And so there's
definitely certain things

00:46:44.187 --> 00:46:46.770
that people seem to really want,
and likewise, with our delis,

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:48.730
like sometimes you're
trying to introduce,

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:51.160
even things like beetroot,
they do not sell.

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.050
Everyone wants broccoli
and sweet potatoes

00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:54.860
10 different ways.

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:57.760
And so I do try and
focus on that a lot,

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.230
because I do notice that if
it's quite simple, courgettes,

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:04.136
broccoli, sweet corn,
courgettes, things that people

00:47:04.136 --> 00:47:06.010
are quite familiar with
and comfortable with,

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:07.970
those like beans and chickpeas.

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:10.960
That's what people definitely
seem to connect to the best,

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:13.164
so I really mostly
just focus on trying

00:47:13.164 --> 00:47:14.830
to take those simple
things, and come up

00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:19.534
with new and interesting
ways of doing them.

00:47:19.534 --> 00:47:20.200
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.990
Thank you so much for
being so open, and honest,

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:24.590
and down-to-earth
about everything.

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:26.590
It's been a real pleasure
listening to you talk.

00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:28.750
Obviously you've
become catapulted

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:34.411
into sort of a business leader
position very, very quickly.

00:47:34.411 --> 00:47:36.160
I wondered if you could
speak a little bit

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.620
to how you found that
process of learning

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:40.900
to be at the head of
a group of people,

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:42.790
and getting them on
board with your mission,

00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:44.650
and keeping them on board.

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:48.180
And I guess, what your biggest
leadership learning has been,

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:49.220
across this time?

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:50.830
ELLA MILLS: Yeah,
totally, honestly, I

00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:52.600
could not have
done without Matt.

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.980
I really-- I think
people can say that like,

00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:56.260
oh it's so self-deprecating.

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.010
Like I could not have
done it without him.

00:47:58.010 --> 00:47:59.890
It never worked in
anyone else's company,

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:02.150
because I got sick when
I was at university,

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:04.550
so I really did not
know what I was doing.

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:08.260
And so I've learned so much
from him, and working with him,

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:10.562
and seeing how he
manages people,

00:48:10.562 --> 00:48:12.520
which is a lot better
than how I manage people.

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:13.107
100%.

00:48:13.107 --> 00:48:15.190
I'm quite scattered, I'm
quite all over the place,

00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:19.030
and he's very
thorough and diligent.

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:20.830
But I find it really
hard, and also I

00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:23.530
felt like such an imposter
when people were like--

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:25.650
they kind of put you
up on this pedestal.

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:28.290
Like wow, OK, I really
don't know how I got there.

00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:31.490
People are like healthy living
guru, and I'm like, oh my gosh,

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:33.882
I'm not a guru.

00:48:33.882 --> 00:48:36.340
Then people are like, oh we
want you to come and talk here,

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:38.102
and you can come and talk here.

00:48:38.102 --> 00:48:39.310
Yeah, like a business leader.

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:41.260
And I'm like, oh
gosh, I just started

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:42.910
cooking in my mom's kitchen.

00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:44.580
I never-- because
I never set out

00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:47.080
with intention of doing that,
I found it quite overwhelming,

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:47.621
to be honest.

00:48:47.621 --> 00:48:49.924
I was quite embarrassed, I
would decline everything.

00:48:49.924 --> 00:48:52.090
And then Matt started seeing
what I was [INAUDIBLE],

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:54.040
and he was like, why are
you saying no to this?

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:55.664
And I was like, I'm
really embarrassed,

00:48:55.664 --> 00:48:56.900
I don't think I should go.

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:59.070
And he'd get so angry with me.

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:02.200
He was like, you're gonna
go, and I was like no.

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.120
And it was just
purely embarrassment,

00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:05.470
because I would go in
somewhere, and I'd be like,

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:07.620
I shouldn't be here,
everyone else should be here,

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:10.120
I haven't earned my
place to be here.

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:13.250
Which I think I've got
better at slowly, but surely.

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:15.760
And I think, honestly, my
biggest thing is that I could

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.280
not have done it without a
partner, I really couldn't.

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:20.040
I did not have the
confidence to do it,

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:22.510
and I think that takes quite
a lot for me to admit that,

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:24.410
because I want to
pretend that I would.

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:26.080
But I don't think
that I would have.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:30.280
And I think-- from my learnings,
that I have so much respect

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.470
for anybody who has the
confidence and ability

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:33.430
to do it on their own.

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:35.669
But for me, being able
to share it, I think

00:49:35.669 --> 00:49:36.710
has made me a lot better.

00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:38.835
And also having someone to
share the pressure with,

00:49:38.835 --> 00:49:42.890
it's been / absolutely amazing.

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:45.640
But I think our biggest thing
has been trying to give people

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:46.930
a lot of autonomy.

00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:48.790
And that's the same
thing of like realizing

00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:50.165
where our strengths
are and where

00:49:50.165 --> 00:49:53.450
our weaknesses are, and even
just in our areas of knowledge.

00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:57.040
And so when we hire someone,
trying to give them the space

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:59.470
to run with what they're
doing, and run their team,

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:00.346
and run their budget.

00:50:00.346 --> 00:50:02.053
And obviously we're
very close with them,

00:50:02.053 --> 00:50:03.910
interact with them a
lot, and understand

00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:05.034
everything that's going on.

00:50:05.034 --> 00:50:07.660
But also just respect
them and their knowledge,

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:09.854
and not try to
micromanage everything,

00:50:09.854 --> 00:50:11.770
even though-- especially
when getting started,

00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:14.350
when we were so keen to know
anything and everything 24

00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:14.890
hours a day.

00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:16.510
But just respecting them.

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:19.240
You know the best people need
a bit of space to be the best,

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:20.670
I think so often.

00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:24.940
And that they have
areas and knowledge,

00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:27.520
you just got to trust them.

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:30.990
So that was really
important for us.

00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:33.810
SPEAKER 1: Anymore
questions from anybody?

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:34.310
No?

00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:36.060
Ella, thank you so you
much for coming in.

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:39.549
It's been an absolute pleasure,
we've thoroughly enjoyed it.

00:50:39.549 --> 00:50:41.090
Ella's recipes are
going to be cooked

00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:43.340
in the cafe on the fourth
floor, and we've also

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.530
got all of her books
outside being sold.

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:47.360
So just around on
the left-hand side.

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:48.680
Thank you very much.

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.480
ELLA MILLS: Thank
you guys for coming.

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.630
[APPLAUSE]
