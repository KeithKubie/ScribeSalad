00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.059
Find the mean, median,
and mode of the following

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.190
sets of numbers.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.250
And they give us the
numbers right over here.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.312
So if someone just
says the mean,

00:00:09.312 --> 00:00:10.770
they're really
referring to what we

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.280
typically, in everyday
language, call the average.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.780
Sometimes it's
called the arithmetic

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.940
mean because you'll
learn that there's

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.980
other ways of actually
calculating a mean.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.210
But it's really you just
sum up all the numbers

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.210
and you divide by the
numbers there are.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.290
And so it's one way of
measuring the central tendency.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.270
The average, I
guess, we could say.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.160
So this is our mean.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.380
We want to average
23 plus 29-- or we're

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.510
going to sum 23 plus 29 plus
20 plus 32 plus 23 plus 21

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.710
plus 33 plus 25, and then divide
that by the number of numbers.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.480
So we have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8 numbers.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.500
So you want to divide that by 8.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.330
So let's figure out
what that actually is.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.080
Actually, I'll just get the
calculator out for this part.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.310
I could do it by hand, but
we'll save some time over here.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:16.010
So we have 23 plus 29 plus
20 plus 32 plus 23 plus 21

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.230
plus 33 plus 25.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.000
So the sum of all
the numbers is 206.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.940
And then we want
to divide 206 by 8.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:34.440
So if I say 206 divided
by 8 gets us 25.75.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.649
So the mean is equal to 25.75.

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.190
So this is one way
to kind of measure

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.430
the center, the
central tendency.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.600
Another way is with the median.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.001
And this is to pick out the
middle number, the median.

00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:49.000
And to figure out the
median, what we want to do

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.790
is order these numbers
from least to greatest.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.030
So it looks like the
smallest number here is 20.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.180
Then, the next one is 21.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.580
There's no 22 here.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.410
Let's see, there's two 23's.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.010
23 and a 23.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.600
So 23 and a 23.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.889
And no 24's.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.770
There's a 25.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.580
25.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.710
There's no 26, 27, 28.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.460
There is a 29.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.860
29.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.690
Then you have your 32.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.470
32.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.420
And then you have your 33.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.170
33.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.420
So what's the middle number
now that we've ordered it?

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.760
So we have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8 numbers.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.751
We already knew that.

00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:32.750
And so there's actually
going to be two middles.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.080
If you have an even
number, there's

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.680
actually two numbers
that qualify for close

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.400
to the middle.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.980
And to actually get the median,
we're going to average them.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.940
So 23 will be one of them.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.440
That, by itself,
can't be the median

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.856
because there's
three less than it

00:02:45.856 --> 00:02:47.330
and there's four
greater than it.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.590
And 25 by itself
can't be the median

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.420
because there's three larger
than it and four less than it.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.480
So what we do is we take the
mean of these two numbers

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.620
and we pick that as the median.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.840
So if you take 23 plus 25
divided by 2, that's 48 over 2,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.540
which is equal to 24.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.500
So even though 24 isn't
one of these numbers,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.260
the median is 24.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.920
So this is the middle number.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.550
So once again, this
is one way of thinking

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.522
about central tendency.

00:03:14.522 --> 00:03:16.230
If you wanted a number
that could somehow

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.105
represent the middle.

00:03:17.105 --> 00:03:19.396
And I want to be clear,
there's no one way of doing it.

00:03:19.396 --> 00:03:22.670
This is one way of
measuring the middle.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.660
Let me put that in quotes.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.450
The middle.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.510
If you had to represent
this data with one number.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.320
And this is another way of
representing the middle.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.430
Then finally, we can
think about the mode.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.060
And the mode is
just the number that

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.590
shows up the most
in this data set.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.150
And all of these numbers show
up once, except we have the 23,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.610
it shows up twice.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.280
And since because 23 shows up
the most, it shows up twice.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.927
Every other number shows
up once, 23 is our mode.
