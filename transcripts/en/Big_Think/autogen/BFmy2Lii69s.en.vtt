it as a national security issue or
 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.630
it as a national security issue or
suddenly see it in terms of investment

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640
suddenly see it in terms of investment

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.999
 
well in this case that you know and in

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009
well in this case that you know and in
 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.230
well in this case that you know and in
fact in the history on an issue like

fact in the history on an issue like
 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.389
fact in the history on an issue like
climate change you know there's been

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399
climate change you know there's been
 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.810
climate change you know there's been
leading examples where the science has

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820
leading examples where the science has
 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.910
leading examples where the science has
been spun in false ways and misleading

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920
been spun in false ways and misleading
 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.320
been spun in false ways and misleading
ways and certainly that's been a

ways and certainly that's been a
 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.910
ways and certainly that's been a
strategy of many conservatives to really

strategy of many conservatives to really
 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.990
strategy of many conservatives to really
downplay concern of the issue and have

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000
downplay concern of the issue and have
 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.600
downplay concern of the issue and have
really no policy action always to say

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610
really no policy action always to say
 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.040
really no policy action always to say
that the science is uncertain sort of a

paralysis by analysis type strategy but

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110
paralysis by analysis type strategy but
 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.990
paralysis by analysis type strategy but
when it comes to science institutions

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000
when it comes to science institutions
 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.259
when it comes to science institutions
communicating with the public what needs

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269
communicating with the public what needs
 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.750
communicating with the public what needs
to happen is that scientists always have

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760
to happen is that scientists always have
 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.210
to happen is that scientists always have
to remain true to the science but that

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220
to remain true to the science but that
 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.039
to remain true to the science but that
doesn't mean that they necessarily only

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049
doesn't mean that they necessarily only
 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.870
doesn't mean that they necessarily only
have to speak about the science in very

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880
have to speak about the science in very
 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.820
have to speak about the science in very
technical terms that is often boring or
