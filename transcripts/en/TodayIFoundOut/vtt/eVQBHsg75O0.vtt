00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:22.869
“Scum” originated in the early 14th century
from the Middle Dutch word “schume” meaning

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.250
foam or froth.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.980
There was also a similar word in old French
– escume.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.480
For about two hundreds years, the word evolved
to mean a “thin layer atop of liquid,”

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.180
then it became “a layer of dirt,” and
then, just simply, dirt.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.489
In 1586, the phrase “scum of Africa” showed
up in the Christopher Marlowe play Tamburlaine,

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.670
this marked the first known time scum was
used as an insult, though that trend would

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.180
be frequently repeated elsewhere after this:
“These are the cruell pirates of Argeire,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.379
That damned traine, the scum of Affrica.”

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.020
In 1604 it had evolved to include worthless
bits that rise to the surface during the process

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.400
of purifying metal: “There was a great store
of these poore mettalls, whereof they made

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.690
no great account, but were rejected…as the
skumme of the good mettall.” (de Acosta’s

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.020
Natural History of the Indies)

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.850
As for the first use of “scumbag,” this
was not, as is popular stated, a condom.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.420
Rather, in 1812, Abraham Rees compiled 45
volumes of an encyclopedia entitled, simply,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.660
Rees’s Encyclopedia.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.360
In the 34th volume, dedicated to the arts,
sciences, and literature, Rees referred to

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.330
a scumbag in relation to a straining bag when
refining sugar:

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.560
Having kept it simmering for several hours,
and having provided a cooler or receiver,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.990
over which is placed a strong wooden frame,
and upon this a basket, to which a coarse

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.490
bag, called the scum-bag, is fitted, he pours
the contents of his pan into this basket and

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.020
bag… and a strong board, called a scum-board,
is laid upon the bags, with several weights

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.390
upon the board, to press down the scum.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.660
This use of the word obviously relates back
to the “foam or froth” definition of scum.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.790
Over the next century to a century and a half,
the word evolved into meaning something quite

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.790
different.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.739
Scumbag, as referencing a condom, seems to
have first appeared in volume nine of the

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.170
American Journal of Orthopsychiatry in 1939.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.049
However, I was unable to get access to the
source material on this one, though several

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:31.739
otherwise normally reputable sources do cite
it as the first instance and I have no particular

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.069
reason to think they’re wrong, just normally
I like to read it for myself before presenting

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.450
something like that as a fact.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.840
The Oxford English Dictionary disagrees with
the 1939 reference, and puts the first reference

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.849
much later.

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.981
However, although the OED is one of the best
with this sort of thing, even they aren’t

00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:49.981
immune to occasional mistakes.

00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:50.981
This wouldn’t be the first time I’ve seen
the OED wrong on the first documented instance

00:02:50.981 --> 00:02:51.981
of something, and you’re about to read another
confirmed instance of this.

00:02:51.981 --> 00:02:52.981
But considering the scope and depth of their
work, I think we can all give them an occasional

00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:53.981
pass.

00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:54.981
🙂

00:02:54.981 --> 00:02:55.981
In any event, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary
and Oxford English Dictionary date “scumbag,”

00:02:55.981 --> 00:03:00.340
in reference to a used condom, to 1967, with
the first known use of “scum” meaning

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.790
“semen,” according to the OED, being in
that same year in Wentworth &amp; Flexner’s

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.830
Dictionary of American Slang.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.290
Whether the 1939 American Journal of Orthopsychiatry
instance is valid or not, the 1967 reference

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.290
is definitely not.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.040
In a book entitled Sex Histories of American
College Men published in 1960, college-aged

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.360
males were calling condoms this by this time:
“According to him and the rest of the boys,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.440
the name of the thing was scum bag.”

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.889
The word popped up more and more from there,
and in June 1971, Frank Zappa, John Lennon,

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:37.670
and Yoko Ono recorded a live track at Filmore
East in New York City that they called “Scumbag.”

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.359
By 1972, the word was also being used to describe
a “despicable person,” which has been

00:03:42.359 --> 00:04:01.810
the more common definition ever since.
