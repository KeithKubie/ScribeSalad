00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; Voiceover: From the Library
of Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.340
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Hello,
my name is Nancy Groce,

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.520
and I'm one of the
folklorists on staff here

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.040
at the American Folklife Center
of the Library of Congress,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.440
and I'd like to welcome you
to the latest presentation

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.570
in our ongoing Benjamin A.
Botkin's lecture series.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.630
The Botkin series allows
us to highlight the work

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.270
of leading scholars in the
disciplines of folklore,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.000
ethnomusicology, oral history

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.820
and cultural history while
enhancing the collections here

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.830
at the American Folklife Center.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.740
For the center and the library,

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.980
the Botkin lectures
form an important facet

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.320
of our acquisitions' activities.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.770
Each lecture is videotaped
and becomes part

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.200
of the permanent
collection of the center.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.440
In addition, the lectures
are later posted as webcasts

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.270
to library's website, where
they're available for viewing

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.650
to Internet patrons
throughout the world.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.810
So, if you haven't already done
so, now would usually go time

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.280
to turn off your cell phones.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.110
Today, we're delighted

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.960
to be presenting a multi-faceted
event featuring the works

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.260
of our colleagues

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.830
at the influential
Philadelphia Folklore Project.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.920
Since 1987, the staff of
the Philadelphia Folklore,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.630
Project has worked
to sustain the vital

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.830
and diverse living cultural
heritage communities throughout

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.440
the Philadelphia region.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.210
Through collaborative projects,
research, documentation,

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.500
and education, PFP
projects have nurtured folk

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.380
and traditional arts in the
service of social change.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.760
Among other activities, folklore
project staff identify local

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.260
folk artists and support
their artistic growth.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.930
They produce public programs,
advancing folk artists

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.360
and traditions significant
to Philadelphia communities,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.080
develop educational programs
benefiting children and adults,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.450
and document outstanding
practitioners and practices.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.330
We're happy today to be joined
by PFP's director, folklorist,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.780
Selina Morales, PFP's --
oh, thank you very much,

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.780
director of programs and
the cultural anthropologist

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.150
and filmmaker, Toni
Shapiro-Phim.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.280
They will open today's
program with short overviews

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.520
of PFP's history
and accomplishments,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.830
and then we're going to screen
PFP's latest production,

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.900
the documentary film, Because of
the War, which tells the stories

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.840
of four Liberian
women who have settled

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.580
in the Philadelphia
area, and who have drawn

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.510
on their knowledge of
traditional Liberian music

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.550
to make community,
address injustice,

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.970
and inspire action
for social change.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.150
We are particularly honored
that one of the artists featured

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.380
in Because of the War, the
award-winning Liberian singer,

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.250
Fatu Gayflor, is able
to join us today.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.030
During the 1970s and 80s, Ms.
Gayflor was a principal member

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.610
of Liberia's National
Cultural Troop,

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.560
the country's premier
performing arts ensemble,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.880
and an internationally
renowned recording artist.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.600
A US resident since
1998, Gayflor performs

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.230
at Liberian communities
throughout the country,

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.950
and since 19 -- I'm
sorry, since 2013,

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.450
has also been the
artistic director

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.310
of the Philadelphia's Liberian
Women's Chorus for Change.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.740
Ms. Gayflor will join Selina
and Tony to introduce the film

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.780
and for a question-and-answer
session following the screening.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.420
I would also like to
take this opportunity

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.350
to thank Nadia Kamara, the
head of Diaspora Affairs Office

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.190
at the Liberian Embassy, and
her colleague, Vicki Ward,

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.610
for joining us this
afternoon, as well as,

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.800
the members of the Catholic
League Immigrants Network,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.750
who are concerned with
Liberia, for joining us.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.090
And we're honored that Ms.
Kamara will take a few minutes

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.120
to welcome us, in a minute.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:10.380
In addition, I want to recognize
Marita Harper, the Liberian

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.040
and African specialist
here at the Library

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.100
of Congress's Ahmed Division.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.210
So, thank you all for coming.

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.080
So, if I can ask Ms. Kamara
to come up and say a few words

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.730
of welcome, that
would be lovely.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.530
Thank you so much for coming

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.940
&gt;&gt; Nadia Kamara:
Thank you very much.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.480
My name is Nadia Kamara
from the embassy of Liberia.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.330
Oh, like this, okay.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.460
Madame [inaudible]
and all the members

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:52.230
of the American Folklife Center
of the Library of Congress,

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.390
distinguished ladies and
gentlemen, I stand here today

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.440
on behalf of Her Excellency,
Ambassador Lois Lewis Brutus,

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.940
Ambassador of the Republic of
Liberia, to the United States

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.340
of America, who is presently
at another engagement,

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.100
and would have loved
to be here today,

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.530
and who extends her greetings
and appreciation to the Library

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.720
of Congress for hosting

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.410
and screening the recently
completed documentary

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.790
on the war in Liberia.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.500
In this regard, I wish

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.810
to applaud the Philadelphia
Folklore Project for producing

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.810
such a relevant documentary
film, Because of the War,

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.910
which tells the story
of four Liberian women

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.890
who have been using their
music and their talents

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:48.130
to address injustice and inspire
action for social injustice

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.060
and social change
for their country.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.870
The Republic of Liberia is
particularly blessed and honored

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.960
by the contributions of our
own Liberian women artists,

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.650
who have been promoting Liberian
and African culture and music

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.970
and entertainment
throughout the world.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.630
On behalf of the ambassador,
Her Excellency, Lois Brutus,

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.550
I want to thank and congratulate
the four Liberian women

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.940
who have used their music
to address injustice

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.200
and inspire action
for social change.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.290
As survivors of the Liberian
Civil War, these four women,

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.020
who are accomplished
singers and models

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.140
and among other qualities have
achieved another [inaudible]

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.130
production of this film.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.150
In this connection,
it is our hope

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.800
that this film will
create awareness

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.490
about the tragedy resulting
from Liberian Civil War

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.170
and also create a positive
impact regarding the triumph

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.450
of the human spirit
over adversity.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.490
We also hope that the
Philadelphia Folklore Project

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.050
and other programs that
promote traditional music

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.750
and entertainment will lend
support to more African culture

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.090
and artistic practices
throughout the world.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:16.890
Thank you.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:23.090
[ Applause ]

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.580
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Thank you
very, very much, Mrs. Kamara.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.140
I'd like to, again,
welcome you to the Botkin --

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.730
this Botkin lecture,
in particular,

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.910
that celebrates the
landmark contributions

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.930
of the Philadelphia
Folklore Project,

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:43.990
and notes the great impact
PFP activities have had

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.390
in sustaining community
culture and artistic practices.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.780
I ask you to join me

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.510
in welcoming PFP's
director, Selina Morales.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:58.050
[ Applause ]

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.520
&gt;&gt; Selina Morales:
Good afternoon.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.510
Thank you, Nancy, and the staff
at the American Folklore Center

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.900
for inviting the Philadelphia
Folklore Project to talk today

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.610
as part of the Botkin Lecture
Series, and thank you to all

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:15.470
of you for attending this
afternoon during [inaudible].

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.920
Today we want to tell you
about our organization,

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.920
the Philadelphia
Folklore Project.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.050
We're impactful,
politically grounded,

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.070
and artistically excellent
projects are incubated

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.220
and presented in the
City of Philadelphia,

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.100
and we'll talk specifically
about two initiatives,

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.330
one we'll tell you about,
and the second, you'll learn

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.010
about through our latest
film Because of the War,

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.770
followed by discussion with
the filmmaker, a Q&amp;A that is

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:44.500
with the filmmaker and with our
special guest, Fatu Gayflor.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.480
We're hoping that by sharing
insights, both into the mission

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.210
and workings of our organization
and into its impacts,

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.530
you will be inspired to think
about aspects of our approach

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.270
and practice that you
might emulate, or adapt,

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.500
in the context in
which you are working

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.790
and simply being with others.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.680
We are also hoping that this
presentation will affirm for you

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.840
that traditional
arts are, indeed,

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:15.560
contemporary tools -- sure.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.860
Can folks hear me?

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.160
&gt;&gt; Female: Yes.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.460
&gt;&gt; Selina Morales: Yeah?

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:20.760
Okay. Then I'm going
to keep going.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.060
That folk -- there we go.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.360
That folk and traditional
arts are, indeed,

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.740
contemporary tools
providing pathways forward,

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.410
that they are future-looking
and that it is their relevance

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:34.160
and their ability to change
and respond to social needs

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.750
that makes traditional
arts extremely potent,

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.550
powerful, and political.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.650
The Philadelphia Folklore
Project is one of just a handful

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:46.090
of independent, freestanding
nonprofit organizations

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:50.700
dedicated folklore, Folklife,
and traditional arts nationwide.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.660
The organization was founded
by Debora Kodish in 1987

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.920
at the 100th anniversary of
the American Folklore Society.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.180
It started as an
effort, a project,

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.930
to learn about the
living cultural heritage

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.390
of Philadelphia, the city

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.880
where the American
Folklore Society was founded

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.090
and where it celebrated
its centennial year.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.910
Early efforts included
massive amounts

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.660
of ethnographic fieldwork,
documentation

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:21.480
of community vitality, community
gardens, family reunions,

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.980
mom-and-pop shops,
street festivals.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.210
Dr. Kodish and the team of
Folklore Project staff kept

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:31.080
that project going,
kept our project going,

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.460
and advanced major initiatives
that documented, supported,

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:38.370
and helped to sustain a wide
breath of cultural knowledge

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.350
and outstanding arts
in Philadelphia.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:45.270
Examples of that documentation
in the projects include 20 years

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.630
of attention to Philadelphia's
African

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.340
and African-American dance
and drum communities,

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.170
including major work
with Odunde,

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.280
one of the nation's
oldest African-American

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.240
street festivals.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.530
We documented Cambodian arts,
African-American tap dance,

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.310
Chinese arts and culture,

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:06.410
Philadelphia-based Eastern
European klezmer music,

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.240
Mung food ways, and much more.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.810
Many of these initiatives are
even carried forward today.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.790
The Folklore Project's long-term
initiatives have left an

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:18.620
indelible mark on
the city's landscape,

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.360
including through our
work in a K to 8 school,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.140
the Folk Art Culture Treasures
Charter School, founded in 2009,

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.710
as a collaboration between
Asian Americans United

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.850
and our organization.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:34.840
This is a school that centers
home culture and knowledge

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.410
in the classroom and
connects 500 students

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:42.070
to traditional arts, as a way
of incorporating ethics, values,

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.790
and of course, aesthetics
into the school environment.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.350
Nowadays, as Nancy said, at the
Philadelphia Folklore Project,

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.100
we identify local folk artists

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.310
and support their
artistic growth.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:59.360
We produce public programs,
advancing folk artists

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.200
and traditions significant
to Philadelphia communities.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.790
We develop education programs,
benefitting children and adults,

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:11.380
and document outstanding
practitioners and practices.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.150
We work directly with
traditional artists

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.860
and community-based
organizations were using tools

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.390
of social justice activism

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:21.440
and community-based expressive
culture to make change

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.590
that they have identified
in their own communities,

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:26.310
and we understand
that opportunities

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:30.860
to practice valued cultural
traditions enhances lives,

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:35.460
self-determination, and
community-add vitality.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.450
We do this work through
long-term engagement

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:39.890
with individuals,
through deep listening,

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:42.970
employing ethnographic methods
to learn about the traditions

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.270
of those who make change

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:47.180
within longtime
Philadelphia-based communities,

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.980
and communities that
have just arrived.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.270
Because of our ongoing
collaborative approach

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.960
across the city, the folklore
project has gained a fair amount

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.900
of credibility, which is really
helpful when we're looking

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.570
to start a new project.

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.930
We produce documentation
of all of our endeavors,

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:06.340
and over 31 years, have
built an archive of more

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.500
than 70,000 community-sourced
histories, photographs, videos,

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.740
artworks, and interviews.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.980
We've collaborated on
dozens of exhibitions,

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.950
music and dance concerts, artist
salons, documentary films,

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:20.930
and magazine articles.

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:24.140
Our products are
widely recognized.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.410
They garner awards,
and they are used in K

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.870
through college classrooms.

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:32.210
Today, we want to highlight
our collaborative practice

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.610
and describe for you a few
examples of how we work

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:37.980
with others to advance our
mission to sustain vital

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.070
and diverse living
cultural heritage

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.430
in the communities
in our region.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.170
A central program at PFP
is called the Folk Art

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.440
and Social Change Residencies.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.250
Community members, artists,
and activists advance projects

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.280
that highlight folk
arts practices

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.830
and social justice concerns.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.440
Projects are selected
and pursued

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.160
by folklore project staff
through an assessment

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.920
of our own resources
and capacities.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:07.080
We look at dollars, genres,
content area knowledge,

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:11.880
our language facility,
time, and community support.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.620
The scale and timeline
are determined

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.060
by a coalition of stakeholders.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.010
The projects are
always multidimensional.

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.890
The artists involved
advance their own skills,

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:23.840
their artistic practice.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.330
They gain skills in
budgeting, in leadership,

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:31.130
in public speaking, exhibition
design, grant writing,

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:33.750
contract negotiations,
decision-making,

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:38.140
and relationship building, and
the residency results vary.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.310
In addition to skills built,
often exhibitions are mounted

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.950
or an article is written,
concerts are performed,

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:45.670
or workshops are conducted.

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.550
Because each residency
is really distinct,

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.940
it's hard to make
generalizations

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.460
about the outcomes, but all of
our projects, at their core,

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.810
employ ethnographic and
participatory research methods,

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:59.400
including working with a
community advisory council

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.200
where assessment is at the
center of the practice.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.040
We set goals together and ask
ourselves how were going all the

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.340
way along the way.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.620
If a project is a year,
or a project is six years,

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.290
thinking constantly about
the relationship of the work

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.020
to the goals for each
of the stakeholders.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.680
Funding for the projects,
for the Folk Art

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.610
and Social Change
residencies come principally

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.910
from the National
Endowment for the Arts,

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:26.960
where we take an approach
to funding this work

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.290
by funding the methodology
and the process of doing it,

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:34.080
rather than the particular
programs that are part of it,

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:40.870
and that way, as we're doing
these collaborative processes,

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:44.240
when we identify a thing we want
to do, a product that we want

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.050
to create, an interpretive
methodology, then we can go

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.370
for other kinds of grants
particular fundraising

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.790
for that node of the project.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.700
I'll introduce you now to
PFP's director of programs,

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.000
Dr. Toni Shapiro-Phim.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.320
Toni runs our Folk Arts and
Social Change residency programs

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.180
and will share with you two
examples that show our mission

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.570
at work in different ways.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.370
So, Toni.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:21.200
[ Applause ]

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.130
&gt;&gt; Toni Shapiro-Phim: Thank you.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:26.860
The year was 2011.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.160
Losong Semtan [assumed
spelling],

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.020
an award-winning Tibetan
artist, a sand mandala artist,

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.880
he creates images of aspects
of the Tibetan universe

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:40.650
out of grains of colored sand,
and he does so over the course

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:45.490
of days, week, or
weeks, maybe a month.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:46.860
This artist told Selina

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.540
that he'd loved introduce
folklore project staff

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:53.000
to members of the local
Philadelphia Tibetan community.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.480
Losong Semtan, this very artist,
had been engaged with projects

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:02.290
with us for years, but we
hadn't had a chance to connect

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:04.670
with other local
Tibetans before.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:08.030
This is his work, one
of his masterpieces.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.880
So, fast forward to
the spring of 2015.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.250
We h ad spent four years
developing relationships

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:17.820
with documenting the
Philadelphia Tibetan community

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:21.410
comprised of about
150 people total.

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:23.470
Together, with members
of that community,

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:26.990
we created an exhibition that
chronicles a year in the life

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:28.950
of Philadelphia's Tibetans.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:32.120
It offers a glimpse of their
commitment to their community

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.820
and to their culture,
coming together annually

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.350
to publicly call Tibet's
autonomy and deliverance

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:41.730
from oppression, celebrating
the Dalai Lama's birthday

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:44.760
and Tibetan New Year
through ritual and games.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.960
Honoring ancestral traditions
and the struggle of those

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.480
in Tibet through
the monthly practice

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.980
of Lakher [assumed spelling] and
the weekly teaching and learning

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:57.310
of Tibetan language, songs, and
dances at Tibetan Sunday school.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.450
It shares, too, how
Tibetans on a daily basis,

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.030
pay respect to the Buddha
and to the Dalai Lama

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.030
and the privacy of their homes.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:08.150
The exhibition was about
to open in a small gallery

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:12.180
on the first floor of our office
on a springtime afternoon.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.380
That very morning, I got a
call from a member of the board

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.260
of the Tibetan Association
of Philadelphia.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.660
"Toni," he asked,
"would you mind

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.920
if Tibetan monks visiting
the United States from India,

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.280
monks who happen to have
just arrived in Philadelphia,

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.810
would you mind if they came
by to bless the exhibition?"

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.390
And so, it was blessed.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.100
Now we're going to rewind a bit.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.530
We got to the exhibition
opening after years

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.760
of building towards something.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.340
Members of the Tibetan
Association

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.260
of Philadelphia had originally
told us that they'd love

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.640
to create an exhibition
that shares their concern

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.980
or the plight of their
homeland and for all Tibetans.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.560
I spent at least a
year-and-a-half following

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.640
community members around
at their annual monthly

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.440
and weekly celebrations,
commemorations, and activities,

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.970
interviewing them in their
homes and photographing

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:04.680
and videotaping some of
the cultural practices.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.590
Then, as part of the
exhibition development process,

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.230
we selected hundreds of
photographs have been taken

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.940
over that year and a half,
hung them from clothesline

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.150
around our then-empty
gallery, and invited everyone

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:19.130
in the Tibetan community
to stop by one evening.

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:22.320
So, that means is 70 or
80 people stopped by,

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.320
that's a huge percentage
of the entire population.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.960
We asked people to select up to
three photographs that resonated

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.880
with them, images that meant
something to them and about

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.600
which they'd like
to say something,

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.420
and we had multiple
copies of each image

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.670
that more one person could
choose a particular picture.

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:43.670
We recorded interviews with
everyone, some in translation,

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:47.650
and it was these statements and
stories that became the captions

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.620
for the photographs
mounted in the exhibition.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.290
While the exhibition
included material objects

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:57.810
and even a complete Tibetan
altar room at their urging,

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:00.110
it's just some of the
photographs and their captions

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.420
that we'll share with
you today before we move

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:06.110
on to our next project,
which is the movie.

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:13.970
So, there is one of the sand
mandalas by Losong Semtan.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:16.350
I mentioned that members

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.640
of the Tibetan community have
prioritized educating the

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.550
broader Philadelphia population

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.890
about the situation
in their homeland.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:27.440
The Chinese military invaded
Tibet in the 1950s, and in 1959,

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.500
Tibetans in their
capital, Lhasa,

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.040
rose up against Chinese rule,
and many were slaughtered.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.030
Many who survived
were imprisoned.

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:38.430
The Dalai Lama, Tibetan
Buddhism's spiritual leader,

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:41.560
and at that time, Tibet's
political leader, as well,

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.530
escaped, ultimately establishing
a Tibetan government

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.030
in exile in India.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.410
Thousands and thousands
of Tibetans followed him,

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:50.850
taking harrowing journeys
through the mountains.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.000
I'm going to quote from
the International Campaign

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.970
for Tibet website.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.310
"Tibetans cannot practice
their religion freely.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:59.810
Nor can they protect
their culture

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:01.680
and language in a
meaningful way.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.840
Instead, they suffer
from repressive laws

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.140
that deem any expression
of their identity

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.290
as extremist or even terrorist."

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:10.970
It's the end of the quote.

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:13.000
What follows is a
selection of the photographs

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.160
in the exhibition with
their captions, and for us,

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:22.100
it was very important to
work together to collaborate

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.880
with members of the
Tibetan communities,

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.620
so that they could tell their
story in their own words,

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.000
and we could especially
highlight how,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.670
through the practices
of traditional arts

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:36.390
and other aspects of their
culture, that they nonviolently

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:43.740
and intentionally counter the
oppression in their homeland.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.370
Several of the people sharing
their stories and opinions

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:50.950
for the exhibition chose to
remain anonymous, so that even

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:54.150
on the placards under
the photographs,

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:56.110
their names don't appear.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.690
They're afraid of
possible repercussions

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:01.560
for relatives and
friends at home.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.590
That's a tiny picture for
you to see, but I wanted

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:10.340
to give you a picture of the
scope of a certain issue.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:17.470
On the ground there at this
commemoration of the 1959,

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:20.020
March 10th uprising in Tibet,

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:24.160
which Philadelphians do
annually, they have laid

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.000
out portraits of all the
Tibetans they have heard

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.080
of who have self-immolated.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:35.540
That's they set themselves
on fire in protest

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:39.300
of the situation in Tibet.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:43.890
And three of the people who came

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:47.700
to the gallery before we put the
exhibition together chose this

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.560
picture, and one them
explained, the top one,

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.720
explained that in
Tibetan Buddhism,

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.130
it's actually a sin
to commit suicide.

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:00.310
So, her interpretation
is that those

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:03.360
who have self-immolated
must be suffering so much

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:08.200
if this is the only option
they feel is open to them.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.130
Here she says since 2008,
there have 136 Tibetan people

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:17.850
who self-immolated, but as
of yesterday, it was 153.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:21.260
So, every year, the Tibetans
in Philadelphia gather in front

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.920
of the National Constitution
Center or the Liberty Bell

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.730
in Philadelphia to call
attention to both the history

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.300
and the current plight.

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:40.350
At that annual demonstration,
children are there,

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.810
as well as their parents, and
somebody chose this picture

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:45.450
for that reason, in particular.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:47.960
Here, you can see father
and son both participating

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.480
in the March 10th procession,
and the son is marching

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.800
with the Tibetan flag.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.040
That's the story for
Tibetans throughout the world.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.400
The younger generation
is marking forward

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.950
with the Tibetan struggle.

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:03.720
So, every year, as I
said, they gather in March

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.460
to call attention to
the political situation,

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.360
but also every year,
they gather together

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.260
to celebrate Tibetan New
Year, which they call Losar.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.400
I'll just redo the
first quotation.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.450
"Losar in Tibet was very
exciting, especially for kids.

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:19.740
At that time, we'd count the
days until Losar came, and if,

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.730
let's say, tomorrow is Losar,
tonight we'd hardly sleep

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:24.720
because everyone
gets new clothes,

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.320
which you put under your pillow.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.720
You keep looking
at the new clothes,

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.330
excited to wear them
the next day.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.900
So, you spend most
of the night awake."

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:40.200
And also, at New Year time,

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:46.290
they engage in traditional
ceremonies,

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:50.820
both inside of the
Buddhist temple and outside.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.210
This is a family, who at New
Year time, was performing

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:56.660
for the rest of the community.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:00.520
The entire family plays musical
instruments, and somehow,

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.340
they get even their teenagers
to practice every night

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.240
for an hour altogether.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:12.360
One of the family members
said that in Tibet,

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.330
they aren't allowed
to display the flag.

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:17.900
Nor are they allowed to display
the Dalai Lama's portrait.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.350
So, here they are doing
that with the intention

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:23.400
of showing the world that
they hope someday people

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:28.320
in their homeland are
able to do the same.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.710
Also, on an annual basis,

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:32.590
they gather to celebrate
the Dalai Lama's birthday.

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:37.200
Say happy birthday, have a big
cake for him, and recognize him

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:42.900
as even more important
than their own parents.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:49.370
They get together in July

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:50.670
to celebrate the
Dalai Lama's birthday.

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:52.620
Also, in July, they participate

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:55.840
in Philadelphia's
July 4th parade.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.420
So, here they are
marching down the street.

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.990
An image of the Dalai Lama,
as if he's being carried

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:07.700
in a carriage, and this is
Yak, the national animal,

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.860
considered the national
animal of Tibet.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.490
Two people are in it dancing,
and then, there's a line

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.820
of women behind the
carriage dancing

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.360
to recorded Tibetan music.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:24.410
And here's Losong, the artist
I mentioned at the beginning

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:26.830
at work, creating a mandala.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:28.920
So, I mentioned to you a
few things that Tibetans

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:32.120
in Philadelphia do on an annual
basis, but on a monthly basis,

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:35.600
they meet on a Wednesday evening

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:41.830
to actually teach their
own community about Tibet,

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:43.850
to intentionally speak Tibetan,

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:45.730
eat Tibetan food,
wear Tibetan clothes.

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:48.350
Maybe they show a
documentary or bring in a guest

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.730
with some special knowledge.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:55.230
This is a time that they
are nonviolently working

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:59.200
to counter the cultural
oppression in their homeland.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.940
And Losong here,
creating the sand mandala,

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:07.520
says that as he brings these
images to life, he considers

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:13.000
that his own lahkar, his
own way to counter that kind

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.430
of cultural oppression,
and as he's making this,

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:19.900
people come around to watch, and
he has a chance to talk to them,

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:23.420
not only about Buddhist
philosophy, but about Tibet

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:27.720
and other aspects
of his culture.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.180
Once a week, they
gather for Sunday school.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:33.570
The kids are learning to read
and write and speak Tibetan,

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:37.380
which many of them do at
home, and learning dances

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:41.040
and songs and prayers, as well.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.180
And every day, in the
privacy of their own homes,

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:48.430
they pay respects to the
Buddha and to the Dalai Lama.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:58.000
So, that was an example
of one kind of folk arts

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.160
and social change residency
that we developed together

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.840
with members of the community.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.420
That's a tiny community,
150 people,

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:09.050
and another community we spent
years and years getting to know

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:12.230
and developing relationships
with is a little bit bigger.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:15.980
It's 15,000 to 25,000 people,

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:18.490
and that's the Liberian
community of Philadelphia.

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:21.370
It's hard to know exact numbers.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:26.430
Philadelphia has one of the
highest populations of Liberians

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:31.630
in the United States, and it's
been our pleasure and honor

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:34.560
to work with artists
from that community.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.950
And we're going to show you a
movie that is, in some ways,

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:41.730
a combination of an
initiative that we've had going

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:43.530
for a few years, and we'll
be happy to talk to you

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:45.610
about that afterwards.

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:49.340
As a way to introduce the movie,
I'd like to introduce you to one

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:53.510
of the stars of it,
Fatu Gayflor.

00:28:53.510 --> 00:29:00.690
[ Applause ]

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:01.990
&gt;&gt; Fatu Gayflor:
Hello, everybody.

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.200
At this time, I just
want to welcome everybody

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:09.320
to this beautiful
afternoon to watch our movie.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.030
I just ask you to sit tight

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:16.510
and watch every bit
that we have for you.

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:21.200
We are very, very proud
that we brought our stories.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.400
When the stories is in
you, it hurts a lot.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.300
But when you put it
out, it helps a lot.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.590
So, we took this time to work

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:33.030
with Philadelphia
Folklore Project to be able

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:37.600
to put our stories out, so
that people know who we are

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.200
in the inside and
on the outside.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:44.200
So, I hope you enjoy,
and thank you for coming.
