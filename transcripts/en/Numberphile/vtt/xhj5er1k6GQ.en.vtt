00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
I want to talk about a problem in

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.790
mathematics called billiards study

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.860
billiards and talk about maybe a couple

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.300
of aspects of that these are called

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.509
polygonal billiards you have some figure

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.140
in the plane maybe it has straight sides

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.100
or maybe not.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.390
You can either think of this as

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.859
billiards or you could think of this

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.560
as a room where the sides of the room have

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.289
a mirror started a point and we move in

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.359
a straight line starting at the point

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.969
until we come to the side and then we

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.090
bounce off the side with the angle of

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.340
reflection equal [to] the angle of incidence so

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.110
These two angles are the same and then

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.809
we continue till we hit to another side we

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.399
bounce off where the angle of incidence

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.770
equals the angle of reflection and so

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.870
forth when you get into a corner there's

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.449
no way of saying what reflection means

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.789
and so if you are a billiard player you

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.590
maybe think of this as pocket billiards.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.510
We could also think of this, as I say, as

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.170
a room with mirrors and you are moving

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.019
along, maybe a light source. A beam of

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.810
light comes to a mirror and then it

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.210
reflects in the mirror and continues on

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.670
in a straight line and so forth.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.920
And these things go forever? [Inaudible] Unless they hit a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.869
corner? These things go forever

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.070
unless they hit a corner, yes.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.170
Ok so, I'm going to talk [inaudible]

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.479
at least to start with a problem called

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.939
an illumination problem. So maybe I have

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.670
a new figure of a billiard table. Maybe

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.470
think of that as a room. Now that's a

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.450
kind of a funny-shaped room, but

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.570
nonetheless. And I have put a candle at

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.759
a certain point in the room that's my

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.890
kind of, a light source. And the question

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.680
is: does that candle illuminate every

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.750
point in the room? So that means that if

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.909
I have some other point in the room, is

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.369
there a beam of light that will start at

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.649
the candle and start bouncing off the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.540
walls of the room? Maybe many, many

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.869
bounces until it finally hits that point.

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.420
So in other words does the candle

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.119
illuminate the entire room or are there

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.979
places in the room which are dark, that

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.930
the candle doesn't illuminate. The

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.450
question is: moving in any direction, can

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.580
you get to this point? The candle is

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.450
radiating light out in all directions

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.090
and do you illuminate every point? For

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.190
example, if my room is just the usual

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.890
- kind of a square - and my candle is

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.349
anywhere in the room, I can certainly get

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.540
to any other place in the room by just

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.250
going in a straight line. So I can go,

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.170
"here's my candle, here's my other point

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.610
in the room." I don't have to do any

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.160
bouncing off walls because I just go in

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.410
a straight line. This kind of room is

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.290
called convex, which means that you can

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.500
join any two points by a line without

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.099
bouncing off the sides. So convex rooms -

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.840
it's obvious or clear that

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.410
illumination happens. This room is not

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.319
convex because if I'm at this point

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.390
there is no straight line that gets me

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.790
from the candle to this point because

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.130
the straight line would, you know, leave

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.569
the room and I'm not allowed to do that.

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.640
The original problem about illumination was

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.530
asked in the 1950's. One

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.560
question was: does every point illuminate

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.319
every other point? The first example

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.780
where this was solved in a way and that

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.540
was by Roger Penrose, who was an English

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.299
mathematician and physicist. What he did

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.019
was he draws the top half of an ellipse and

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.420
he draws the bottom half of an ellipse.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.850
Same ellipse but doesn't connect them.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.639
And instead he draws a mushroom and then

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.310
a similar mushroom on the other side.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.500
The red point here is the focal point of the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.480
ellipse, the top ellipse. And here's the

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.280
other point, [which] is the focal point of the

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.260
top ellipse. And then these points are the

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.480
focal points of the bottom ellipse.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.930
And what Penrose found was that, for example, if

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.120
his candle was placed right there,

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.340
somewhere in the top half, these two

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.190
regions were not illuminated. So in

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.099
other words, there was no way of sending a

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.500
light source from the candle and having

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.230
it bounce into - to those two shaded

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.170
regions. They're permanently dark if that

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.090
is where the candle is. And what he

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.709
showed was no matter where you put the

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.160
candle, there will be regions in this

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.380
ellipse which are dark that are not

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.569
illuminated by the candle. [Brady] Oh there's

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.000
no spot I can put the candle? [Prof. Masur] No spot

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.380
where you can put the candle and

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.709
illuminate the entire table. In 1995, a

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.630
man by the name of Tokarsky found an

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.800
example of a

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.759
26-sided polygon and a place where you

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.889
could put the candle where it didn't

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.199
illuminate some other place on the table.

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.139
Why does this have to be so complicated?

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.020
Well, if you have a polygon as I drew

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.240
here, it's sort of hard to decide when

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.370
you send the light source out where that

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.110
beam of light is going to go. So this

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.150
problem of what you illuminate is

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.129
is possibly pretty complicated, and so

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:51.229
that's why [in] this first example, there was

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.780
a point right here. Put a candle [and] he

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.030
found a single point which was not

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.669
illuminated by that candle. Now the

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.129
difference between this and the Penrose

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:03.830
example was in the Penrose example there

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.990
was a candle and there was a whole

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.330
region two of them which were not

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.250
illuminated in this example is somewhat

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.690
different it and this was kind of the

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.849
only point that wasn't illuminated you

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.340
could get to any anyplace in this room

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.289
except if you were standing right if you

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.240
stood right there at that point you

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.190
would be in the dark but everybody

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.050
everywhere else you would see the light

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.420
from the candle so it's a little

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.940
different. [Brady] But Doc, it's an infintesimal point

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.340
It, well it's a single point you can think

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:31.909
of it as an infinitesimal but it's a

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:35.180
single point as opposed to a whole part

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.159
of the room and your person is standing

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:39.560
right at that place that person is in

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.520
the dark

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.960
somebody standing right next to that

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.750
person sees is in the light so it's a

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.190
little it's a little different because

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.319
it's a mathematical construction it's

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:50.870
not literally a person standing at a

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.180
point because after all our feet have

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.110
width and so it's it's a it's more

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.599
of a you know theoretical construct

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:01.969
there has been research in just in the

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:04.430
last two or three years that says that

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.009
for any polygon and now i'm going to put

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:09.169
a little kind of restriction what I want

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.300
to look at is when the angles at the

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.690
vertex are a fraction a rational number

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.319
P over Q is a rational number times a

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:20.599
180 degrees so every

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:23.300
angle is a rational number times a

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.279
180 degrees for example a

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:27.800
square, a square room that angle is 90

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.680
degrees that's of course one half of 180

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.320
I want to talk about polygons where all of

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.260
the angles

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.230
are any rational number and degrees

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.880
they're called rational polygons or

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.280
rational billiards if i put a candle at

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.820
any place the dark regions are these as

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.950
you say infintesimal points and

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.070
they're only finitely many so maybe two

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.720
of them or something for example in the

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.060
Tokarsky example there was just one

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.730
point there might be two or three or ten

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.090
but there isn't something that's a whole

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.350
patch of infinitely many points so it's

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.960
impossible to construct a rational

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.560
polygon that will have a patch of dark

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.000
[Doc] that's right

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.980
that's right you will not in this

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.890
example rational polygon you will never

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.850
have a whole part of the room which is

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:21.390
dark

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:22.950
that will never happen even a smaller

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.870
not even a very tiny one

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.030
what is an irrational polygon for

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.010
example let me draw in irrational

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.530
triangle and i'm going to make the angle

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.200
here 90 times the square root of 2

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.870
let's say 30 degrees and then here since

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.610
the total has to be 180

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.090
this would be 180 - 90

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:43.920
square root of 2 - 30

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.620
So obviously, Professor, that's convex [inaudible]

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.680
Yeah yeah that, so triangles of course are convex that

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.480
thank you for that observation so but

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.030
this is an example of this is uh this is

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:58.380
an example of a non-rational triangle

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.300
If I created a complicated polygon

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.070
that had a rational angles [Doc] Then I don't

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.780
think anything is known about the

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.700
illumination problem as far as i know the

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.320
things that are known as rational

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.040
polygons so that's the illumination

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.480
problem it it really started in 1955

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.520
and as a consequence of other

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.650
study of other things having to do with

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:25.050
rational billiards there's been new work

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.790
and progress on this illumination

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.400
problems i thought i would mention one

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.810
other problem that arises that you can

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:36.450
ask about polygons you could ask is

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.520
there what's called a periodic orbit

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.950
when I say orbit and that might be start

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:42.729
off at a point cloud

00:08:42.729 --> 00:08:45.850
it's really difficult feels very

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:54.130
skillful well beautiful it rolled round

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:55.899
rather brands reminding me but i'm going

00:08:55.899 --> 00:08:58.019
to bed
