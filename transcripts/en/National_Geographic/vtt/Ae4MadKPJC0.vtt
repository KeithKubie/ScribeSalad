00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.430
The human body is a complex network of

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.080
cells

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.580
tissues and

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.990
organs

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.990
that together

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.450
Make life possible

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.340
Ten major systems are responsible for the body's functions

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.849
skeletal muscular

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:26.619
cardiovascular

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.180
nervous

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.679
endocrine

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.210
lymphatic

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.630
respiratory digestive urinary

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.559
Reproductive

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.079
The skeletal muscular

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.570
cardiovascular and nervous systems in particular

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.739
create an infrastructure that facilitates the other systems the

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.349
Adult skeletal system is a framework of over 200 bones

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.599
They hold the body together give it shape and protect its organs and tissues

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.489
The skeleton also provides anchor points for the muscular system, which includes three types of muscles skeletal

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.750
smooth and cardiac

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.589
They are found throughout the body and facilitate movement

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:18.659
Nestled within these muscles is the cardiovascular system a pipeline that includes the heart blood vessels and the blood itself

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.659
also called the circulatory system the

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.780
cardiovascular system delivers oxygen white blood cells hormones and nutrients throughout the body

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.839
Lastly the nervous system is a communication network of nerve cells that the body uses to transmit information and coordinate

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.740
bodily functions

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.640
It's comprised of the brain the hub of sensory and intellectual activity the spinal cord

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.119
And the many cranial and spinal nerves that emanate from them

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.030
This infrastructure created by neurons blood muscles and bones

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:01.739
Allows three other systems to regulate the body's environment the endocrine lymphatic and urinary systems

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:10.199
The endocrine system is a series of glands that use information carried by the nervous system to help regulate the body's

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.830
processes

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.319
Thanks to this neural connection endocrine glands such as the thyroid are aware of the amount of hormones and other chemicals

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.500
They need to produce

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.979
these chemicals are then distributed throughout the body by way of the cardiovascular system the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.739
cardiovascular and nervous systems are also utilized by the lymphatic system a

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.029
collection of lymph nodes and vessels that help regulate the body's defenses

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.269
Also called the immune system the lymphatic system uses neural pathways to transmit information

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.899
About affected areas of the body and then sends out healing agents like white blood cells via the blood stream

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.479
Another key, regulatory system is the urinary system, which includes the kidneys ureters bladder and urethra

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:05.220
The urinary or renal system maintains the body's electrolyte levels and filters wastes from the blood

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.980
This waste is sent through the blood vessels into the kidneys and then expelled as urine

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.670
All of these systems require energy to function and that's where the respiratory and digestive

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.819
Systems come in

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:28.019
The respiratory system is a group of passageways and organs that extracts life-giving oxygen from the air we breathe

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.649
Air enters the body through nasal cavities travels down the throat and is then transported to the lung

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.850
The lungs extract oxygen for the body to use and then expel a carbon dioxide by-product when we exhale energy

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.729
Can also come in the form of food?

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.940
The digestive system is an approximately 30 foot series of organs that convert food into fuel

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.630
Food enters the system through the mouth then moves into the esophagus the stomach and the intestines

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:05.489
Nutrients are absorbed into the body while solid waste is expelled through the anal canal the end of the digestive tract

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:13.860
No matter the roll size or shape of any of the body systems each began with a reproductive system

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.609
This system is responsible for creating life

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.919
the primary organs involved differ between the sexes with ovaries fallopian

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.910
Tubes the uterus and vagina found in women and testes and a sperm channel found in men together

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.130
Fertilization may occur organ systems form and then a child is born

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.390
Humans are complicated organisms

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.379
But when our 10 major organ systems are healthy

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.020
They ensure our well-being

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.660
