[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.040
SPEAKER: Hello, and
welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.980
Today's person to talk to
is Mr. Jonathan Safran Foer.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.080
Usually, people say, this
person needs no introduction,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.390
and then they fall into
a long introduction.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.250
I will try to
avoid this pitfall.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.280
So please, Mr.
Jonathan Safran Foer.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.990
Good afternoon.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.120
I'll try to just go quickly
a couple of questions

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.570
on each and every book that
you wrote over the years.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.310
And so the first
one will definitely

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.730
be "Everything is Illuminated,"
published in 2002.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:53.500
And it is definitely
a fiction book,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.490
yet as far as I
understand, it is

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.980
somewhat of an
expansion of a thesis

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.480
that you wrote beforehand.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.150
So my question is,
in your view, how

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.790
accurate is this book
when it describes

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.010
all the atrocities
done by the Ukrainians

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.260
while little help
from the Germans?

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.830
And how much would you like
us, as readers, to treat it

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.654
as really a true thing?

00:01:18.654 --> 00:01:20.820
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER: Well,
thank you, first of all,

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.790
for coming out.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.660
It's a very grave
question to begin with.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.290
SPEAKER: It only gets worse.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.415
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER: Yeah.

00:01:29.415 --> 00:01:33.440
I feel a little tonally
out of my wheelhouse here.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.030
It started when I arrived.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.580
I had to pee very
desperately, as you know.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.180
And I was, like, medevaced
to the men's room.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.620
And above the urinal
is a document.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.070
And I literally couldn't
tell if it was a joke or not.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.550
I think it was a joke.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.340
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.287
SPEAKER: Probably,
it's not a joke.

00:01:54.287 --> 00:01:56.120
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER:
I think it was a joke.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.280
It was something
about the difference

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.810
between debugging something
and some other word

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.610
that I didn't understand.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.300
And look, it was a joke
one way or the other.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.220
Either it was an
intentional joke,

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.840
or it was an accidental joke.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.530
I think it was an
intentional joke about,

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.180
here we are at the
urinal and we're

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.600
going to treat it like we might
treat coding, or something

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.780
like that, if that's even
a word that you guys use.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.730
Or it was an accidental
joke, in the sense

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.530
that I am going to seriously
ask you to think about something

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.260
while you're peeing, which
is entirely possible,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.240
because there were
disposable toothbrushes.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.860
And there are a
lot of suggestions

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.820
that one might continue to think
beyond the standard parameters

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.160
of a work day here.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.190
In any case, you're
asking me about tone

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.720
and the tone in that book.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.630
And it is a work of fiction.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.640
And sometimes in fiction,
one has to, or one does,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.950
move away from a kind
of journalistic truth

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.200
to get toward an
experiential truth.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.600
So my second book, for
example, has a nine-year-old

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.820
who does quite a bit
of the narrating.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.250
If I were to go to a
playground and take dictation

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.430
from a nine-year-old, I would
have an unassailably realistic

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.250
portrait of a nine-year-old-- a
journalistically accurate one.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.240
But if you were to then read
that, you might think either,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.950
this is boring, or
it just doesn't sound

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.550
like a nine-year-old to me.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.604
And it's one of the
strange things, too.

00:03:30.604 --> 00:03:32.270
And it's something
that perhaps you guys

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.490
wrestle with in your own ways--

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.840
the difference between something
being true and feeling true

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.010
or the difference between
information and substance.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.420
And so I'm trying to create,
as a novelist, a substance that

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.060
imparts feeling,
that provokes ideas,

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.910
and that offers
an experience that

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:06.830
is beyond the kind of
scientific account, let's say.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.440
That having been
said, there are--

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.170
and I'm willing to depart from
the scientific or journalistic

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.920
account, in order to make
it feel a certain way, most

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.529
of the time.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:18.500
But there are some
times when I'm not,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.820
when I want to be faithful
to history, for example.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.332
And so in the case
of that book, I

00:04:24.332 --> 00:04:25.790
did want to be
faithful to history.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.386
And I would have, even if
it weren't personal history.

00:04:34.386 --> 00:04:36.010
But it happened to
be personal history.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.250
And so that was one of the,
I guess, responsibilities

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.810
or burdens that I felt.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.476
SPEAKER: Interestingly
enough, something

00:04:44.476 --> 00:04:47.670
like three years after the
publishing of the book,

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.080
it came out as a film as well.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.540
So I'm wondering,
were you involved

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.010
in any way in the film?

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.090
And did you like it?

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.459
Or what was your opinion
on what was going on there?

00:04:56.459 --> 00:04:58.500
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER: I
was only barely involved.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.860
I came to know the
writer and director--

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.384
the same person-- quite well.

00:05:04.384 --> 00:05:05.550
We became very good friends.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.120
And so my involvement
was more as a friend than

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.870
as a collaborator
in the project.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.585
And I did like it.

00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:15.960
I was very, very
grateful that it

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:23.070
was made, because the scale
of film, the scale of screens

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.380
dwarfs the scale of paper.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:32.940
And whether that makes
a writer happy or sad

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.940
is a separate
conversation, perhaps.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.970
But it definitely makes a writer
happy when the world of screens

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.550
is brought into
the world of paper.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.330
And so having a film
adaptation made of your book

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.510
is the best thing that
can happen to a book,

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.230
short of Oprah liking it.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.150
But that's its own screen.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.790
She is big, because
she's on the screen.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:57.360
SPEAKER: OK.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.980
So let's move forward three
years later into this book

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.430
that probably everyone in the
world has read at least once.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.310
And if you haven't, you
should feel very shameful.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.720
This book-- and again, in a
way similar to what happened

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.690
in the first book and
also in the newest book--

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.600
revolve around
major catastrophes

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.380
or all kinds of atrocious
thing that happened.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.980
And I was wondering, why
does it happen in your books?

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.230
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER: Well,
I would say the same thing

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.640
about the days of my life
as I would about my books.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.760
When was the last time
you turned on the news

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.480
and there wasn't, if not a
catastrophe, then a tragedy

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.620
to give you pause and
also to make you reflect

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:57.140
on yourself, both in terms of
the scales of your domestic

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:04.220
or personal tragedies or
catastrophes when compared to

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.290
or in the context
of what's going on

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.110
in the world and
the various ways

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.779
that we can become
confused about scale?

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:13.820
That's something that
happens with the characters

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:14.810
in this book here.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:20.270
I am quite often a
confusion of when

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.740
there is a Syrian boy washed
up on the beach, what am I

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.130
then to do with the kind of
passive aggressive exchange

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.770
I had with my wife
the night before?

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:36.370
Dismiss it entirely, or
go back into it because

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.740
of a gratefulness for
being alive and wanting

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:47.240
to do as much as I can with
my life, knowing what I know

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.820
about the horrors of life?

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:55.314
So in each of my books--

00:07:55.314 --> 00:07:56.730
and including the
nonfiction book,

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.521
which you didn't mention,
"Eating Animals,"

00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:01.890
about factory farming--

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:07.080
there are these horrors
that force characters

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.730
to make decisions.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:12.570
And I guess I have been
interested in the ways

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:17.114
that people walk around with all
kinds of ideas of who they are,

00:08:17.114 --> 00:08:18.780
the things we think
we're thinking about

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.270
or think we're feeling,
which are often

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.750
just expressions of how we
want to think of ourselves

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.220
or who we want to
be or how we want

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.020
other people to think of us.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:35.520
And it takes, often, a crisis
to reveal who we actually are.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.650
SPEAKER: OK.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.429
So again, going back
to really this book,

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:43.100
I remember, again, from
my personal experience,

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.190
I read it, more or
less, when it came out.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.980
And I was feeling [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.860
I was 90% immersed in
what was going in the book

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.870
and 10% amazed at how
good this book is.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:09:02.720
But when I reached page 269 in
my version, there was this--

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.240
probably, again, you
might remember there's

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.850
three pages of numbers--

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:08.930
of digits.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.309
And I wouldn't start reading it.

00:09:10.309 --> 00:09:11.350
I don't want to bore you.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:14.420
But it starts with 69, 62, 63.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.770
And this is the dial tone
of this grandfather who

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:22.860
doesn't speak, and he uses
the dial tone to communicate.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.660
And I remember, again, my
friend and I trying, of course,

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:27.442
to decipher it.

00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:29.150
So we were sitting
there and said, OK, we

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.640
wouldn't use any software,
because you probably

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.230
wouldn't like us to use one.

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.080
So we sat there and
trying, reading.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.190
And we managed to go
something like, I don't know,

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.550
four or five lines.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.140
And I said, probably
this is enough.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.044
But I was wondering--

00:09:44.044 --> 00:09:45.710
first of all, again,
nobody's listening.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:50.990
Can you tell us, does it really
become random at some point?

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.480
Or can we read it
the entire thing?

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.006
What's going on there?

00:09:55.006 --> 00:09:56.630
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER:
Who can remember?

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.595
I wrote that so long ago.

00:09:58.595 --> 00:10:00.470
SPEAKER: Would you like
me to read it to you?

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:01.120
Maybe you'll remember?

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.150
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER:
Almost no memory of it.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.650
SPEAKER: 64.

00:10:04.766 --> 00:10:06.390
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER:
It is what it is.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:10.220
What I can say is, the point
of it is not to decipher it.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.560
The point of it is a kind
of expression of just

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.620
frustrated communication.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.230
And that is true in
"Everything is Illuminated."

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:22.340
The hero of the book-- although
there is somebody who is named

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.120
the hero--

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.510
but the actual hero of the book
is Alex, this young Ukrainian

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.390
who is a frustrated communicator
in a pretty extreme way.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:33.472
He speaks in a stilted,
very jarring English.

00:10:33.472 --> 00:10:35.180
And then there's
frustrated communication

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.980
throughout "Extremely Loud."

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.860
And that's maybe the
best example of it.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.830
And then also in "Here
I Am," characters

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:47.160
who have secret
languages between them

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:53.660
or who then secretly know
languages and people who

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.620
are unable to
express themselves,

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.920
but in certain
contexts and venues,

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:02.330
like one of the sons,
Sam, who's 12 years old,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:03.740
who spends almost
all of his time

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.890
playing this second
life kind of game

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:10.100
called "Other Life,"
which has, really,

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.621
its own unique
language of interacting

00:11:13.621 --> 00:11:14.995
and then the
husband and wife who

00:11:14.995 --> 00:11:19.660
have their own sort of, again,
secret language-- like code

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.094
words for things that each
knows means something else.

00:11:22.094 --> 00:11:23.510
When the kids are
in the backseat,

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.610
sometimes they will spell
out their conversations

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:29.030
so the kids can't
understand them.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.550
I guess it's not a
coincidence that someone

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:36.410
who devotes himself to
language would question

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.000
the effectiveness
of language maybe

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.610
more than other people would.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:43.730
And I think that
that is one example

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:50.440
of many of my playing out that
questioning through story.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:50.940
SPEAKER: OK.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.720
So you want to tell me the real
answer offline while nobody's

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.429
really listening?

00:11:54.429 --> 00:11:56.678
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER: I just
told you the real answer.

00:11:56.678 --> 00:11:58.180
I told you the real
question maybe.

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.120
SPEAKER: Yeah, probably so.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.120
And by the way, this book was
turned into a movie as well.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.440
So what do you think is
appealing in your books

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.397
to directors?

00:12:07.397 --> 00:12:09.230
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER:
Well, it's like, there

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.540
are people on Earth who have
been struck by lightning twice.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.956
And to ask them,
what do you think

00:12:12.956 --> 00:12:14.540
is appealing about
you-- maybe you

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.250
have a mouthful of
cavities or something

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:21.020
or you just happened
to walk near the ocean

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.900
during thunderstorms.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.100
I just got very lucky.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.724
I actually don't
think there's anything

00:12:26.724 --> 00:12:29.390
that is particularly
appealing about the books,

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:32.720
in the sense of being
ripe for adaptation.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.560
It just happened.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.920
I don't really know why.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.840
But I'm grateful that it did.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.950
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:41.480
OK, so we're moving five
years later from a book

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.990
that everybody read
to a book that I don't

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.070
know how many people read.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:49.460
It's called "The
Tree of Codes"--

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.360
this one.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.300
Again, I had a hard time
even getting a copy of it,

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.540
due to the fact that maybe
not too many people read it

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:57.620
or read about it.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.600
Would you like just
to tell us a tiny bit

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.480
of what made you do it?

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.690
And how do you expect--

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:05.370
not to expect.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:09.560
How do you imagine
a reader handling

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.450
this art, piece of art--

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:13.460
whatever you call it.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.960
JONATHAN SAFRAN
FOER: Well, handling

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.918
is the perfect word,
because it's a book that's

00:13:16.918 --> 00:13:18.560
meant to be handled.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.580
You found it on Amazon.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.590
What you didn't find
is a Kindle version

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:23.150
of it-- an ebook version.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.670
I was approached by a--

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.370
I got a phone call one day.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:30.590
I remember exactly where I was.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:32.510
And I was in my office.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:35.064
I was trying to write a novel.

00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:36.980
And I got a phone call
from somebody who said,

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.160
I'm starting a publishing
house in England,

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.270
and we're going to do these kind
of literary visual crossover

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.720
books-- art books.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.260
And I can't give you an advance.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.480
I can't promise
good distribution.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.980
We're not going to
market the book.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.950
But I can make any
book you want to make.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:58.250
And there was something
about that that just--

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:02.780
I don't know if I wanted to
challenge her certainty that we

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.280
can make anything
you want to make,

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.330
or if I just found it to be a
really appealing invitation.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:13.260
But we started to work together
and came up with this idea.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.350
It might be worth holding
it up and showing people,

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.200
because it's easy to
understand when you see it,

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.810
but it's very hard to
understand when it's described.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.090
So I took a book
that already existed,

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:27.110
which was Bruno Schulz's
"Street of Crocodiles."

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:28.470
I don't know if you can see.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:33.760
And I had die cut,
out of the book, words

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.800
so that the words
that remain tell

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.224
a completely different story.

00:14:37.224 --> 00:14:39.890
If you haven't heard of it, it's
because what she said was true.

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:43.540
We're not going to
distribute it very well.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.289
It was a hard book to make--

00:14:45.289 --> 00:14:46.330
a very hard book to make.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.670
There's actually a great
video you can find on YouTube,

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.770
I think, of the production
of the book, which

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.290
is a kind of pleasure
in and of itself.

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.180
But they didn't print
a huge number of them.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.970
And that's it.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.670
SPEAKER: So again, and I
saw in one of the interviews

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:02.700
that you--

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:07.070
one of the statements which
struck me as really interesting

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:11.210
was, "This is a book that
remembers it has a body."

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.829
So again, would you
like to elaborate?

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:14.870
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER: I
actually didn't say that.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.470
It was the artist
Olafur Eliasson

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.170
who said that as a
blurb for the book.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.380
But I think he
meant that we often

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.190
forget that books are
things, are artifacts,

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.260
and that they have qualities.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.330
The margins in the
page are a quality.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.350
The font is a quality.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:35.960
The cover, of
course, is a quality.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.210
The way books
smell is a quality.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:41.210
The heft of a book when
you're in bed or in a bathtub

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:42.680
or on the sofa is a quality.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.190
And ebooks, great as they
can be for certain things,

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:50.180
lack all of those qualities,
or at least they're diminished.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:53.060
It's an interesting
question in life.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.390
What do we get in exchange
for the loss of qualities,

00:15:56.390 --> 00:16:00.350
because we're increasingly
living in a world

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:02.240
without qualities?

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.970
And some of them seem
awfully benign or silly even

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:05.690
to mention.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:10.190
Like, phones don't
have buttons anymore.

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:14.420
There are representations
of buttons on a screen.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.370
Buttons have qualities.

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:18.440
They make a clicking
sound sometimes.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.860
Sometimes they put up a
little bit of resistance.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:26.960
Sometimes they make each
letter feel a little bit more

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.230
individualized than
a virtual keyboard.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.240
So those may not matter at all.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.250
Those examples
probably don't matter.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:36.440
But man, are there
a lot of examples.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.470
And I'm sure that's-- or I hope
that's something that you guys

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:45.620
wrestle with all the time as
you create the future of human

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:51.890
experience and human
thought and human culture.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:55.070
Who is remembering qualities?

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.380
It's clear who's
remembering expediency.

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.870
It's clear who's remembering
profit, profitability.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:03.560
It's clear who's remembering
the significance of information,

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.960
or at least the significance
of collecting information.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.060
But who is
remembering qualities?

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.670
Because I would bet, to
just about the last person

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:14.420
in this room, qualities are
what make us feel human.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.339
I think quality is
what makes love, love.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:18.339
It's what makes fear,
fear and makes hope, hope.

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:19.922
I wouldn't want to
forget about those.

00:17:19.922 --> 00:17:20.518
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:17:20.518 --> 00:17:23.060
By the way, an interesting
thing that happened to me

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.470
with this book was that--

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.760
preparing for this interview,
I talk with my kids.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.370
And I told them about this book.

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:34.379
And I thought I would
amaze them and never

00:17:34.379 --> 00:17:35.420
seen such a thing before.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.540
And they told me, oh, in third
grade, we did such things.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.060
So I wonder if you
started the trend here

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.484
that every elementary school--

00:17:43.484 --> 00:17:45.650
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER: It
resembles a children's book

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.030
in a lot of ways.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:49.820
Children's books are
wonderful objects oftentimes--

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.310
like pop-up books.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:54.020
It's kind of amazing, actually.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.620
A novel might now cost
$30 in a bookstore.

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.320
And if you go to the children's
book section, for, like, $6,

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.782
you can get a book that has all
of these full color and things

00:18:03.782 --> 00:18:05.240
that come out and
they make noises.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.190
And they can be
really wonderfully,

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.740
wonderfully inventive.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:13.610
SPEAKER: If we talked about
movies for the previous books,

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.710
this one was adapted
into a ballet.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.310
What's the story behind it?

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:18.024
How can it be?

00:18:18.024 --> 00:18:19.440
JONATHAN SAFRAN
FOER: So actually,

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.940
the artist I mentioned, Olafur
Eliasson, who said that thing

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.600
about the book having a body--

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.610
he collaborated with a
choreographer, Wayne McGregor,

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:32.630
and a musician,
the XX, that band--

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.100
Jamie XX.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:39.230
And they made a ballet, which
was really quite a spectacle--

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:40.419
pretty amazing.

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:41.960
What did it have to
do with the book?

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:42.590
Not a lot.

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:47.510
I think that they were
inspired by the idea of layers

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:53.000
and layering and creating
content by removing content--

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.100
when the absence becomes
the positive rather than

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.390
the negative.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.280
And that idea was
a starting point.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:03.660
But it's not as if they tried to
convey the story that the book

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.830
tells in a different form.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:06.330
SPEAKER: OK.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:09.120
So now we are moving to 2016.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.560
And by the way, as a
promotion for this new book,

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.310
they said the first
book in 11 years,

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.560
as if this one does not exist.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.143
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER: Well, not
to mention the book we haven't

00:19:18.143 --> 00:19:20.760
talked about, which is "Eating
Animals," which is a nonfiction

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.010
book, which I actually
spoke about at the Google

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:25.080
campus in wherever it is--

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:25.960
California?

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:26.947
Sun-- I don't even--

00:19:26.947 --> 00:19:28.150
SPEAKER: In Mountain View.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:29.730
JONATHAN SAFRAN
FOER: Mountain View.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:31.279
Yeah, I spoke about it there.

00:19:31.279 --> 00:19:32.820
I had a really
wonderful conversation

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.028
that happened-- do you
remember-- with the person who

00:19:35.028 --> 00:19:38.192
ran the food system there--
the chef, I guess it is.

00:19:38.192 --> 00:19:39.900
I don't know if she's
still there or not.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.858
I just happened to remember
we had half an hour

00:19:41.858 --> 00:19:44.280
before, and incredibly
thoughtful person.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.010
And it turned out to be one
of my favorite conversations

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.570
of that book tour.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:49.470
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:53.250
So anyway, again, I assume
that maybe not everyone

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:54.780
read "Here I Am."

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:59.914
So would you like maybe to read
a short excerpt from this book?

00:19:59.914 --> 00:20:01.080
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER: I can.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.230
I think that's a very safe
assumption, by the way,

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.160
that not everybody
has read this book.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.720
If they had, I
wouldn't even bother

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.910
showing up to stuff like this.

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:11.689
No, that's a joke, obviously.

00:20:11.689 --> 00:20:12.730
SPEAKER: It's a good one.

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:13.950
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER: Yeah.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:14.620
I can read.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.720
Sure.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.600
I have a little
thing I could do,

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.390
which I was just
thinking about recently.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:24.900
So the book takes
place in Washington DC,

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.570
where I grew up, over the
course of about six weeks.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:32.700
And we follow a family through
two crises, one of which

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.950
is domestic, which
is a discovered cell

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.350
phone that reveals an affair.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:38.760
And the other is global.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.650
There's an earthquake,
which precipitates

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:42.930
a war in the Middle
East that's so

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.110
extreme that the prime
minister of Israel

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.120
asks Jews to come back--

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.750
in his words, come back--

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:52.032
to Israel to fight
for its survival.

00:20:52.032 --> 00:20:54.240
But a lot of the book just
takes place in Washington,

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.690
inside this house, inside
of kitchens and bedrooms

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.880
and living rooms, as
these family members

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.150
interact with each other.

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.570
So we have Jacob and Julie
are the married couple.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:07.320
Three sons-- Sam, Max, and
Benji, who are 12, 10, and 6.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.195
So I'm just going to
read a very short scene.

00:21:09.195 --> 00:21:13.770
It's two pages, but it's
almost all dialogue, where--

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.320
the book opens with
Sam, the 12-year-old,

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.180
having gotten in
trouble in school,

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.360
because there was a piece of
paper found on his desk with

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.520
a list of totally
inappropriate words--

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.150
racist, misogynistic,
homophobic, anti-Semitic,

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:28.230
sexually lewd--

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:31.149
just all the bad words
you could think of.

00:21:31.149 --> 00:21:33.690
And there's a question of, did
he actually do anything wrong?

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:36.180
He didn't direct
them at anybody.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:41.580
They don't seem to refer to
anything other than themselves.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:44.640
Jacob, that evening,
goes into Sam's room

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.240
to sort of have a conversation
with him about it,

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.270
and particularly his
use of the N-word, which

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:53.400
is the only word that's
never actually articulated

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.250
between two people
who is referred to.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.880
Sam is now explaining,
well, he couldn't possibly

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.270
be racist, because his
girlfriend is black.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.800
So he says, "'Dad,
Billie's black,

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.445
so how could I be a racist?'

00:22:07.445 --> 00:22:11.180
'Billie?' 'The girl
I'm in love with.'

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.400
'You have a girlfriend?' 'No.'

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.060
'So then I'm confused.'

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.460
'I said, she's the girl
that I'm in love with.'

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:17.960
'OK.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.731
And you said Billie,
but a girl, right?'

00:22:20.731 --> 00:22:21.230
'Yes.

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:24.210
And she's black, so
how can I be racist?'

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:27.080
'Well, I'm not sure that
that logic quite works.'

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.960
'It does,' Sam said."

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.767
And his dad said,
"Well, you know

00:22:30.767 --> 00:22:32.600
who points out that
some of his best friends

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.141
are black, right--
somebody who isn't

00:22:34.141 --> 00:22:36.830
comfortable with black people."

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:41.437
said, 'And And Sam says, "None
of my best friends are black."

00:22:41.437 --> 00:22:43.520
And his father says, "And
for whatever it's worth,

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.290
I'm pretty sure that
African-American is

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:48.500
the preferred nomenclature.'
'Nomenclature?'

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.302
'Terminology.'

00:22:50.302 --> 00:22:52.760
'Well, shouldn't the guy who's
in love with a black girl be

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:56.626
the one establishing the
nomenclature?'" And Jacob,

00:22:56.626 --> 00:22:59.000
the father, said, "'Isn't that
the pot calling the kettle

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.280
African-American?'

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.590
'Pot?' 'Look, I'm
just joking around.

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:04.670
It's an interesting name.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:05.270
That's all.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:06.500
Not a judgment.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.120
You know that you were named
for a great, great uncle who

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.080
perished in Birkenau.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:13.010
With Jews, there always has to
be some significance attached.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:14.800
'Some suffering, you mean.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.120
You know, Gentiles just
pick names that sound nice,

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.220
or they even make them up.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.780
Billie was named after
Billie Holiday,' Sam said.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:22.280
'All right.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.280
So fine, she's the exception
that proves the rule.'

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.290
'Who were you named
after,' Sam asked,

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:29.720
his interest a small concession
in response to the guilt

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:34.370
of having forced his dad's voice
into quiet sadness earlier.

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:36.710
'I was named for a
distant relative Yacov--

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:38.780
supposedly an amazing,
larger-than-life guy.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:42.280
Story goes, he crushed a
Cossack's head in his hand.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:46.310
'Cool.' 'Well, I'm obviously
not strong like that.

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.790
We don't even know any Cossacks.

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:51.650
And at most, I'm
the size of life.'

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:54.470
One of their stomachs grumbled,
but neither knew whose.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:56.720
'Well,' Jacob
said, 'bottom line,

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.060
I think it's awesome that
you have a girlfriend.'

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.820
'She's not my girlfriend.'

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.810
'Nomenclature strikes twice.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.210
I think it's awesome
that you're in love.'

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:06.440
'I'm not in love.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:10.270
I love her.' 'Well, whatever is
going on, this obviously stays

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:10.900
between us.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.250
You can count on me.'

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.451
'I've already talked
to Mom about it.'

00:24:15.451 --> 00:24:15.950
'Really?

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:18.980
When?' 'I don't know--
a couple of weeks ago.'

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.830
'Wait a minute,
this is old news?'

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:24.630
Jacob stared at Sam's screen.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.310
Was this what drew Sam to it--

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:30.000
not the ability to be
elsewhere but to be nowhere?

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.060
'What did you tell her?'

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.440
Jacob asked.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.990
'Who?' 'Your mother.'

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:39.490
'You mean Mom?' 'Yeah,
that's the one.'

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:43.150
'I don't know.' 'You don't
know as in, you don't feel like

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:45.430
talking about it
with me right now?'

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:47.530
'Yeah, as in that.'

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.260
'It's strange, because she's
convinced that you did write

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.820
those words.'

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.840
'I didn't,' Sam said.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.150
'OK, I'm becoming annoying.

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:56.680
I'll get out of here.'

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.330
'I didn't say you
were annoying.'

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:01.220
Jacob moved to the door
to leave but then paused.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:03.130
'You want to hear a joke?'

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:04.750
'No,' Sam said.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:08.880
'It's dirty.' 'Then
definitely no.'

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.380
'All right.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:13.710
What's the difference between
a Subaru and an erection?'

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:15.030
'No means no, Dad.'

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:17.700
'No, no, seriously,
what's the difference?'

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.430
'No, no, no, seriously,
not interested.'

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:22.620
Jacob leaned forward
and whispered,

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:25.680
'I don't have a Subaru.'

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.390
Despite himself, Sam
released a huge laugh--

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.220
the kind involving
snorting and saliva.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.400
And Jacob laughed--
not at his own joke,

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.210
but at his son's laughter.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.990
They laugh together
vigorously, hysterically.

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:39.420
Sam struggled, without success,
to regain his composure

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.100
and said, 'The funny thing--

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.050
the really funny thing--

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:46.470
is you do have a Subaru.'

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:48.240
And then they laughed more.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.550
And Jacob spit a
little and teared up

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:53.460
and remembered how horrible
it was to be Sam's age--

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.230
how painful and unfair.

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:56.610
'It's true,' Jacob said.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:58.347
'I totally have a Subaru.

00:25:58.347 --> 00:25:59.430
I should have said Toyota.

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:01.350
What was I thinking?'

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.370
'What were you thinking?'

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:04.774
What was he thinking?"

00:26:04.774 --> 00:26:06.710
Stop there.

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:14.315
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:14.315 --> 00:26:15.690
SPEAKER: After I
read this book--

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:20.760
and it was when it
came out in hardback--

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.540
there was kind of a very
strange rhyming event for me,

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:28.770
because I was driving my car
almost a few days after I

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:30.750
finished reading it.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:35.805
And I heard, over the radio, a
new Leonard Cohen song, which

00:26:35.805 --> 00:26:38.347
is called "You Want it Darker."

00:26:38.347 --> 00:26:39.180
I guess you know it.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.490
Again, I just read just
the first couple of lines.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:46.110
It said, "If you are the
dealer, I'm out of the game.

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:49.490
If you are the healer, it
means I'm broken and lame.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:52.860
If thine is the glory, then
mine must be the shame.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:56.100
You want it darker,
we kill the flame."

00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:01.630
And then he comes to the chorus
and he said, ""[NON-ENGLISH]..

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:02.520
I'm ready, my Lord.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.660
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.500
I'm ready."

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.110
"Here I am" in Hebrew.

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:11.410
And again, I was wondering,
is this kind of magic?

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:13.970
What would you read into
this kind of thing--

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:19.040
that two very important artists
came up with this important

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.820
of using [NON-ENGLISH]
or "here I am"

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:26.112
as part of whatever they
are doing that moment?

00:27:26.112 --> 00:27:28.320
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER: Well,
it's only [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:28.994
"here I am."

00:27:28.994 --> 00:27:30.660
It's also "I'm ready,"
as you just said,

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.610
which are the last
two words of this book

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:36.360
and have a huge significance
as the last two words.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.640
It's just a total coincidence.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.040
Things can be sort of
culturally in the air.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.750
"Magically" was
the word you used.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.530
And it's not a bad word.

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:46.290
But it's not
magical in the sense

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:47.700
that it defies explanation.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.100
It's just magical in the
sense that the explanation

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.210
is so wonderful--

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:54.420
that there's kind
of something like

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:55.830
a collective consciousness.

00:27:55.830 --> 00:28:01.050
There are the ideas that
people have independently

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:02.020
and powerfully.

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:06.850
And the reality is that this
is happening all the time.

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:10.111
It's just that we only get to
witness it every now and again.

00:28:10.111 --> 00:28:12.360
The things that seem like
profound coincidences really

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:12.859
aren't.

00:28:12.859 --> 00:28:18.660
It's just that the ability to be
present when they're happening

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:19.590
is rare.

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:24.090
But their occurrence, in and
of itself, is not that rare.

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:27.470
There's also, at
the exact same time,

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:32.480
in the TV show "Transparent,"
which I really love,

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.270
there was an episode in which
[NON-ENGLISH] and "here I am"

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:38.800
also took on a
great significance.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.090
SPEAKER: Maybe I'll stop here.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:42.660
And if anyone in the audience
has some questions to you

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:44.640
as well, then this
might be a good time.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.140
AUDIENCE: So to go
back earlier when

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:49.560
you were talking about the--

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.300
I don't know-- the art project
book and you mentioned that

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:56.240
you'd hope that we would be
mindful of the qualities that

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:02.150
we're losing as we move to
other forms of media, it seems,

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:04.840
to me, also that there are a lot
of qualities that we gained--

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.620
like, all the qualities
that you listed

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:09.080
having to do with books
that you said were trivial

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.350
were things that were not
present when stories were just

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:14.060
transmitted orally.

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.580
And I wondered, do you feel
like there's a net loss?

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:19.950
Or do you think it's
just the qualities

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:23.452
that we gained by going to
ebooks or whatever else?

00:29:23.452 --> 00:29:25.410
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER:
I'm definitely not making

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:28.290
the argument that technology
leads to less qualities

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:28.909
necessarily.

00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:31.200
But it's just something that's
worth thinking about it.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.520
That was my only point.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:38.010
In the specific case of going
from a paper book to an ebook,

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:43.260
presently, I don't know
what an ebook offers,

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:46.505
beyond the obvious things,
which are wonderful convenience,

00:29:46.505 --> 00:29:47.130
which is great.

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:49.710
And it gives one the
ability to carry many books

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:51.390
at the same time
or to have access

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:53.610
to books that you
wouldn't necessarily

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:54.449
have in a bookstore.

00:29:54.449 --> 00:29:55.740
And those are wonderful things.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:58.380
But in terms of the
reading experience,

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:02.010
I don't find the quality of
reading a book on the screen

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:04.860
to be as rich as reading a book.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:08.310
That having been said,
the ebook experience

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:10.590
is obviously going to
change in the coming years.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:13.325
And because of that, the
nature of books will change.

00:30:13.325 --> 00:30:14.700
And there will be
the expectation

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.100
to have all kinds of
ancillary material

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:20.190
and that you'll be able to
link to the author talking

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:23.580
about why he or she made a
decision in a certain point.

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:25.596
Or you'll be able to--

00:30:25.596 --> 00:30:26.970
I assume one can
already do this.

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:28.980
I just don't really
swim in that water.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:32.540
But you could click
on a line that you

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.170
are sure is an
allusion to something

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:40.350
and then Shakespeare
will open up or Faulkner

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:42.140
or whatever it was.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:47.900
So I get frustrated
when people talk

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:52.149
about the inherent good or the
inherent bad of technology.

00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:53.690
It's just such an
oversimplification.

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:56.510
And it's naive, and
it's unproductive.

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:58.310
But I also get
frustrated when there

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:00.920
isn't an honest and
robust conversation

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.810
about what it is
that we're losing

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:04.600
as we are gaining these things.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.650
As somebody said to
me the other day,

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:08.990
technology now runs the
risk of answering questions

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:10.440
it doesn't ask.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.040
And there are massive
changes afoot,

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.080
in terms of what it
is to be a human being

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.880
and how we relate to each other.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:23.000
And I'm so grateful for a
lot of the things that--

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:23.630
is that true?

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:25.970
Am I so grateful?

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:26.600
Maybe I'm not.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.260
I don't know.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.590
But I'm not dismissive of
the new ways of communicating

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:31.440
with other people.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.770
I think there
probably are examples

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:37.700
in which it makes me
feel more human, as

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:41.090
opposed to simply presenting
the illusion of offering

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:43.610
more and more time,
which it does not do.

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:47.690
But what I don't
think is I don't

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:56.800
think that there are broad ways
of together asking questions

00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.940
about not simply,
what is efficient,

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:03.580
and not simply, what is
attractive in a short-term

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:07.480
sense, but what is good?

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.650
It's a very basic question.

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:12.610
We were saying earlier,
Google has had the mantra as--

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:15.790
this is, again, to an outside
or a lay person of-- what is it?

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:18.610
Do no evil, or don't be evil?

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:19.630
Don't be evil.

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:23.257
That's an awfully
low bar to clear.

00:32:23.257 --> 00:32:25.840
There is another question to be
asked, which is, what would it

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:30.220
mean to do good and to
think very deliberately

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:34.434
about, is there a difference
in quality of thought?

00:32:34.434 --> 00:32:36.850
Is one kind of thought better
than another kind of thought

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:38.380
that makes us feel--

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:43.330
I don't want anybody to be
the arbiter of that question.

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:45.460
But we are living in
a world in which there

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:48.840
are arbiters of such questions.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.620
Google and Facebook
and Twitter--

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:54.700
they are the arbiters of
how should humans think,

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:58.610
because the form doesn't
predetermine or dictate.

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:00.530
But it strongly
influences the kinds

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:02.390
of interactions that
we have and the kinds

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:03.920
of thoughts that we have.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.470
And it's nice to imagine that
the goodness of the quality

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:12.470
of those thoughts is something
that is as seriously considered

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:15.210
as any other question.

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:17.130
AUDIENCE: 9/11 is
a pretty big topic

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:19.980
to take on since,
for many of us,

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.080
it looms large in
our recent memory.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:26.190
We're in college or
wherever we were, many of us

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:27.780
were living it when it happened.

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.250
Did this feel like a
big challenge for you

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:34.380
to take on such a big topic?

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.140
Did you decide, I want
to write a 9/11 book

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:40.170
and then the characters came
out of that or vice versa?

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:43.200
Can you just say
anything about the topic

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.620
as it fit into your
writing process?

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.840
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER: It
was a very difficult thing

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:49.620
to write about.

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:51.930
I was helped by the
fact that I didn't

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:53.190
know I was writing about it.

00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:01.454
If I were to know what
I was doing in advance

00:34:01.454 --> 00:34:03.870
of trying to do it, most of
the things that I write about,

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:05.220
I just wouldn't do.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:08.489
And a lot of my writing is the
result of a very open process

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:10.830
that isn't outcome-oriented.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:14.100
I'm not trying to write a book
about anything in particular.

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.929
I never find a voice
that I want to share.

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:19.020
There are never characters
living inside of me.

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.030
There's no story that
I'm burning to tell.

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:23.429
It's a very open process--

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:27.719
open to intuitions,
open to distractions,

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:31.860
open to my changing self
and the changing world.

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:38.080
Most writers require two years
to write a book or three years.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.900
You change over
that period of time.

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.250
And the world changes.

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:45.510
And I would never want to be
in the position of responding

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:52.080
or being enslaved to what
seemed like a good idea had

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.210
by somebody that I no
longer am in a world

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:56.730
that we no longer live in.

00:34:56.730 --> 00:35:00.240
So I like books to bend.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.149
In the case of "Extremely
Loud," I literally

00:35:03.149 --> 00:35:05.190
didn't know that I was
writing about September 11

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:07.090
for quite a long time.

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:12.150
I had had this boy Oscar
whose father died tragically

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:16.440
somehow, very suddenly.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.920
And he had a lot of the same
characteristics and phobias

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.240
that he has now.

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.030
He used imagination in a
lot a lot of the same ways.

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:26.520
And I actually gave the
book to my little brother

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:29.250
who said to me, is
it possible you're

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:32.550
writing about September 11?

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:35.460
There's a certain quality of
idea that once you hear it,

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.410
it becomes so obvious.

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:42.810
But before hearing it, you never
would have had it yourself.

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:45.340
And that was such an idea.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.610
But all writing is hard, I find.

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:49.920
I find it's all
difficult. And the idea

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:55.680
of taking on a challenging
subject, consciously or not,

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.910
what else would you be doing?

00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:01.880
Why wouldn't you be trying
to approach the big concerns?

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:04.560
A big concern doesn't have to
be a big historical concern.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.240
And it doesn't
have to be tragic.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:11.340
Humor can just as powerfully
address the big concerns.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:13.657
But it's always tough.

00:36:13.657 --> 00:36:15.240
I have a friend who
is a writer-- he's

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.780
no longer alive,
unfortunately-- who used to say,

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:22.600
writing is like pulling
teeth out of your penis.

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.840
It's as tough as it comes.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:29.610
For somebody who believes
that writing has the ability

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:36.810
to organize one's thoughts
and feelings and the ability

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:40.650
to organize them in a way
that they can be shared--

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:46.260
well, that's a big tool to have.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:49.305
And so you wouldn't want
to use the proton collider.

00:36:49.305 --> 00:36:50.400
Is that what it's called?

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.420
The electron collider?

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.162
What is it?

00:36:53.162 --> 00:36:54.870
SPEAKER: Collider
definitely is in there.

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:55.953
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER: Yes.

00:36:55.953 --> 00:36:57.800
And it's probably
in Switzerland.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:01.620
But actually, if I could
run back to the men's room,

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:04.200
I'm sure there's an explanation
of it above the urinal.

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:09.060
But you wouldn't want to
use that to scramble eggs.

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.610
That would be a stupid
use of an amazing tool.

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:14.910
The novel is an
amazing tool and should

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:19.717
be used in a way that
befits its potential.

00:37:19.717 --> 00:37:21.300
AUDIENCE: Again, I
have two questions.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:21.940
One is easy.

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:23.340
And then one, I haven't
figured out how to ask.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:25.290
The easy one kind of
relates to the question

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:27.270
asked about making the movies.

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:29.520
I listened to "Here I
Am" as an audio book

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.542
and wondered to
what extent you had

00:37:31.542 --> 00:37:33.000
any involvement in
that-- if you've

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.300
heard it, if you enjoyed it.

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.020
I really thought the
narrator did a fabulous job

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:38.994
and was a good way
to enjoy the book.

00:37:38.994 --> 00:37:41.160
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER: So
we'll answer that while you

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.990
think about your second one.

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:43.800
I haven't heard it.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.822
I haven't, because I
have a kind of resistance

00:37:46.822 --> 00:37:49.280
to it, not in the sense that
I'm worried about its quality.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.210
I've actually heard only
good things about it.

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:53.330
And I'm grateful for
the person who did it.

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:55.782
But it would be awkward
for me to listen to,

00:37:55.782 --> 00:37:57.240
in much the same
way that listening

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.781
to your voice on an
answering machine

00:37:58.781 --> 00:38:02.310
is awkward, just
multiplied by 100 million.

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:04.949
I've heard really funny
stories of people who

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:06.240
are listening to the audiobook.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.280
They're bopping around in their
convertible with the windows

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:08.780
down.

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:09.600
It's a nice day.

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.650
Come to a red light.

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:12.410
Cars on the left,
cars on the right.

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:14.070
And then it gets
to the part about--

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:17.340
there's some pretty sexually
explicit stuff in this book--

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:20.340
stuff where I very deliberately
wrote the crudest thing I

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:24.360
could conceive of, because
it had to be for the context,

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.600
because it's examining
the power of language,

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:32.670
examining the relationship
between words and action.

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:34.470
And also, it had to be
something that there

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:38.640
was no way for Jacob, the
husband, to be able to say,

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.680
well, it's not what it seems.

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.890
It had to be undeniably awful.

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:47.230
And so I've heard stories of
people who are reading a book--

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:49.110
and those things
come out of the blue.

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:51.660
They're not contextualized
in the beginning--

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.760
reading the book and then
all of a sudden, it's--

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.625
you can imagine.

00:38:56.625 --> 00:38:59.000
AUDIENCE: That was actually
the first thing [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.100
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER: You
needed the [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:00.940
to talk about it.

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:01.770
AUDIENCE: When I
saw the pile there,

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:03.322
I wanted to see
the physical copy

00:39:03.322 --> 00:39:05.530
so that I could see how it
was presented in the book,

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:07.450
because I remember it
being jarring in the car,

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:09.200
especially until the
story kind of evolved

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.035
to interpret what was going on.

00:39:11.035 --> 00:39:12.160
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER: Yeah.

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:16.630
In the book, it's
these sexting sentences

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:18.850
that are taken out of context.

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:23.380
But in the book, they're removed
from the body of the text

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.160
by a space.

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.204
And they're centered,
and they're in italics.

00:39:27.204 --> 00:39:28.870
So when you read it,
there's no question

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:31.120
that you're reading something
that is out of context.

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:34.990
And I've wondered how a
voice would accomplish that.

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:38.380
Do you want to
try to imitate it?

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:41.290
AUDIENCE: It's
not safe for work.

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:42.740
The harder question was--

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.800
and I wish I could think
of specific examples.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.960
But there certain--

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.850
I don't know-- either
paragraphs or sentences

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:54.960
or phrases or concepts that seem
almost as if they're poetic.

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.770
They're within the
context of the book.

00:39:56.770 --> 00:40:00.460
And I wonder if it's things
you collect over time, thoughts

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:01.990
you have just as
you live your life,

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:04.540
and it's time to present
them in the book,

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.541
or if, as you're writing and--

00:40:06.541 --> 00:40:09.040
I don't know-- in the flow of
telling your story or thinking

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.570
about it--

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:13.780
the things I'm referring to
is maybe like scrapbook pieces

00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:14.680
that--

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:18.880
important thoughts that you've
had are coming to you in line

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.980
as you create the
book, or if they're

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:24.100
things you've wanted to say
and here's an opportunity

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.320
to say so, even if
that wasn't where

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.995
you imagined them showing up.

00:40:27.995 --> 00:40:30.370
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER: That's
a really wonderful question.

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:32.969
And I'm not even sure I
know the answer exactly.

00:40:32.969 --> 00:40:34.510
I can tell you a
little bit about how

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:36.801
I write in the course of each
day, which may be my best

00:40:36.801 --> 00:40:38.320
way of answering that.

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:44.680
So when I face the
blank page or screen,

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:49.930
I devote the beginning of
each day to a kind of almost

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:52.030
free associative thought.

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:54.400
So I will sit down
and just ask myself,

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.460
is there something I'm
thinking about right now?

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:58.260
Is there anything on my mind?

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:01.200
And I might literally look
around the room and just,

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:04.960
does anything here capture
my imagination right now?

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.710
And it's not a
judgment of the thing.

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:12.117
It's a judgment of my
imagination in that moment.

00:41:12.117 --> 00:41:13.450
It's not even a judgment at all.

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:16.244
It's just a description of it.

00:41:16.244 --> 00:41:18.160
So like, right now, I
can look around the room

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.830
and think, these lighting--

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:23.440
doesn't really do
anything for me.

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.270
The exit sign
that's illuminated,

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:26.120
kind of interesting.

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.850
Maybe I'll come back to that.

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:31.740
These chairs-- a globe--

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.570
so anyway, I would
find something and just

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:36.580
reflect on it and
research it a little bit

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:41.170
and write for an hour or
two about some thing that

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:44.530
just captures my mind
with absolutely no regard

00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:45.880
or concern for the outcome--

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:48.970
if it's going to fit into what
I'm working on, if it's useful.

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:52.780
It's just, I assume there
is some good reason that I'm

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.065
interested in something.

00:41:54.065 --> 00:41:56.560
It's a little bit like--

00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:00.640
I don't know if you ever have
the experience of getting

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.560
into bed on Friday
night after a long day

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.660
at the end of a long week.

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:05.830
You're really tired.

00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:06.550
The room is cold.

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:08.740
The bed is warm.

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:10.420
And you're about to drift off.

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.640
And then you have a little idea.

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:17.290
And you think, well, I could get
out of bed and write it down,

00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:19.720
or I could just assume
that it's not important,

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.330
or I can assume that I'll
remember it in the morning.

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:24.100
But nobody ever,
ever, ever remembers

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:25.870
those ideas in the morning.

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:29.390
So writing, the way I do it, is
a lot like getting out of bed.

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:30.760
It's uncomfortable.

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:33.010
It's not the easier
way to do things.

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:35.500
And I'm not at all sure
that these thoughts are

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.180
going to have any significance.

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:40.000
But I know that I can't
know unless I record them

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.900
and I'm able to
reflect on them later.

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.162
So I spend the first bit of
every writing day doing that.

00:42:45.162 --> 00:42:47.620
Then I go back to the beginning
of what I have been working

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:49.150
on for the last
stretch of time--

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:52.750
so let's say a 50-page section--

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:54.370
and I'll read it
from the beginning,

00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:56.455
editing it while I read it.

00:42:56.455 --> 00:42:58.600
So I'm constantly
editing what I work on.

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.750
I don't make a draft and then a
second draft and a third draft.

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:04.750
It's always combing over itself.

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:09.670
And then at the end of the day,
when I have maybe an hour left,

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:12.400
I will look back at the
thing from the beginning--

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.889
at the globe or
whatever it was--

00:43:14.889 --> 00:43:16.180
and think, is this interesting?

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:18.013
Does this have anything
to do with anything?

00:43:18.013 --> 00:43:20.170
Was it just a little
piece of mental garbage

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:24.680
that had to be disposed
of, or is it relevant?

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:26.360
And when I'm in the
beginning of a book

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:28.617
and I don't yet have a
feeling for what it is,

00:43:28.617 --> 00:43:30.200
that stuff at the
beginning of the day

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.000
is almost always nothing.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:32.990
I can't use it.

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:36.320
As I get to the end of a
book, four days out of five,

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:41.404
it ends up becoming part
of what I'm working on.

00:43:41.404 --> 00:43:46.130
And I can think of so many
explicit examples in this book.

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:50.074
There's little meditations on
contingency plans for asteroids

00:43:50.074 --> 00:43:50.990
approaching the earth.

00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:54.680
There's a little meditation
on sign language.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.560
There's the meditation
on this Nirvana lyric.

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.140
There's a meditation
on the animals

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:02.810
in the Museum of Natural
History and why their positioned

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:03.980
in the ways that they are.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:07.100
Those are all the products
of that early morning "I'm

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:09.680
thinking about this
thing right now"

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:14.360
and then the realization that
the part of the brain that you

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:18.500
don't have control over
is constantly at work

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:20.700
and is constantly
doing interesting work,

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:22.310
as opposed to the
part of the brain

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:23.750
that I do have
control over, which

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:26.960
is eating a lot of popcorn
and watching a lot of TV

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:32.036
and, even when it is
engaged, isn't that great.

00:44:32.036 --> 00:44:33.410
It's OK, but it's
not that great.

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:36.770
I would never be able to write
something good on purpose.

00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:40.520
It always has to be
because I have learned,

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:43.490
through lots of experience
and lots of effort and will--

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:44.660
it's not naive--

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:46.970
but I have learned how to
get in the way of those kind

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:50.750
of interesting accidents
and how to move

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:54.664
the light toward my intuitions.

00:44:54.664 --> 00:44:56.580
AUDIENCE: So I've read
a number of your books.

00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:00.180
"Eating Animals" is one of
them, albeit seven years ago.

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.250
But from what I remember,
you touch a little bit

00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:05.130
upon this forgetfulness
that happens

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:07.680
when there's a lack of
transparency into something.

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.160
And transparency's a really
interesting topic, especially

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.119
in the tech space
at both extremes.

00:45:13.119 --> 00:45:14.910
And so I'm wondering,
A, what your thoughts

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:17.610
are on that, and B, If you
might have another nonfiction

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:19.500
book in the works
that also touch--

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:22.110
or if you were particularly
attached to the animal topic,

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:25.772
or if you're really
interested in the meta topics?

00:45:25.772 --> 00:45:28.230
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER: That's
another really great question.

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:30.390
For a long time, I've wanted to
write a book about technology,

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.990
actually.

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:35.820
And in a way, that's very
similar to "Eating Animals"--

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:38.460
that I've had these
instincts about it,

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:43.200
and they seem to fluctuate
in really extreme ways.

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.650
And they're based in not a lot--

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:49.680
not a lot of familiarity with
how the world actually works

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.490
and what's actually going on.

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:54.840
And with "Eating Animals,"
it wasn't until--

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:58.110
and for most of my life, I
was sometimes a vegetarian.

00:45:58.110 --> 00:45:59.600
Sometimes I would
eat everything.

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:00.600
Sometimes I was a vegan.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.510
Sometimes I was a pescatarian--
just all over the map.

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:06.120
I've had periods
when I will leave

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:10.140
my phone in a drawer for as
much of the day as possible

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:11.820
or leave my phone
in the drawer when

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:15.570
I'm in my house with family.

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:17.100
I don't use any social media.

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:22.200
But I could also easily imagine
becoming deeply immersed in it.

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.900
I'm somebody who's flailing
in his relationship

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:28.740
to technology, just as I flailed
in my relationship to food.

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:30.990
It was when I had kids and
had to start making choices

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:32.990
on their behalf, because
every parent does.

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:35.460
It's not like you force
vegetarianism on your kid

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.830
any more than you force
meat-eating on your kids.

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:40.980
You just force a familial
culture on your kids.

00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:42.780
That is what it
is to be a parent.

00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.090
And similarly, I now have
to give some really serious

00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:47.910
thought to what kind
of role technology

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:49.050
will play in their lives.

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:50.800
And I'd like for it
to be thoughtful--

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:54.030
not the kind of
thought that is just

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:57.510
following the current of
whatever everybody else is

00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:01.460
doing or the current
of what is easy,

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:06.240
but where my actions are in
some kind of correspondence

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.665
with my beliefs.

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:15.890
As I was saying earlier,
as with the food industry,

00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:18.950
I think everybody feels a little
bit of discomfort with regard

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:20.750
to meat.

00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:23.570
Anthony Bourdain feels a little
discomfort with regard to meat.

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:25.130
We've had
conversations about it.

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:28.220
He's actually an incredibly
thoughtful person about it.

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:32.480
It's just, he distinguishes
between factory farming

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.200
and traditional
and family farming,

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:37.280
which I think is an extremely
important distinction

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.530
to make that a lot of people
don't know about or think

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:41.060
about.

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:46.045
I think also there's a broad
discomfort about technology.

00:47:46.045 --> 00:47:47.420
I don't know any
parents who have

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:50.450
a perfectly laissez-faire
attitude about technology when

00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:52.010
it comes to their kids.

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:53.960
And frankly, I don't
know all that many people

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:55.751
who have a perfectly
laissez-faire attitude

00:47:55.751 --> 00:47:57.416
about their own use.

00:47:57.416 --> 00:47:59.790
If I had a nickel for every
time somebody has said to me,

00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:03.030
I wish I used my phone less,
I wish I checked email less,

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:05.580
I wish I were less
reliant on screens--

00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:07.740
not that I wish I didn't
have them in my life.

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:09.410
That's not what I mean.

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:12.960
And these are people who
love the technology that they

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:17.400
have and value it in ways that I
think are really rich and deep,

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.220
but a discomfort.

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:20.610
That's all-- a discomfort.

00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:22.680
And it's a discomfort
that I, at least,

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:28.200
haven't devoted nearly enough
of myself to and want to,

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:34.640
especially as the influence
of technology in our lives

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.980
is becoming something
that is not only

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:42.090
more profound, but
harder to negotiate

00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:46.460
as the range of
choices seems to be

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:48.350
becoming smaller and smaller.

00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:50.060
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering about--

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:53.570
I remember there was a scene
in "Extremely Loud" where Oscar

00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:56.900
discovers the pen
in the pen store

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:58.860
where it's written
in a different color.

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:03.260
And that's one of those things
that just has stuck with me.

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:04.340
I go and I look at pens.

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:05.180
And it's like,
oh, wouldn't it be

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:06.920
funny to write a
different color?

00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:09.527
Is that one of those things
that was an early morning

00:49:09.527 --> 00:49:10.110
kind of thing?

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:12.320
Or is that one of those
things that kind of floats

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.750
through the air and
then you remember it

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:16.970
for a long time, kind
of looking for a way

00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:18.260
to weave that into a story?

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:18.700
Because that seemed like--

00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:19.590
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER:
That's a great question.

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:22.040
So he's referring to the
phenomenon of anybody

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:23.749
who's ever been to an
office supply store

00:49:23.749 --> 00:49:25.456
where there's a little
pad of paper where

00:49:25.456 --> 00:49:26.750
people can test pens.

00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:30.810
They very often write the
name of the color of the pen

00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:32.030
that they're writing with.

00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:34.310
And that ends up
being a kind of clue

00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:36.275
or an oddity that Oscar notices.

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:40.965
That was something
that struck me--

00:49:40.965 --> 00:49:43.340
so there's a whole category
of things that just strike me

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.830
as interesting metaphors
without my knowing what

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:47.192
they're metaphors for.

00:49:47.192 --> 00:49:49.400
Those, to me, are the most
richest kind of metaphors.

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:53.540
Like, this has something
to do with life,

00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:54.710
and I don't know what.

00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:57.080
If I know what it is, then
it's a little bit mundane,

00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.827
or it exhausts itself.

00:49:58.827 --> 00:50:01.410
And if I don't trust that it has
anything to do with anything,

00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:02.900
then it's just empty.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:06.440
But there's something
in between where

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:08.492
you're not able to
grasp the meaning,

00:50:08.492 --> 00:50:09.700
but you know that it's there.

00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:11.300
And that's a really
deep experience

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.880
to have as a writer or a
reader or just a person

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:16.230
moving through the world.

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:19.075
I write scenes around
those feelings.

00:50:19.075 --> 00:50:20.450
So you might have
read that scene

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:24.760
and thought, OK, so he
has Oscar doing this,

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.860
and then he was thinking
about a stationery store

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:28.059
and he had that realization.

00:50:28.059 --> 00:50:30.100
In fact, I wrote the whole
stationery store scene

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:32.200
because I had had that idea.

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:36.007
Another example-- actually,
is it the cover of this?

00:50:36.007 --> 00:50:37.340
Can I see that "Extremely Loud?"

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:38.290
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:50:38.290 --> 00:50:39.380
JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER:
Well, it's not exactly--

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:42.020
there's an image in the book
that this is an excerpt from.

00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:42.686
It's right here.

00:50:42.686 --> 00:50:44.530
It's in the beginning.

00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:46.160
This.

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:49.210
So this photo takes on some
significance in the book.

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:51.040
There's a two-page spread of it.

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.290
The first book I ever did,
which we didn't talk about,

00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:57.640
was an anthology about
the artist Joseph Cornell.

00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:00.490
The publisher paid
me for that book--

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:02.620
it was an art book
publisher-- in art books.

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:04.150
So I had a huge credit.

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:06.820
And every season,
they would send me

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:08.540
the catalog of their books.

00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:09.730
And I would pick out
the ones that I liked.

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:11.021
And they would send them to me.

00:51:11.021 --> 00:51:14.920
And that was how we
worked off the advance.

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.350
In one of those
catalogs, this was

00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:20.200
the cover of a book
called, I think,

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:21.460
the "Birdman of Brooklyn."

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:22.870
I think so.

00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:26.050
I just became entranced
by that cover.

00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:27.831
I said, I'd like
to order that book.

00:51:27.831 --> 00:51:29.830
And they said, we're
actually not publishing it.

00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:31.288
I can't remember
what had happened.

00:51:31.288 --> 00:51:32.721
There was some problem.

00:51:32.721 --> 00:51:33.970
And yet, I had seen the image.

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:37.690
And then I got in touch with the
photographer, who I befriended.

00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:41.200
And then I wrote the
scene for the book

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:44.140
as a way of using that image.

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:46.690
And it's the scene in which
the title "Extremely Loud

00:51:46.690 --> 00:51:48.850
and Incredibly Close" appears--

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:51.010
the only time in the book.

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:53.250
And it's because of the--

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:57.540
talk about the process
of openness and fortuity.

00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:01.080
There's a wonderful saying
that the Russian poet Joseph

00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:03.850
Brodsky said, "The rhyme
is smarter than the poet."

00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:05.940
People write in verse
because it's pretty,

00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:08.550
but also because it
creates a problem.

00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:10.110
And the solution
to the problem is

00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:13.770
more interesting than what you
would have done if you had not

00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:15.300
been constrained.

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.257
I would never have
arrived at the title

00:52:17.257 --> 00:52:18.840
"Extremely Loud and
Incredibly Close."

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:21.690
I would never have had the scene
where Oscar goes and visits

00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:26.270
the guy with the hearing aid--
turning the hearing aid up--

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:29.060
if I hadn't come across
this thing, which,

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:31.070
in a way, my attraction
to that image

00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:34.400
presented a problem, which
is, how can I use that?

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:38.120
And the solution to it was,
in many ways, this book.

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.430
And just to return to a
theme that has come up now--

00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:42.500
I know we have to
end-- but in addition

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:45.544
to where are the qualities,
where are the problems?

00:52:45.544 --> 00:52:47.960
We're living in a world that's
solving all of our problems

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.040
for us.

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:50.870
Is there anything
richer than getting--

00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:51.980
it's frustrating.

00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:53.789
It's annoying, and
it is to be avoided.

00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:55.580
But how many good things
have been stumbled

00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:57.440
upon when you get lost?

00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:03.000
The most memorable experiences
that I have had as a driver--

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.820
virtually all of them are
either because I was lost

00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:09.882
or because I
created my own route

00:53:09.882 --> 00:53:11.340
and, in the process
of creating it,

00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:13.152
became aware of possibilities.

00:53:13.152 --> 00:53:15.360
Like, oh, god, I've always
meant to go to that place.

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.985
Or you've got to be
kidding me, there's

00:53:16.985 --> 00:53:18.300
a town with this bizarre name?

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:21.060
I have to have a picture
of myself at the--

00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:24.690
and it is something else
that I give a lot of thought

00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:27.000
to, because so much
of my creative life

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.300
is dependent upon the accidental
thing which is stumbled

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:32.850
upon which I commit
myself to exploring

00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:35.910
and to being in response to--

00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:39.270
not that the accidents--

00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:41.220
the world is not in
the service of me--

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:43.710
of facilitating the
world so that it's better

00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:45.780
organized for my
ends, but that I

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:51.720
can be also in the service of
those wonderful, stumbled-upon

00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:52.992
things.

00:53:52.992 --> 00:53:54.200
SPEAKER: Thank you very much.

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:56.050
