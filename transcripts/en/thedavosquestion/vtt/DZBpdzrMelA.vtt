00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
&gt;&gt; My name is Kojo Parris. I am the Chairman
of A Free Africa. We are a social enterprise,

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.400
and we're particularly excited by the fact
that FIFA World Cup is coming to South Africa

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.250
and of course South Africa as the host nation
will probably disproportionately will benefit.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.230
But it's impossible for South Africa to benefit
from something this large without there being

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.130
corrollary effects across Africa. And Africa
itself, we believe is going to have a very

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.520
positive stage on which to demonstrate all
it's potentialities. So South Africa will

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.910
be the main beneficiary, but certainly going
forward Africa will be highlighted and will

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.760
have the opportunity to show it's wears.
