00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.230
How does the moon still have so many mysteries?

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.650
We beat you, moon, give up your secrets.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.450
Don’t make us send Buzz back up there!

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.880
Hello moon men and women, Julian here for
DNews.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.020
The moon is our little celestial sidekick,
the Robin to Earth’s Batman.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.180
And ever since we’ve noticed it up there
we’ve come up with all sorts of myths and

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.090
theories of how it got there.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.100
For the last 40 years, we’ve had a explanation
we were mostly satisfied with, but now a new

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.400
study published in the journal Nature Geoscience
has revived the discussion of the moon’s

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.400
origin.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.600
The study suggests that the moon was formed
a little bit at a time as small planetoids

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.030
hit a young proto earth over and over 4 billion
years ago.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.579
Back then, the solar system was still just
getting together and sorting itself out, so

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.530
collisions of these forming space chunks were
a lot more common.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.810
Each time one hit, it would kick up a cloud
of debris that would settle into a ring of

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.760
dust around our forming planet.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.309
Eventually the orbiting dust would coalesce
and the little ball of moon chunk would move

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.010
away from our planet over the course of centuries.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.239
Then another planetoid would hit and the whole
process would repeat.

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.880
The moon bits would interact in space, sometimes
causing them to be ejected or collide with

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.431
earth again, and occasionally they’d come
together and form something greater… like

00:01:06.431 --> 00:01:08.729
an orbiting moon-fragment megazord.

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.640
This study is similar to the current most
popular explanation for the moon, called the

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.060
giant impact hypothesis.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.750
I think you can see where they’re different
though: instead of lots of smaller impacts

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.420
over a long period of time, the giant impact
hypothesis does all its moon forming in one

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.420
go.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.760
Baby Earth was smacked by another Mars-sized
object called Theia, made a huge debris cloud,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.530
and then that cloud reformed into the moon
we see today.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.960
The giant impact hypothesis has been the favorite
since it was proposed in the 70s, but it’s

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.960
not perfect.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.770
The biggest issue is the composition of the
moon and Earth are really similar, which isn’t

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.810
what you’d expect if two large objects smack
into each other.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.409
We think that when the planets formed, their
composition depended a lot on how far they

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.590
were from the sun.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.659
The farther away they were, the more likely
they were to retain heavier isotopes of elements.

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.740
So Earth and Mars have different levels of
certain isotopes like silicon, but somehow

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.390
Earth and our moon have surprisingly similar
levels of silicon, oxygen, and titanium.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.159
To explain the similarities, Theia would either
have to have formed roughly the same distance

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.960
from the sun as the Earth, or when it hit
the Earth it would have to have been spinning

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.370
in just the right way to kick up more Earth
material so the moon’s composition matches

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.370
ours.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.700
It’s not out of the question, but it certainly
seems unlikely.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.430
Previous models of single giant impacts showed
a moon like ours forming only 1-2% of the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.430
time.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.660
This is what lead the researchers to model
what might happen if the Earth was occasionally

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.220
bombarded with smaller planetesimals instead
of big ol’ Theia.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.830
They found that if the moon is built up over
time, the composition of the impactors can

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.630
be different from the Earth’s, but the debris
will average out and mask what the original

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.360
planetesimals were made of.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.380
When the researchers simulated this scenario
800 times, they found there was better than

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.220
a 10% chance of getting the moon we see today.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.880
Not great, but better!

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.770
Of course, they say their model raises other
issues, like how these smaller impacts could

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.250
give our Earth and Moon the angular momentum
we see today, and for that their proposal

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.250
needs more study.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.000
But it raises the possibility that we once
had multiple smaller moons.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.420
Or as I call them, moon moons.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.770
While we only have the one moon now, other
planets in our solar system have them in the

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.770
double digits.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.540
Why did we get stuck with just the one?

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.020
Well Trace talks about that here.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.220
So which sounds better to you, Giant Impact
Hypothesis or assembling the moon, Ikea style?
