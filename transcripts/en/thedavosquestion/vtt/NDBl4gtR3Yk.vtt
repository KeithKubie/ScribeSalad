00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:12.170
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
I'm Jim Breyer.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.490
I'm a venture capitalist with Accel Partners
in Palo Alto.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.310
And I've been on the board of Facebook and
an investor in Facebook for

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.310
about five years.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.740
&gt;&gt; What's your next investment?

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.020
&gt;&gt; Well, we have -- we have about a dozen
investments in social media

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.369
companies around the world.
And Julia, and for any other panelist that

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.380
might be interested, what
can we as either business investors or part

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.470
of the business community
around social media do better for further

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.980
many of these causes that
we've talked about today?

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.030
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: I'm going to talk to
you afterwards one-on-one

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.300
because I need your advice.
Absolutely, I was talking about someone just

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:01.020
the other day about how he
uses mobile phones to get medicines into villages.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.029
And able to predict supply and demand in a
much, much clearer way.

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:09.093
And having been out in Africa, knowing the
growing use of that sort of

00:01:09.093 --> 00:01:14.689
technology is absolutely crucial.
I mean, imagine if this network of -- as we

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.779
said before taking things
to scale, imagine if we can do that through

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:22.729
empowering community
leaders to -- you know, even if it's someone

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.950
saying that there's a
cutting ceremony that's due to take place

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.319
within two months.
And then being able to gear up around that.

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:36.469
I think there's so much that can be done and
the empowerment around

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.159
that is huge.
But also what I found through my experience

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.670
is how many people have
contacted me globally so this is not just

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.669
about what the West can do.
I had some much e-mails from people in Cameroon,

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:54.599
in Guinea, in all
sorts of places saying what can I do in my

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:59.669
own community?
And one thought is just about, you know, there's

00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:02.069
not one database, for
example.

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:08.289
That's someone contacted me from Guinea-Bissau
to say can I download

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.929
from the web?
I'm about to teach this class.

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.590
What can I download from the web?
I couldn't find a single place where that

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.409
person could just go to be
able to say to their community these are the

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.230
issues that you could deal
with.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.330
So we need to hit this straight on.
