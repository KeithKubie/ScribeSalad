00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.139
Technically, we’re all just meat.

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:05.859
Yeah, you could say that what makes us human
is our emotions, or thoughts, or memories,

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.560
but physically, we’re not all that different
from this.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.849
We’re used to thinking of meat as the muscle
tissue that people cook and eat -- but the

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.640
fact is, you could eat that stuff raw. A chicken
breast or a steak or a pork chop is tender

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.610
enough that it doesn’t need cooking.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.210
What does need cooking is all of the connective
tissue that’s in and around the muscle,

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.560
and gets in the way of our meal.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.180
So one of the main reasons humans began to
roast, and boil, and bake meat in the first

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.060
place, was to break down those connective tissues
that we can’t chew, so we could get the meat.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.600
Now, you might’ve noticed that connective
tissues kind of seem like a grab bag of materials

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.120
that don’t really fit in other groups.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.860
Our muscle, nervous, and epithelial tissue
types are more uniform, more obviously grouped

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.260
together. Sometimes, our connective tissues just
seem like the leftovers you throw in the stew pot.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.680
But appearances are deceiving, and our inability
as a species to tolerate these tissues in

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.860
our food is just one reminder that no matter
how different tendon, bone, or a hunk of fat

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.899
may appear, they are indeed very closely related.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.639
They all spring from the same embryonic cells,
and their structures are dominated, not by

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.540
cells, but by an extracellular matrix full
of fibers.

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.070
And it’s those fibers that have given humans
the most trouble in our meat-eating history.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.350
It wasn’t until we figured out how to cook the
stuff the that we were able to denature, or

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.360
change the natural structure of, those protein
fibers so that they became soft and pliable.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.310
Take a chicken for example. You couldn’t
just pull the skin off a living bird -- like

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.979
ethically you couldn’t do that but also
you probably couldn’t.

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.200
Its living skin is anchored by connective
tissue that’s full of collagen fibers. But

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.420
if you roast that chicken, and break apart
that collagen, suddenly the skin just peels

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.830
right off with no effort at all.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.270
So connective tissues, as evidenced by this
mess here, are good reminders of how sometimes

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.060
things are more similar than they appear.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.960
They’re also delicious . . . if you’re
into that.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.200
So we know what our connective tissues have
in common, and we know that we’ve got four

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.340
different types -- but what do they look like,
what do they do, and where are they found

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.720
-- both in your butcher shop, and on your
body?

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.330
Perhaps your most diverse type is your classic
connective tissue proper. It comes in both

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.739
loose and dense subclasses, based on how many
fibers it has in its ground substance.

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.080
Pull on the back of your hand. See that fleshy
tent there? That’s one example of loose

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.630
connective tissue. There’s a lot of ground
substance in here, and the elastin fibers

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.400
help it snap back into place, while the collagen
helps anchor it so you can’t, like, snag

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.290
your skin on a zipper and watch it just fly
off.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.770
But try pulling on your Achilles’ tendon,
or these wing tendons here, and there isn’t

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.200
a lot of give. That’s because a tendon is
an example of dense connective tissue, with

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.060
a lot more collagen. You could chew and chew
and chew on a collagen-dense tendon and never

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.460
get anywhere. That’s why butchers trim off most dense
connective tissue before selling cuts of meat.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.000
So loose connective tissues have fewer fibers,
and more cells and more ground substance.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.340
Areolar tissue is the most common loose connective
tissue you have, found ALL over your body,

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.440
just under your epithelial tissue, and wrapped
around your organs.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.599
It’s got a loose and random arrangement
of fibers, with just a few fibroblast cells

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.190
that make those fibers. If you look at it
under a microscope you’ll see that its most

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.769
obvious feature is that it looks like it has
a lot of open space in it.

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.129
This makes areolar tissue makes it great at
holding the watery, salty ground substance

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:19.980
that surrounding tissues draw from.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.620
Your adipose tissue, meanwhile, is your fat
tissue, the loose connective tissue that’s in here.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.560
Rather than being mostly ground substance,
this one is mostly cells -- adipocytes -- which

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.220
store lipids for later use, insulate the body against
heat loss, and grow pot bellies and love handles.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.599
The average person’s weight is about 18
percent adipose tissue, and it’s those fat

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.999
stores that keep us alive when food is scarce.
With no fat stores, you’d die within a few

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.540
days of your last sandwich.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.020
Reticular tissue is like areolar tissue, but
with a woven mess of reticular fibers -- rather

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.819
than collagen and elastin fibers -- hence
the name.

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.799
This tissue provides the soft internal framework,
or stroma, of the spleen, lymph nodes, and

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.560
bone marrow, and it supports lots of developing
blood cells. Just as your areolar tissue is

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.019
a kind of sponge for watery ground substance,
your reticular tissue is what holds your blood

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.590
in place in many of your organs.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.000
Really, all of these loose connective tissue
proper types share an airy dispersal of fibers

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.820
... which is why they’re easier to eat after cooking --
and why you can pull cooked chicken skin apart.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.820
On the other hand, you can’t easily rip
a tendon or ligament in two, or even chew

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.240
it, because it’s made of that dense regular
tissue, full of tight bundles of collagen

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:25.820
fibers all running parallel.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.460
You can see how neat and smooth a slide sample
looks under a scope, the fibers being those

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:35.430
white, flexible structures. They provide great
resistance to tension when that tension is

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.720
exerted in one direction.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.839
That’s why you find this tissue in your
tendons, which connect muscle to bone or other

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:44.319
muscle, and your ligaments, which bind bones
together anywhere you’ve got a joint.

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:48.389
But what if those collagen fibers aren’t
all stacked regularly in rows?

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:53.629
Then it forms dense irregular tissue, whose
fibers are thicker and arranged erratically

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:57.860
-- it’s found wherever tension might be
exerted in lots of different directions, like

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.110
the leathery dermis underlying your skin.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.899
And finally, your body has places that require
more elasticity than rigidity, like say, around

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:09.520
your joints. That’s where you’ll find
dense elastic tissue -- for example, connecting

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.210
your vertebrae so that your spine can curve
and twist.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.439
Some of our largest artery walls are made
of this stretchy elastic tissue, too, which

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:18.899
provides both support and flexibility.

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:23.479
From fat to tendons, connective tissue proper
is the most diverse group in this tissue family.

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.799
But for the last few minutes you’ve also
been watching a different type of connective

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.160
tissue bob up and down as I talk -- cartilage

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.689
Cartilage doesn’t have any blood or nerves,
and it stands up against both tension and

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:38.129
compression pretty well -- it’s that whitish
gristle you see at the end of pork ribs or

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:41.659
chicken wings in your grocer’s freezer -- and
it’s another thing that you’re not going

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:42.830
to have much luck chewing.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.740
Hyaline cartilage is your most common type
-- it’s kind of glassy looking and provides

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.780
pliable support. It connects your ribs to your
sternum and keeps the tip of your nose all perky.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.440
Its ground substance is rich with those sticky,
starchy proteoglycans, and although it has

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.249
collagen fibers, when you look at it under
a scope, you can’t really see them -- instead

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:06.109
the tissue looks glassy, hence the name “hyal”
meaning glassy, or transparent.

00:06:06.109 --> 00:06:09.960
Elastic cartilage is very similar to hyaline,
but with more elastic fibers that are easier

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:14.029
to see, and it’s found in places where strength
and stretchability are needed. Like, it’s

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:16.710
why I can pull on my ear without it ripping
off.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.960
And just as your body needs firm parts and
stretchy parts, it also needs shock absorbers.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.460
That’s where your fibrocartilage comes in.
It’s dominated by thick fibers of collagen

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.610
and is good at withstanding lots of pressure,
so it makes up the discs between your vertebrae,

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.699
and your knee joints where it keeps your bones
from grinding together.

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:34.889
And speaking of bones!

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:38.919
Although you might not think of something
so hard and durable as living tissue, bones

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:39.899
definitely are.

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:44.300
The word “bone” can refer to an entire
organ -- like your femur or scapula -- or

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.839
just bone tissue. And that bone, or osseous
tissue, is just calcified connective tissue,

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:53.179
perfect for supporting and protecting your
body’s various structures.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.120
Spongy bone tissue is typically found in the
heads of long bones and in the inner layer

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:01.999
of flat bones like the sternum. This spongy
tissue is strong, but porous, even to the

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:06.059
naked eye, and it uses this extra room to
make and store bone marrow.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.979
Compact bone tissue on the other hand is quite
dense, with no visible spaces. It forms the

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:14.779
external layer of your bones and stores calcium
for bone cells to use to make more tissue.

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:18.830
Now, if bone doesn’t conjure up your traditional
image of a tissue, blood probably doesn’t

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.669
either -- I mean, it doesn’t seem to connect
things, or lend support, and yet, blood is

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:25.929
our fourth type of connective tissue.

00:07:25.929 --> 00:07:30.429
And when you think about it, it clearly does
connect distant parts of your body and provides

00:07:30.429 --> 00:07:32.029
some rigidity to other parts.

00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:35.379
Just like other connective tissues, blood
develops from mesenchyme and is made up of

00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:40.789
cells surrounded by an extracellular nonliving
matrix: In this case, the ground substance

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:44.300
is your blood plasma, which has protein fibers
floating around in it.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.709
Your blood’s main job, of course, is delivering
goods -- it transports cells, and nutrients,

00:07:48.709 --> 00:07:52.319
and hormones, and wastes, and all kinds of
other stuff, keeping all the parts of your

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:53.749
body connected in the process.

00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:58.389
Most of your blood cells are erythrocytes,
or your famous red blood cells that zoom around,

00:07:58.389 --> 00:08:02.889
carrying oxygen and carbon dioxide through
your body. You’ve also got larger, infection-fighting

00:08:02.889 --> 00:08:08.179
white blood cells, or leukocytes in the mix,
and your platelets, the small cell fragments

00:08:08.179 --> 00:08:11.559
needed for blood clotting so that a paper
cut doesn’t bleed you dry.

00:08:11.559 --> 00:08:15.229
Unlike other connective tissues, it doesn’t
really have what you would call fibers, but

00:08:15.229 --> 00:08:20.529
instead has a bunch of protein dissolved in
the plasma, and those protein molecules will

00:08:20.529 --> 00:08:24.139
form fiber-like structures when your blood
needs to clot.

00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:29.300
So. You take your four primary types of tissues,
and all of the subtypes of each that’s taken

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:34.219
us weeks to explore, and you can probably
see how they can come together in many, many

00:08:34.219 --> 00:08:37.050
combinations to form all of your body’s
organs.

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.750
And just like that chaotic cafeteria packed
with middle-schoolers -- we’d be hopeless

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:45.610
messes without our hierarchy of organization,
our inner and outer boundaries, and the ability

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.870
of our systems to communicate with each other.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.500
THAT is what our tissues do for us, and we
wouldn’t exist without them.

00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:55.769
Today we wrapped up our four-episode series
on tissues, with a survey of the sub-groups

00:08:55.769 --> 00:09:01.290
of loose and dense connective tissue, including
areolar, adipose, reticular, tendons, ligaments,

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:05.290
dense irregular, and dense elastic tissue.
We also talked about the three cartilage types,

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:11.300
spongy and compact bone connective tissue, and how
and why our blood is also a connective tissue type.
