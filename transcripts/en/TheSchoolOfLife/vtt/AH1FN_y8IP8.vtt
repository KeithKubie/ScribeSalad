00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:06.080
Many of us want to start our own businesses.
Public space is filled with reports of new

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.579
ventures. But the reporting on entrepreneurship
is heavily skewed in one particular direction:

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:17.920
towards people who have started new kinds
of businesses, pioneers who have pushed the

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.160
boundaries of commerce by creating a wholly
original offering, usually through the help

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.580
of an innovative piece of technology. The
new entrepreneurs might, for example, have

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.110
invented an app for measuring and controlling
the humidity of clothes’ closets, or they

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.520
might have come up with a tiny sensor that
can detect hunger in domestic animals or have

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.570
built a social platform to connect people
planning a trip to Italy. This emphasis on

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.300
novelty can leave us feeling that the chief
and correct way to become an entrepreneur

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.910
is invariably going to be through radical,
technologically-based innovation. We may therefore,

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.350
as we contemplate an entrepreneurial future,
ask ourselves (with increasing panic) what

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.140
entirely unthought-of idea we might ourselves
come up with to propel us forward. In our

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.480
frenzy, the answers we arrive at may start
to lean towards the implausible, the trite

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.920
or the naive. But there is another path. Most
of the economy is made up of businesses doing

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.270
stuff that people have always been doing or
have been doing for a very long time: making

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.210
daily bread or shirts or trousers, teaching
languages or giving travellers a bed for the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.680
night, raising animals or fixing teeth. In
other words, most businesses operate in areas

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.250
that economists call ‘mature’, sectors
where it’s rather hard to come in and make

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.810
a surprising fortune. But that doesn’t mean
these sectors should be ignored. Far from

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.750
it; there are a plethora of hugely meaningful
possibilities hiding for us in plain sight

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.490
on account of one, perhaps surprising fact
about the economy: a majority of businesses

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:08.690
don’t love what they do. We might make a
basic distinction between two kinds of businesses:

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.749
– pragmatic businesses – businesses of
love. Pragmatic businesses are everywhere.

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:20.560
They almost define for us what we think business
is in its essence. They know how to make their

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.010
product or service with a sound degree of
competence, but there is a practical, unidealistic

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.579
edge to the way they go about things. There
isn’t anything very powerful drawing them

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.170
to their particular offering. They might easily
have been doing something else. They don’t

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.500
care about the long-term; the business is
only a vehicle for an underlying financial

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.730
purpose. One eye is always focused on how
to sell. If the owners didn’t have to work,

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.999
they almost certainly wouldn’t. Such pragmatic
businesses may do fine, or even very well,

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:56.180
for a long time, but the motivations are easy
enough to spot. A discerning eye can tell

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.489
something crucial within minutes of walking
through the door: this is not being done with,

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:08.739
or for, love. Pragmatic businesses dominate
the economy. One might say that over 85% of

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.099
businesses fall into this category. But there
are parts of the economy, and they are heavily

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.590
in the minority, where things are being done
very differently.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.489
Businesses of love produce many varied things,

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.060
but there are underlying principles holding
them together. Here love means: – a total

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.829
commitment to excellence of a given product
or service. – a desire to reinvest almost

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:39.249
all profit into guaranteeing excellence. – a
focus on the long-term, because the business

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:44.469
is – for its owners – the meaning of life.
There is no interest in selling the firm now,

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:49.120
or perhaps ever. The dearest wish might be
to give it to someone you love, like your

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.499
child.

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:55.159
– love means you’d almost do it for free
– and don’t only because you need to live,

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.629
you need to pay your employees and you want
the business to be able to last into the long

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:05.620
term. The product or service is what you love
and you love it inordinately. Businesses of

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.279
love are the sort where the owner has scoured
the world for the best kind of flour and wakes

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:15.819
up excitedly at dawn to check on the progress
of each of the loaves; the aircraft factory

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.150
where the workers think of every plane they
are building like a relative they will always

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.740
care for; the stationery shop where notebooks
and paper are viewed as objects of beauty

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.560
rather than utility; the travel agency that
won’t rest until it knows it clients have

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.560
enjoyed their trips rather than just paid
for them; the sandwich store that views a

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:44.069
fine avocado and chicken roll as one of the
authentic joys of a tricky life. Businesses run for love are not always successful

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:48.280
in the standard financial sense of the term.
Some might just be returning a little over

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.270
3% a year. But for these enterprises, money
is only ever a means to a greater, more purposeful

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.370
end. There are huge opportunities to hand
for any would-be entrepreneurs because most

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.730
of the economy is in the hands of people who
don’t love what they are doing. Most law

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:12.490
firms, dentists’ offices, hotels and bakeries
aren’t in it for love. They may be efficient

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.849
and canny, but they are – ultimately – just
waiting to sell up. We don’t need to be

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:23.599
very original to succeed, we don’t need
to have invented anything very new; we just

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.689
need – to make sense of our lives and to
make an honest living along the way – to

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:33.440
offer the world something we love a little
more intensely than most people do. .
