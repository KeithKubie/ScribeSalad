- Okay, welcome, everyone.

00:00:03.369 --> 00:00:04.537 line:0%
And shut up.

00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:06.272 line:0%
Love the excitement.

00:00:06.338 --> 00:00:08.341 line:0%
Can't take the noise.

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:11.677 line:0%
Now, you're here because
you're Chase's biggest fans.

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:13.245 line:0%
And because your parents
are rich.

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:15.414 line:0%

on the plane?

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.317 line:0%
- Yes.
- [crying]

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:18.984 line:0%
- And for your superfans,

00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:20.586 line:0%
it's not just Chase
on the plane,

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:22.121 line:0%
but the whole Dream family.

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.423 line:0%
[all scream]

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.658 line:0%
- I love you, Cary!

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:27.627 line:0%
- I love you too.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.428 line:0%
- Okay, and remember,
once the music starts...

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:34.434 align:end position:100% line:0%
- Hey, Cary, your hair is
looking a lot less swooped.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.835 line:0%
- I know.
Why didn't you tell me?

00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:37.703 line:0%
I looked crazy.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.105 line:0%
- Well, I was trying to be
supportive.

00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:40.906 line:0%
Also it was really funny.

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:43.008 line:0%
- You're the one that told me
to ride the wave.

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:44.444 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
- I told you to use Chase.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.045 align:start size:47% position:53% line:0%
Not become him.

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:48.014 line:0%
- Now, once we reach
30,000 feet,

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:51.817 line:0%
we will be streaming live
on ChaseDreams.com.

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:54.253
There are cameras
all over the plane,

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:56.055
except the bathrooms.

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:58.924
Viewers will be able to watch
any camera at any time.

00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:02.995
So if you need to yawn, burp,
sneeze, fart,

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:05.465
do it now
and do it fast.

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:06.599
[tiny fart]

00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:08.301
Excellent.

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:11.537 align:end position:100%
- Oh, um, here's a random
question.

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:14.874 align:end position:100%
Lance.
Just such an idiot.

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:16.609 align:start size:19% position:81%
Right?

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:18.510 align:start position:0%
- Um, sure?

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:22.982 align:end position:100%
- But he's, you know,
he's kind of cool, as well.

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.717 align:start position:0%
- Oh, so you're getting back
together with him.

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:26.285
- No!
- Yes.

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.821 align:end position:100%
- No. No.
Never.

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:31.023 align:end position:100%
I just...I think you should be
nicer to him.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.825 align:start position:0%
- Okay, Brooke.

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:34.393 align:start position:0%
God I wish I had seen
those pilots.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.963
- Hey, Car.
I know you're scared of flying,

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.732
so I thought you might want to
hold Helen for a little bit.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.234
- You brought a pig on
the plane?

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:42.902
- It's a therapy pig.
I got it for you.

00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:44.871
Look, she's very calming.

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:46.438
Unless you hold her the wrong
way, and then she'll attack you

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:48.007
in ways that you never thought
were possible.

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:50.342
- Um, no thank you.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.913
- Okay.
I was just trying to help.

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.249 align:start position:0%
- Okay, folks, we are
ten minutes out

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:58.417
from hearing Chase's new album.

00:01:58.484 --> 00:01:59.518
[all scream]

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:01.654
12 incredible songs.

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:04.858
We are talking over 19 minutes
of music.

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:06.892
- 12? I thought he only had
three songs.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.462 align:end position:100%
- Uh-huh.
And nine remixes.

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:14.200
- Hey, not to be a bummer,
but, um...

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:17.336
How are you doing with today?

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:19.672
- Oh, um,

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:20.806
I'm okay.

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:22.007 align:start position:0%
- Sorry to bring it up.

00:02:22.074 --> 00:02:23.442 align:end position:100%
- No. No, no.
It's...

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.678 align:end position:100%
It's good. I mean, it's been
almost a year

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:26.712 align:end position:100%
and no one ever talks
about Dad.

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.414 align:start position:0%
- Yeah, it sucks.

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:30.149 align:end position:100%
- I wonder if Chase's remembers
it's his birthday.

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:32.685 align:start position:0%
- I'm sure Mom does.
I hope she's doing okay.

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:34.220
- Hi, guys!
- Oh, God.

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:36.889
- Hey, how, uh, how you doing
with today?

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:38.290
- I'm great. I'm great.

00:02:38.357 --> 00:02:39.425
This is such a big day
for Chasey.

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.126
And me.

00:02:41.193 --> 00:02:42.928
I'm wearing the first sample
from my jewelry line.

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:44.396
- Oh, you have a jewelry line
now.

00:02:44.463 --> 00:02:45.965
- Yeah, yeah.
The book was such a hit

00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:47.400
that they're letting me move
into apparel now.

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:49.135
This is just a prototype.

00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:51.137
The real version will be four
times bigger and heavier.

00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:53.138 align:end position:100%
- Okay, I'm gonna go
check on Chase.

00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:55.241
- I'm wearing it on the
livestream to get feedback

00:02:55.307 --> 00:02:57.310
from the marketplace.

00:02:57.376 --> 00:03:00.613
- Yeah, wow, you...
You're doing a lot.

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:02.715
[rattling]

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.818
- Hey, kiddo.

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:07.753
Just wanted to see
how you're doing.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.054
Today.

00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:10.990
- I guess I feel a little
weird.

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:12.458 align:start size:56% position:44%
- Yeah, I figured.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:14.160
Do you want to talk about it?
- Sure.

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:15.961
They put a bunch of filler
in my lips

00:03:16.028 --> 00:03:18.898
to make them look kissable,
and now I can't feel them.

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:21.533
- Oh.
