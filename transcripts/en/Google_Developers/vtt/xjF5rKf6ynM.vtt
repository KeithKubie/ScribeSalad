00:00:02.117 --> 00:00:03.950
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Hey, it's Natalie again.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.340
Thank you so much for
tuning into the Livestream.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.560
I have the extreme
honor of sitting here

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.450
with Kelly Shuster.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.825
She's an Android
developer for iTriage.

00:00:11.825 --> 00:00:13.700
And I'm excited to have
you meet her and have

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.720
her talk about her work.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.570
Welcome, Kelly.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.120
KELLY SHUSTER: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.210
I'm honored to be here.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.790
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So
tell me a little bit,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.750
how did you get into
the technology industry?

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.760
I think you had mentioned
harmware-- or not harmware--

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.480
firmware, hardware,
mixing the two.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.820
KELLY SHUSTER: Yes.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.810
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Tell
me a little bit about it.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.186
KELLY SHUSTER: Sure.

00:00:30.186 --> 00:00:31.685
So I never really
thought that I was

00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:34.561
going to be a tech
person in my career.

00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:36.060
So when I was
younger, I started out

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.340
with a lot of
different interests.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.220
I did theater.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.970
I loved reading.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:40.910
I loved history.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.510
And I also loved
math and science,

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.120
but they were just like
these extra things.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.740
But I had this intense
curiosity about computers.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.540
I remember staring at
my parents' computer

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.370
and just being obsessed.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.440
Like, what is going on?

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.330
I know there are people in the
world that know how this works.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.640
It's not magic, and I
have to figure it out.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.925
So I watched this movie with
my sister-- "Antitrust."

00:01:00.925 --> 00:01:02.550
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
I think you told me

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.165
it was "Hackers" because
that's how-- "Hackers,"

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:06.290
for me, that's what it was.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.590
KELLY SHUSTER: Really?

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.340
That's awesome.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.494
Yay for Hollywood
getting us into tech.

00:01:09.494 --> 00:01:10.910
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Which is rare.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:11.290
KELLY SHUSTER: Yes.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.630
Yes.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.130
Exactly.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.140
So there's this scene
where he's at the daycare,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.710
and he hacks into the system
through the daycare computer.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.460
And I became obsessed
with the idea, like,

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.420
could you really do that, or
was that a Hollywood thing?

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.384
So that got me going
on this tech area.

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:26.050
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
[INAUDIBLE] hacking.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.883
KELLY SHUSTER: Yeah.

00:01:26.883 --> 00:01:28.420
Like, could you really do this?

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.280
Yeah.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.310
And when I went into
college, I actually

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.630
was a political science major.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.340
And I had to take a science
for political science.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.900
And so I opted to take physics.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.940
And my adviser was
like, no, no, no, you're

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.060
supposed to take meteorology
or intro to astronomy--

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.985
the "easy sciences."

00:01:44.985 --> 00:01:46.636
Like, no, I really like physics.

00:01:46.636 --> 00:01:48.270
It's so fun.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.550
So then towards the end
of my physics class,

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.639
I realized I was
so depressed that I

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:54.430
was going to be done
with math and science.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.300
So I was like, why don't I
just switch to engineering?

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.370
So I switched over to
electrical engineering.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.940
And I just loved it.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.780
It was much fun.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.920
And I learned how
computers work finally.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.880
And it was awesome.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.910
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
[INAUDIBLE] from there.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.076
KELLY SHUSTER: Yes, exactly.

00:02:08.076 --> 00:02:09.449
I felt like I hit a niche.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.320
And I was just in
my stride, yeah.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.540
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So
tell me, so now you're

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.450
an Android developer.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.270
KELLY SHUSTER: Yes.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.130
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: And
you're working at iTriage.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.290
And you were telling me
you're the accessibility lead.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.960
KELLY SHUSTER: Mm-hm.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.690
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Talk to me a little bit

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.891
about what you're solving
for and maybe some

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:24.140
of the challenges that you
faced in your current role.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.750
KELLY SHUSTER: Sure.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.250
OK.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.750
So at iTriage I'm working on a
new app for Aetna's new member

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.280
experience.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.860
So you can check claims or
doctors or things like that.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.540
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
I would love that.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.940
KELLY SHUSTER: Yeah, it's
going to be so awesome.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.440
I can't wait.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.880
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: It
makes health care easier.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.046
KELLY SHUSTER: Yes, exactly.

00:02:39.046 --> 00:02:39.840
Super easy.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.190
Information when you want it.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.120
And it's going to be awesome.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.300
And so one of the big
pieces that I'm personally

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.750
passionate about is
developing accessible apps

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.600
so that all people can use it.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.770
And we're really focused
on vision impairment.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.740
So I'm an Android developer, so
I'm doing Android for the app.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.567
But I'm also the accessibility
lead for web and iOS as well.

00:02:59.567 --> 00:03:01.192
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
So you're not busy.

00:03:01.192 --> 00:03:04.517
KELLY SHUSTER: Not
in the slightest.

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:05.350
So it's really cool.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.020
I get to work with this
group called the Blind

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.220
Institute of Technology.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.650
And they're a
nonprofit group run

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.990
by an engineer and all
these tech savvy people

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.655
that also happen to be blind.

00:03:14.655 --> 00:03:16.280
And they come in and
they test our app.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.225
And I work with them to
understand, like, what

00:03:18.225 --> 00:03:20.420
can we do from a
programming perspective

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.660
to fix these issues?

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.710
And I help the
developers on our team

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.100
about what are the
tips and tricks

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.830
for coding, for web,
iOS, and Android

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:29.830
that they can implement.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.450
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
It's cool user testing.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.450
KELLY SHUSTER: Very cool, yeah.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.235
And they have their
own set of standards.

00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:36.970
It's not tied to
specific regulations,

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.165
but it's tied to
actual usability.

00:03:39.165 --> 00:03:41.820
Because a lot of the
official regulations,

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.160
you can check off all the boxes
but still not have a great user

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.966
experience.

00:03:45.966 --> 00:03:47.050
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Right.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.799
No, I mean, you're
putting the user first.

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.616
And I think that's what's
really important in developing

00:03:51.616 --> 00:03:53.240
new technology is
you don't necessarily

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.200
have to start from scratch.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.300
Like, know your users.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.800
And so it sounds like you guys
are doing a great job talking

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.980
to the community.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.990
And from there, you're
getting the insights

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.722
to build for them
with them in mind.

00:04:03.722 --> 00:04:04.680
KELLY SHUSTER: Exactly.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.730
Because I feel like I read
through the documentation

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.250
about accessibility, but it
wasn't really until I actually

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.800
got to know them as
users that I was like,

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.980
oh, I was thinking
about that wrong.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.840
So it's really cool.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.673
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: No,
that's really great.

00:04:17.673 --> 00:04:19.480
And so, what would
you say a challenge

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.680
was and a creative solution
that you implemented

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.317
in your current work?

00:04:24.317 --> 00:04:26.150
KELLY SHUSTER: As far
as accessibility goes,

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.080
I think a lot of it is in
terms of not really knowing

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.060
exactly how the screen reader's
going to read things out,

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.170
and so finding ways to set
content descriptions on layouts

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.840
as opposed to on specific views.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.470
But outside of
accessibility, the greater

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.060
technical challenges,
we had a challenge

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.977
with the back end solution.

00:04:45.977 --> 00:04:48.560
So when we were looking at all
the schedule-- and our back end

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.170
is being developed
by another team,

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.420
and we're not their
only stakeholder.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.132
And so they were on
this longer timeline.

00:04:55.132 --> 00:04:56.090
So we were like, shoot.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.610
We're not going
to get everything

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.670
in time for us to be able
to put the app together.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.050
So my manager came up with this
brilliant solution about, well,

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.170
why don't we just have these
different networking modes?

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.576
And we can build out
these fake APIs for us

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:11.950
as we develop our
app internally.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:12.211
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Wow.

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:12.670
Cool.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.900
KELLY SHUSTER: Yeah.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.860
And then as we start getting
the services delivered to us,

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.700
we can just flip a switch.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.260
I was like, ah, this
is such a cool idea.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.460
So we had to be really strict
about separating model view

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.584
controller in our app.

00:05:24.584 --> 00:05:25.750
And every platform did this.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.060
We pushed the logic
of switching modes

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.240
to the lowest layer of
the networking library.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.590
And we just started integrating
the real back end services.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.710
And it was so awesome,
because we literally just

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.900
had to new base URL and then
maybe a little bit of tweaking

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.030
with JSON parsing,
and it just works.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.970
And it's so cool.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.980
And there's an Easter egg
menu in our alpha channels.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.220
So people can switch
between this fake API

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.560
mode and the real
API mode, which

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.390
is incredible for the
business stakeholders,

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.554
because it's super hard to demo
back end services to people

00:05:58.554 --> 00:06:00.220
that are really high
up in the companies

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.020
because there's that huge
technical gap of knowledge.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.645
But if they have the
app in their hands

00:06:05.645 --> 00:06:07.728
and they can toggle back
and forth with the modes,

00:06:07.728 --> 00:06:10.620
they can easily see the progress
of the back end services.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.836
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:06:10.836 --> 00:06:10.910
Yeah.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:11.480
Absolutely.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.150
And so from all of
this, you're incredibly

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.290
passionate about
technology, right?

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.410
What I love about--
so you're not only

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.090
just doing incredible
work at iTriage,

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.280
you're also out leading
and helping more women,

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.760
specifically get
into technology.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.240
And so you're also one of the
founders and leaders of Women

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.930
Who Code Denver.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:30.220
KELLY SHUSTER: Exactly.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.880
Yeah.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.060
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So what
is that community like,

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.330
and why is it important?

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.760
KELLY SHUSTER: Oh my gosh.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.010
The community is awesome.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.115
So I started out in hardware,
like we were talking before,

00:06:38.115 --> 00:06:39.312
with electrical engineering.

00:06:39.312 --> 00:06:40.770
And a few years
ago, I transitioned

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.220
into Android development.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.370
And during that time, I
just found meetup.com.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.430
And I was like, this is amazing.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.180
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
[INAUDIBLE] them, too.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.570
KELLY SHUSTER: Oh my gosh.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:49.270
It was so great.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.570
So I just went
through and signed up

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:51.620
for every tech meetup.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.520
And I was like, oh, Women
Who Code, that sounds cool.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.731
And I remember, I went to
my first meetup for Women

00:06:56.731 --> 00:06:57.230
Who Code.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.530
It was a Ruby study group.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.990
And I wasn't a huge
Ruby person, but I was

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.240
like, oh, it sounds like fun.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.314
And I show up.

00:07:03.314 --> 00:07:05.480
And there are all these
women literally just sitting

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.010
around hacking and programming.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.282
And it was indescribable.

00:07:09.282 --> 00:07:11.240
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: It's
like the idea of where

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.009
we both started was real.

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:14.050
It wasn't just Hollywood.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.592
It was women actually doing
what we always wanted to do.

00:07:16.592 --> 00:07:17.550
KELLY SHUSTER: Exactly.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.290
And I didn't even
realize I'd never

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.260
programmed with more
than one woman before.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.260
And I was like, wow.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.000
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: And
that's really common.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.209
KELLY SHUSTER: Yeah.

00:07:26.209 --> 00:07:28.750
And I didn't really realize I
was missing anything in my life

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:29.450
until I went.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.750
And I was like, oh,
this is so cool.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:31.810
I want to do this all the time.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:33.330
So I started going
to their meetups.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.030
And they had a lot of
really good tech talks.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.830
And the woman that
was leading Denver

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.915
was actually moving
to Boulder, I think.

00:07:39.915 --> 00:07:41.970
And so she was going to
do the Boulder stuff.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.970
And the position opened up.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.590
And she was like,
do you want to lead?

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.715
We need someone to lead it.

00:07:46.715 --> 00:07:48.300
And I was like, I would love to.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.480
The women that I meet
here are phenomenal.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.937
And it's really cool, too.

00:07:51.937 --> 00:07:54.020
With the [INAUDIBLE] ability
and all these things,

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.950
I'm interested in the
idea of a full stack

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.920
or a multi-platform
knowledge, which

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.710
is amazing because in the
Women Who Code community, we've

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:07.310
got Java people, we've got iOS,
Android, Ruby on Rails, Scala.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.320
You name it, they're
here in my group.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.580
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: And so
when you go to the meetups,

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.080
you don't necessarily
just even have

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.050
to work on what you're
working on at iTriage.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.520
You can work on
personal projects.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.580
Do you have personal
projects that you're

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.550
working on outside
of your current work?

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:20.800
KELLY SHUSTER: Yeah, actually.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.165
So I have one little app.

00:08:22.165 --> 00:08:23.547
It's called Should I Buy It.

00:08:23.547 --> 00:08:25.630
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: This
already sounds dangerous.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.421
KELLY SHUSTER: Yes.

00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:27.070
Yes.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.920
So I'm a personal finance geek.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.620
And I like to help people make
smart financial decisions.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.730
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
I like shopping.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:33.090
KELLY SHUSTER: Yes.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:33.299
OK.

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:34.690
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: I'm
really good at spending money.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:35.690
I need to learn how to save it.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:36.669
KELLY SHUSTER: This app
might help you then.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:37.647
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: OK.

00:08:37.647 --> 00:08:39.730
KELLY SHUSTER: You put in
what you're going to buy

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.688
and how often you think
you're going to buy it,

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:44.474
and it will tell you if you had
invested the money instead, how

00:08:44.474 --> 00:08:45.765
much you'd have after 10 years.

00:08:45.765 --> 00:08:46.650
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Yeah, I need this.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:46.900
KELLY SHUSTER: Yes.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.445
It's awesome.

00:08:47.445 --> 00:08:48.680
It is available in Android.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.210
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: It is?

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:50.340
It's on the Play Store?

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:50.750
KELLY SHUSTER: It's
on the Play Store.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:50.915
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: OK.

00:08:50.915 --> 00:08:52.020
So tell me again,
what is it called?

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:52.900
KELLY SHUSTER: Should I Buy It.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.670
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Should I Buy It.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:54.320
KELLY SHUSTER: It's
got a little green logo

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.990
with a scale of a bag of
money or a cup of coffee.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:58.240
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: All right.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.520
KELLY SHUSTER: Yeah.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.325
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: I'm
going to start saving

00:09:00.325 --> 00:09:01.470
more money because of that app.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:01.860
KELLY SHUSTER: Cool.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.360
Cool.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.800
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
So, again, I'm

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.740
really thankful that you made
time to come and visit us

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:06.400
today.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.050
You're clearly doing incredible
work for accessibility

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.600
at iTriage and you're leading
Women Who Code Denver.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.010
It sounds like you don't
really have spare time,

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:15.580
but then you've created
this awesome app.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.025
So anyways, I'll look forward
to hearing more innovations

00:09:18.025 --> 00:09:19.290
that you're creating
in the future.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.020
Thank you so much
for making the time--

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:20.520
KELLY SHUSTER:
Thank you so much.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.120
This was awesome.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:21.620
Thanks.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.820
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Thanks.
