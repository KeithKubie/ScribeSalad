Hi!

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:07.109
My name is Christian and I am the Product
Manager for Native Client, a technology that

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.200
allows you to run native code in the browser
in a safe way.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.820
In developer events, I am often asked in what
ways Native Client can help developers.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.619
In this video, I am going to present the most
common use cases where our team thinks Native

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.220
Client can make a huge difference.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.990
Many developers have large code bases written
in C or C++ and want to use this code to build

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.189
web applications.

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.289
So, rewriting everything in JavaScript would
take a long time.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.620
With Native Client it is fairly easy to port
your existing code to the web platform.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.090
For example one engineer working at Spacetime
Studios ported Star Legends - an MMO with

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.329
half a million lines of code in just 2 weeks!

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.489
There are also many cases where an application
has significant performance requirements.

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.890
While we’ve seen amazing improvements in
JavaScript performance the last couple of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.559
years, some applications need all the performance
they can get.

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.610
Native Client runs native code, so you can
create these performance intensive applications

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.930
for the web.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.970
If you’ve developed a desktop app that you
want to make portable across operating systems,

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.759
we believe Native Client can help you out,
especially if your app performs heavy computation

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.780
like many games, photo editing and video editing
apps.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.930
With Native Client you only have to maintain
one code base but your app can run on Windows,

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.590
Mac, Linux, and Chrome OS.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.500
Finally, we understand that for some web apps
you may prefer to write parts of them in languages

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.420
other than JavaScript.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.960
Native Client currently has the tools that
allow you to write web applications that run

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.210
C and C++ code in the browser.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.530
Mono also works on Native Client, so you can
run the .NET family of languages, such as

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.530
C#.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.280
And in the future we’ll work to support
even more languages.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.610
These are the most common use cases where
we believe Native Client can be helpful for

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.610
developers.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.680
