Speaker 3:          00:55          hey, it's Molly Webster from radio lab. Before we get into the show today, I wanted to tell you something and that's it. Radiolab has a newsletter we do. It's awesome. You should sign up for it. You'd be the first to know about new episodes. You'd get updates on old ones and lots more to sign up. Go to radiolab.org/newsletter see ya.

Speaker 1:          01:17          Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:19          You're listening to radio lab from New York public radio, public radio, W, C, n, n. P. R.

Speaker 5:          01:32          [inaudible] [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          01:43          Some people go to therapy, some to church, others come here to the northwest corner of a parking lot on fire island, where most nights you'll find a handful of people looking up. I come down here quite often. It's a great place to stargaze. You've got the sound of the ocean in the background with the crashing waves, stash the relaxation of it. You know, the night I visited this guy, Ron was about one of 20 enthusiasts, huddled over astro maps, staring through telescopes of all sizes is quite a quite a telescope, some so big and needed a ladder. Wow. That's a big cluster of stars. Yes, it certainly is. Do you get attached to certain stars? Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah. You did. You get begin. You know the first one she ever found and stuff. Do you remember your first walk? Yeah. Beerio was one of my, I really like Ron's gonna show it to you at MCAP. You can do it. I didn't catch your name actually. John, what it is that to the naked eye yet? A just those like a really famous single star. But when you look at it through a telescope, Zen look in there. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:55          Oh my God, they're so bright. Lights like through the telescope. Al Berio looked like a headlight. Bright and flat and close. Very immediate. But that was nothing compared to what happened next. A woman walks up, points her finger at the star. Okay, so is it, is that the one up here and touches it? That one right touches the star. That's really cool. That was one of the things. It's describe what you just did please. I a turned on my green laser and I pointed at the store. It was one of the coolest things I have ever, ever, ever seen. Her name was Linda. She had a pen that was a laser. When she turned it on, a focused bright green beam of light sprung from her hand to the star like a long green finger. She literally touched the star and for a moment I forgot the ground underneath my feet. And at that star Iberia was 50 million light years away. It seemed right.

Speaker 5:          04:02          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          04:04          so tell me what you mean. What do you see when you look up besides you know, nebulous and and stars and star clusters? Well what do you sort of look for exactly? Well can really see sorta like where you are in the universe or at least in our own galaxy. And it makes like a very interesting perspective for yourself. You know, and like what life is like here and what life must be like in other worlds and whether or not there's other planets out there with people or different life forms that we came to comprehend. This is radio lab on Janet from Roger Today on a program. We're going to project our minds out there to the great beyond and asked some basic questions here to help. As always a hi is Robert Krulwich and in this hour we discover how big, oh sorry we and in this hour we find ourselves in space.

Speaker 4:          04:54          We discover how immense, how huge space is and then we ask ourselves, now where does that leave us? We are a Spec on a Spec, on a Spec, on a speck, and his astrophysicist, Neil digraphs Tyson will remind us later in the program. It is difficult for little specks like us to find walking, talking intelligent spec somewhere else in the universe, but say what you will be, are trying, speaking of which, let's begin by rewinding the clock back to 1977. Okay. This is the big year for the space program because in August of that year, NASA launched a spacecraft carrying a gold record. You remember this, right? I remember the record carried a message from us to them. Our story now, it was Carl Sagan,

Speaker 6:          05:38          cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be.

Speaker 4:          05:44          Who led the team that made the record. And that team included actually was headed by Annie Druyun and visited Annie at her home in Ithaca, New York. And we sat in the backyard near a waterfall in the same spot. She says, where Carl would sit

Speaker 7:          05:58          and become so absorbed in what he was reading that he would not notice a deer standing right next to him. My name is Annie Durian. And, um, it was honored to be the creative director of the voyager. It just stellar message project which began in early 1977. But now how does this come about? I think about the project now and it's so exciting to think about, I mean it's such a romantic idea that you know, that at the time, absolutely we felt, first of all that this was a kind of sacred trust that here we were half a dozen very flawed human beings with the huge, a huge holes in our knowledge of all of these subjects. Building a cultural Noah's Ark. It was the chance to tell something of what life on earth was like two beings of perhaps a thousand million years from now because the, the voyager engineers were saying this record will have a shelf life of a billion years. That didn't race goosebumps then you'd have to be made of wood. Uh, it was also the, the, the, the season that Carl Sagan and I fell so madly in love with each other and here we were taking on this mythic challenge and knowing that before it was done, two spacecraft would lift off from the planet earth moving at an average speed of 35,000 miles an hour for the next thousand million years. And on it we'd be a kiss, a mother's first words to her newborn baby. Come on now, Mozart

Speaker 5:          07:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          07:51          NATO. Greetings in the 59 most populous human languages. Hello for your children or planet earth as well as one non U in language, the readings of the humpback whales and it was a sacred undertaking because it was saying we want to be citizens of the cosmos. We want you to know about that.

Speaker 5:          08:30          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          08:30          tell me about the moment you fell in love with Carl Sagan. You said it was during the voyager compilation? Yes, it was. It was on June 1st, 1977 I had been looking for some time for that piece of Chinese music that we could put on the voyager record and not feel like idiots for having done so. And um, I was very excited because I'd finally, I found a ethnomusicologist at Columbia University who told me without a moment's hesitation that this piece slowing streams, which was represented to me as one of the oldest pieces of Chinese music, 2,500 years old was the piece we should put on the record. So I called Carl who was traveling, he was in Tucson, Arizona giving a talk and we had been alone many times during the making of the record and his friends for three years. And neither of us had ever said anything to the other.

Speaker 7:          09:32          We were both involved people. We'd had these wonderful story in conversations, but we hit both, been completely just professional about everything in his friends and he wasn't there. Left a message. Our later phone rings pick up the phone and I hear this wonderful voice. Then he said, I get back to my hotel room and I find this message and it says any cod. And I say to myself, why didn't you leave me this message 10 years ago? And my heart completely skipped a beat. I can still remember it so perfectly. And I said, for keeps. And he said, you mean get married? And I said, yes. And we had never kissed. We had never, you know, even had any other kind of personal discussion before. We both hung up the phone and I just screamed out loud. I remember it so well because it was this great Eureka moment.

Speaker 7:          10:35          It was just like a scientific discovery. And then the phone rang and I was thinking, oh gosh, you know, like, and a phone rang and it was Carl. And he said, I just want to make sure that really happened. We're getting married, right? And I said, yeah, we're getting married. He said, okay, just wanted to make sure. And um, spacecraft lifted off on August 20th and August 22nd, we told everyone involved. And we were together from that moment until his death in 1996 and December. Wow. Talking about romantic Michael Magic and part of my feeling about voyager obviously, and part of what I was feeling in the recording of my brainwaves, my heart, my eyes, everything in that meditation on the record, I had asked Carl whether or not would it be possible to compress the impulses in one's brain and nervous system into sound and then put that sound on the record and then think that perhaps the extraterrestrials of the future would be able to reconstitute that data into thought. And he looked at me and beautiful May Day in New York City and said, well, you know, that was a million years is a long time. You know, why don't you go do it? Because who knows, you know, who knows what's possible in a thousand million years. And so, um, my brainwaves and rem, every little sound that my body was making was recorded at Bellevue Hospital in New York.

Speaker 7:          12:18          This was two days after Carla and I declared our love for each other. And so what I often think is that maybe a hundred million years from now, he goes, somebody flies that record down, and I always wonder it because part of what I was thinking in this meditation was about the wonder of love and of being in love and to know it's on those two spacecraft. Even now in my, whenever I'm down, you know, I'm thinking it's still, they move 35,000 miles an hour, leaving our solar system for the Great Wide Open Sea of interstellar space.

Speaker 5:          13:07          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          13:07          billions of years from now, the Sun will have reduced this planet to a charred ashy ball. But that record with Andrew, Ian's brainwaves and heartbeat on it will still be out there somewhere intact in some remote region of the Milky Way, preserving a murmur of an ancient civilization that once flourished on a distant planet. Two hearts on a wing. Very nice. It's lovely, right? Yeah, it is. Although there are six plus billion earthlings right now and what the best thing I think about earth is that bridge so various, right. So you can get six plus billion versions of being an earthlink. Yeah. Like, if you were any join in Carl Sagan, what would your recipe of us be? So we asked a bunch of people who, a comedian Margaret Show, uh, you know, her, um, Neil Gaiman, this graphic novelist, Michael Cunningham and author, very famous chef Alice Waters. They all sort of, you know, told us what they would send. I'll play you one, not gonna play all because one, I don't want to hear it. It would take too long. You can hear all of them on our website, actually radiolab.org. But here is, um, one guy, we asked,

Speaker 5:          16:29          well, this week, you make tiny little man really surrounded by thousands upon thousands of people leading this March. And, uh, it was so moving. I think what you'd have to do is get that piece of footage. It articulates in this very simple act, how society's changed, how people that appear to be powerless and insignificant can bring about huge changes.
