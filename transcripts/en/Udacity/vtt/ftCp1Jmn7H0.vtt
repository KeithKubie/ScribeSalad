00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.770
Okay. So now at this point that we exit from the loop, which means that we

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.857
encounter the sentinel which is the, marks the end of the, of the sentence.

00:00:09.857 --> 00:00:11.072
[CROSSTALK]. &gt;&gt; Are we guaranteed to exit?

00:00:13.857 --> 00:00:14.363
&gt;&gt; Well-

00:00:14.363 --> 00:00:17.062
&gt;&gt; You know, we'll, w'll have to fix the condition that we identified.

00:00:17.062 --> 00:00:21.143
&gt;&gt; But assuming that we, we fixed it,

00:00:21.143 --> 00:00:27.411
what happens if last character is not a sentinel?

00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:28.908
&gt;&gt; Well, we tell the user, right,

00:00:28.908 --> 00:00:32.500
that he should follow, that he should enter sentence, end it with the period.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.584
&gt;&gt; That's right, the user are always right.

00:00:36.584 --> 00:00:38.637
&gt;&gt; With their responsibility, right?

00:00:38.637 --> 00:00:41.460
You have to take care of all the possibilities here.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.501
&gt;&gt; Well, as you might recall on a keyboard and a computer, the period and

00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:49.576
the comma are right next to each other, and

00:00:49.576 --> 00:00:52.500
frequently people punch the wrong one.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.066
It's called a slip in, in the cognitive world, and

00:00:57.066 --> 00:01:01.360
they put a comma in and then this thing loops forever.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.416
&gt;&gt; I was thinking, in fact, if there was an enda file without a,

00:01:05.416 --> 00:01:07.446
without a sentinel at the end.

00:01:07.446 --> 00:01:09.426
&gt;&gt; Even better.

00:01:09.426 --> 00:01:12.593
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess then what we'll get, an exception exit, right, and

00:01:12.593 --> 00:01:13.922
catching the exceptions, so.

00:01:13.922 --> 00:01:15.520
&gt;&gt; Without printing anything out?

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.600
&gt;&gt; Well, you know, the, the user will figure out that they did wrong.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.640
We gave them instructions.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.360
I mean, I don't know.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.010
If we want to account for

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.280
all the possible behaviors, sure, I mean, just you know, let's agree to do that.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.370
&gt;&gt; Hey, listen son, this is Aviaonic software we're building here and

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.090
that means planes crash if we can't-

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.534
&gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Characters in a sentence.

00:01:31.534 --> 00:01:32.857
&gt;&gt; That's fine.

00:01:32.857 --> 00:01:35.067
You've kind of been on my back the whole time, but that's fine.

00:01:35.067 --> 00:01:38.669
I mean if, if you think we should account for the, for this thing.

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:39.764
We'll, we'll account for that.

00:01:39.764 --> 00:01:42.277
Do you want to mark it down as as a problem?

00:01:42.277 --> 00:01:42.790
&gt;&gt; We might send-

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.090
&gt;&gt; Crazy Bob, if you don't mind.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.670
&gt;&gt; Maybe we need to send this guy back to the IT department.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.720
&gt;&gt; I think we have read the point.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.222
I think we have read the point.

00:01:50.222 --> 00:01:50.980
Doctor Bug gets the point, right Doctor Bug?

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I, I get the point.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.600
Yeah. There's no need to kind of reiterate every time like three or

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.030
four times but, anyways.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.600
Okay so where were, was I
