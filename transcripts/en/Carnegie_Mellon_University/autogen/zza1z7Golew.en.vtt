finish a PhD in five years that's how we
 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.930
finish a PhD in five years that's how we
advertise it the real number is like

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:31.940
advertise it the real number is like
 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.620
advertise it the real number is like
seven or eight but but we don't want to

seven or eight but but we don't want to
 

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.350
seven or eight but but we don't want to
tell that to anybody right so five years

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.360
tell that to anybody right so five years
 

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.510
