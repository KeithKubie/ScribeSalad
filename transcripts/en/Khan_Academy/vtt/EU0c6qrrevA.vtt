00:00:00.213 --> 00:00:01.931
- [Voiceover] We're told
the first four terms

00:00:01.931 --> 00:00:03.649
of an arithmetic sequence are given.

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:06.454
So it goes from negative
eight to negative 14

00:00:06.454 --> 00:00:09.449
to negative 20 to negative 26.

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:11.515
What is the fifth term in the sequence?

00:00:11.515 --> 00:00:13.578
So we just need to
figure out the next term.

00:00:13.578 --> 00:00:15.458
Well, in arithmetic sequence,

00:00:15.458 --> 00:00:19.220
each successive term is
separated by the same amount.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.029
So when we go from negative
eight to negative 14,

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.466
we went down by six and
then we go down by six again

00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:28.391
to go to negative 20 and
then we go down by six again

00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:30.634
to go to negative 26, and
so we're gonna go down

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:34.631
by six again to get to negative 32.

00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:38.677
Negative 32.

00:00:38.677 --> 00:00:40.595
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:00:40.595 --> 00:00:43.056
The first five terms of
the sequence are given.

00:00:43.056 --> 00:00:44.611
What is the sixth term?

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:46.469
Let's see, to go from two to negative one,

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.303
you subtracted three.

00:00:48.303 --> 00:00:50.416
Two minus three is negative one.

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:52.320
Negative one minus three is negative four.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.661
Negative four minus
three is negative seven.

00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:57.145
Negative seven minus three is negative 10.

00:00:57.145 --> 00:01:01.170
And so negative 10 minus
three is negative 13.

00:01:02.313 --> 00:01:05.721
So hopefully that gives
you the hang of things.
