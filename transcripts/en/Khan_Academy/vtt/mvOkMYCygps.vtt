00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.970
 

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.890
Let's learn to multiply.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.990
M U L T I P L Y.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.960
And the best way I think to do
anything is just to actually do

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.040
some examples, and then talk
through the examples, and try

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.690
to figure out what they mean.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.330
In my first example
I have 2 times 3.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.020
By now you probably
know what 2 plus 3 is.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.300
 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.470
That's equal to 5.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.860
And if you need a bit of a
review you could think of

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.840
if I had 2-- I don't
know-- 2 magenta--

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.600
this color-- cherries.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.880
And I wanted to add
to it 3 blueberries.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.950
How many total pieces of
fruit do I now have?

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.920
And you'd say, oh,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:55.460
Or likewise, if I had our
number line, and you probably

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.710
don't need this review,
but it never hurts.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.040
Never hurts to
reinforce the concept.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:09.600
And it this is 0,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.130
If you're sitting 2 to the
right of 0 and in general,

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.580
when we go positive
we go to the right.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.870
And if you were to add 3
to it, you would move

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.210
3 spaces to the right.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.040
So if I said, if I just
moved over 3 to the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.190
right, where do I end up?

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.120
1, 2, 3.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.450
I end up at 5.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.950
So either way, you understand
that 2 plus 3 is equal to 5.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.790
So what is 2 times 3?

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.550
An easy way to think about
multiplication or timesing

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.560
something is it's just a
simple way of doing addition

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.160
over and over again.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.280
So that you means is, and
it's a little tricky.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.230
You're not going to add 2 to 3.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.220
You're going to add-- and
there's actually two

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.770
ways to think about it.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.375
You're going to add 2
to itself three times.

00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:00.685
Now what does that mean?

00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:07.730
Well, it means you're going
to say 2 plus 2 plus 2.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.070
Now where did the 3 go?

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.940
Well, how many 2's
do we have here?

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.770
Let's see, I have-- this
is one 2, I have two

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.930
2's, I have three 2's.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.550
I'm counting the numbers here
the same way that I counted

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.340
blueberries up here.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.970
I had 1, 2, 3 blueberries.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.840
I have one, two, three 2's.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.658
So this three tells me how
many 2's I'm going to have.

00:02:33.658 --> 00:02:36.230
So what's 2 times 3?

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.060
Well, I took 2 and I added
to itself three times.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.180
So 2 plus 2 is 4.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.265
4 plus 2 is equal to 6.

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:48.340
Now that's only one way
to think about it.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.900
The other way we could have
thought about this is we

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.120
could've said, instead of
having 2 added to itself three

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.020
times, we could've added
3 to itself two times.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.530
And I know it's maybe becoming
a little bit confusing, but the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.050
more practice you do it'll
make a little sense.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.950
So this statement up
here, let me rewrite it.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.830
2 times 3.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.780
It could also be rewritten
as 3 two times.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.880
So 3 plus 3.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.320
And once again, you're
like, where did this 2 go?

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.440
You know, I had 2 times 3 and
whenever you do addition you

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.130
see I have 2-- oh, I don't
know these-- well, I said

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.470
cherries, but they could be
raspberries or anything.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.310
And then I had two things, I
have three things and the 2

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.175
and the 3 never disappear.

00:03:34.175 --> 00:03:36.620
And I add them
together, I get 5.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.720
But here I'm saying that
2 times 3 is the same

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.080
thing as 3 plus 3.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.210
Where did the 2 go?

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.620
2 in this case, in this
scenario, is telling me

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.580
how many times I'm going
to add 3 to itself.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.420
But what's interesting is,
regardless of which way I

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.950
interpret 2 times 3, I can
interpret it as 2 plus 2

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.880
plus 2 or adding 2 to
itself three times.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.390
I can interpret it that way or
I can interpret it as adding

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.100
3 to itself two times.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.940
But notice, I get
the same answer.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.330
What's 3 plus 3?

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.120
That is also equal to 6.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.860
And this is probably the first
time in mathematics you'll

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.340
encounter something very neat.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.170
Sometimes, regardless of the
path you take, as long as you

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.350
take a correct path you
get the same answer.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.450
So two people can kind of
visualize it-- as long as

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.780
they're visualizing it
correctly, two different

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.810
problems, but they come up
with the name solution.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.330
And so you're probably
saying, Sal, when is

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.690
this multiplication
thing even useful?

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.890
And this is where it's useful.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.890
Sometimes it
simplifies counting.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:52.630
So let's say I have a--
well, let's stick with

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.590
our fruit analogy.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.250
An analogy is just when
you kind of use something

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.090
as-- well, I won't
go too much into it.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.710
But our fruit example.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.130
Let's say I had lemons.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.040
Let me draw a bunch of lemons.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.810
I'll draw them in rows of 3.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:15.050
So I have 1, 2, 3-- well, I'm
not going to count them because

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.926
that'll give our answer away.

00:05:17.926 --> 00:05:21.450
I'm just drawing a
bunch of lemons.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:27.070
Now, if I said, you tell me how
many lemons there are here.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.260
And if I did that you would
proceed to just count

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.210
all of the lemons.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.120
And it wouldn't take you too
long to say, that oh, there's

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.510
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12 lemons I actually

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.470
already gave you the answer.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.180
We know that there
are 12 lemons there.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.390
But there's an easier way
and a faster way to count

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.020
the number of lemons.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.960
Notice: how many lemons
are in each row?

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.950
And a row is kind of the
side to side lemons.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.870
I think you know what a row is.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.330
I don't want to
talk down to you.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.100
So how many lemons
are there in a row?

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.290
Well, there are 3
lemons in a row.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.130
And now let me ask you
another question, how

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.170
many rows are there?

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.030
Well, this was one row, and
this is the second row,

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.680
this is the third row, and
this is the fourth row.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.510
So an easy way to count it
is say, I have 3 lemons per

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.510
row and I have 4 of them.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.360
So let's say I have
3 lemons per row.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.350
I hope I'm not confusing you,
but I think you'll enjoy this.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.800
And then I have 4 rows.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.765
So I have 4 times 3 lemons.

00:06:41.765 --> 00:06:46.210
 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.600
And that should be equal to the
number of lemons I have-- 12.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.720
And just to make that gel
with what I just did

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.000
with the addition,
let's think about this.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.090
4 times 3-- literally, when you
actually say out the word 4

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.640
times 3, I visualize this.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.980
I visualize 4 times 3.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.120
So 3 four times.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.910
3 plus 3 plus 3.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.160
And if we did that we
get 3 plus 3 is 6.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.820
6 plus 3 is 9.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.410
9 plus 3 is 12.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:24.450
And we learned up here, this
part of the video, we learned

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:29.670
that this same multiplication
could also be interpreted

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:33.220
as 3 times 4.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.950
You can switch the order and
this is one of the useful and

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.940
interesting actually, kind of
properties of multiplication.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.830
But this could also be
written as 4 three times.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.930
4 plus 4 plus 4.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.400
You add 4 to itself
three times.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.430
4 plus 4 is 8.

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:58.250
8 plus 4 is 12.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:04.680
And in the U.S. we always say 4
times 3, but you know, I've met

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.870
people and a lot of people in
my family they kind of learned

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.900
in the-- I guess, you could
call it the English system.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.870
And they'll often call this
four 3's or three 4's.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.640
And that in some ways is
a lot more intuitive.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.810
It's not intuitive the first
time you hear it, but they'll

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.150
write this multiplication
problem or they'll say this

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.340
multiplication problem and
they'll say, what are four 3's?

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.850
And when they say four 3's,
they're literally saying,

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.570
what are four 3's?

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:31.810
So this is one 3, two 3's,
three 3's, four 3's.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.270
So what are four 3's
when you add them up?

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.480
It's 12.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.665
And you could also say,
what are three 4's?

00:08:38.665 --> 00:08:41.520
So let me write this down.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.740
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.840
That is four 3's.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.060
I mean literally,
that's four 3's.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.350
If I told you to say, write
down for four 3's and add them

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:53.460
up, that's what that is.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.830
And that is 4 times
3 or 3 four times.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:03.080
And this is-- let me do
that in a different color.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:09.870
That is three 4's.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.090
And it could also be
written as 3 times 4.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.550
And they all equal 12.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.490
And now you're probably
saying, OK, this is nice.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.600
It's a cute little trick,
Sal, that you've taught me.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.140
But it took you less time
to count these lemons

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.500
than to do this problem.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.880
And well first of all, that's
only right now because you're

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.110
new to multiplication.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:34.010
But what you'll find is there
are times and there are

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.240
actually many times-- and I
don't want to use the word

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:41.195
times too much in a video on
multiplication-- where each row

00:09:41.195 --> 00:09:45.530
of lemons, instead of having 3
maybe they have 100 lemons.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.770
Maybe there's 100 rows.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.160
And then it would take you
forever to count all the lemons

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.210
and that's where multiplication
comes really useful.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.560
Although, we're not going
to learn right now how to

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.500
multiply 100 times 100.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.350
Now, the one thing that I
want to get you and this

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.030
is kind of a trick.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.390
I remember my sister just to
try to show how much smarter

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.420
she was than me when I was in
kindergarten and she was in

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:12.690
third grade, she would say
Sal, what is 3 times 1?

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.100
And I would say, because
my brain would say, oh,

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.450
that's like 3 plus 1.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.920
And I would say 3 plus
1 is equal to 4.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.190
And so I'd say, 3 times 1?

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.780
That must be 4 as well.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.270
And she would say, no, silly.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:26.080
It's 3.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.130
And I was like,
how can that be?

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.220
How can the 3 times some
other number still

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.270
be the same number?

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.320
And think about
what this means.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:39.440
You could view this
as three 1's.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.570
What are three 1's?

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:44.550
That's one 1 plus another
one 1 plus another 1.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.010
And that's equal to 3.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:49.410
Or you could view
this as 3 one time.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.130
So what's 3 one time?

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:53.370
It's almost silly
how easy it is.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.620
It's just 3.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.900
That's one 3.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.780
You could write this as one 3.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.090
And that's why anything
times 1 or 1 times

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.580
anything is that anything.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.960
So then 3 times 1 is 3.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.110
1 times 3 is 3.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:16.710
And you know, I could say 100
times 1 is equal to 100.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:23.450
I could say that 1 times
39 is equal to 39.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.730
And I think you're familiar
with numbers this large by now.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:27.930
So that's interesting.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.550
Now there's one other
really interesting thing

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:31.950
about multiplication.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.760
And that's when you
multiply by 0.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.060
And I'll start with the analogy
or the example when you add.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:42.210
3 plus 0 you've
hopefully learned is 3.

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.790
Because I'm adding
nothing to the 3.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.950
If I have 3 apples and I
give you 0 more apples,

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.940
you still have 3 apples.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.100
But what is 3 and maybe I'm
just fixated on the number

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.240
3 a little bit too much.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:53.950
Let me switch.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:59.070
What is 4 times 0?

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:03.040
Well this is saying,
0 four times.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:09.110
So what's 0 plus
0 plus 0 plus 0?

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.890
Well, that's 0.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.000
I have nothing plus nothing
plus nothing plus nothing,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.390
so I get nothing.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:18.940
Another way to think of it,
I could say 4 zero times.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.190
So how do I write 4 zero times?

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:23.090
Well, I just don't
write anything, right?

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:25.770
Because if I write anything, if
I write 1/4 and I don't have

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:31.250
no 4's-- let me write this.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:40.676
This is four 0's, but I
could also write zero 4's.

00:12:40.676 --> 00:12:41.880
And what is zero 4's?

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.630
I'll just write a
big blank here.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:44.310
There, I wrote it.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:45.370
There are no 4's here.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.610
So there's just a big blank.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:48.710
And that's another fun thing.

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:50.800
So anything times 0 is 0.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:13:01.390
I could write a huge number,
you know, 5,493,692 times 0.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.560
What does that equal?

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.560
That equals 0.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.180
And by the way, what's
this number times 1?

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.215
Well, it's that number again.

00:13:07.215 --> 00:13:12.410
And what's 0 times 17?

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:15.230
Once again, that is 0.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.855
Anyway, I think I've
talked for long enough.

00:13:17.855 --> 00:13:20.350
See you in the next video.
