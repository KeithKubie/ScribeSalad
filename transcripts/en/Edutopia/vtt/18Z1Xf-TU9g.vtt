00:00:08.376 --> 00:00:11.026
&gt;&gt;Darren: The swine-flu snake
greeting, Morning, Morning, Morning,

00:00:11.026 --> 00:00:12.176
Morning, Morning, Morning.

00:00:12.676 --> 00:00:15.306
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Carrithers
Middle School, the day begins

00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:19.826
with goofy games, which are often
followed by serious discussions.

00:00:20.026 --> 00:00:22.736
&gt;&gt;Darren: We've been discussing
bullying all week long.

00:00:22.736 --> 00:00:26.226
What are some ways that
we can stop the bullying?

00:00:26.656 --> 00:00:27.746
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The 20 minutes spent

00:00:27.746 --> 00:00:30.726
in this daily morning meeting
is a critical component

00:00:30.726 --> 00:00:34.206
of Jefferson County,
Kentucky's, district-wide CARE

00:00:34.206 --> 00:00:37.376
for Kids initiative, which
seeks to build positive,

00:00:37.376 --> 00:00:39.076
caring learning communities.

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:40.156
&gt;&gt;Darren: Humor?

00:00:40.246 --> 00:00:41.706
That's always good, right?

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:44.686
What do you think humor
takes away from bullying?

00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.746
&gt;&gt;Student: If you make
somebody laugh,

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:50.696
then they won't be as
angry as they were.

00:00:50.896 --> 00:00:53.916
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: It takes skill
to lead a class meeting,

00:00:53.916 --> 00:00:59.606
an effective class meeting, takes the
ability to not intervene too soon...

00:00:59.856 --> 00:01:03.266
&gt;&gt;Darren: Or should we
maybe let Mr. Atkinson know?

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.766
What should we do about that?

00:01:04.886 --> 00:01:09.776
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: ...to not impose one's
own values and one's own thoughts

00:01:09.776 --> 00:01:14.686
on the situation and let
students engage and discuss

00:01:14.686 --> 00:01:16.076
and struggle for a while.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.396
&gt;&gt;Darren: I think that's a good idea.

00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:19.856
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Fortunately,
there is support for teachers

00:01:19.856 --> 00:01:21.856
who lead these difficult discussions.

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:26.106
They receive a binder of instructions
and activities and two days

00:01:26.106 --> 00:01:27.936
of training in the summer, followed

00:01:27.936 --> 00:01:30.686
by five follow-up sessions
throughout the year.

00:01:30.916 --> 00:01:31.856
&gt;&gt;Teacher: One of the challenges

00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:36.796
for me was changing
how I saw consequences

00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.916
and the proactive approach.

00:01:38.996 --> 00:01:41.446
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And, I mean, I think
that's what I see you all -

00:01:41.446 --> 00:01:43.736
if you struggle with
anything, it's the language,

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:46.546
because it is so different
than corrective language.

00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:50.166
It's all the negative of "don't
do that," "don't do this,"

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:52.956
"this is what you did wrong,"
whereas the language and care

00:01:52.956 --> 00:01:56.466
and developmental designs is
all about self-regulation,

00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:58.586
about acknowledging what you've done.

00:01:58.586 --> 00:01:59.656
It's all in a positive.

00:01:59.656 --> 00:02:01.076
It's non-confrontational.

00:02:01.306 --> 00:02:03.236
So, is that what you
all see as the language

00:02:03.236 --> 00:02:04.646
as probably the biggest change?

00:02:05.016 --> 00:02:09.056
&gt;&gt;Alicia: Some teachers, the CARE for
Kids might come naturally for them.

00:02:09.196 --> 00:02:11.656
For others it might
be more of a struggle.

00:02:11.906 --> 00:02:13.776
The framework is there.

00:02:14.236 --> 00:02:18.746
They can pick up the book and
structure their morning meeting

00:02:18.746 --> 00:02:21.656
and afternoon meeting
using the resources,

00:02:21.656 --> 00:02:26.566
and so it's helped everyone quickly
be able to implement it successfully.

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:29.286
&gt;&gt;Teacher: There are some things
that're already in place in the book

00:02:29.406 --> 00:02:30.916
that we may want to
consider instead of some

00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:32.436
of these levels that
we currently have.

00:02:32.436 --> 00:02:34.156
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Every school has a
CARE for Kids leadership team,

00:02:34.456 --> 00:02:36.376
usually comprised of the principal

00:02:36.536 --> 00:02:38.676
and a representative
from each grade level.

00:02:39.106 --> 00:02:40.926
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Mr. Atkinson, would
you like to join our circle?

00:02:40.926 --> 00:02:42.626
&gt;&gt;Darren: Sure, I'd
love to, thank you.

00:02:43.306 --> 00:02:47.066
&gt;&gt;Narrator: As the Care team leader
at Carrithers, Darren Atkinson acts

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:50.006
as a sounding board and
mentor for his colleagues.

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:51.956
&gt;&gt;Darren: Well, I think
your circles go well.

00:02:51.956 --> 00:02:53.776
The kids all seem to
interact very well.

00:02:53.926 --> 00:02:54.926
They communicate.

00:02:55.426 --> 00:02:58.506
&gt;&gt;My job is to find out if they
have any kind of issues at hand,

00:02:58.926 --> 00:03:02.446
and then if I can help them solve
that, then that's where I try

00:03:02.446 --> 00:03:08.546
to either suggest the advisory
books or a Web site or something

00:03:08.546 --> 00:03:10.896
that we found successful
in another school.

00:03:11.396 --> 00:03:14.496
Whatever I can do to
alleviate their issue

00:03:14.496 --> 00:03:18.406
and whatever problems they're seeing
at the time, that's kind of my role.

00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:22.116
&gt;&gt;I would have a fix-it plan
and just explain to him,

00:03:22.896 --> 00:03:24.106
"This is what I'm seeing.

00:03:24.346 --> 00:03:26.806
Please help me to understand
why that this is happening."

00:03:27.186 --> 00:03:30.996
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Breckenridge-Franklin
Principal Alicia Averette uses a Care

00:03:30.996 --> 00:03:34.966
for Kids evaluation form to note
what goes on in the classroom.

00:03:35.176 --> 00:03:37.126
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What needs to
happen when we're working

00:03:37.126 --> 00:03:38.186
in a group or with a partner?

00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:39.336
&gt;&gt;Student: Level 1.

00:03:39.656 --> 00:03:42.056
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Very good job, you
are working together; Jermaine?

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:43.966
&gt;&gt;Jermaine: Help them
if they need help.

00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:44.966
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Help them
if they need help.

00:03:44.966 --> 00:03:47.616
&gt;&gt;I use the CARE for
Kids walkthrough tool,

00:03:47.756 --> 00:03:51.946
so when I go in the room I'm
looking for respective interactions

00:03:51.946 --> 00:03:55.426
between students and teachers,
a student-centered environment,

00:03:55.426 --> 00:03:58.756
student work posted, but
then I'm also looking

00:03:58.756 --> 00:04:02.786
at instructional practices
and I provide the teacher

00:04:02.786 --> 00:04:05.406
with a copy of the walkthrough tool.

00:04:05.536 --> 00:04:09.456
And then we have an
opportunity to debrief.

00:04:09.806 --> 00:04:13.226
&gt;&gt;I'm seeing the morning meeting
and the afternoon meetings

00:04:13.226 --> 00:04:15.506
and everything, they're being fit in.

00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:15.656
You all...

00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:17.756
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Since it is part
of the mandated curriculum,

00:04:17.756 --> 00:04:21.336
discussion of the CARE for
Kids initiative is a big part

00:04:21.336 --> 00:04:22.786
of weekly teacher meetings.

00:04:22.786 --> 00:04:24.416
&gt;&gt;Alicia: The sample
schedule we received

00:04:24.416 --> 00:04:26.916
from the district has helped plan it,

00:04:26.916 --> 00:04:29.326
but it does not allow
for wiggle room.

00:04:29.326 --> 00:04:32.736
&gt;&gt;Robben: We can't possibly fit every
single thing that we're expected

00:04:32.736 --> 00:04:36.066
to cover in a day along with
the CARE for Kids stuff.

00:04:36.066 --> 00:04:39.006
And some teachers get hung up on
it, but at the end of the day,

00:04:39.006 --> 00:04:40.996
the moments with the
kids sharing out,

00:04:41.186 --> 00:04:43.326
the moments of you
diffusing a problem

00:04:43.326 --> 00:04:46.516
or letting kids diffuse the problem
on their own, that's the kind

00:04:46.516 --> 00:04:49.846
of stuff that's going to have
the more lasting effect on them.

00:04:50.436 --> 00:04:53.316
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Do not let CARE for
Kids be something that's cut out.

00:04:53.506 --> 00:04:55.596
If you have to knock
10 minutes off math,

00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:58.206
if you have to knock 5 minutes
off science, social studies,

00:04:58.646 --> 00:05:04.746
if you embrace the CARE for
Kids and allow that to be one

00:05:04.746 --> 00:05:09.656
of the core things, then everything
else falls into place so much easier,

00:05:09.916 --> 00:05:11.996
because the students
know the expectations.

00:05:11.996 --> 00:05:13.396
They work together well.

00:05:13.436 --> 00:05:17.066
They are able to respect
each other, and I was so glad

00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:23.016
when our school adopted that,
but now it's mandated and, yay.

00:05:24.046 --> 00:05:25.826
