00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Last problem set, we talked about the force of air resistance and how could be described

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
using the equation F equals B for some constant V times velocity squared

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Velocity being the velocity of the object moving to the air.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In this problem, we're going to use this equation to figure out what the maximum speed is

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
for a car with a certain maximum power output, and yes this is a drawing of a car

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
even though it's not a very good one..

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Let's imagine that this car has a maximum power output of 150 HP

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and let's say that in this scenario, b equals 0.1, so using this information,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
particularly that the maximum power output of the car is 150 HP, I want you to tell me what's the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
maximum speed this car can maintain without slowing and give me your answer in m/s.

00:00:49.000 --> 99:59:59.000
To solve this, you may need to know that 1 HP is equal to 746 W. Good luck.
