Well the answer would be zero. This one was tough. So don't worry if you didn't

00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:09.046
get it right on your first try. We can see that one of the factors is x minus x.

00:00:09.046 --> 00:00:13.015
Well, we know x minus x would equal zero, so I have a bunch of other numbers,

00:00:13.015 --> 00:00:18.529
times zero, times a bunch of other numbers. Anything times zero is just zero. I

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.807
think it's pretty amazing how one number can have such a unique property in

00:00:22.807 --> 00:00:27.463
math. This one zero makes this whole entire multiplication zero.
