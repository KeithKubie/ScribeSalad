WILLIAM LI: So the class
was started in 2011.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.300
That was the first
time it was offered

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.010
in the fall semester of 2011.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.570
It was founded by
Professor Seth Teller, who

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.780
has done a lot of work over
the past couple of decades,

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.760
particularly in computer
vision and in robotics.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.180
And over time I think he saw
that a lot of the work that he

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.730
was doing could also be
applicable to assistive

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.550
technology or
technologies that can

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.520
help people with disabilities
live more independently

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.560
or help them in their
day-to-day lives.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.020
So I think over the
past maybe decade

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.165
or so, he's been involved
in a lot of course creation

00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:57.000
and creating robotics courses
and other undergraduate

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.910
courses in electrical
engineering, computer science.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.740
And I think that this
class was in a lot

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.960
of ways kind of an extension
to that to some extent,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.690
focused on assistive technology.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.900
Over the years, I
think Seth had a chance

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.450
to work in assistive
technology in research projects

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.750
and then interact a lot with
people with disabilities

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.830
in the Cambridge area
or the Boston area

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.380
and really get a sense of the
kinds of practical challenges

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.140
that they face and how
technology could help.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.320
So that really I think
was the motivation

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.740
for starting the
class, trying to work

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.660
with this group of
people and also to tap

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.520
into the interest of
undergraduate students

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.830
to work on service
learning projects

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.590
or to apply their design and
engineering skills to something

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.230
meaningful.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.000
So he taught this class
of the past three years,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.340
and we're fortunate to
be teaching it this fall.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.500
GRACE TEO: In terms of
departmental support

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.009
for the class, so because
Professor Teller was part

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.260
of the electrical engineering
and computer science

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.340
department at MIT, that's
mainly where it has been housed

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.070
for the last three and this
year as well-- so four years--

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.760
going forward, we're
actually looking

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.005
to cross list a class between
electrical engineering

00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:34.190
and computer science,
mechanical engineering,

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.410
as well as health
sciences and technology.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.250
And so I would say
that when it was housed

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.790
within electrical engineering
and computer science,

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.330
we had a lot of computer
science students come to us.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.210
And so a lot of
the other projects

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.050
ended up being
software-related projects,

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.560
because that was
their skill set,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.160
and that's what they
were comfortable with.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.820
But we've also seen that a
lot of assistive technology

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.830
requires hardware design
as well, and so that's

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.740
why we're bringing in
mechanical engineering

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.540
support for the class.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.310
And as for health sciences and
technology, their role at MIT

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.190
is really to serve
as this integrated

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.690
force between different
facets of engineering

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.270
and the medical community.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.350
And so what we're hoping to
do next year with HSTS, Health

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.060
Science and
Technology Support, is

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.080
to bring in occupational
therapists into the class

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.270
as well to help the students
with their projects.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.770
So yeah.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.810
Just in thinking about the
different skill sets that

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.180
go into the projects, we do
think software, hardware,

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.340
and then being able to interface
with the health side of things

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.923
is very important.
