00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:18.000
The World Health Organization estimates that over 121 million people worldwide

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.010
suffer from some form of depression.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.510
It is one of the world's most common mental

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.860
disorders and with 30 percent of sufferers attempting suicide.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.320
I'm not lying when I say the depression kills.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.120
Creative types have been proven to be the group most affected by this disorder

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.450
with people such as Ernest Hemingway Virginia Woolf

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.260
and Michelangelo all being affected.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.140
Is this due to nothing but their unique thought processes

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.190
or could it be something else.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.690
It has been proven that as a species human beings are drawn to those with

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.050
whom we share ideas and have similarthoughts with.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.070
 Studies have shown this time and time again

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.310
such as in Newcomb's 1956 experiment where

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.160
he found that men liked their housemates

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.410
more if they had similar attitudes about sex, family and politics.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.080
This is because people enjoy feeling validated are impressed when

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.190
others have the same taste as them and

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.460
find it easier to talk to those with the same interests.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.680
So it is reasonable to assume that if a person is unable to

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.560
find someone with a similar thought process to them

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.030
they will become lonely

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.040
and may end up suffering from depression.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.620
Creative people have the most unique of minds

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.140
and therefore we can draw the conclusion that as cliched as

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.770
it sounds no one understands them.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.420
However Newcomb study was flawed in many ways

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.940
it's gender bias and small sample size of 17

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.350
means that it can't be generalized to the entire population

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.420
and it fails to explore deeper levels of thought.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.600
This means that whilst people may be more agreeable

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.060
when they have the same views

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.120
it doesn't mean those with different views are shunned from society.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.100
So what does cause such levels of

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.900
depression in the more creative half of the population.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.250
Akinola and Mendes in 2008 conducted a study that looked at

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.370
the role of rejection when it comes to creativity.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.270
Participants were given

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.570
either positive negative or no feedback on a speaking test

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.070
and then asked to produce a collage.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.840
The participants exposed to negative feedback or rejection

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.050
produced more creative collages than participants in

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.920
the control group and the positive feedback group.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.420
This suggests that societal rejection a particular symptom

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.720
of depression may be responsible for increased creativity.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.850
In other words depression causes creativity

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.720
instead of creativity causing depression.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.370
It is crucial to think critically when it comes to the art

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.810
in order to reach your optimum capability,

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.590
but the problem with overthinking is that self-doubt often follows

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.520
and with that lower confidence making it easier to slip into depression.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.610
Perhaps the cause of such mental issues with creative people is that

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.620
they get too used to judging their own work and

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.350
slowly begin judging themselves.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.910
I know that I am guilty of doing this

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.220
as it becomes hard to distinguish between the two

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.860
especially when you put so much heart into what you're working on,

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.600
it almost becomes a part of you.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.870
The role of an artist is to always dance on the dangerous line

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.850
and for many the dance is too hard to keep up.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.030
Do you suffer from the same struggles which theory do you support

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.720
depression causing creativity or

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.750
creativity causing depression.
