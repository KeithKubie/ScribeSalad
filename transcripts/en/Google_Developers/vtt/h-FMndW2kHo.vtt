Hey, everybody.

00:00:00.717 --> 00:00:03.300
I'm Andrew Brogdon, and welcome
back to the Mobile Ads Garage,

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.480
where we cover mobile
ads code the way

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.610
I enjoy cheese
burgers-- thoroughly.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.220
In our last episode, we covered
how to import the Google Mobile

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.890
Ads SDK into your projects.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.200
Today, with the help of my
partner, Gary the Graphics Guy,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.110
I'm going to build on that
by talking about banner ads.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.084
To start, let's imagine
that I'm in an application.

00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:22.930
[TONE]

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:23.860
Perfect.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.800
One of the simplest
ways to monetize an app

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.140
is just by adding a banner.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.819
Here we go.

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:30.610
Now, there's a lot you
can do with banners.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.339
You can use different sizes.

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:33.880
You can put them in
different places.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.030
And you can even animate them.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.530
But we'll keep it
simple for now.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.830
Let's start with Android
Studio and a simple banner

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.370
across the bottom of the screen.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.830
So here's my app
in Android Studio.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.454
It's just a simple
Hello World, and I'm

00:00:45.454 --> 00:00:47.810
going to add a banner
ad right at the bottom.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.210
And here are the steps involved.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.290
So first, I'll place
an AdView in my layout,

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.080
then I'll build
a request object,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.657
and then I'll load an ad.

00:00:55.657 --> 00:00:57.740
So here's my layout file,
and I'm going to drop in

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.520
and AdView element.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.159
There we go.

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:02.950
And you can see Android
Studio pointing out

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.325
that I need a new namespace
reference, because of the ads

00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:08.540
attributes, and I'll
accept that, no problem.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.121
There we go.

00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:11.120
Now, let's talk real quick
about what's in here.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.499
So I've got the AdView
element right there.

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:16.540
I've got my width and
height set to Wrap Content,

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.690
which is what you want.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.180
I've got some positioning
code, and then I

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.320
have two attributes
that I really

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.611
want to draw your attention to.

00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:24.900
Ad size, right
here, tells the SDK

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.630
what size ad you want
to load-- banner, medium

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.970
rectangle, that sort of thing.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.760
And then add unit ID
tells the SDK which

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.010
ad unit corresponds to this
banner placement in the ad.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.580
Ad units are created
at apps.admob.com,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.560
and generally you want
a unique ad unit ID

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.120
for each of the spots in your
app where an AdView appears.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.960
That way you can control things
like mediation and refresh rate

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.190
and so on independently.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.640
Now I can go into
my activity code

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.730
and find a reference to
that AdView object that

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.220
just dropped in the layout
file by using Find View By ID.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.130
There we go.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.911
Perfect.

00:02:03.911 --> 00:02:04.410
All right.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.610
So step 1 done.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.250
Now I'll move on to
building a request.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.407
So the SDK has a builder
class for ad requests

00:02:11.407 --> 00:02:13.240
that makes it really
easy to construct them.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.250
So I'll make a new one here
and call its build method.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.942
We're going to into a lot
more detail on ad requests

00:02:18.942 --> 00:02:20.400
and how they work
in another video.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.066
But for right now, just remember
that every time you load an ad,

00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:25.950
you'll need a fresh ad
request object to do it.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.520
Now, one thing I am going to
do is add a test device ID

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.940
to this request by
adding a function called

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.382
Just Before Build and
giving it the emulators ID.

00:02:35.382 --> 00:02:37.840
This way I can be sure I'll
get test ads while I'm testing,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.790
and that's important.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.760
Always, always use
test ads to test.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.540
OK, that's all we need here
to build my ad request.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.840
So what's left?

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.490
Just making the actual
call to load an ad.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.490
And since I have
my request object,

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.840
I just need to call
AdView's Load Add Method,

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.665
and I'm ready to go.

00:02:55.665 --> 00:02:56.250
Excellent.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.750
All right.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.810
Let's run this bad boy.

00:03:00.522 --> 00:03:02.350
And there's my test banner.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.400
Excellent.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.250
So I placed an AdView, I built
a request, and loaded an ad.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.720
Job done.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.220
Great.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.110
Now that we've got Android
down, let's move on to iOS

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.540
and, remember, it's like
making a tarte tatin instead

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.590
of an apple pie.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.835
Same concepts,
different language.

00:03:19.835 --> 00:03:20.335
Oh.

00:03:20.335 --> 00:03:21.210
Fine, Gary.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.590
It's like CK Ogden's
seminal translation

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.110
of Wittgenstein's Tractatus.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.250
Same concepts,
different language.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.401
You don't know me.

00:03:31.401 --> 00:03:33.093
Now, on to Xcode.

00:03:33.093 --> 00:03:33.593
All right.

00:03:33.593 --> 00:03:35.780
So here we are in Xcode, and
I've got my sample app going.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.446
And I'd like a banner
across the bottom.

00:03:37.446 --> 00:03:40.160
So how can I do that?

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.540
Well, here are the steps
for showing a banner in iOS.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.623
If you just got done
watching the Android section,

00:03:44.623 --> 00:03:46.380
these should seem very familiar.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.920
First, I'm going to place a
GADBannerView on my storyboard.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.880
Then I'm going to build
a new request object.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.299
And then I load an ad.

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.090
So here's my storyboard,
and I'm just going

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.090
to drop a generic view onto it.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.750
Let me drag that over.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.485
And then I'll use the Identity
Inspector to change the class

00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:05.360
to get GADBannerView.

00:04:08.747 --> 00:04:10.980
There we go.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.480
And now I'll throw some
constraints on my banner.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.050
I'd like it to be at the
bottom of the screen, centered.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.990
And the size is going
to be 320 by 50, which

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.150
is our standard banner size.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.970
There we go.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.340
Add the constraints.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.538
Let's see how that looks.

00:04:27.538 --> 00:04:28.370
Cool.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.977
Now, I need to get a
reference in my code.

00:04:30.977 --> 00:04:32.560
I'm going to use
Counterparts and just

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.018
drag it over to
the View Controller

00:04:34.018 --> 00:04:38.320
and make a property
called BannerView.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.658
Excellent.

00:04:39.658 --> 00:04:41.226
And you can see
Xcode complaining

00:04:41.226 --> 00:04:42.350
that I'm missing an import.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.460
So let me go ahead and add
one in for Google Mobile Ads.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.170
The SDK is distributed
as a framework

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.134
to make that part easy.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.330
Now I just need to give
my banner an ad unit.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.280
These are made at
apps.admob.com, and generally

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.280
for every place in your
app that you show an ad,

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.790
you'll need a
different ad unit ID

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.180
so you can control things like
refresh rate and mediation

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.984
independently.

00:05:04.984 --> 00:05:06.900
And last thing, I just
need to give the banner

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.010
a reference to the Root
View Controller, which

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.590
my sample app is this one.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.970
So GADBannerView is placed.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.606
Now I need a request object.

00:05:18.606 --> 00:05:20.920
Requests are represented
by the GAD Request Class

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.310
in iOS, which has a static
request method to build them.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.060
There's a lot you
can do with requests,

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.120
which were going to cover in
one of our subsequent videos.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.520
For now, just remember that
each time you load an ad,

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.822
you'll need to build a fresh
request object to do it.

00:05:33.822 --> 00:05:36.280
And I'm going to go ahead and
add the simulator to the list

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.940
of test devices on my request.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.270
That way I can be sure I'll
get a test ad in response

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.740
to it, which is important.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.247
You should always, always use
test ads when you're testing.

00:05:44.247 --> 00:05:46.580
They prevent false impressions
and false click-throughs,

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.540
both of which are bad things.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.727
So the only thing left
to do now is load an ad.

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:55.060
To do that, I just need to
call the GADBannerView's Load

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.654
Request Method and pass
it my ad request object.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.020
Excellent.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.060
So that's the last step.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.408
Let me run the app,
see what happens.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.240
And there's my test banner.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.740
All right.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.240
So here are the
steps one more time.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.790
To get a banner working, you
just place a GADBannerView,

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.630
build a request,
and then load an ad.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.261
Job done.

00:06:19.261 --> 00:06:21.510
Banner adds are a great way
to get started monetizing,

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.051
but there's a lot
more to talk about.

00:06:23.051 --> 00:06:24.597
Where's the best
place to put them?

00:06:24.597 --> 00:06:26.430
How can you avoid
unintended click-throughs?

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.410
We'll cover all that and
more in our next episode.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.390
In the meantime, I've
got some great resources

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.240
to link you to like our AdMob
Interstitial Guides for iOS

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.220
and Android, which have
notes for Java, Objective-C,

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.300
and Swift.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.100
We also have sample
code up on GitHub

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.350
for both operating systems.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.140
