PENG YING: Hi Welcome to
Google Developers Live.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.087
My name is Peng Ying, and with
me today is my colleague, Maru.

00:00:15.087 --> 00:00:16.340
MARU AHUES: Hey Peng.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.380
PENG YING: Hey Maru.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.990
We're here to talk to you today
about Google Wallet platforms.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.560
Specifically we're talking
about Wallet Objects

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.480
and the QuickStart Tutorials.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.560
The QuickStarts are a great
way to hit the ground running

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.030
when you start integration.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.280
What they do is showcase
and provide examples

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.610
about how to code
against our APIs.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.560
Within it, you'll find
samples to create a class,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.170
to create an object,
to insert the object

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.990
using Save to Wallet,
and to leverage

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.070
our web service APIs, which
allow your users to find

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.580
the loyalty programs and objects
from within the Google Wallet

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.060
app.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.590
So specifically
today we're going

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.670
to be focusing on the Java
Wallet Objects QuickStart

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.280
and how to get it up
and running with Maven.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.030
To show you the
process, here is Maru.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.290
MARU AHUES: Thanks, Peng.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.960
So the first thing we'll do
is go into our documentation.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.050
So go to
 developers.google.com/wallet/objects,

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.700
and from there click
on QuickStart samples,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.050
and you'll see the five
QuickStarts that we have right

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.790
now.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.170
Then click on Java.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.540
Once you get there, you'll
see the instructions

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.170
on how to get your
credentials, and to be

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.510
able to access the API.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.270
So go read the instructions
from the documentation.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.600
And also you can
watch another video

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.770
that we have that
explains this in detail.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.050
And once you have
that, then we'll

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.110
go ahead and start downloading
the QuickStart code

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.470
and installing it.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.650
So what we are going to
assume that you already

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.510
have your credentials,
and we're going

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.760
to go now and download the code.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.690
So to do that, we
have the code running.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.670
You can download it or
clone it from GitHub.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.470
I'm going to click on that.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.470
And so on GitHub,
you can either just

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.270
copy the URL to
clone it locally,

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.350
or you can download
a zip off the code.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.560
I'm going to just clone
that here on my local.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.340
And to do that, I just need
to get clone and the URL,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.980
and that should clone the code.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.070
And I already have it
here for our demo today.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.790
Once you have that,
just one thing

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.330
that you need to make sure is
that you have Maven running,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.080
Maven installed.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.310
We're going to use Maven to
run, and to build the project.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.360
OK so you can see I
have Maven installed.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.810
And now when you got
your credentials,

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.750
you also got a private key file.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.280
You need to copy a private
key file on the source main

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.830
resources directory.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.140
So let me see if I
already have it there.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.050
OK so this is the
sample that we have.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.600
I'm going to copy my private
key, my p12 file into source

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.740
main resources, right?

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.030
Once I have that, the next
thing that we have to do

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.830
is configure the project.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.880
So to do that, we're going to
open the web.xml file, which

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.170
is under source main
web app web inf.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.830
And let me open that here.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:38.310
Source main web app
web inf, web.xml.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:50.000
In this file, so the first
field we have to change

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.655
is the service
account email address.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.560
Change here.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.080
So I have here a cheat
sheet with my credentials,

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.605
so I'm just going to copy
that and put it here.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:13.340
Great.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.180
And then we need to also modify
the path to our private key,

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.390
which in this case
then it would be--

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.310
do I need to put
web inf classes?

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.935
PENG YING: Yes.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.000
MARU AHUES: OK.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.500
PENG YING: That's where it gets
copied to when you build it.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.190
MARU AHUES: OK.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.820
So then yes.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:45.550
And then from here, I think my
file's called wobs private--

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:53.350
let's see what it was called--
I think it's wobs private key.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.540
Let me see here to make sure.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.130
Wobs private key.p12.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.830
OK.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:01.750
So that's fine.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.880
Then we also need our issuer ID.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.760
And this is the ID
that you got when

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.465
your merchant
account was created.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.280
Let's see.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.620
What's this?

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.050
If you don't have an
issuer ID, then you

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:25.170
need to request one through
our Get Access Form.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.720
And once that is
provided to you,

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.040
then you can then download
the quick start and try it.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.930
The application name can be
pretty much any application

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:35.430
name.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.554
It doesn't have to match any
of the values that you have

00:05:38.554 --> 00:05:39.970
when you created
your credentials.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.010
So I'm just going
put wobs testing.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.000
And those are the four values
that we need to update.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.970
So that's, of course,
defining our documentation.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.640
Once we have that, I'm
just going to save my file.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.020
And we have to
install-- and I'm going

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.040
to copy this--
the Wallet Objects

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.000
library in our local
Maven repository.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.610
And we're just going
to do that from here.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.460
And make sure that you
are in the root directory

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.730
where you downloaded
or cloned the code.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.580
Good.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.130
So that's done.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.950
And after that, all we need
to do then is just run it.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.940
So we're going to run it using
Maven on our local server.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.500
So Maven and App Engine here.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.800
And I'm just going to do that.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.470
And here it's going
to build it first,

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.360
and then it's going
to run locally.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.790
So let's see, it's
already running

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.600
and it says it's
running on 8080.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.380
PENG YING: There's
two things to note

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.420
when you're running
your dev server.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.270
The first thing is that
what Maven likes to do

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.470
is encode everything in UTF-8.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.770
So it also encodes
a key sometimes,

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.357
which is why we have an
exception rule in the palm.XML.

00:06:58.357 --> 00:06:59.940
but if you're getting
an error stating

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.490
that some length, the
string length is too long,

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.540
then it's likely that your
key is getting UTF-8 encoded.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.390
The second thing is that
Maven sometimes actually

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.650
this is more an
App Engine issue,

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.290
but what happens
with App Engine is

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.010
that the latest version of App
Engine requires the Java 1.7

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.240
run time.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.420
So if you're getting
any App Engine errors,

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.480
try to install Java
1.7 first, and then

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.400
make sure that your
Java home is pointing

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.360
to the right directory
for Java 1.7.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.810
You can also check Java
dash version to make sure

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.710
that the current
run time is 1.7.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.460
And that should fix
most of the issues

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.070
that you're running into.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.850
MARU AHUES: And
that's very important.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.120
When you do run it, make sure
that Java home is exported.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.900
And you can see on
my screen that I just

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.170
did that before we
ran the QuickStart.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.910
So we have this running.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:56.490
We now loaded on our
local instance here

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:57.435
and what do we get?

00:07:57.435 --> 00:08:01.660
We get buttons to
insert the classes.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.170
In this case we have a
sample for loyalty and offer.

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.910
And once you click on
one of these buttons,

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.540
this will insert the class.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:17.250
And then it will tell me
that the class already

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.370
exists because we
already inserted it.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.100
And that's OK.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.050
That's not an error.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.910
Once we have the class inserted,
then we can click on the Save

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:31.450
to Wallet button, and
this will save the object

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.039
into my Google Wallet app.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:37.600
So now if I go into my
Wallet app on my phone,

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.049
or if we go into the merchant
dashboard under instances, then

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:43.570
we'll see a preview
of the object

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.140
that we saved on our account.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.020
So this is it.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.340
That's all it takes to
download it and run it.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.340
PENG YING: Super simple.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.381
MARU AHUES: Super simple.

00:08:54.381 --> 00:08:55.600
PENG YING: Few steps.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.700
MARU AHUES: We hope
you found this helpful.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:02.060
And if you have any questions
or you want more details

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.720
about wallet objects,
go watch our other GDLs.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:12.010
We do have a GDL about concepts
about Wallet Objects that

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.834
should be very helpful as well.

00:09:13.834 --> 00:09:14.500
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.125
We have an entire series to help
you through the Wallet Objects

00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:18.077
integration.

00:09:18.077 --> 00:09:19.410
MARU AHUES: Thanks for watching.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.180
And we'll see you next time.
