00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.210
Is it me?

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.460
Or have there been a ton of plane crashes
lately?

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.060
Yeah...I’m heavily considering never stepping
on a plane again.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:14.660
Hey folks, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.699
There was MH370, MH17, TransAsia 222, and
Air Algerie flight 5017...it’s all so tragic,

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.949
and my god it’s SO.

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:24.949
MANY.

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:25.949
FLIGHTS.

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:26.949
DOWN!

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:27.949
What the heck is going on?

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.499
Despite all of these closely occurring crashes
lately, officials from the Atmosphere Research

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:35.129
Group and Flight Safety Foundation both say
that air travel remains EXTREMELY SAFE.

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:37.239
And I do mean extremely.

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.730
Air travel is safer than it’s ever been,
so safe that the experts say that being on

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.160
a plane is probably the safest part of your
day.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.499
There’s a 1 in 11 MILLION chance that you
will die in a plane crash - a chance so small

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:50.090
that it’s more likely you’ll die in the
airport itself.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.239
Nearly 96% of those who are in a plane crash
survive.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.660
But you know what’s WAYYYYY more fatal?

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.960
Driving in a freaking car.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.320
CARS ARE DEATH MACHINES.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.159
You have a 1 in 5000 CHANCE OF BEING KILLED
IN A CAR.

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.900
That’s right - we should really fear the
ride to the airport more than the flight itself.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.380
Still, fears about flying in planes is widespread.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.930
6% of people refuse to get on a plane outright
because they’re so paralyzed with fear - a

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.930
condition called aviophobia.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.860
But up to 40% of people say they experience
some anxiety when they’re on a plane.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.979
What’s at the heart of this widespread fear?

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.640
One is the psychological effect of HEARING
about every plane crash.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.329
They’re so rare that when they do happen,
word spreads around the world.

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.611
If we heard about every single fatal car crash
IN THE WORLD, you bet your bottom people would

00:01:33.611 --> 00:01:35.369
be much more terrified of cars.

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.520
But moreso than the high visibility of plane
crashes is the fact that flying reminds us

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.490
how little control we have over life and death.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.810
Being behind the wheel of the car provides
a greater ILLUSION of control -- but in neither

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.950
situation are you completely in control of
your own destiny.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.780
For many, flying provides varying degrees
of confrontation with our own vulnerability

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.670
and the true fragility of life.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.950
Fear of flying can also be exacerbated by
other elements of the experience: being in

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.329
small spaces, feeling crowded, processing
lots of strange noises, doing a lot of waiting,

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.170
or not understanding the mechanics of how
the thing actually flies.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.451
Every single time I’m on a plane I’m in
awe of how they work….but simple lack of

00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:17.790
understanding about flight basics can make
things like turbulence go from harmless side

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.730
effect to full blown panic attack.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.260
If you have a little anxiety while flying,
or if your fear is stoked by hearing about

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.210
crashes, it might help to read up about how
safe flying actually is and how it works.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.610
I fly a lot and learning a bit about it has
definitely helped me out.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.280
Thanks for joining me for DNews, are you scared
of flying?

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.500
Let me know down below and I’ll catch you
next time.
