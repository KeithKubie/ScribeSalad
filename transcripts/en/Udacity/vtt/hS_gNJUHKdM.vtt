00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.380
So what defines a partner?

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.920
What's really interesting is that this has to be a 2-way street.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.670
One way we say that is shared economics.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.320
Not only do you have to get something out of the relationship,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.840
but so do they, and so you really need to understand

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.100
what's in it for your partner.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.510
A classic start-up mistake is understanding why you need them

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.750
but not being able to articulate why it is that they would need you.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.280
They should need you not only for success,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.730
but boy if they don't have you, they should understand that their business might fail.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.410
A partner might also take a form of co-development or co-invention,

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.530
or you might share common customers.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.940
But, one of the things to remember is all the books about partnerships

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.550
and all the literature you read tend to be about partnerships

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.410
of companies the same size.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.370
But you are a tiny speck to most potential partners.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.379
Remember, you're a start-up, and that means they barely could see you,

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.420
and so there are some special pitfalls,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.670
some special things to talk about throughout the rest of this presentation.
