00:00:00.247 --> 00:00:01.115
(whoosh)

00:00:01.115 --> 00:00:06.115
(mouse clicks)
(electronic beeping)

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.670
- Raphael Pelayo from Stanford University.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.420
Dr. Pelayo is a professor of
psychiatry and sleep medicine,

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.320
and he's here to tell us all
about sleep in this population.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.313
Dr. Pelayo.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.946
Yay.

00:00:26.946 --> 00:00:27.830
(audience applauds)

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.663
- Thank you.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.790
Are they clapping louder
in that overflow room?

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.973
Do you guys know, anybody know?

00:00:33.973 --> 00:00:35.810
What's happening over there?

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.643
Good morning.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.940
I'm Raphael Pelayo.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.410
I'm a sleep doctor at Stanford,

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.290
and thank you so much for the invitation.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.440
Really happy to be here.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.017
You guys can come on in.

00:00:48.017 --> 00:00:50.210
I am a professor now in the
department of psychiatry,

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.020
but I'm not a psychiatrist.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.290
I wanted to be a psychiatrist

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.570
when I was in high school and college,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.310
but I ended up, when I
got to medical school,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.140
switching to neurology, and I
switched to child neurology,

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.760
just as a pathway to get into sleep.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.450
My interest has always...

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.040
Since the first week of medical school,

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.300
I started hanging around the sleep lab,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.723
and that's what I've been doing.

00:01:09.998 --> 00:01:11.070
And I wanna talk to you
guys a little bit about,

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.930
see but everybody sleeps.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.150
You know, when I walked in this morning,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.750
I saw the overflow room, so
say hi to you guys over there,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.410
and it was packed.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.030
It was packed, there was
nowhere to sit over there.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.630
And I think, wow, this
room must really be full.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.683
And I walked in here, and I said, whoa,

00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:24.960
what are these empty seats over here now?

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.430
So our overflow friends
could come over here

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.800
if they wanted to, right?

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.608
I teach a class on campus
called Sleep and Dreams,

00:01:32.608 --> 00:01:35.120
set up by Dr. William Dement in 1970.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.780
And Dr. Dement is now retired,
so I get to teach the class.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.300
And yesterday, no, Wednesday
was our last day of class,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.600
we've got finals this week.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.840
But one of the things
that happens in our class

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.280
is if you fall asleep
during one of our lectures,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.658
we will squirt you with water.

00:01:49.658 --> 00:01:51.050
(audience laughs)

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.240
With a water gun, and
you get bonus points.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.660
You actually can get bonus points

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.530
for falling asleep in class.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.730
So, I didn't bring my water gun with me,

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.590
but it brings up that should
somebody fall asleep in class,

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.640
and it turned out that when I did the math

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.920
when I took over the course,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.700
that if you fell asleep
at every single class,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.060
you could end up with a C.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.287
So we had to stop doing that,

00:02:08.287 --> 00:02:10.308
we had to cap the bonus points.

00:02:10.308 --> 00:02:13.141
(audience laughs)

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.630
I have disclosure.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.410
I did consulting with a
couple different companies

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.763
and they're listed there.

00:02:22.237 --> 00:02:23.730
None of these are gonna be relevant

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.950
to our talk today, I believe,

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.870
but if something comes up, I'll flag it.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.383
But I don't think any of
these will be relevant to it.

00:02:31.516 --> 00:02:34.770
We're gonna talk about
overall sleep disorders.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.560
I mentioned I trained in child neurology,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.840
but I mostly took care of adult patients.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.900
And what I actually do is what I think of

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.400
as more like family sleep medicine.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.233
'Cause if one person doesn't sleep,

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:47.220
it affects the entire family.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.820
It's unusual to have just
one person sleep poorly

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.845
and everybody else is like, it's okay.

00:02:51.845 --> 00:02:53.967
It affects everybody in the family

00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:55.930
if someone doesn't sleep well.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.810
And also these sleep
disorders are familial.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.910
I'll show you a few of them.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.160
But sleep disorders are familial.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.070
So if you see a child with sleep problems,

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.530
you're gonna find parents
with sleep problems.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.820
And if you see an adult
with sleep problems,

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.890
you should ask about their
kids, their relatives.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:07.823
Almost all of the sleep disorders

00:03:07.823 --> 00:03:10.653
that we're gonna address
today are familial.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:13.840
So what do we see in clinic?

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.880
These are the typical conditions we see.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.750
We have a little bit less than an hour

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.360
to talk to you about these.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.030
Each one of these can be
a lecture unto itself.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.603
We'll have a Q&amp;A afterwards.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.023
Insomnia.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.326
Short of falling asleep or staying asleep

00:03:28.326 --> 00:03:29.240
(mumbles) the next day,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.779
it's probably one of
the more common things

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:31.710
that you'll deal with

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.850
with adults and children
with disabilities.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.520
Sleep apnea, I would say it's like fog,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.660
it gets into everything,
you gotta take care of it,

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.830
it's like sand on the beach.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:41.910
If you don't take care of the sleep apnea,

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.670
it's hard to take care of
these other things you'll have.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.338
And many times you'll encounter patients

00:03:45.338 --> 00:03:48.260
who have tried some type
of behavioral treatment

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.640
or stress and medication
to help their sleep,

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.457
and they say it didn't work.

00:03:51.457 --> 00:03:52.860
And the reason it didn't work was

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.390
there was an underlying
sleep apnea condition

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.670
that hadn't been addressed.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.010
So you gotta clean that up
first, and then you can retry

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.850
things that supposedly
have failed in the past.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.040
Now you may find that they do work.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.607
Parasomnias are things
that go bump in the night.

00:04:04.607 --> 00:04:07.640
If I give a talk at a
high school or college,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.390
parasomnias are what the
kids wanna talk about.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.676
They wanna talk about lucid dreaming,

00:04:10.676 --> 00:04:12.770
they wanna talk about sleep paralysis,

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:13.970
they wanna talk about sleepwalking.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.100
Those are things that interest them.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.677
Restless leg syndrome,
extremely common condition.

00:04:19.677 --> 00:04:21.340
Somebody in this room must have it,

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.080
it's impossible to have
this many people in the room

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.320
and nobody have restless leg syndrome.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.310
Some of you must have restless legs.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.130
Yes, thank you, a couple of
people raised their hands.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.350
You were one of the
speakers, weren't you, no?

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.241
Hi.

00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:32.700
(audience laughs)
That explains a lot.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.320
I see you kind of moving around and stuff,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.410
I was watching you.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.140
I see, got it, okay.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.210
We thought it was just energy.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.890
Restless legs runs in families.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.360
And I'll tell you my youngest case,

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.193
well, restless legs,

00:04:44.193 --> 00:04:45.510
first of all I should describe it to you.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.582
It's an unpleasant
sensation, hard to describe,

00:04:49.582 --> 00:04:54.260
with an urge to move,
characterized by an urge to move.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.350
First described over 600 years ago by Sir,

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.610
I forgot his first name, Sir Willis,

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.470
the guy who did the Circle of Willis.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.150
That same guy described
restless leg syndrome

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.990
as a neurological condition.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.270
Before then it was thought to be a curse.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.030
And it feels like a
curse to a lot of people,

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.830
because it's a condition
where it only bothers you

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.430
when you stop working.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.880
As long as you're moving
around, it doesn't bother you.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.220
When you sit still, it'll come on.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.010
And I can tell you, my
youngest case that I saw

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.650
was a two-year-old girl
adopted from China.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.080
And restless legs is tied
in to iron metabolism.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.746
And these wonderful parents, I mean,

00:05:31.746 --> 00:05:34.030
I don't have tell you how
generous somebody must be

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.420
to adopt a child, right?

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.930
Amazing heart these people
have to adopt a child.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.540
And they adopted this
little girl from China,

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.930
and they said that she doesn't sleep well.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:43.910
And obviously people said,

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.130
well did you try sleeping with her,

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.124
is it neglect, is she just stressed out?

00:05:48.124 --> 00:05:49.960
The parents said, no,
we'll sleep with her.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.700
And a common question,
something you can think

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.603
about yourself when you interact with,

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.910
especially with younger children,

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.190
if they have poor sleep, you can ask,

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.960
does the problem get better
or worse or stay the same

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.550
if they sleep with the
parents or their caretakers?

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:03.890
And usually, if it's a behavioral issue,

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.580
if they sleep with the
parents, it gets better.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.290
Little kids usually wanna be with people

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.020
that love them and protect them.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.220
But this little girl slept just
as poorly with the parents,

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.820
the adoptive parents.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.460
In fact, they said, we
wish she'd sleep with us.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.620
It was an Asian family,

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.453
they said we'd like to sleep with her,

00:06:18.453 --> 00:06:19.640
it's in our culture,

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.211
but we can't sleep with
her, she moves too much.

00:06:22.211 --> 00:06:23.690
So I said, you know,

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:24.911
there's not many other things it could be

00:06:24.911 --> 00:06:25.930
to differentiate a diagnosis,

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.680
so I said let's just give
her a little bit of iron.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.000
Let's just see if she has,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.910
we measured her ferritin,

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.350
and it turns out that
she has restless legs.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.340
And the parents said she
got much better quickly

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.230
after we treated her.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.180
I think we gave her a
low dose of pramipexole,

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.550
which we can talk about
later, a medication.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.383
But the interesting thing is

00:06:42.383 --> 00:06:43.340
when she learned to speak English,

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.681
her first word in English was "itchy".

00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:48.610
'Cause she would say "itchy",
she knew what she had.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.480
So restless legs is
something to think about.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.490
And when you see it in a kid,
always ask about the parents.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:54.890
And you have to always ask that

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.640
kind of semi-awkward question
to whoever brings them in,

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.440
the mother, are you the birth mother?

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.860
Because restless legs typically
flares during pregnancy.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.000
And you'll meet women who'll tell you

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.060
that they know they're pregnant,

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.130
they know to check for pregnancy,

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.050
because they start feeling the legs,

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.320
the legs start bothering them.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.540
That's restless legs.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.520
Delayed sleep phase syndrome,

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.090
second most common sleep disorder

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.930
among young adults and
teenagers, the most common simply

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.700
being behaviorally induced
insufficient sleep syndrome.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.540
People who just don't get enough sleep

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.150
for their own reasons.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:27.730
Which is very weird, by the way.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:28.820
Animals don't do that.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.690
Animals don't just stay awake
for the fun of it usually.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.430
Usually they sleep on a rhythm.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.330
But delayed sleep phase syndrome,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.610
characterized by difficulty falling asleep

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.540
rather than staying asleep.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.890
If you've never made a diagnosis,

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:42.893
it's because you've missed it.

00:07:42.893 --> 00:07:44.770
It's just that common.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.570
Look it up, learn it, you're
gonna start seeing it.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:48.550
Delayed sleep phase syndrome,

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.660
characterized by
difficulty falling asleep,

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.250
not staying asleep.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.530
Most of the time you talk
with an adult with insomnia

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.027
or sleep problems, they say things like,

00:07:56.027 --> 00:07:56.893
"Doc, I have no trouble falling asleep,

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:59.300
"I have trouble staying asleep."

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.133
This is the opposite.

00:08:00.133 --> 00:08:01.177
"I have trouble falling asleep,

00:08:01.177 --> 00:08:03.790
"but once I fall asleep, I'm just fine."

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.250
Interestingly, delayed
sleep phase syndrome

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:06.890
was first described in 1981,

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.350
at Montefiore Hospital, New York City,

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.860
where I trained a few years later.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.730
And it was described among
a group of young adults

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.830
who had what was called at
that point atypical depression.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.607
What was atypical about
their depression was

00:08:19.607 --> 00:08:21.720
the insomnia pattern was different.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.570
They had trouble falling
asleep, not staying asleep,

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.060
and didn't have the other
feature sometimes of depression

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.070
called terminal insomnia,
which is a bad term,

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:31.570
terminal insomnia, which means insomnia

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.060
at the early morning hours.

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.036
But the other thing
about these individuals,

00:08:35.036 --> 00:08:37.230
these young individuals,

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.550
was that they did not
respond to medication.

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:41.610
None of the antidepressants at the time

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:43.290
seemed to make any difference to them.

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:45.760
Once it was identified as
a circadian sleep disorder,

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.894
and it was the first circadian
sleep disorder identified,

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:49.950
they reset their sleep schedules,

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.810
and once that happened,
their sleep normalized,

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:55.415
and they felt better
and their mood improved.

00:08:55.415 --> 00:08:57.260
I'm always happy to come to this meeting,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.760
and I mentioned it to you earlier,

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.020
when I was a medical student,
I got to do a project

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.110
on delayed sleep phase syndrome.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.610
And it wasn't that good a project,

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:05.280
but I wrote my project
on it and submitted it

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.730
to the Journal of Pediatrics.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.670
And the letter of rejection
was signed by Lucy Crain,

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:09.744
so I was very proud of her.

00:09:09.744 --> 00:09:11.900
(audience laughs)

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.390
So when I saw her...

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.120
And it wasn't really rejected,

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.370
it was like, this needs more
work, and she was right.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.790
But I was a fourth-year medical student,

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.610
and it was before the Bell Commission,

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.400
so I had a 110-hour workweek.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.360
So I just never got to it.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.750
So it always bothered
me that I didn't do it,

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:26.817
but then I reconciled it.

00:09:26.817 --> 00:09:29.410
I'm 56 now, I was 25
years old at the time,

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.576
so I'm okay with it now.

00:09:30.576 --> 00:09:31.740
(audience laughs)
But it was a good thing,

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.970
I think it was a good rejection.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.365
It pointed me in the right
direction where I have to be.

00:09:35.365 --> 00:09:36.198
(indistinct question from audience)

00:09:36.198 --> 00:09:39.380
Yeah, much more, no, no, you
are thanked with gratitude,

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.690
because it helped me think
about how I want to do things,

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.320
and how it goes.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.710
But anyway, that's delayed
sleep phase syndrome.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:45.963
So learn that condition.

00:09:48.217 --> 00:09:51.620
"My child won't sleep, my child is tired."

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.070
Wouldn't it be nice if
we could have kids sleep

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.331
whenever we wanted to?

00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:55.272
(audience laughs)

00:09:55.272 --> 00:09:57.410
Wouldn't that be so cool, right?

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:58.410
Can you imagine if you could have them

00:09:58.410 --> 00:09:59.923
fall asleep on demand?

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.150
You can feed them whenever you want,

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.460
why can't you make them
sleep whenever you want?

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.660
Why can't we do that?

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.480
Parents would love it.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.400
When you travel,

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.740
wouldn't it be convenient
if you could make them sleep

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:09.950
whenever you wanted to?

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:10.783
(audience laughs)

00:10:10.783 --> 00:10:12.890
And actually this is one of
the reasons kids get medicated,

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.041
is because it's inconvenient
when they're awake.

00:10:15.041 --> 00:10:16.710
So a lot of times when some--

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.010
(audience laughs)

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:18.843
It's true.

00:10:19.691 --> 00:10:21.130
It's true.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.900
Wouldn't you like them to
sleep when you wanted to?

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:24.733
It'd be nice.

00:10:24.733 --> 00:10:27.743
And that's why people will
give their kids medication.

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:30.860
So what goes through your
mind when you hear this?

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.590
How do you go through this?

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.400
So we're gonna touch on
some of these issues.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.460
And one of the things
that's nice about sleep

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.140
is that principles of sleep medicine

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.670
apply equally to children and adults.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.040
They really do apply across the board.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.360
And the same concepts
that I use with adults

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.830
apply to children, and that
goes in both directions.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:50.013
And we can talk some more as we go along.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.297
Your life is reflected in your sleep,

00:10:52.297 --> 00:10:54.197
you sleep's a reflection of your life.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.380
That's our symbol in sleep medicine,

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.250
that ying and yang symbol.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.160
That's our official symbol,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.840
that's what I keep on my work ID.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.950
You see, I have it here.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:04.020
Have a little, if you can see it up front.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.293
See, that's what I keep on my thing.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.420
In sleep medicine early on

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.220
they knew they couldn't separate
the mind from the brain.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.930
It kind of goes together.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.460
The day and the night, they're
just part of the whole thing.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.390
So because that's our
symbol, it's a platitude,

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.140
but I sort of say this routinely

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.030
when I give lectures to my students.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.972
Your life's reflected in your sleep,

00:11:22.972 --> 00:11:24.210
your sleep's a reflection of your life.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.070
And then what turned out to happen was

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:28.030
that got picked up by,

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.240
one of the students put it on a blog

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.940
and it got picked up by another blog.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:31.950
And that was carried on.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.190
And now, I was at a conference in Houston,

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.250
and some lady walked over to me,

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:38.430
says I quoted you in a talk,
says that's one of the most

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.530
famous sleep quotes out there, she said.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.690
So if you look up my name and quotes,

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.010
this shows up along with the Dalai Lama

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:46.620
and Benjamin Franklin as a sleep quote.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.538
It's ridiculous.

00:11:47.538 --> 00:11:49.505
(audience laughs)

00:11:49.505 --> 00:11:50.930
I'm not kidding, just look it up.

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:52.740
Some of you are just browsing the internet

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.573
as I speak anyway.

00:11:53.573 --> 00:11:54.936
Probably in that overflow room
that's what they're doing.

00:11:54.936 --> 00:11:57.880
(audience laughs)

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.890
But one time somebody
showed up with a picture

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.060
of a mattress store in Lebanon.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.370
And there was that quote
with my name beneath it

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:07.687
in this mattress store in Lebanon.

00:12:07.687 --> 00:12:08.960
(audience laughs)

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.110
Just use it, just take
it, you can have it.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.560
But that's a true quote.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.380
And that's the power of our students,

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.130
the power of the echo
chamber of the internet,

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:18.223
how that carries on.

00:12:19.116 --> 00:12:20.180
The other phrase that I like to say

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.830
is that your sleep is biological,

00:12:22.801 --> 00:12:24.090
but the way you sleep is learned.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.921
You've all been taught how to sleep.

00:12:25.921 --> 00:12:28.830
Whenever you're in track
with anybody's sleep,

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.420
all sleep problems have
four components to them.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.253
Child or adult,

00:12:32.253 --> 00:12:35.270
all sleep problems have
four components to them.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.690
When you get your history,

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:38.670
you wanna think about the amount of sleep,

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.270
the quality of their sleep,

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.317
the timing of their sleep,

00:12:41.317 --> 00:12:43.762
and what do you think
the fourth one is, guys?

00:12:43.762 --> 00:12:45.320
Their state of mind.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.870
Get a sense from your patient,

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.000
from whoever you're dealing with,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.890
are they looking forward to sleeping?

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.780
Or are they looking
forward to being awake?

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.470
Does it matter to them
if they make it on time

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:54.660
to their day program or not?

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.940
They may not care.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.050
Sometimes the concerns are
more of their caretakers

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:00.360
than are the actual patient
that they get up on time.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.846
Do you look forward to sleeping?

00:13:01.846 --> 00:13:03.920
People with sleep problems
talk a certain way

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.940
that nobody else talks.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.650
They say things like,
"I try to go to sleep."

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:09.680
Nobody else talks that way.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.930
Everybody says I go to sleep.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.797
They say I try to sleep.

00:13:12.797 --> 00:13:15.350
"If I'm lucky, I'll get
six hours of sleep."

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.320
And they imply luck like
it's an external thing,

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.090
like sleep is out of their control.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.490
And when you start thinking that way,

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:21.460
you know there's a problem.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.530
So you've gotta get a sense
from anybody you're talking to,

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.777
are they looking forward to sleeping?

00:13:25.777 --> 00:13:27.240
When you deal with young adults

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.820
or especially with teenagers,

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.220
ask them who goes to sleep
first, you or your parents?

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:33.700
You'd be surprised how many teenagers

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.670
stay awake past their parents.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:36.690
They may go to their bedrooms

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:38.117
much earlier than their parents.

00:13:38.117 --> 00:13:40.130
And the kids do something
that's very un-adult-like.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:42.510
They convert their bedrooms
to mini studio apartments.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.270
And they hang out in their room.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.660
So when you talk with them, get a sense,

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.290
do you spend more hours awake
than sleeping in your bedroom?

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:49.330
You think that's not a good thing to do

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:50.740
if you're spending too much
time awake in the bedroom,

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.005
but a lot of kids will do that.

00:13:53.005 --> 00:13:55.780
And then the kids will start
sleeping in on weekends.

00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:00.354
The first evidence of poor sleep
is sleeping in on weekends.

00:14:00.354 --> 00:14:04.310
That's a very un-adult
thing that they'll do.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.880
You may as an adult sleep
in one or two hours.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.060
You don't sleep in five or six hours

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.830
typically on Friday compared to Saturday.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.040
The weekend is an artificial thing.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.380
Seven- and eight-year-olds don't sleep in.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.755
Parents wish they would, but they don't.

00:14:15.755 --> 00:14:16.820
(audience laughs)
Right?

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:17.897
They don't.

00:14:17.897 --> 00:14:19.900
They don't have to, their sleep-satiated.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.968
They're sleep deprived, and
that's why they're sleeping in.

00:14:22.968 --> 00:14:24.660
And parents say, poor
kid, it's good for him

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.010
to catch up on his sleep.

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:27.230
We don't do that with food, do we?

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.360
We don't say, hey, we're gonna starve you

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.249
Monday through Friday.

00:14:29.249 --> 00:14:30.082
(audience laughs)

00:14:30.082 --> 00:14:31.440
Saturday and Sunday, eat all you like,

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.799
because I'm starving you
again starting Monday.

00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:34.990
(audience laughs)
We don't do that.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.890
But that's what happens with our kids.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:39.780
The need for sleep is biological,

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.550
the way you sleep is learned.

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:43.040
Just know this with adults.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.400
All of you, the first night
you spend with your loved one,

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.730
that person you love,
your significant other,

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.570
the first night you're with that person,

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:50.410
you got on one side of the bed,

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.020
that person took the
other side of the bed.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.100
It was never discussed again after that.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:54.933
That was your side,
and that was your side.

00:14:54.933 --> 00:14:56.753
And when you travel, that's your side,

00:14:56.753 --> 00:14:57.586
that's the other person's side.

00:14:57.586 --> 00:14:59.550
You never ever change
sides again, I've learned,

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.070
until much later in life.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.620
Older folks will have an agreement

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.580
that one of them sleeps
closer to the bathroom.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.710
So if they're in a hotel
and the room is rearranged,

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.000
that's the only time they
change sides of the bed,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.430
'cause they don't wanna
walk around things.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.420
Other than that, that's
your side of the bed.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.020
And if you don't believe
me that sleep is learned

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.360
and you sleep alone,
simply rotate your body

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.420
and put your feet where your pillow goes

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:17.740
and see how you feel.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.080
You may fall out of bed if you do that.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:19.998
Same room, same everything.

00:15:19.998 --> 00:15:20.831
(audience laughs)

00:15:20.831 --> 00:15:22.369
So sleeping is a learned behavior.

00:15:22.369 --> 00:15:24.440
We teach kids how to sleep.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.340
We teach them where
they're gonna be sleeping.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.380
That's an important thing.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.780
Talk to little kids, they'll talk to you

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.670
about where they're gonna
sleep, what's gonna happen.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.080
Little kids know, in the dark,

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.490
they know which side of the bed mom's on

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.020
and which side of the bed dad's on.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.270
They know.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.378
If you speak with a mom,
says my kid comes in

00:15:39.378 --> 00:15:40.457
and wakes me up at night.

00:15:40.457 --> 00:15:41.970
And I'm like, well why
don't they wake up dad?

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:43.080
Oh, 'cause dad ignores them.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.780
And I'm like, well maybe that's
the problem, then, right?

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:45.870
(audience laughs)
That's the issue.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:47.920
Why does the kid go to your
side and not the dad's side?

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:48.940
What's going on?

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.828
He knows he can sneak in on
my side, not on dad's side.

00:15:50.828 --> 00:15:52.963
I figured this out, too.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:54.653
Corollary to this, what wakes you up

00:15:54.653 --> 00:15:57.070
may not be what's keeping you awake.

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:58.240
There's too many sleep disorders,

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.289
sleeping is just something
that we all do so much of.

00:16:01.289 --> 00:16:03.090
You should not assume
that what's waking you up

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.600
is keeping you awake.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.048
You may wake up because you
have a little bit of sleep apnea

00:16:07.048 --> 00:16:08.290
and that wakes you up,

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:10.140
or you may wake up because you
have a little bit of reflux.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.340
Ton of reflux in our patient population.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.630
That will wake you up.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.280
But staying awake is something different.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.907
What's keeping you awake?

00:16:16.907 --> 00:16:19.570
You're concerned about
things, worried about things.

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.100
So you always gotta think in
sense of people's state of mind

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.400
and what's waking them up.

00:16:25.528 --> 00:16:27.430
We always talk about these sleep stages,

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.783
and there's a few things I'd
like to point out to you.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.160
First of all, John's in the back.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.530
Is it John?

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:35.289
Thank you, John cleaned up my slides.

00:16:35.289 --> 00:16:38.020
I've had a problem with
this slide for a long time,

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.708
and he fixed it for me very
quickly, so thank you, John.

00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:43.308
He made these graphics pop, thank you.

00:16:43.308 --> 00:16:46.308
(audience applauds)

00:16:47.328 --> 00:16:49.780
What he changed was,

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.033
we used to talk about,

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.630
sleep is divided into,

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.450
well, take a step back.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:58.340
Our entire lives, you've
either been awake,

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.350
you've been dreaming, or
sleeping but not dreaming.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:01.640
That's all we do.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.030
You're awake, you're dreaming,
or sleeping but not dreaming.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:04.863
And those are the three states

00:17:04.863 --> 00:17:07.370
the brain seems to function in.

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:10.453
So we talk about awake,
dreaming sleep, you may know

00:17:10.453 --> 00:17:13.710
is equated with rapid eye
movement sleep, REM sleep.

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.740
REM sleep, the term was
coined by Dr. William Dement.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.400
Dr. Dement is alive,
he wants people to know

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.800
he's still alive, he's 90 years old.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:20.680
And if you ever wanna visit him,

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.010
he's open to visitors.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:23.090
Just come on down to the campus.

00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:24.673
He's real happy to talk to you.

00:17:24.673 --> 00:17:25.780
He's around.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:26.720
He's a great guy.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.540
But anyway, he was into dreaming.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:33.160
Coming out of World War II,
the big rage in psychiatry

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.840
was Freud and psychoanalysis.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.010
He was interested in dreaming.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.120
So he talked about rapid
eye movement sleep,

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:38.953
and he didn't wanna,

00:17:38.953 --> 00:17:41.210
he was a two-finger typist,
so he called it R-E-M,

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:42.291
that's how that happened.

00:17:42.291 --> 00:17:43.810
(audience laughs)

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.672
And then, since he was
interested in dreaming,

00:17:45.672 --> 00:17:49.753
he called everything else non-REM, NREM,

00:17:49.753 --> 00:17:52.420
kind of disrespectful
to the rest of sleep.

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.330
But that's how it turned out.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.200
So we talk about awake,
REM, and non-REM sleep.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.301
And non-REM sleep we divide into

00:17:58.301 --> 00:18:01.860
a light, intermediate,
or deeper state of sleep.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.040
The deep sleep is also
called slow-wave sleep.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.280
People often talk to you
about slow-wave sleep.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.530
And slow-wave sleep used to be divided

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.340
into stages three and four.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:10.870
Stage four got dropped as a term.

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:11.980
That's one of the things
that got cleaned up.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.730
Now we just talk about stage three.

00:18:15.063 --> 00:18:17.670
I wanna describe to you
how we think of sleep

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.000
as light, deep, light and deep sleep.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.210
And talk about REM sleep.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:24.420
But the people you talk to, your patients,

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.600
your patients' families,

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.890
they may use the terms
differently than you.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:29.310
A lot of people equate
deep sleep with dreaming.

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:30.477
That's how they think of it.

00:18:30.477 --> 00:18:33.020
And dreaming sleep is one
thing, and delta sleep,

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.580
or slow-wave sleep, deep
sleep is something different.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:38.757
Slow-wave sleep, deep sleep,
maybe 10% of the night.

00:18:38.757 --> 00:18:41.163
That's when growth
hormone secretion occurs,

00:18:41.163 --> 00:18:42.910
when physical growth occurs.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:45.610
And deep sleep is, delta sleep, excuse me,

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:47.190
is our deepest sleep,
that's when it's hardest

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:49.100
to wake somebody up.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.240
Underwriter's Laboratories
have measured this.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.580
In deep sleep and delta sleep

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:54.600
you cannot wake up a teenager.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.000
They'll sleep through the smoke alarm.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:57.860
You cannot count on them.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.760
So whoever you're taking
care of during your lives,

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.760
if they're in deep sleep, delta sleep,

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.470
you cannot count on them
waking up on their own.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:08.093
Deep sleep dominates the
first third of the night.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.880
And also there are
certain sleep conditions

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.730
that occur at that point,

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.048
most of the parasomnias, things
that go bump in the night,

00:19:15.048 --> 00:19:18.630
the things that we talk about
with young adults and children

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.400
as far as parasomnias, like sleepwalking,

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.730
confusional arousal, sleep terrors,

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:24.557
those things occur in the
first third of the night.

00:19:24.557 --> 00:19:28.220
And parents say they
can kind of measure it.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.660
If you think somebody's
having sleep terrors

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.920
in the last third of the night,

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.550
it's more likely to be a
partial complex seizure

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:36.490
than an actual true parasomnia.

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:38.270
And that's a differential
diagnosis to keep in mind.

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:39.103
And you can have both,

00:19:39.103 --> 00:19:41.800
you can have seizures and sleep
terrors in the same person.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.050
But the timing kind of
predicts how they're gonna be.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.010
So that's slow-wave sleep.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.280
The bulk of sleep is stage two.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.200
The bulk of sleep is stage two.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.330
Now we think stage two has something to do

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.100
with memory consolidation,
memory processing.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.450
So important stuff happening we think

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:58.030
in the formation of memories.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.380
The type of sleep that's often ignored

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.333
in most conversations is stage one.

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:03.860
People don't care about
stage one, it's light sleep.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.292
In fact, a lot of the apps,

00:20:05.292 --> 00:20:07.090
there's a lot of technology companies

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:08.400
that are trying to hack sleep

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.900
to increase your slow-wave sleep,

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.732
make your sleep even deeper.

00:20:11.732 --> 00:20:15.050
Just think of the monetary
value that would occur

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:17.350
if any of these companies
could show up with a device

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.230
or a product or a pill that you could take

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:21.740
that'll tell you, hey, if you take this,

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.210
you're gonna feel like
you slept eight hours,

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:24.600
but you only need to sleep four.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.710
In four hours you're gonna get
eight hours worth of sleep.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:28.880
How many of you would try it?

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.713
Look at you guys.

00:20:29.713 --> 00:20:30.810
How many, raise your hands.

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.685
You, you (mumbles), okay.

00:20:32.685 --> 00:20:33.518
What if they said your
hair would fall out,

00:20:33.518 --> 00:20:35.326
a list of side effects, say I don't care.

00:20:35.326 --> 00:20:36.720
(audience laughs)
Boom, I'll take it.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.553
Whatever it is.

00:20:37.553 --> 00:20:38.386
It's crazy.

00:20:38.386 --> 00:20:39.350
You don't care, sir, right?

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:40.696
Something else could
fall off instead, sir,

00:20:40.696 --> 00:20:41.866
you would still do it, apparently.

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:44.699
(audience laughs)

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:46.600
But that's the thing.

00:20:47.939 --> 00:20:49.390
And the concept behind that is

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.280
the concept of sleep is an inconvenience.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.070
And we want people to think of
sleep not as an inconvenience

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.860
but sleep as a cornerstone of your health.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.150
Nutrition, exercise, and sleep.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:58.771
Sleep is for the brain.

00:20:58.771 --> 00:20:59.800
It's not the kidneys that have to sleep,

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.350
it's not our lungs that sleep.

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:02.970
It's our brain that has to sleep.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:04.220
It's a restorative process.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.560
It's the most dangerous
thing the brain can do,

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.240
actually, is sleep.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.129
So our earliest sleep scientists said

00:21:10.129 --> 00:21:11.690
if sleep has no function,

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:14.480
it's the biggest mistake
evolution ever made.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.729
Let me talk to you about
stage one just a little bit.

00:21:16.729 --> 00:21:19.180
You'll watch around the room, look around,

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.020
you'll see somebody at some point,

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.920
this afternoon after lunch,

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.789
head starts to roll and
nod, eyes (mumbles).

00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:27.850
(audience laughs)

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:29.910
Boom, head drops.

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:30.940
If you nudge that person,

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.047
what's the first thing they say to you?

00:21:32.047 --> 00:21:33.012
"I'm awake."

00:21:33.012 --> 00:21:35.217
(audience laughs)

00:21:35.217 --> 00:21:36.747
"I'm resting my eyes."

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:39.763
That's stage one sleep.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.210
Stage one sleep is characterized
by thinking you're awake

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:44.635
when in fact you're asleep.

00:21:44.635 --> 00:21:45.680
(audience laughs)

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.470
That is a true thing.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:49.583
Stage one sleep is characterized
by thinking you're awake

00:21:49.583 --> 00:21:52.130
when in fact you're asleep.

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.280
Think of the power of that.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.750
You can do anything automatic,
anything overlearned,

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:58.150
in stage one sleep.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.303
You can drive your car in stage one sleep.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:03.270
You can eat in stage one sleep,

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:04.882
you can have sex in stage one.

00:22:04.882 --> 00:22:06.590
You can do all these things.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:08.230
Anything goes in stage one,

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:09.510
as long as it's automatic behavior.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:11.870
And this'll happen a
lot with your patients,

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.220
you talk with them, you
ask them do you take naps?

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.340
And they'll take offense,
no I never take a nap.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.360
Well what do you do after lunch?

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.459
Oh, I rest.

00:22:18.459 --> 00:22:19.780
I watch TV.

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.110
You get a sense of them.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:23.420
But there's no point in arguing,

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.669
just know if somebody's in a light sleep,

00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:26.890
they'll think they're awake.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.300
It's part of the
situation that they're in.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.660
And if somebody's got chronic pain,

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:32.930
if somebody's uncomfortable,

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:34.789
any kind of sleep
disorders you can think of,

00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:37.440
that fragments or make their sleep choppy,

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.740
they go back to stage one,

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.389
and they go back and forth,
stage one to the other stages.

00:22:41.389 --> 00:22:44.900
So they will tell you things
like I have not slept a wink.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.110
And you've seen them sleeping,

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:47.370
but they'll say I have not slept at all.

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:49.370
Because they did not perceive that sleep.

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:50.310
It's unrefreshing to them.

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.000
That's stage one sleep.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.623
REM sleep is kind of
the juicy part of sleep

00:22:55.623 --> 00:22:57.410
that we always think
about, we're dreaming.

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.870
That dominates the last
third of the night.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.810
As the night goes on, your
dreams get longer and longer,

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:03.680
more vivid and more intense.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.980
How many of you have every told somebody

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.440
or heard somebody say to you,
especially at graduation time,

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.800
I want you to follow your dreams.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.240
You hear that all the time.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.230
But what do we do to these kids?

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.230
We cut off their dreaming time.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:15.450
The time of sleep that we're cutting off

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:17.130
is the last chunk of the night.

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:18.490
We're not cutting off their stage two

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:19.323
or their slow-wave sleep,

00:23:19.323 --> 00:23:21.200
we're cutting off their
early-morning hours.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.590
We just all lost some of
our dreams Sunday morning.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:26.040
We lost an hour of sleep.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:26.900
Whose idea was that?

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.313
Don't say Benjamin Franklin,
he didn't put it into law.

00:23:29.313 --> 00:23:32.204
That's crazy, we lost an hour of sleep.

00:23:32.204 --> 00:23:34.963
For daylight savings, this
has actually been measured.

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:38.270
There's a part of the brain
we're gonna discuss in a moment,

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:41.910
circadian systems, that
predict dawn and dusk.

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:43.250
And it's very important to anybody with,

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:45.960
any people born with disabilities

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.320
to keep track of their circadian system

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.313
and make their sleep predictable to them.

00:23:49.313 --> 00:23:52.530
But the brain is trying
to predict dawn and dusk.

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:55.832
So if you normally sleep
eight hours a night,

00:23:55.832 --> 00:23:58.440
and you skip sleep completely,

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.070
whatever reason, you stay up all night,

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:02.640
will you get 16 hours the next day?

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.420
No, your brain won't let you do that.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:07.770
It'll take about a week to
make up that day of no sleep.

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:10.280
And this you know from when
you did (mumbles) overnight.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.270
Every third night was really horrible.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:13.790
Every fifth night was
kind of a piece of cake,

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.041
wasn't so bad, was less painful.

00:24:16.041 --> 00:24:19.200
But it takes about five days to make up

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.747
that full night of no sleep.

00:24:20.747 --> 00:24:22.700
And that fluctuates among people.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.090
But they measure this in teenagers

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:27.083
that that shift in daylight
savings that we just had,

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:33.210
it takes about five days to
make up that hour of sleep.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:34.845
But they actually lose
two and a half hours

00:24:34.845 --> 00:24:37.030
to make up that one hour of sleep.

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:37.880
'Cause they keep waking up too early,

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.010
it takes a little while.

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:40.163
So it's a bad deal.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.660
Dreaming sleep, REM sleep, is when we're,

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:45.890
if you have a sedentary lifestyle,

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:48.230
many of our patients have
sedentary, or many of us,

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:50.330
many of our patients have
sedentary lifestyles.

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:51.590
If you have a sedentary lifestyle,

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.920
your peak heart rate is
when you're dreaming.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.513
The biggest workout your
body gets is dreaming.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.970
That's your peak heart rate, dreaming.

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:04.600
And this is why we think that
people die in their sleep.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.850
Why people get arrhythmias.

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:08.773
Why should somebody get
a heart attack sleeping

00:25:08.773 --> 00:25:10.700
instead of shoveling snow or jogging

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.240
or doing something physically exerting?

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.870
Sleeping is hard.

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:17.010
Sleeping can be very hard on
the body, dreaming especially.

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:18.557
So that's when you get the arrhythmias,

00:25:18.557 --> 00:25:20.640
and that's why it occurs.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.670
If you have people who are
using CPAP for example,

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:24.020
we'll talk about CPAP in a moment,

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:25.380
but the machine, the CPAP,

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.020
patients sometimes think,
well I slept with it

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.180
in the beginning of the night,
and I took it off later.

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.080
I used it enough hours.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.550
They actually take it off
when they need it the most.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.180
Sleep apnea's worse when you're dreaming.

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.849
That's when the muscles are most relaxed.

00:25:35.849 --> 00:25:37.669
So if I have to pick
somebody a time to use it,

00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:39.141
I want you to wake up with it,

00:25:39.141 --> 00:25:42.810
more important than
falling asleep with it.

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:44.679
So we want them to use
it all night if they can.

00:25:44.679 --> 00:25:46.910
But sleep apnea's worse
when you're dreaming.

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:49.410
That's when you have,
again, your biggest workout.

00:25:50.281 --> 00:25:52.231
That's also when nightmares will occur.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:02.463
This is actually my only
real science slide, I think.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.353
This is a coronal section
through a monkey's brain.

00:26:06.353 --> 00:26:08.163
There's the third ventricle.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.453
The optic chiasm.

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:13.450
Our eyes crisscross in
the back of our heads,

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:15.360
I'm sure you all know that.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.670
So in the brain there is
an actual piece of tissue

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:18.720
that measures time.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.930
The biological clock is real,
it's not a hypothetical thing.

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:23.840
And where are you gonna put
a clock in somebody's head,

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.836
if you're gonna think about it,

00:26:24.836 --> 00:26:26.830
where are you gonna stick a
clock in somebody's brain?

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:28.610
We know what time it is based on light.

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:31.453
So the first point in the
body where both eyes meet,

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.850
that's exactly where the clock's located.

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:37.770
The suprachiasmatic
nucleus, the optic chiasm,

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:40.130
suprachiasmatic nucleus,
part of the hypothalamus,

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:42.763
this cluster of neurons
here measures time.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:49.320
And the clock measures time
based on DNA replication,

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:50.373
and there's a cycle.

00:26:50.373 --> 00:26:52.160
And these clock genes actually got

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.780
the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize,

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.587
Nobel Prize in Medicine, excuse me,

00:26:56.587 --> 00:26:57.560
not the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.020
The prize in medicine was
for circadian clock genes.

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:00.853
And this is so important.

00:27:00.853 --> 00:27:02.880
We have the same genes
pretty much in fruit flies

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.950
as there are in humans.

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:06.600
The same molecular system is going on.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.810
But it's something kind
of interesting about this,

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.060
if you think about the
importance of sleep.

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.710
If you look at the retina,

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:14.823
the retina we learned is polysynaptic.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.520
The rods and cones, all
the synapses in there.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:22.176
There's an exception, 1%
of the cells in the retina

00:27:22.176 --> 00:27:25.010
actually have one function only,

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:28.290
to let the clock know
how much light is around.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:29.940
So it's a monosynaptic connection

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:33.620
straight from the retina straight
to the clock, right there.

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:34.970
No other processing needed.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.449
Right there.

00:27:37.449 --> 00:27:38.470
And this is so important to know

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:39.480
whether it's daylight or nighttime,

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.034
'cause some of us are
nocturnal, some are diurnal.

00:27:42.034 --> 00:27:45.940
We live in the Bay Area,
and a lot of our lives

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.210
are dominated by real estate.

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:49.190
If you're a neuron, where
would you like to live?

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:50.420
Right there.

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.700
Best blood supply in the entire brain.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.260
Circle of Willis is right there.

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.380
You can stroke out your ability to speak,

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.940
you can stroke out the use your right arm.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.037
You can't stroke this out

00:28:01.037 --> 00:28:02.850
'cause you have the best blood supply.

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:03.790
What does this mean?

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:06.370
That no matter how impaired
your patient may be,

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:08.180
the ability to reset
their circadian rhythms

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.473
probably remains intact.

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:14.360
Even if they have retinopathy,
depending on the type,

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.390
you may be able to get
some light into them

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:17.590
and reset their rhythms.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.060
There are these circadian sleep disorders.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.770
Delayed sleep phase I mentioned earlier,

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:26.730
but the more common type we see in people

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:31.130
who have disabilities are the
irregular sleep wake cycle.

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:33.100
People with sleep problems
do what's logical,

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.203
do what's reasonable.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.080
The reality is that sleep is a paradox,

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.370
and I have a slide to
mention that earlier,

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:40.080
to remind me to tell you that.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.180
If we didn't have to do
it, we wouldn't do it.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.980
The more logical you are,
the more analytical you are

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:46.770
in your approach to your sleep,

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:48.560
the more likely you are to screw it up.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.750
Because sleeping is counterintuitive.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.620
Logic, if I can't sleep, I should rest.

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:53.790
That's not how it works.

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:57.480
Logic is if I had a bad night
of sleep, I should sleep in.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.810
That's not how it really works.

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:00.820
Because that's thinking of sleep

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:01.697
as only the amount of sleep.

00:29:01.697 --> 00:29:03.140
And I told you those four components,

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.710
amount, quality, timing, state of mind.

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:07.630
We gotta work with all
four of those components

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:10.190
when we try to correct somebody's sleep.

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:12.643
So variable wake up times
is what we're seeing a lot.

00:29:12.643 --> 00:29:14.570
A lot of irregular times.

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:16.939
Especially people who are kind of,

00:29:16.939 --> 00:29:19.320
don't have great social interactions

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.060
or being fed on a continuous system,

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.840
they may have some of these,
missing these social cues.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.290
But we can work with these systems

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:28.020
and get people to sleep better.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.300
The nice thing about sleep
problems, even if we only get

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.580
the patient to sleep a little bit better,

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.840
makes a big difference to the family.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.280
When kids can't sleep, when
an adult has trouble sleeping,

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.050
I've seen this in people with
Alzheimer's, for example,

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:42.820
if that person has trouble
sleeping poorly at night,

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:43.780
that's when they get institutionalized,

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.380
that's when it becomes an issue.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.910
So always take a moment
to ask your patients,

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:52.170
what's your motivation to go to bed,

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.220
what's your motivation to get out of bed?

00:29:55.395 --> 00:29:56.670
What are you doing this for?

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:58.070
Do you wanna go to sleep?

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:00.730
You gotta start thinking
about, you get to go to sleep.

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:02.530
Not that you have to go to
sleep, but you get to do it,

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:04.340
it's actually a really cool thing to do.

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:07.230
If you provide yourself with a nice, safe,

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:09.480
comfortable place to
sleep, you get to do it.

00:30:11.063 --> 00:30:14.854
You can regulate anybody's sleep rhythm

00:30:14.854 --> 00:30:16.883
by regulating these four variables.

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.090
Social interactions,
exercise, light, and food.

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:22.903
You can take a wild rat.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:28.920
A rat is a nocturnal animal,
genetically nocturnal.

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:32.080
By the way, we'll talk
about melatonin later.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.120
Melatonin in our brains elevated at night,

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.380
it means get ready for sleeping.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.800
Rats have elevated melatonin
in their brains at night also.

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.270
Melatonin to them
signals them to get busy.

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:43.170
Night's coming, it's time to get busy.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.310
So melatonin's a signal
that night's approaching.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:50.250
You take a nocturnal animal like a rat,

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:53.760
all its family's nocturnal,
it's meant to be nocturnal.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.900
You take that animal and put it in a cage,

00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:00.660
and pretty much only give it
food when the lights are on,

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:03.840
and when it's dark, you
don't provide any food.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.380
When the lights are on, you
provide it with food again.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:07.820
What will the animal do?

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:09.670
Initially the animal will go hungry.

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:11.210
It's not supposed to be
eating when it's daytime,

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:12.990
it could be attacked, it's scared.

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.610
But eventually that animal will change.

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:18.470
You can make a nocturnal animal
behave like a diurnal animal

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:20.270
by changing the timing of its meals.

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:24.510
Which also teaches us
something for our patients.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:25.450
You know, some of your patients,

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:26.680
you know, you come in,

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.051
how many of you have
seen patients come in,

00:31:28.051 --> 00:31:30.759
you try to talk to your
patients about their tendencies,

00:31:30.759 --> 00:31:32.767
the genetic tendencies, and
the kids look at their parents

00:31:32.767 --> 00:31:33.770
and think that they're screwed

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:36.340
because looking at their
parents, they're like, no.

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:37.660
I tell them all the time,

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:39.230
your tendencies are not your destiny.

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:40.560
Just because your
parents are a certain way

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.840
does not mean you have
to be that way, right?

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.500
You can be different.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.443
Your tendencies are not your destiny.

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:49.971
So you can change a pattern
of behavior of an animal.

00:31:49.971 --> 00:31:51.430
Somebody says, I'm just a night owl,

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:52.870
and then the parents,
oh, I'm a night owl, too,

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:53.830
and his dad's a night owl,

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:55.010
so that's just the way it's gonna be

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:58.380
and he can't go to school,
he has to be home-schooled.

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.130
That's not really true, right?

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:01.350
It's just a little bit harder for you

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:02.740
to become a day person.

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.340
So you can regulate timing of meal.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:05.891
A lot of young people,

00:32:05.891 --> 00:32:08.650
a teenager will tell
you they're going to bed

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:11.040
at, say, two o'clock in
the morning or something.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:14.100
I assure you their last
meal is not at 6:00 p.m.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.340
They're eating very late into the night.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:17.530
You can say, hey, you
wanna stay up all you like,

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:19.560
but there's no food after seven,

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.351
there's food in the morning,
you're gonna start waking up.

00:32:22.351 --> 00:32:24.660
You're gonna start getting up to go.

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:25.740
You need a reason to do this.

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.641
So social interactions,
exercise, light, and food.

00:32:28.641 --> 00:32:30.490
We can talk about melatonin

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:32.580
and how to provide melatonin to children.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.310
The melatonin receptors
are turned off by light.

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:36.900
So if you have blasting
light in somebody's face,

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.350
you can be eating pounds of melatonin

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:39.790
and it won't really do much for you.

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:41.610
Because the receptors aren't expecting it.

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:42.520
It's not there for it.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.077
So it has to do with timing of light also.

00:32:45.077 --> 00:32:48.110
You wanna give people light
first thing in the morning.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:49.570
So I talked to you about
motivation earlier,

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:51.372
and I talked to you about light just now.

00:32:51.372 --> 00:32:53.261
One of the things that I'll do
sometimes with younger people

00:32:53.261 --> 00:32:56.730
is, they wanna do video
games and stuff like that.

00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:58.060
I say, why don't you do video games

00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.857
first thing in the morning?

00:32:59.857 --> 00:33:00.690
They say I don't have enough time.

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:02.417
I say you do if you get up earlier.

00:33:02.417 --> 00:33:04.150
You can get up earlier.

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:05.390
One of the things I like
with all my patients,

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:07.110
my adult patients especially,

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:09.140
a very frequent question
I'll ask an adult patient

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.900
is what do you do for fun?

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:11.990
They're usually surprised
by that question.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.050
I don't know if you ask that routinely,

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:14.890
that's a routine question
for me to ask a patient.

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:16.470
What do you do for fun?

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:18.110
Patients will brighten up and
tell you all kinds of things.

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:22.830
I had a lady that was depressed
and her husband had died.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:24.200
She'd had a stroke,

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.650
and now she was staying at
one of her siblings' house.

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:29.250
And they all go to bed at eight o'clock

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:30.320
because they get up early to work,

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.510
so she has to go to her room early.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:35.571
And I said, what do you do for fun?

00:33:35.571 --> 00:33:39.260
She goes, well when I was
younger, before I had my stroke,

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.680
she used to work in a tomato cannery,

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.390
tomato cannery, and she
had the night shift,

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:44.560
she used to work through the
night in the tomato cannery.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.860
And she used to sing during her shift.

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:47.990
And now she can't sing

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:49.440
because it's gonna disturb the family.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.180
So we had this lady start
singing mariachi music

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:53.330
in the clinic full blast,

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:54.600
it was kind of wonderful to hear her

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.210
just brighten up and change.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:57.760
But you'll be surprised
when you ask a patient,

00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.270
what do you do for fun?

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:01.040
Once you get a sense of
what they do for fun,

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.440
if a patient says I do nothing for fun,

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.853
then you gotta think about
depression and things like that.

00:34:03.853 --> 00:34:07.020
Because of course,
depression often travels

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.082
with sleep problems.

00:34:08.082 --> 00:34:10.920
It's unusual to find somebody
who's truly depressed

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.360
who does not have sleep problems.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.869
But if you ask somebody,
what do you do for fun,

00:34:13.869 --> 00:34:16.240
then I ask them whatever
it is they say they do,

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.980
can you do it first thing in the morning?

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:19.810
I wanna play guitar, I wanna work on this,

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:20.719
whatever they say.

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:22.230
Do it first thing in the morning.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:23.450
And if you don't do it in the morning,

00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:25.110
you can't do it till the next day.

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:28.440
I want you to have a reason
to get up, a motivation.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.349
All of you, when you work up this morning,

00:34:30.349 --> 00:34:32.700
couldn't you have stayed
in bed a little bit longer?

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:35.140
Why did you get up when
you got out of bed?

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:36.360
Because you had to.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.300
In your head you had to come here today.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.470
Thank you for coming today.

00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:42.470
But you always in your own
head is, I had to, right?

00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:43.690
Waking up is one thing, getting out of bed

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:44.580
is something different.

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.230
Waking up is biological.

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:47.440
Getting out of bed is volitional.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.831
You don't really have to
get out of bed, right?

00:34:49.831 --> 00:34:52.200
But you should.
(audience laughs)

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.000
But waking up is one
thing, getting out of bed

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.610
is something different.

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:57.460
So if you control these four variables,

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.351
you can get anybody to
change their schedule.

00:34:59.351 --> 00:35:01.960
Also when sometimes your
stuck getting a history,

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.000
trying to figure out what to do,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.160
if you remember this mnemonic, SELF,

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.150
you can use it to get your history.

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:08.550
Go through these four variables,

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:10.620
social interactions,
exercise, light, and food.

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:13.991
And the reason I use SELF is
because you can self-correct.

00:35:13.991 --> 00:35:16.640
You can empower the
teenager, the young adult,

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.270
whoever's having these sleep issues.

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:20.543
So you can fix this,
this is a fixable thing.

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:23.720
So think about these four
things when you talk with them.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.070
Social interactions,
exercise, light, and food.

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:29.960
Let's talk about hypnotics,
we got 10 minutes left.

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.233
I'm sure we can cover
hypnotics in 10 minutes.

00:35:33.628 --> 00:35:37.283
This is a recent paper,
Oliviero Bruni from Italy,

00:35:38.168 --> 00:35:40.200
so you guys can pull this.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.980
Some of you probably
subscribe to this journal,

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:44.170
but you can grab it, it's a recent paper.

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:49.170
And it looked at the sea of
things we can try for insomnia.

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:51.920
First off, there's nothing
approved in the US or Europe

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.940
to treat insomnia in children.

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.080
Anything you do is obviously
gonna be off-label.

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:57.380
First time treatment is behavioral,

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:58.840
and that's a lot of what I do.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.690
When I first started,
we did a lot of meds.

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:03.163
Now almost everything we
do is behavioral first.

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.940
And how you do it is a separate question.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:09.730
The most widely prescribed
substances are antihistamines.

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:10.930
Most widely recommended things,

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:13.520
but not a lot of evidence that they work.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:14.510
It's unusual these days

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:16.050
to have anybody show up at your clinic

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:18.450
who's not tried melatonin
before they came to see you,

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:20.850
because it's over-the-counter,
it's widely used,

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:24.150
and how they use it and the
timing of it is interesting.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:27.120
But it's thought to be a
safe choice for most people.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:30.830
There's data with children with
autistic spectrum disorder,

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:32.550
pretty much any disability
you can think of,

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:34.100
childhood disability you can think of,

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.783
may have tried melatonin at some level.

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.610
And it works for some people.

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:43.010
Also, by the way, sleep is super sensitive

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:44.560
to placebo effect.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:45.874
I'm not saying these are placebo effect.

00:36:45.874 --> 00:36:49.250
Sleep is super sensitive
to placebo effect.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:51.823
Because your state of mind
influences how you sleep.

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:53.523
And you can prove this.

00:36:53.523 --> 00:36:55.820
Open up any PDR and look
at the package insert

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:56.983
of any sleep aid.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:58.753
And you're gonna see

00:36:58.753 --> 00:37:00.360
that when they did the randomized trials,

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.460
the placebo group always has listed

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:04.110
a certain percentage of hangover.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.840
Why does somebody get a
hangover on a placebo?

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.530
Because they think they
got the active agent,

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:11.760
they slept longer than before,

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.600
and now they've waken up fuzzy
'cause they've overslept.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:18.480
So sleep is super sensitive
to the placebo effects.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.730
And that's also why things
stop working after a while.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:24.927
Benzodiazepines, they
don't recommend using them.

00:37:24.927 --> 00:37:26.990
These are the older benzodiazepines

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:28.700
that you're familiar with.

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:30.555
I have a second slide on this.

00:37:30.555 --> 00:37:33.290
A few studies on zolpidem,
zaleplon, eszopiclone.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:35.040
I lean more to using these medications

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.210
'cause I have more experience
with them with adults,

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:39.570
so I use them a lot with kids
if I'm gonna use anything.

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:40.520
Clonidine, often talked about,

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.950
many of you will use
clonidine in your patients.

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:45.390
It's popular in child psychiatry circles.

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:47.040
You may inherit patients with it.

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.910
But again, not a ton of data with it.

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:54.440
They did not like tricyclic
antidepressants in this one.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:57.124
The tricyclic antidepressant
that I will sometimes use

00:37:57.124 --> 00:38:02.124
with success is doxepin,
that's the generic name.

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:05.830
It has a brand name which we won't say

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:07.940
at a lower dose you can try,

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:09.640
and I've done that with some kids.

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.837
And you can also get the
generic, it comes in 10s,

00:38:11.837 --> 00:38:14.510
you can chop it in half
and get a five out of it.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:15.370
You can do that.

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:16.870
But they don't recommend using it.

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:18.953
Trazodone and mirtazapine,
which has another brand name

00:38:18.953 --> 00:38:22.270
many of you guys know,
require more studies.

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:23.207
But that's just from this study here.

00:38:23.207 --> 00:38:24.970
And I can discuss these
in more detail with you,

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:27.510
but let's give you an overview of these.

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:30.240
But the real issue is not
the pill, it's the insomnia.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.340
That's the issue here.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:35.060
Parents say what are
you gonna give my kid?

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:37.082
Oh, why do I need to give him anything?

00:38:37.082 --> 00:38:39.040
Why can't the kid sleep?

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.350
Is it the kid can't sleep,
or the kid can't sleep

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:41.830
when you want the kid to sleep?

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:42.700
What are we talking about?

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:43.897
What is the situation here?

00:38:43.897 --> 00:38:45.690
What's the timing here?

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:47.720
The thought of sleeping
will wake people up.

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.730
That's when you know
somebody's become habituated

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:51.330
to having insomnia.

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:53.213
If somebody says to you that
they're drowsy, they're sleepy,

00:38:53.213 --> 00:38:55.450
they're in the living
room, they're watching TV,

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:56.760
and they're fighting sleep,

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:59.370
they get to the bedroom
and suddenly wide awake.

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:00.980
The thought of sleeping is waking them up.

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:04.160
You become habituated to being awake.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.560
You can only voluntarily
keep yourself awake,

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:09.110
you can't voluntarily force
yourself to fall sleep.

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.920
If I were to look at anybody's
respiratory rate here,

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:13.753
and say somebody's breathing at,

00:39:13.753 --> 00:39:15.680
let's say 12 breaths a minute,

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.590
if I say take 12 breaths
in a minute, I'll time you,

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:18.740
you'd screw it up.

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:19.800
You can't do it.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.240
It's an automatic thing.

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:22.210
Once you try to do it,

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:23.847
you can voluntarily keep yourself awake,

00:39:23.847 --> 00:39:26.570
but you can't voluntarily
force yourself to fall asleep.

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:27.930
It doesn't work that way.

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:29.210
On top of this, what's often overlooked

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:30.830
are the circadian principles.

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:31.990
Peak alertness for humans,

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:33.460
and this applies to children and adults,

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.380
is about two hours before you fall asleep.

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.660
You're most awake before you fall asleep.

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:39.650
You have to be.

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:41.620
If sleeping is really the most
dangerous thing we can do,

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:45.220
and if you think of
sleep in that framework,

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:46.780
that sleeping is inherently dangerous,

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.570
you must be able to protect
yourself while you're sleeping.

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:51.600
Think of it that way.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.720
Then it makes sense that, biologically,

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:56.263
we have a surge of alertness
before we fall asleep.

00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:58.840
You'll notice yourself,

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:01.190
if sleep was just a linear
thing like gasoline,

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:03.540
you'd be most awake first
thing in the morning.

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:04.430
But you're not.

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:06.350
You're grabbing coffee.

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:08.180
You have more alertness mid-morning,

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.600
you have a drop in
alertness in the afternoon,

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:12.342
and then without catching any nap at all,

00:40:12.342 --> 00:40:14.940
you feel more awake in the evening.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:17.130
When you feel that slump this afternoon,

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:18.560
you're gonna blame it on your lunch.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.240
But oddly, breakfast
doesn't make you sleepy,

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.073
and neither does dinner.

00:40:21.073 --> 00:40:22.430
Why does lunch make you sleepy?

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:23.680
It's not the food.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:24.980
It's the time of the day.

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.470
Our predators are less likely to attack us

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:28.180
when the day's at its hottest.

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.370
So we get that surge
of alertness at night.

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:32.810
That's why it's so hard
to go to bed early.

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:34.410
If you had to think about
what's easier for you,

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:36.143
for most of us it's
easier to push away sleep

00:40:36.143 --> 00:40:38.090
than to advance sleep.

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:39.650
So you wanna regulate somebody's sleep

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:41.090
and help somebody sleep better,

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:44.150
any of your patients
you're taking care of,

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:45.670
ask the patient, ask the family,

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:47.470
what sleep schedule
would you like to have?

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:48.730
Whatever numbers they
pick, they say things,

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:51.170
I want to go to bed at 10, get up at six.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:53.260
Okay, from now on, you
get half your wish today.

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:55.300
You get up at six no matter what today.

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:57.200
But you're gonna go to bed a midnight.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.660
I can't stay up that late.

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:00.690
Yes you can, you have insomnia,
you can stay up later.

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:01.830
You have to remind them, okay?

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:03.391
(audience laughs)

00:41:03.391 --> 00:41:06.020
Remind them they have insomnia, okay?

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.120
But what you're gonna do by that is

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.647
it's gonna crunch their sleep.

00:41:08.647 --> 00:41:11.280
You're gonna make their
sleep more efficient.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.113
And that's what we talk about.

00:41:12.113 --> 00:41:14.630
Sleep efficiency to us
refers to time of sleep

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:16.250
divided by the time in bed.

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:17.610
You wanna be efficient in your sleep.

00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:19.950
Little kids are 90% or so efficient.

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:21.380
Actually, something I
should've mentioned here,

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:23.950
and I wanna go backwards just briefly

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:25.670
in my time that I have left.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:27.160
There's something missing in this slide.

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.938
I gotta fix this slide a little more.

00:41:28.938 --> 00:41:31.940
Nobody sleeps eight hours in a row.

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:33.300
You never have and you never will.

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:35.250
Human sleep cycle's about 90 minutes.

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:36.860
Newborn's about 60 minutes.

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.820
About every hour, all
humans open their eyes,

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:41.390
make sure everything's
okay, and go back to sleep.

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:43.470
All of us wake up at night.

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:44.800
You have to.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.330
If you didn't wake up, you'd
be easy pickings for predators.

00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:48.410
Lions and tigers would pick us off

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:49.660
at three o'clock in the morning.

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:50.760
Waking up is normal.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.000
We have to wake up.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.392
Watch anybody sleep.

00:41:53.392 --> 00:41:55.930
By the way, you've got a
great sleep center here.

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:58.330
My wife is a sleep doctor
at UCSF, Dr. Kin Yuen,

00:41:58.330 --> 00:41:59.460
she works with Dr. David Claman,

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:01.380
I'll put in that plug, that's
allowed under the rules?

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:02.213
Thank you.

00:42:02.213 --> 00:42:04.120
And you also have Dr. Gwynne Church

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.920
who's fantastic and trained
with us at Stanford.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.740
So you've got some really
good people up here.

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:09.070
But if you visit their sleep lab,

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:11.290
I'm sure you're welcome
to visit the sleep lab,

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:12.810
you'll see that nobody
sleeps through the night.

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:13.643
Look at the tracings.

00:42:13.643 --> 00:42:14.990
People wake up all the time.

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:16.040
We have to.

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.180
And about 10 times per hour

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:18.820
we get little bursts of brain waves

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:20.630
that feel like we're awake,
that look like we're awake,

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:22.300
little about three second
bursts of brain waves.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:23.687
It's just not long enough
for you to remember it

00:42:23.687 --> 00:42:24.940
and be aware of it.

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.670
But we all wake up during the night.

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:27.882
We have to.

00:42:27.882 --> 00:42:30.721
And this explains sometimes
how people are behaving

00:42:30.721 --> 00:42:31.813
in their sleep.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.540
So back to this issue of the hypnotics.

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.090
This is a little bit skewed on here,

00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:44.163
but there was a recent
study came out of Canada,

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:48.070
and it looked at the quality
of over-the-counter melatonin.

00:42:48.923 --> 00:42:52.610
In many countries, melatonin
is a prescription item.

00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:56.160
I think in Australia and Europe
it's a prescription item.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.710
But in Canada and in the
US, it's over-the-counter.

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:01.670
And what I learned was,

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:03.150
if you try to sell
something over the counter,

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:04.440
you wanna give it a long shelf life.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.710
'Cause when you look at the bottles,

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:07.610
you wanna know what are you gonna get.

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.620
They reviewed the quality of
the melatonin over the counter

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:14.030
and they found what was
labeled on the bottle

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:17.390
and what was inside the bottle
fluctuated by over 400%.

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:18.820
Over 400% fluctuation.

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:22.873
Even within the same brand
it was fluctuating over 400%.

00:43:22.873 --> 00:43:25.180
And about 25% of the
samples had serotonin,

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:27.900
because melatonin breaks
down into serotonin.

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:29.890
So you may be giving some
of your patients (mumbles)

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:30.723
and also giving them melatonin,

00:43:30.723 --> 00:43:32.940
you may be giving them an
extra boost of serotonin.

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:34.070
Just know that,

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:37.180
that the quality of
over-the-counter melatonin

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:38.490
is not that good.

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:40.430
So in Canada, the pediatrics people there

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:45.050
are actually importing
the melatonin from Europe,

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:46.660
and they're talking about
regulating melatonin.

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:49.463
So they may create a black
market in Canada, maybe,

00:43:49.463 --> 00:43:51.090
where they're gonna start importing

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:53.570
or sneaking across the
border US melatonin,

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:54.840
because it's gonna be
controlled over there.

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.570
So there's gonna be a flip side to this.

00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:59.590
But just keep and eye and know
what happens with melatonin.

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:01.090
There are some brands of melatonin

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:03.440
that seem to have better quality control,

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.390
at least they market themselves that way.

00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:10.040
In this survey, the melatonin types

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.670
that had the worst variability,

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:13.130
they were all bad in this study,

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:15.600
the worst ones were the ones
that came in as a gummi.

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:18.390
Anything that was in a gummi
type was very unpredictable

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:19.223
how it would work.

00:44:19.223 --> 00:44:21.330
And we tend to like these
gummi stuff in kids, right?

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:22.898
I like taking a gummi vitamin myself.

00:44:22.898 --> 00:44:26.900
And if it also was marketed
as having a combination.

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.700
Sometimes you'll see
melatonin with some valerian

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.220
or some chamomile or
some hops or magnesium.

00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:33.700
The things that were in combination,

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:36.360
they tended to be also widely fluctuating

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:37.230
what was on the bottle

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:39.130
versus what was actually on the label.

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:42.013
So don't lose sleep over that, ha ha.

00:44:42.013 --> 00:44:44.344
(chuckles)

00:44:44.344 --> 00:44:45.210
Another thing I like to tell people is

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:47.620
don't equate sedation with normal sleep.

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:48.950
We can sedate kids a lot.

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:50.050
We can give kids alcohol.

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:51.640
You can get black out drunk.

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:55.030
Do you have a good night
of sleep the next day,

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:56.070
do you wake up feeling good the next day?

00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:56.910
No.

00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:58.140
Just because you're sedating somebody

00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:59.670
does not mean you gave
them a good night's sleep.

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:00.920
A lot of things that
we're doing to our kids

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:01.880
is sedating them.

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.320
So keep that in mind.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:04.153
We're running out of time.

00:45:04.153 --> 00:45:05.300
I wanna make one last point to you

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.260
about this paradoxical reaction.

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:09.370
If we have a surge of alertness at night,

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:10.760
you have a child with disabilities,

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.610
and you give them something
that sedates them,

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:14.140
what's gonna happen is
you're gonna dissociate,

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:15.870
you're gonna start having
intrusion of awake behavior

00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:17.080
into sleep behavior.

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:18.860
And when this happens,
the kids will freak out,

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.550
they'll start hallucinating.

00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:21.980
So sometimes this paradoxical reaction

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:24.690
is simply the wrong dose of
medication at too high a dose.

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:25.690
I've got 18 seconds.

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:28.270
Oh, I've got two minutes, good.

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:29.864
The timer says 14 seconds.

00:45:29.864 --> 00:45:31.730
So let me make a point here.

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:33.930
When you prescribe something to a child,

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:35.500
or an adult with a disability,

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:37.140
you cannot assume the
parents are gonna give them

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.253
what you gave them, what you prescribed.

00:45:39.253 --> 00:45:42.400
Parents are gonna wonder, oh
this thing might be too strong.

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.320
Parents are gonna feel guilty

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.000
about giving the kids
medication for their sleep.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.300
So they'll underdose them.

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:50.010
They'll give them half the
pill to see what happens.

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:51.480
And they wanna give it early
'cause they don't want the kid

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:52.910
to have a hangover the next day.

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:54.480
So now you're underdosing somebody

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.473
and giving the pill too early.

00:45:55.473 --> 00:45:57.193
When the brain expects to be awake,

00:45:57.193 --> 00:45:58.810
your underdosing disinhibited them,

00:45:58.810 --> 00:45:59.760
they'll start to hallucinate.

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.480
They'll have intrusion of things.

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.750
If I have one cocktail,
I think I'm charming.

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:05.400
If I have five cocktails, I'm asleep.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.390
So that's what happening, right?

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:08.930
You disinhibit these people,
and they start to freak out.

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:11.010
So these paradoxical reactions
that you may document

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:14.430
or be aware of, go carefully
over what they actually did.

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:15.880
You may find the parents gave

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:17.930
less than the recommended amount,

00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:19.890
and also gave it earlier than expected to.

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:21.830
If you wanna prescribe for real,

00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:23.160
make them go to bed later,

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:24.380
that way you have the homeostatic drive

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:25.213
working in your favor.

00:46:25.213 --> 00:46:27.580
Go to bed later, and go up on the dose.

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:30.340
The kids have healthy
livers for the most part.

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:32.600
They metabolize the medication faster.

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.010
So you can actually go higher on the dose

00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:36.120
if you're gonna bother at all.

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:37.640
If you're gonna prescribe at all,

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.480
go higher than you expect to.

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:40.313
Don't go low,

00:46:40.313 --> 00:46:42.000
you're gonna have these weird
reactions in these kids.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.020
I saw many times when I was
a child neurology resident,

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:46.140
they would give us chlorohydrates

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:47.420
to sedate the kids for procedures,

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:49.560
and the kids would flip out
because we underdosed them

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:50.773
at the wrong time.

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:56.910
Just a couple of things on sleep apnea.

00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:58.520
Sleep apnea is a real thing.

00:46:58.520 --> 00:46:59.540
You're gonna see it all over the place.

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:01.230
The thing to watch for
in our group of kids,

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:02.920
and our adults especially,

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.110
you don't have to be
overweight to have sleep apnea,

00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:06.950
but what you are gonna
have is a high-arch palate.

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:09.410
Look in their mouths and
see if the roof of the mouth

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:11.430
is narrower than the
width of their tongue.

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:12.370
If they stick out their tongue

00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:13.780
and you can see little
crescent marks of the teeth

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.680
along the edges, they
probably have sleep apnea.

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:19.130
The tongue is gonna be
too wide in their mouths.

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:21.247
Down Syndrome is an obvious
example of that (mumbles).

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:23.905
So you see this high roof of the mouth.

00:47:23.905 --> 00:47:24.867
Because kids when they don't sleep well

00:47:24.867 --> 00:47:26.713
have trouble behaving,

00:47:27.684 --> 00:47:29.130
the first thing that happens
when you don't get enough sleep

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:31.390
is you have trouble paying attention.

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:33.340
In the DSM IV, I know we're
not in the DSM IV anymore,

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:35.030
but this was the book
that some of you are using

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:36.481
as doorstops in your office now.

00:47:36.481 --> 00:47:38.072
(audience laughs)
Okay?

00:47:38.072 --> 00:47:40.630
That book says specifically
for attention deficit disorder

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:43.550
that they had physical features
such as high-arched palates.

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:47.450
Which I'm telling you is a
physical finding for sleep apnea.

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:49.850
So there's not doubt that
there's some people out there,

00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:50.820
probably college students now,

00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:53.820
were diagnosed as ADD as kids,
actually had sleep disorders.

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:57.080
By the way, CPAP has never been better.

00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:00.640
When we look back on our field,

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.233
we're gonna see this as
the golden era of CPAP.

00:48:02.233 --> 00:48:04.040
It's just never been
better than it is now.

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.500
The machines are quieter,
smaller, lighter.

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.140
They have pocket-sized CPAP machines now.

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:10.660
Pocket-sized CPAP machines are available.

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:12.230
It's gotten a lot, lot better.

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:14.540
Just because somebody
couldn't use it before

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:15.650
doesn't mean you should try it now,

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:17.500
'cause it's just gotten a lot better.

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:19.969
This is my last point I
was gonna make to you.

00:48:19.969 --> 00:48:21.050
These are our conclusions.

00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:22.872
Thank you so much for listening, guys.

00:48:22.872 --> 00:48:25.955
(audience applauds)
