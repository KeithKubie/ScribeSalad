00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:19.010
experience now it sounds outlandish
 

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.140

unless you've had that psychedelic

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:21.150
unless you've had that psychedelic
 

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.840
unless you've had that psychedelic
experience and when you have you very

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:23.850
experience and when you have you very
 

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.310

and this is something that may very well
 

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.910
and this is something that may very well
have been lost information or this may

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:34.920
have been lost information or this may
 

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.830
have been lost information or this may
very well have been rituals that people

very well have been rituals that people
 

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.180
very well have been rituals that people

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:38.190
participated in to bring them closer
 

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.070
participated in to bring them closer
together and to reinforce that sense of

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:41.490
community that you do get from a church
 

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:43.730
community that you do get from a church
and you do get from a group of people

and you do get from a group of people
 

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.620
and you do get from a group of people
that share more beliefs and values and

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:45.630
that share more beliefs and values and
 

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.230
that share more beliefs and values and
there's a there's real good discussion

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240
there's a there's real good discussion
 

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.510
there's a there's real good discussion
that a lot of these experiences that

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:50.520
that a lot of these experiences that
 

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.580
that a lot of these experiences that
became these religious doctrines came

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:52.590
became these religious doctrines came
 

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.650
became these religious doctrines came
from psychedelic experiences now as

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:54.660
from psychedelic experiences now as
 

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.120
from psychedelic experiences now as

someone who's never experienced that
 

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:57.920
someone who's never experienced that
before I know this is probably a very

strange thing to try to even wrap your

strange thing to try to even wrap your
 

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.900
strange thing to try to even wrap your
head around it's it is entirely alien

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:02.910
head around it's it is entirely alien
 

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:05.270

who've used those kind you see I'm
 

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:12.560
who've used those kind you see I'm
actually made this argument to me too

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:12.570
actually made this argument to me too
 

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.720
actually made this argument to me too
about you know he's a psychedelic and

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:14.730
about you know he's a psychedelic and
 

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:18.350
about you know he's a psychedelic and
any maybe he dodged again I apples well

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360
any maybe he dodged again I apples well
 

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:18.560
any maybe he dodged again I apples well
it

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:18.570
it
 

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.690
it
okay so it's our command I will say I'm

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:20.700
okay so it's our command I will say I'm
 

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.250
okay so it's our command I will say I'm
not super fond of the argument that God

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:22.260
not super fond of the argument that God
 

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.470
not super fond of the argument that God
made something and therefore it's ours

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480
made something and therefore it's ours
 

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.200
made something and therefore it's ours
to use or I mean like I keep kosher

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:27.210
to use or I mean like I keep kosher
 

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.000
to use or I mean like I keep kosher
right look what I've made pigs I don't

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:29.010
right look what I've made pigs I don't
 

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:32.090
right look what I've made pigs I don't
need them so so I am NOT a huge fan of

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:32.100
need them so so I am NOT a huge fan of
 

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.160
need them so so I am NOT a huge fan of
the argument that because something is

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:34.170
the argument that because something is
 

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.800
the argument that because something is
here or because in urge is natural

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:36.810
here or because in urge is natural
 

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:38.990
here or because in urge is natural
therefore we ought to imbibe or

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000
therefore we ought to imbibe or
 

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.460
therefore we ought to imbibe or
therefore we ought to participate in a

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:40.470
therefore we ought to participate in a

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:42.330
particular activity you know one of the

things mm-hmm so which is why you

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:57.090
things mm-hmm so which is why you
 

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:58.640
things mm-hmm so which is why you
shouldn't overuse drugs even if you're

00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:58.650
shouldn't overuse drugs even if you're
 

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:00.140
shouldn't overuse drugs even if you're
going to use drugs first this is prior

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:00.150
going to use drugs first this is prior
 

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.670

to the problem of making things illegal

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680
to the problem of making things illegal
 

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.380
to the problem of making things illegal
you make things illegal then you really

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:03.390
you make things illegal then you really
 

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.500
you make things illegal then you really
don't know what it is or how it affects

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:06.510
don't know what it is or how it affects
 

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.990
don't know what it is or how it affects
the body or what's the right dose or the

the body or what's the right dose or the
 

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.480
the body or what's the right dose or the
wrong dose and then people get involved

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:11.490
wrong dose and then people get involved
 

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:12.920
wrong dose and then people get involved
in these terrible situations where

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:12.930
in these terrible situations where
 

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:13.970
in these terrible situations where
they're taking things they're just

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:13.980
they're taking things they're just
 

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:15.530
they're taking things they're just
guessing I mean there's truth but it's

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:15.540
guessing I mean there's truth but it's
 

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.060
guessing I mean there's truth but it's
also true that on a social level I'm not

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:17.070
also true that on a social level I'm not
 

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:18.320
also true that on a social level I'm not
talking about legal because we totally

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:18.330
talking about legal because we totally
 

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:19.910
talking about legal because we totally
agree on the legal level on the social

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920
agree on the legal level on the social
 

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.040
agree on the legal level on the social
level there's a couple of things that

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:22.050
level there's a couple of things that
 

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.960
level there's a couple of things that
are true of for example the Orthodox

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:23.970
are true of for example the Orthodox
 

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.910
are true of for example the Orthodox
Jewish community low rates of addiction

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920
Jewish community low rates of addiction
 

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.190
Jewish community low rates of addiction
because people have that social fabric

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:28.200
because people have that social fabric
 

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.250
because people have that social fabric
they don't feel the necessity also yeah

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:31.260
they don't feel the necessity also yeah
 

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.140
they don't feel the necessity also yeah
as you say substance use in moderation

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:33.150
as you say substance use in moderation
 

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:34.850
as you say substance use in moderation
can actually be quite a good thing so

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:34.860
can actually be quite a good thing so
 

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.230
can actually be quite a good thing so
low rates of alcoholism in the Jewish

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240
low rates of alcoholism in the Jewish
 

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.640
low rates of alcoholism in the Jewish
community and part of that is the fact

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:37.650
community and part of that is the fact
 

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:39.050
community and part of that is the fact
that you are given kiddush wine from the

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:39.060
that you are given kiddush wine from the
 

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.040
that you are given kiddush wine from the
time you're a kid right I mean you

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:40.050
time you're a kid right I mean you
 

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:42.020
time you're a kid right I mean you
actually our arty stigma car

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:42.030
actually our arty stigma car
 

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:43.700
actually our arty stigma car
yeah it's D stigmatized and the idea is

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:43.710
yeah it's D stigmatized and the idea is
 

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.950
yeah it's D stigmatized and the idea is
that in its proper context this could be

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:45.960
