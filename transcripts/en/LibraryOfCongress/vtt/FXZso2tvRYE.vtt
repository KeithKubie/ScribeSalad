&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Good
afternoon everyone.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.790
I think we'll go ahead
and get started.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.450
Some of our colleagues will
join us as they can get off duty

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.650
and lunch hours, things like that.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.530
On behalf of my colleagues and in
particular, Dr. Mary-Jane Deeb,

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.180
Chief of the African and
Middle East Division,

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.880
I'd like to welcome everyone to
this very special lecture today.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.990
I'm Joan Weeks, head of the Near
East Section, which is the sponsor

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.670 position:56%
of today's program along with Roshan
Institute for Persian Studies.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.190
We're very pleased to continue the
Persian Book Lecture Series this

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.680
year with the 2016 focus on
literature and the performing arts.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.130
With this program,
"Persophilia Persian Culture

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.680
on the Global Scene".

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.400
But before we start today's
program and introduce the speaker,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.240
I'd like to give you a brief
overview of our division

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.110
and the resources in the hopes
that you'll come back again

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.600
and do your research
here, use our collections

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.330
and enjoy some future programs.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.130
This is a custodial division which
has three sections that build

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.340
and serve the collections from two
researchers from around the world.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.010
We cover over 75 countries
and two dozen languages.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.700
The Africa section includes all
the countries of sub-Sahara Africa.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.920
The Hebraic section covers
Hebraic and Judaic a worldwide.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.830 position:56%
And the Near East section covers all

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.710
of the Arab countries including
North Africa, Turkey, Central Asia,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.220
Iran, Afghanistan, the Muslims in
Western China, Russia, the Vulcans

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.840
and the people of the Caucuses.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.170
So, it's a very extensive
area coverage.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.880
After this program,
we'd like to invite you

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.400
to fill-in the evaluation forms
that you see on your seat.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.860
This helps us plan
for future programs.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.730
And we'd also like to invite you to
tryout our new Four Corners Blog.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.500
Our specialists have written very
interesting, special editions

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.140
of items focused on a particular
aspect of the collections.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.140
This is contained with posts from
the Hispanic, Asian, the European

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.770
and our own African and
Middle East division.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.030
We also have a Facebook page.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.430
And, we'd like to invite
you to like us on Facebook.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.720
We also promote our programs
through that so you can always keep

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.570
in touch with what's coming up.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.710
And we will also be
videotaping this program today.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.150
So, two things about that, if
you ask a question at the end,

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.320
you're implicitly giving your
permission to be taped, videotaped,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.880
and also, you'll be able
to have this program

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.040
about six weeks from now.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.350
We will be uploading it on our
website and the URL feed available

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.180
to researchers worldwide.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.630
So, that's another added advantage.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.130
So, without further ado, I'd
like to invite Hirad Dinavari,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.370
our Persian specialist
to give a few words.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.720
Thank you.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.020
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Thank you Joan.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.050
And thank everyone for coming
day after the election.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.030
I wanted to just in two seconds
say that this is the finale

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.900
for the Persian Book Lecture
Series for this year, 2016.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.830
Our partner, Dr. Fatemeh
Keshavarz is here

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.880
and we've been doing this
now from 2013 onwards.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.640
Our lectures again, pick
up next year in 2017

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.850 position:56%

possible without the help and effort

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.120

of Maryland, Summer, Susan,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.130
prior to that Noz and of course Dr.
Keshavarz and Dr. Ahmet Karmaustafa

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.840
and of course Matt himself.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.390
So, without taking too much time,
I just want to mention stay tuned

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.070 position:56%
in 2017 we'll continue and thank you
so much for your support and coming.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.370
And now, I'm going to introduce
Keshavarz from the University

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:28.140
of Maryland who will
introduce the speaker.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.440
Thank you.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.980
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: Thank Hirad,
I'm not going to take a whole lot

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.430
of time so that you can
actually hear the speaker.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:42.700
Dr. Dabashi was here when we had
our major exhibit that brought,

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.940
you know, 1,000 years of the
Persian Book that brought

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.480
about 1 million visitors
to the library

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.540
and he gave a beautiful
concluding presentation.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.330
He is a very distinguished
scholar of Persian studies

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.800
in many, many different fronts.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.380
He was born in Iran and did his
early stages of his education

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.860
in Tehran before he moved to the
United States, and he did a Ph.D.,

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.020
both in History and in Sociology
at the University of Pennsylvania.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:25.560
And ever since then, he has
been writing on numerous books

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.660
and articles in areas
staring with sociology

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:37.060
of the Muslim majority cultures in
the world, to Islamic philosophy,

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.740
and that really is something

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.080
that makes Professor
Dabashi's work unique in a way

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.210
because it's deeply rooted
both in the textual tradition

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.280
but at the same time
in the social realities

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.980
of the world in which we live.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.390
The book before this one,
that he's going to talk

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:05.420
about on Persian literature
humanities is really a unique

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:14.520
contribution to the works
coming out of the humanistic

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.220
and literary tradition of
Persian within the Islamic context

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.410
in which it came to be
and to enrich the world.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.830
But in addition to all of
that, he's worked in cinema,

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.850
he has written beautiful works on
the study of cinema and I would

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.690
like to draw attention before
transregional matters became very

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.430
fashionable, he always did
his work transregionally,

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.030
by looking beyond the you know,

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.400
the limited geographical
area we call Iran.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.560 position:56%
So, without further ado, let me just
call on Professor Hamid Dabashi,

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.370
please welcome him to speak about
his latest book "Persophilia"

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.290
which is available here, and I'm
looking personally, looking forward

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.890
to reading it, since I
haven't had a chance yet.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.850
So, Hamid please.

everyone, thank you for coming.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.500

next to being at home with my family

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:28.340

is the place that I like to be,

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.970
in the company of my
dearest friends.

Before which I'd like to express my
gratitude to the Library of Congress

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:44.960
for generously, kindly, graciously,
this is twice hosting me here.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:51.900
And particularly Mr. Dinavari and
my colleague Dr. Fatemeh Keshavarz

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:57.020
for being so, gracious
and kind to my work.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:01.900
Writing as I'm sure you
know is a very private

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.100
and insular event, when we work.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.720 position:56%
We're always like a potter, I always
use the metaphor of a pottery,

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.780
when you're in your
pottery workshop.

look at one pot say, well it's ready

window for people to watch.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:28.210
Speaking of watching,
as Dr. Keshavarz said,

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.220
I have lots of filmmaker friends.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:36.790
And these filmmaker friends read my
books and make movies about them.

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:40.760
So, there's a short
clip about this book

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.420
that I think is the
best introduction

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.900
to what this book is about.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.640

That effectively dismantles
those two coded illusions

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:11.030

"Persophilia" harbors neither

&gt;&gt; Hamid Dabashi: Well, as
you can tell for the duration

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:35.820
of writing this book, I was
in the company of my music,

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:40.200
looking at beautiful
paintings and so forth.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:47.620 position:56%
Now, let me summarize in addition to
what you just heard, what were some

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:51.670
of my concerns that
drew me this study.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:56.890
As I'm sure know, there
is a groundbreaking study

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:00.890
by my own dear friend and late
colleague Edward Said called

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.280
"Orientalism" published 1978.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:09.100
The basic argument with Said as you
know, is the production of a kind

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:13.570
of knowledge above the
Orient that was concomitant

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:19.130
with the European age
of Colonialism.

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:25.350
Prior to Edward Said's study, in
the 1950's a French historian,

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:31.850
Raymond had written a book called
"The Oriental Renaissance".

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:33.220
Raymond Schwab.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:39.850
And the point of Raymond Schwab
in "Oriental Renaissance" was how

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:43.750 position:56%
in addition to the other Renaissance
that we know, there was a period

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:49.120
of attraction to things oriental,
particularly Indian culture

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.390
that was influential
in the formation

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:55.740
of European culture of the period.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:59.780
My study of "Persophilia"
is somewhere

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:04.500
in between those two studies, but
more, specifically about things

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.280
that Europeans call Persia.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:10.710
Not Orient at large, but very
specifically about Europe.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:16.830
And it's at some point in
the book, I said the --

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:22.390
devil of orientalism is in
the detail of persophilia.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:29.880
The fact that Europeans have been
attentive to the Iranian history

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:35.010
from the Hebrew Bible to
classical antiquity is known.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:40.010
Cyrus the Great appears
in the Hebrew Bible.

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:44.850
Repeatedly the Book of Esther is
about a period in Jewish history

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:48.740 position:56%
that has to do with a Persian queen.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:55.410
And also, the classical antiquity
Exodus' "Persian" for example,

00:19:55.410 --> 00:20:00.580
Xenophon's "Cyropaedia", the
book about Cyrus the Great,

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.680
which we are in the
presence of Thomas Jefferson.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:09.300 position:56%
Thomas Jefferson had a copy of
Xenophon's "Cyropaedia" and in fact,

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:15.500
he wrote marginally on
the - on his own copy.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:22.130
Xenophon was contemporary of Plato
both of them students of Socrates

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:26.310
and in fact for a period of time,
"Cyropaedia" competed with Plato's

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.590
"Republic" as a mirror for princes.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:32.160
At any rate, these are
more classical period.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.040 position:56%
In the first chapter I do talk about

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.510
these classical periods.

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:40.040
But my interest is more
on 17th and 18th century

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.300
when these attractions
to these things Persian.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:49.440
For example, in Montesquieu's
"Persian Letters",

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.970
I asked why would Montesquieu
be interested

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:54.760
in something called
"Persian Letters"?

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:59.270
It's a book of satire about these
two fictive Iranians who come

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.780
to France and keep
writing letters back home.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.210
Just before he writes
"The Spirit of the Laws".

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:10.960
This is the man who THE
definitive book on the separation

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.380
of powers in a democracy.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:21.050
Which we hope we will
continue to have in our...

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:22.350
democracy.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:29.550
So, I began to place works such as
Montesquieu's or" Persian Letters"

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:38.020
or Goethe's "West-ostlicher Divan"
or even books like Nietzsche's

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.480
"Thus Spoke Zarathustra".

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:47.900
I began asking why would Nietzsche
call one of his most critical books

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.200
"Thus Spoke Zarathustra"?

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:55.080
Why not "Thus Spoke Christ or
Moses or Mohamad" or whoever?

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:59.260
This did not quite fit with Edward
Said's notion of Orientalism,

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:04.900
namely production and knowledge
in the service of Colonial power.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.020
These books in fact,
would definitive to social

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:12.180
and intellectual movements
in Europe and by extension

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:18.910 position:56%
through the extension of romanticism
into American transcendentalism.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:21.300
They became definitive to the point

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:27.230
that Emerson thought he was
the reincarnation of Saadi.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:30.930
And so, I always say when
they ask Martin Luther King

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:33.090
who he was influenced by?

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:34.390
It's by Gandhi.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.970
Gandhi said I was influenced
by Thoreau

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.740
and Thoreau said I was
influenced by Saadi.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:45.710
Those I propose the question of
boundaries and boarders and East

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:49.010
and West and North and South,
such historical facts, in fact,

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:54.790
transcend these fictive frontiers.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:59.960
Here I - what became important
to me is the formation

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:03.280
of what the great German
Sociologist, Philosopher,

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:07.760
Habermas calls the formation
of the bourgeois public sphere.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:12.400
Because it is not - this is a
period that Europe is emerging

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:17.480
from its own post French Revolution
period and public sphere -

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:21.790
public conversation, public
knowledge, public reason,

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:25.600
a period of enlightenment, is
when they begin to pay attention

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.060
to other cultures,
non-European cultures.

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:35.330
This is a period that Goethe
thought of word literature or ideas

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:38.460
in word history became important.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.430
So, the idea of the world

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:45.220
or non-European cultures becomes
definitive in the formation

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:50.730
of social, intellectual movements
in Europe and United States.

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:55.070
As a result, I do kind of a canny

00:23:55.070 --> 00:24:01.530
that locates specific
references to things Persian.

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:08.650
In painting for example, sun and
music, there are 100's of operas

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:16.460
from Handel's Xerxes which you just
heard a little bit of right here,

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:22.290 position:56%
to many, many others in which the
period of the [inaudible] the figure

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:28.640
of the Xerxes and Cyrus the Great,
etc., become very definitive.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:37.750
My argument is to cut to the chase,
that the metaphor or the trope

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:42.500
of Persia predicated on
Biblical and classical antiquity,

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.440
but extended into for
example, Matisse's fascination

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.710
with Persian carpet
and Persian painting.

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:53.130
And how these paintings from
the design of Persian carpet

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:57.430
to miniatures, exhibitions of
Persian miniatures in Paris

00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:02.900
that Matisse had seen, they begin
to be present and instrumental

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:07.970
and at some point, even definitive
to the formation of the social,

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:13.120
intellectual and artistic movements
within the European public sphere.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:16.900
But here, as I said
here in the narrative,

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.000
is only half of the story.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.690
My interest is not to say "Oh low
and behold, how lovely is that.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.210
Isn't that cute that the
Iranian's had an influence

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:31.230
on Europe.". The real
part of my argument is

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:35.140
when that public sphere
becomes transnational.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:40.030
And by virtue of the global
operation of the capital, the taste

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:46.280
and preferences and choices and
the status symbols of things

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:50.070
that are happening in European
public sphere, they traveled.

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.480
They traveled to the
rest of the world.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.000
So, I put it provocatively

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.810
that wherever British Colonialism
goes so goes "Omar Khayyam".

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:02.760
Because it is initially the
translation of FitzGerald's

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:08.210
"Omar Khayyam", of his journals
attention to "Omar Khayyam",

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:11.870
that turns "Omar Khayyam"
into a phenomenon

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:14.760
in the English speaking world
and then eventually comes

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.290
to the United States, goes to
the Arab world and to India

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:23.870
and sub-continent and I underline
the paradox that for example,

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:30.710
when you hear Umm Kulthum, for
example singing Omar Khayyam,

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:37.290
Rubaiyat, this is not directly from
Egypt and Iran are not that far,

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:40.880
but it is in the aftermath of
the location of Omar Khayyam

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.820
on a global public sphere
that now Egypt is receiving.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:49.250
The same is if you go to
Pakistan or Indian sub-continent

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:55.460
and the attention of
[inaudible] to Rumi and Hafez.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:58.570 position:56%
[Inaudible] discovers Rumi and Hafez

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:02.990
in Germany while he's doing his
Doctoral distortion in Germany.

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:07.720
And then he goes back
to India/Pakistan

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:12.630
and suddenly Rumi becomes so
definitive to his thinking

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:19.750
that constitutes like Virgil in
his version of Devine Comedy.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:25.480
Here then I begin - I have a
more theoretical preoccupation

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:31.390
which is how does on Iranian
context or the Persian world,

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:36.890
or the Islamic world, or Third
world, whatever term we want,

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:40.250
suddenly this reflection of
one particular attention,

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:43.240
European attention
to things Iranian,

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:48.960 position:56%
has repercussions beyond the control
of the original European attention?

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:53.650
So, I play with Habermas'
notion of public sphere

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:56.040
and I call it para-public sphere.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:01.360
There is a para-public sphere
that for example, in say,

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.680
Nietzsche's attention to Hafez.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.340
Hafez becomes very definitive
to Nietzsche's notion

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.870
of the allusion pleasure.

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:14.930
Then goes back to Iran and
gives rise to the poetry

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:20.910 position:56%
of contemporary masters like Shamlou
and Forough Farrokhzad and so forth.

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:27.090
So, it is in a sense a kind
of intellectual historiography

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:31.890
as my colleague Dr. Keshavarz
said, that does not remain constant

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:37.540 position:56%
within fictive frontiers of Colonial
and post-Colonial boundaries

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.100
in order to understand
the social phenomenon.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:44.060
Pays much more attention to
historical realities of how

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:48.430
for example, canonization
of literature happens.

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:51.280
I have a whole chapter
on re-canonization

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.330
of Persian literature in the
aftermath of European attention

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:56.830
for example, to Ferdowsi.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:29:01.790
Yes, Ferdowsi was known,
celebrated and loved and even here

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.640
in this very library, I'm told

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:08.000
that there are manuscripts
of "Shahnameh" extent.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.460
But the rediscovery of Ferdowsi and
his epic, I propose is something

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:18.020 position:56%
that happens in the aftermath of the
European reception of "Shahnameh",

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:21.080
when Matthew Arnold
begins to impose his poem -

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.270
famous poem on "Rustum and Sohrab".

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:31.270 position:56%
When Jean Mohl prepares his
critical edition of the "Shahnameh".

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:35.730
When [inaudible] writes his
pioneering study of Shahnameh,

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:39.450
or when E.G. Browne for
example, writes his four-volume

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:41.590
"Literary History of Persia".

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:46.200
And who is next to E.G. Browne
when he's writing his four volume

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:51.330
on literary history of
Persia is Muhammad Qazvini,

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:56.610
the doyen of Persian literary
of the early 20th Century

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:58.600
and he goes back to Iran.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.800
He and his generation are
instrumental, that generation

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:06.750
of the literary are instrumental
in defining and co-defining

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:09.870
and canonizing the history
of Persian literature.

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:13.440
So, if you remain confined,

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.280
this is my argument -
if you remain confined

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.630
within one particular
political border to try

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:23.610
to understand literary
historiography,

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:26.810
artistic historiography,
cultural historiography,

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:31.580
you will have a distorted
conception of all of those things.

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:35.010
Another example I give and then
I'll stop hopefully we can have a

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:39.630
conversation if you so wish,
is this is not the first time,

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:47.230
16th century Persian literature
has a former hospitable environment

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:48.890
in the Mohall, India.

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:52.840 position:56%
And goes to Mohall, India and if you
want to study Persian literature,

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.900
the studyography, poetry, anything

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:57.970
of the 16th century,
you have to go to India.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:02.130
And in fact, literary
history of Persia,

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:05.670
particular in the Safavid
period is very, very weak.

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:08.740
I mean they are great in
architecture, and in art

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:12.590
and in philosophy and
theology, and many other things.

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:15.310
But the actual Persian
literature called literature,

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:18.670 position:56%
poetry in particular, if you want
to study it you have to go to India.

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:24.880 position:56%
So, as a result on the model of "The
World of Persian Literacy Humanism",

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:30.570
I offer not post-Colonial
national frame of reference

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:34.890
for our understanding of
literature, art, music, so forth,

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:39.360
but an imperial that is
the three pre-modern -

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.870
as they call them - Muslim empires.

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:47.590
The Mughal's, the Safavid/Qarjar's
and the Ottoman's, ultimately yield

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:53.490
to the incoming European
Imperial conquest.

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:59.040
And the proverbial Persian poets
that have habitually in history,

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:05.210
exists a royal court, say Ferdowsi
from the - in the Samlandic period.

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:08.190
Exists the Samlandic court,
there's another court,

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:11.480
the Ghaznavid enters
the Ghaznavid courts.

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.390
This is historically,
it's happened many times.

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:16.570
You exit one royal court, you
go to another royal court.

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:21.320
In the 16th century when the
Safavid sultans are not interested

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:25.440
in poetry, they find a
hospitable environment in India,

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.080
so many of them go to India.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:32.500
But in the aftermath of the
collapse of these three empires,

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:36.320
and the rise of the
European empires,

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:42.320
the proverbial Persian poet exits
the Qarjar court, looks around,

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.530
there is no other royal
court to go to.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:49.070
Suddenly they discover that there
are these Europeans, in English,

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:54.460
French, German, Dutch
are interested in Persia

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:59.170
in their own bourgeois public
sphere, not royal court.

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:03.590
Thus, we have the emergence
of Iranian or Arab

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.910
or Turkish bourgeois public sphere.

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:10.700
In fact, Aref Ghazvini,
a very important poet

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:16.740
of the Constitutional period, says
in so many words, that before -

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:23.360
I am quoting him "Before I talked
about the vatan, which is homeland,

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:29.290
one out of - nine out of ten
Iranians didn't have any clue what

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.310
is vatan."

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:35.350
And he's right because he
invented it in his poetry.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:40.010
And homeland, I propose is
the functional equivalent

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:45.400
of the bourgeois public sphere
because it is on public sphere

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.110
that the generation of say,

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:53.000
Mirza Saleh Sirazi they bring
the first printing machine

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.130
on which they publish
the first newspaper.

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:59.310
The simplification of
Persian prose takes place,

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:01.190
if you read for example,

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:08.840
about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the
first diplomat of Iran in England,

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:12.140
he apologizes early
in his travel log.

00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:16.230
He says - you have to forgive
me, this is a very simple prose -

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:22.110
because the florid language of
say the Rajar period and before

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:27.910
that is now yielding to the
necessity of talking to a public

00:34:27.910 --> 00:34:31.470
that is emerging on the
space of the public sphere

00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:35.770
and that is the most revolutionary
phenomenon that the [inaudible]

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:39.150
which continued to happen until
the Constitutional Revolution

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:40.850
and many other revolutions.

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:44.480
The young Turks revolutions, the
resistance to the British in India,

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:48.020 position:56%
etc. So, to make a long story short,

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:52.300
I begin on the European public
sphere and the attention

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:56.180
to these kinds of Persian material.

00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:58.930
And not all of it is high culture.

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:03.900
I even, in fact, pay attention
to when high heels for example,

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.790
when did people begin
to wear high heels?

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:10.700
Was actually Persian Ambassadors
through European courts

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:14.880
that had high heels and
then European monarchs began

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.850 position:56%
to imitate them and have high heels.

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:21.210
It was at some point that
then this transformed

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:26.280
into women wearing high
heels, rather than men.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.590 position:56%
Appealing to their Socratic culture.

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:34.820
And so, there many of these
sort of nitty gritty aspects

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:40.220
of this dialectic in which I'm
interested, but not for the sums

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:44.300
but for the carrier of more
important transformations

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:47.240
of society, culture,
history, so forth.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.530
I hope some of what
I said made sense?

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:51.610
I hope you get to read the book.

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:55.130
And thank you for your patience
and I will be happy, with pleasure,

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:57.510
with pleasure, with pleasure.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:06.570
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:10.460
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz:
Thank you so much.

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:26.250
I really look forward to reading
your book and I think a key point

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:38.460
that you made is that that
one was in the details,

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:55.800
so we have to really
focus on every detail.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:08.030
One thought that I had when
you addressed the question

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:18.450
of canonization of some of
these texts and their appeal

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:24.480
to the European intellectuals
and so on

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:28.370
and there's definitely
some truth to that.

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:31.790
I think it's a, you know,
you established that.

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:38.490
But, what does that do for the
way these texts actually travel

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:46.650
within their indigenous context
and you know, as well as concepts

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:53.060
such as, mechanic, you
know, I can see it that in

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:58.750
that particular specific
context, this is what happens.

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:03.830
But does that really mean that
they have it in sub-Tehran,

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:06.990
if not have an idea about the
homeland or wherever [inaudible].

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:10.450
So, you know, in other words,
what happens to that image?

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:11.750
&gt;&gt; Hamid Dabashi: Very good.

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.050
Yeah. Excellent question.

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:15.690
The question is: Yes, let's agree

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:20.740
that there is a transnational
public sphere on which these words

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:24.730
such as vatan, homeland, take shape

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:31.040
or these texts are
re-conceptualized, re-canonized,

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:35.630
but what about the indigenous
history and genealogy

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:39.700
and exomologesis of
all of these works.

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:42.580
Now, on the way I address
that, is that I don't believe

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:45.920
in one specific indigenous
environment with capital I,

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:49.160
there are multiple
indigenous environments.

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:53.890
And for historical
references, I opt to operate

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:58.560 position:56%
within a specific imperial contexts,
I operate within the Sadjuric Period

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.080
and I look at Sadjuric
Period and say ok,

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:04.130
in this period how does
canonization happen?

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:06.420
What are the texts
that are important?

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:10.970
Why is it that it takes from
the say, early 11th century,

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:17.180
that Ferdowsi finishes "Shahnameh",
until we get to the 13th century

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:18.680
when Najmeddin Razi
writes [inaudible]

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:23.740
that we have the first account
of who this Ferdowsi was.

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:30.370
No, this doesn't mean that for
two centuries people didn't know

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:31.950
who Ferdowsi was.

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:38.060
There are extent manuscripts of
"Shahnameh" at the beginning of the

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:40.560
"Shahnameh" in fact, we have the
rise of all of this fluoric aspect

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.750
between the relationship between
Ferdowsi and [inaudible] etc. So,

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:45.640
there are many localities, many...

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.940
vernaculars.

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.240
I mean I will not even call them
vernacular, because I don't want

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.680
to give primacy to the European
and then vernaculars to others.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.450 position:56%
I just want to show multiple, layers
of history in each one of which -

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:53.010
because of proclivities of one
empire as opposed to another.

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:54.660
Or also the other thing which is
the subject of the previous book,

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:56.130
as you remember, the internal
logic of the development

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:57.430
of the literary tradition
in and of itself.

00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:58.730
Before we reach the European.

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:00.030
So, your point is absolutely
well taken.

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:01.330
But I place it in a
larger frame of reference.

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:02.630
So, this period of 18th -
19th century European context,

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:03.930
falls into a much larger context

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:05.230
of not only the 1400 is an
Islamic history of Iran,

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:06.930
but even pre-Islamic
period that gives us a

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:17.310
much better perspective of how
canonization actually takes place.

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:19.110
Please.

[ Inaudible Question ]

00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.980
&gt;&gt; Hamid Dabashi: Excellent.

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:03.410
Again, the question is: if
I believe as I indeed do,

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:08.360
multiple persophilia's not
just one mold of persophilia.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.760
Absolutely I do.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:14.420 position:56%
Again, as the example that you gave
me that Edward Said Orientalism book

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:17.750
"Orientalism" is mostly
in British and French.

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:21.610 position:56%
That's to say much about either
German, except occasional references

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:26.150
to Goethe, and also
Russian Orientalism.

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:32.860
Which is equally if not, even
more important than European.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:37.510
And precisely the same way that the
German Orientalism has a particular

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:41.970
genealogy and vintage, which is
different from Russian Orientalism,

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:44.670
that especially in the aftermath
of the Russian Revolution

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:50.970
as it decidedly Marxist historical
materialist disposition to it.

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:56.370
The same is with, with
"Persophilia" of course.

00:41:56.370 --> 00:42:04.180 position:56%
But as I said, I for my purpose, I
concentrate on those specific cases.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:10.020
That the picking of a Persian
element is instrumental

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:15.270
in the formation of
progressive social movements.

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:17.850
Such as, romanticism,
such as enlightenment,

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:20.140
such as transcendentalism,

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:25.110 position:56%
such as groundbreaking philosophical
country centuries of [inaudible].

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:32.150
Such as modernist painting
etc. I deliberately

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:33.870
in the introduction I talk

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:36.440
about that these are the
true trends on which I stand.

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:37.740
I don't negate them.

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:40.600
I'm not offering it
as a contrary reading,

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:44.160
but those are the true
positions Schwab and Said,

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:48.790
that are the predicates of
what I do and what I do is

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:53.050
to go counterintuitively
not when the knowledge

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:56.610
about the Orient is produced
in order to make it subjugate

00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:59.750
to [inaudible]; but in fact,
it has entirely, very -

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:03.570
that is transcendental, because it
isn't the bourgeois public sphere.

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:07.030
However, in the aftermath of
the construction of Orientalism,

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:09.170
within the bourgeois public sphere,

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:12.980
what happens is it
becomes a status symbol.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:17.720
Whether it is enclosing or
as Annemarie Schimmel writes

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:22.220
at some point that after
Goethe's "West-ostlicher Divan",

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:25.530
suddenly there were
scores of blue eyes

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:29.400
and blond officers
appeared in Germany.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:33.840
So, this means that
bourgeois consciousness,

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:37.800
bourgeois public sphere,
bourgeois self-awareness,

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:41.870
is beginning to assert itself
on public sphere in terms

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:45.590
that it is borrowing from
and it's not just Iran.

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:47.260
It is India, it is the Arab world.

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:49.010
It is all over the place.

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:53.670 position:56%
So, it is the particular composition
of the bourgeois consciousness

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:56.600
that I'm interested in this period.

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.360
And then my argument
following Habermas,

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.200
is that this bourgeois
consciousness doesn't stand,

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:06.470
in fact more on Nancy
Fraser's take on Habermas

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:09.010
that this public sphere
becomes transnational.

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:13.890
That I follow it back into other
parts of the world which then comes

00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:17.920
to the sort of re-canonization
of the - of text.

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.610
I mean you can do that
with [inaudible],

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:23.610
you can do it with many
number of other figures.

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:28.010
That yes, they were known and
loved and celebrated and subject

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:33.250 position:56%
of biographical dictionaries and all
of that but there is a new gestation

00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:37.920 position:56%
that now happens by virtue of
transnational imperialism predicated

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.830
on transnational bourgeois
public sphere,

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:43.850
that I think needs documentation.

00:44:47.510 --> 00:45:15.040
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.340
&gt;&gt; Hamid Dabashi: Exactly.

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:22.270
I would only add to what
you - the question is:

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:26.710
how do I place this particular
work next to my other works

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:29.980
that are very much in
conversation I would say

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.270
with Edward Said, rather
than influence?

00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:36.250
I actually intellectually come
from a different genealogy.

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:41.130
Edward Said as you know, was a
literary critic and very much came

00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:43.270 position:56%
from a tradition of our [inaudible].

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:47.970
I'm a sociologist of
culture by training.

00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:51.830
So, when I read Edward
Said's "Orientalism",

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:56.310
after having read Karl Mannheim
and Mark Schaller and so forth,

00:45:56.310 --> 00:46:01.720
it was not such a huge
sort of event for me.

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:05.730
What was an event, what was
implicit in Edward Said's work?

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:09.360 position:56%
Namely Michel Foucault's
"Conception of Knowledge and Power".

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:13.950
That "Knowledge and Power" which
informs Said's "Orientalism",

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:17.400
has remained very constant
in my work.

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:21.590
So, I offer it as you write the
word that you use 'complicating',

00:46:21.590 --> 00:46:24.820
that's a better word
rather than a disagreeing

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:27.470
or taking it other places.

00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:31.950
I wanted to see this power
dynamic in multiple settings.

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:35.630
This is actually a fucoidan, I
want to see how the power works

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:38.340
in multiple settings,
not just in a knowledge

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:41.290
that Colonial officer produces.

00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:43.760
I mean there are many of them,
in fact I talk about them

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.530
in the context of the book.

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:49.160
But here I don't through
a Saidian fucoidan

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:52.190
but through the deliberately
of Habermas' notion

00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:54.130
of the bourgeois public sphere.

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:57.430 position:56%
Because that to me it is, because if

00:46:57.430 --> 00:47:00.650
in Said becomes Oriental
knowledge production

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:03.140
and revolutionary knowledge
production.

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:07.240
Here I'm after a more subtle
and perhaps insidious mode

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:11.950
of knowledge production that is
evident of bourgeois public sphere.

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:16.090
And Said didn't see it because
his point was something else.

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:19.410
His point was to document a
different set of trajectory.

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:23.230
To me, this bourgeois
public sphere on a model

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:25.620
and also remember this
is a very Marxists -

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:28.240
can we say Marxists in
Library of Congress?

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.540
&gt;&gt; Yes

00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:30.840
&gt;&gt; Hamid Dabashi: Is that ok?

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:32.140
[ Inaudible ]

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:33.440
[ Laughter ]

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.740
&gt;&gt; Hamid Dabashi: Edward
Said was [chuckles],

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:38.630
was he was a literary
historian not -

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:43.520
this is a decidedly a class
formation bourgeois public sphere

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.820
kind of a thing.

00:47:47.510 --> 00:49:10.040
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:11.450
&gt;&gt; Hamid Dabashi: Very good.

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:14.510
Very good, yeah.

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:18.190
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:22.400
&gt;&gt; Hamid Dabashi: Ok, let me repeat
right, the first question has

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:26.640
to do with the word vatan.

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:31.760
The way that Aref Ghazvini the
prominent [inaudible] period poet,

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:40.040
uses it and its earlier gestation
that have indeed existed.

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:43.440
First of all, vatan does
not appear in "Shahnameh".

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:47.310
But it doesn't mean the
concept is not there.

00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:49.050
There are concepts of Iran.

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:50.540
There are concepts of Kishva.

00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:52.810
There are concepts of
many similar concept.

00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:55.770
But not the word vatan.

00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:58.770
And my point is what is important

00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:03.240
about Aref Ghazvini is the
coincidence of the word vatan

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:06.040
and the way that he uses it
and you're absolutely right

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:09.800
in the revolutionary
disposition of Tasnif

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:16.470
which pre-dates Aref Ghazvini,
but he makes it popular.

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:21.720
Simplification of music and etc.
What distinguishes it is the rise

00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.320
of the public sphere.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:28.270
Namely an "educated public",
because it is a small public.

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:34.050
But a century before exactly,
Aref Ghazvini uses this word.

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:37.510
We have Mirza Saleh Sirazi,
bringing a printing machine

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:38.840
with himself from London.

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:43.650 position:56%
He had a shawl, a paisley shawl
that - second hand - that he sold it

00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:48.140
and bought a second-hand printing
machine and brought to Iran

00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:50.690
with which he published
the first newspaper.

00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:54.890
There was no word for newspaper, so
he just called it kaqaz-i akhbar.

00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:57.850
This you know, word for-- .

00:50:57.850 --> 00:51:01.580
And third essentially of
simplification of Persian prose

00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:06.170
through translations and
travel logs and so forth.

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:10.310
This 100 years prepares
eventually the formation

00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:13.220
of what Habermas' Public Sphere.

00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:19.570
Public sphere on which now,
when Aref uses the word vatan

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:25.950
or when he uses the word vatan in
a Tastif, that he sings it publicly

00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:32.330
and people here it [inaudible]
etc., it resonates with a public

00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:36.190
that prior to this 100
years, active formation

00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:37.940
of the public sphere did not exist.

00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:40.210
You have different kinds
of social formations.

00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:43.240
But not the bourgeois
public sphere on this model

00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:45.880
of encountered with Europeans.

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:49.110
The second question about
the medium of transmission.

00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:52.190
This is a very crucial point.

00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:57.740
How did these manifestations of
persophilia in Europe transferred?

00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:00.740
Traveled to Europe?

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:11.470 position:56%
Here my emphasis are more on
merchants, diplomats, travelers, ok.

00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:18.120
That people like [inaudible]
for example, goes to India

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:24.660
and because he goes in India, plus
the fact that just before him,

00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:28.030
his friends buddy, his
buddy that had knew him,

00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:29.660
[inaudible] said you should stay.

00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:34.360
Goes from Iran to India in fact we
have a space, a geographical space

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:41.420 position:56%
of in the Persian, which is far
more accurate geographical territory

00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:45.210
rather than India and
Iran at the time.

00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:49.850
So, these and an example of
young scholars at the time

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:53.830
like Muhammad Qazvini who
is actually is instrumental

00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:56.920
in the writing of the four
volumes of E.G. Browne.

00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:01.020
And then many of these travelers,
if you look at Ilci's travel log,

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:06.520
if you look at many others you
see how this particular attention

00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:11.820 position:56%
to the Iranian culture,
literature, sometimes sarcastically,

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:16.540
sometimes approvingly,
sometimes they're just stunned

00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:18.980
"Why are Europeans
paying attention to this?"

00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:24.410
begins to be translated
back into Iranian context.

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:27.680
Or, Islamic context at large.

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:31.690 position:56%
You're right that there is sometimes
- if you look at the American -

00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:38.110
American Embassy etc., is
a very new gestation, ok.

00:53:38.110 --> 00:53:41.550
And we have to make a distinction
between European Orientalism

00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:45.420
and American area
studies/Orientalism is a whole

00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:46.820
different genealogy of it.

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:49.120 position:56%
Which I address in a different book.

00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:53.380
In the - in that context what
is important - the distinction

00:53:53.380 --> 00:54:00.550
between Persia and say India
or the Arab world is that idea

00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:06.370
of Persia was known to the
European from classical antiquity.

00:54:06.370 --> 00:54:10.560
And when Hagel is writing
his "Philosophy of History",

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:16.470
you remember, if you look at the
tautology of Hagel's "Philosophy

00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:21.050
of History", he considers
Egypt and India he dismisses.

00:54:21.050 --> 00:54:24.010
He cites India and
Egypt, but he dismisses

00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:25.750
where the Geist is not present yet.

00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:30.810
Geist becomes Geist, Farrago,
in Persia and from Persia goes

00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:34.970
to the Roman Empire and goes to
Germany, just the neighborhood

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:39.380
of Berlin where he lived.

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:45.010
So, that's as I emphasized
in the book, that familiarity

00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:48.710
with the thing called Persia
from the Book of Esther

00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:54.130
to Xerxes' Persia, is a very
important factor in how in 18th

00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:56.980
and 19th century Persia,
Persia begins -

00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:59.410
starts to be re-conceptualized.
