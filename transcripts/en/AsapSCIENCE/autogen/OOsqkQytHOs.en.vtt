00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.460
 Video games provide a fun escape from reality. Although they are often depicted with violence, 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.370
 Lazy and time consuming by some. The debate raged for years - so there is no 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.160
 Positive effects? Can video games actually make you smarter? 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.600
 Before we precede events, it is important to note that much of anything is bad - even 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.180
 broccoli. Doses seriously, too high broccoli can actually be toxic. Heck even 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.890
 Water toxicity exists. So if you binge and do nothing but play video games, risk 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.490
 Perhaps outweigh any benefits. In fact, we have a full video dedicated to what would 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.780
 Happens if you stop going outside, the negative effects of the session - the link at 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.399
 Describe! 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.350
 As I have said, many studies actually have increases shown in post cognitive function 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.379
 Play video games. One study in particular was the participants play Super Mario 64 for 30 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.709
 Minutes per day more than 2 months. After that, the brains of these participants witnessed an increase 

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:54.170
 Of the gray matter in areas associated with memory, strategic planning, and fine motor skills 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.350
 From my hands, compared with those who have not played. This is particularly encouraging 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.119
 The results of mental disorders that cause these brain regions to shrink. Using video games 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:04.129
 As a treatment. 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.719
 Surprisingly, action games can also increase attention to detail in individuals. take 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:12.670
 Look at the following words on the screen, and scream what color the floor is as fast 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:19.670
 you may! So: green, blue, orange. Ok, now try a little faster without me. We continue, 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.009
 It becomes more difficult because there is a conflict between the same word and her 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.369
 the color. Chances are, if you play more than 5-10 hours of work games per week, you 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.390
 Able to solve these problems much more quickly. This is because the brain is actually more 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.810
 Efficiency in areas associated with interest. 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.369
 Of course, video games can also be incredibly educational! And while it may not be playing 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.979
 Some of your favorite games for this purpose, there are many certain games that are used 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.859
 As effective educational tools for young and old. 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.999
 They may even help children with dyslexia read more effectively. In a small study, Dilixia 

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:05.810
 Children who played regular video games ended up reading faster and more accurately - once 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.599
 Again related to improving attention skills. Improvements at the same time, other studies have found 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.769
 In sight. They can only see smaller details more clearly, such as small writing, however 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.379
 They have an easier time separating gray levels. The games were a very practiced work 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.420
 58% are better at recognizing the nuances in contrast. Which is important because that is 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.989
 One of the first things to reduce with age. 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.519
 Even in older people, improved memory and concentration are seen. More importantly, specially designed 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.400
 The brain has been teasing video games to slow the aging process of the brain by 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.900
 Up to seven years. This is because it is ideologically complex and requires mental energy! 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.349
 I think you're able to track what's in front of your eyes? Keep an eye on 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.590
 The blue circle is here. Eventually they will turn yellow like all the others. I'll point out then 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.450
 To a circle, you tell me if it was originally blue. If you know this ball was not blue, then 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.390
 I was a human being. But allows make it difficult. Staring in the middle 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:05.390
 The screen can help to track blue circles. Was this blue circle originally? 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:13.239
 If you say no, you're right. Again, but with 5 blue circles. This was originally one 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.760
 Blue? Yes - it was. As it turns out, the average person can track about 3-4 things, while 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.670
 An experienced work gamer can follow around 6-7. 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.140
 Finally, with the continuing technology to transform medicine, surgical operations are completed with 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.090
 Introducing cameras and remote control tools. These operations are very clear 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.860
 Similarity to video games, with screen and control of the device. Not surprisingly, young people 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.459
 Doctors with previous exposure to video games display fewer errors and complete faster than 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.209
 Without those. 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.650
 Of course, all these skills are only useful if you use them; that can not be if all 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.069
 To do is to play video games. So enjoy your down time and relax with the games in moderation, 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.620
 But get out there and keep your life diverse as well. Because this is the way you'll win in to 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.420
 Game of Life.
