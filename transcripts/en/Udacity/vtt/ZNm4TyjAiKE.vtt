00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
One thing that's a lot of fun to do in physics is to create fun problems for yourself.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
For no other reason, just to see if you can solve them and to see how a system might behave.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Here we've created a problem for ourselves.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This problem involves two masses connected by a string over a pulley.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This mass is on a plane which is inclined at some angle α

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Let's call acceleration positive when this mass goes up and this one goes down into the right.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Bause the other way, acceleration would be negative.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now, I'm not going to ask you to solve for the acceleration of this system.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Maybe you could do it. Maybe not but what I want you to do is not solve.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Yet still answer this question, and the purpose of this question is to build your physics intuition.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now, the way you're going to solve this question is by filling in these four boxes.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The blue boxes, you'll fill in with either a 1 or a 2 to indicate whether the appropriate mass

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
in that section of the equation is mass 1 or mass 2.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The purple boxes you'll fill in with a plus sign or a minus sign.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Now, what I want you to do is to really think about this problem

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and think in your head and maybe test some limiting cases.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So for example, what happens if the M₂ is huge and M₁ is really small, maybe 0?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
What happens if M₁ is really big and M₂ is close to 0?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
What do you expect the acceleration to look like in those cases?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Enter your best solution in these boxes.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So for example, if you thought this was the answer, you'd enter a 1, a plus sign, a 2, and a plus sign.

00:01:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Go ahead, give this some thought, and see if you can accurately fill in those boxes.
