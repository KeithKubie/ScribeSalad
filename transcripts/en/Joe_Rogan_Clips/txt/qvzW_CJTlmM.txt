Speaker 1:          00:00          And there's so much clickbait out there because it's such an effective way to get people to pay attention to things because it's, as you said, people focus on failure and negative and anger. That's who we want to see. Controversy. That's what we want to see. People would want to see the anger and, and you know, why do you think that is? Because it's just the times. It's, it's, that's what's cool. Now, is that what it is? The coolest being negative. You know how you always have some people is a great example. How you have people who mean you can talk about a movie. All right. We didn't talk about titanic. Wow. And Titanic, one of the biggest movies of all time. Fucking great movie. He'll, yes, it was great movie. And why guy for no reason to go. I fucking hated it.

Speaker 1:          00:44          Why? Yeah, like titanic. Fucking bullshit. Why Manga? The odd Noah. Now tell me why. Why did you hate it that Tom told you about that? The cool thing is just being different. I wanna I want to be completely opposite than all even true positive. You know what? Nah, Nah, Nah. That shit was ass. Wow. Wow. Wow. Why was it as you have people that just like to do that? Oh yeah, for sure. And, and what happens when one person does it? Another person for no reason. I'll go. Yeah, me too. Yeah, that shit was ass, man. I, I ain't like it either. Did you see it? Which I'll talk about. You don't have to know what they're talking about, but you just want to hop on the negative train because that's what's cool. It's not cool to be positive. It's not cool to be happy. I don't know if it's a cool thing. I think it's usually people that are really frustrated with their lives. 100% of, what's the, that's the factual side to it. I did a joke before, it was like, do you think Michael Jordan leaves Youtube comments? Like, I bet he does now.

Speaker 1:          01:52          That's awful winters. No, not at all. Type of people that want to get mad and complain constantly about shit like that. Do you know what it takes to do this right here? Right here. I'll tell you how I feel right in your comments section. Joe Rogan, you can kiss my ass. You know what that takes you or what do you have going on that you have the time to just simply be that negative and do it in this world and it's just a mismanagement of your time. Time is so valuable and I don't think people understand how valuable they can be if they use their time correctly. Yeah. Yes. Now, have you always been like this? If you always put this fucking guy, man, but always, always. Really. I find a light in every dark tunnel. I will find a goddamn light, man. I hear it all.

Speaker 1:          02:49          You'd listen when I tell you to wait on my back is so heavy of all the stuff that I deal with and I'm fine. The reason why I'm fine is because I'm genuinely happy. I'm happy and I'm not happy just because of the success. The success x is a bonus. I'm happy because I truly know the definition and the feeling that comes with happiness. I truly know it. I felt it. I felt it when I said, Yo, what really makes me happy? And I look at heaven and Hendrickson, I look Hizo. I look at my wife, I go, Yo, I didn't have the family shit when I was coming up. Y'All got one. I got one. Look, what I done did, look what I built. These people depend on me. I provide for these people. That makes me happy. That makes me happy. When my daughter comes up, dad, you're not only my dad, you're my best friend.

Speaker 1:          03:44          Yo, I'm happy. That's my world. So everything else from the outside that comes in, you're, you're, you're throwing shit at a, at a, at a bubble that can't be popped. There's a force field around me. There's a force field around me because what matters, what really matters loves me whole heartedly. And when you had that and you understand that you're unbreakable, so if you don't add to that force field, if you don't make my force field stronger, you don't, you don't, you don't get time from me. My team hartbeat productions, the people underneath my umbrella. You're a part of my force field. You believe what I believe we all see the same things. We want the same things. So we march with the same beat. You can't, you can't shake that. We are an individual that seen that and understands that if you've never felt that, if you have no idea what that feels like and it's easy to shake you.

Speaker 1:          04:51          That's why some people are easily broken. Being broken is not a hard thing. It's not a hard thing. So those that do get broken, those that do get down, those that do get depressed. I understand, I understand. I don't, I don't knock people for it. Mm. I don't knock anybody for it. What I also understand is that the encouragement that can come from so many can add value for those that may need a little push, that may need a little amen. Picky Chyna. It's so easy to be that positive reinforcement for somebody and add value. It's so easy. But some people choose to throw that aside and kick while your dad. Mm. I try to put out the light of positivity because whoever's out there you, I don't know what it could do for somebody else, but somebody else may just simply look at him and say, Yo, to wait.

Speaker 1:          05:44          He embraces his kids. It makes me want to be a better father. Yoda, where did this man doesn't stop in a way that every day he wakes up and he's just positive, regardless of what's going on, makes me realize that this shit ain't so bad the way he gets up and says, Hey, today's another day. It's a morning. Let's all be better than we were yesterday. Somebody probably needed to hear that. The more that I can give that out and I can take my platform to throw good energy out, I'm doing my part because there's so many that thought the complete opposite. Yeah. I don't want to be a part of that. That's beautiful man, and that's true. I believe you. It's not, it's not forced. It's not phony. Yeah. It's not fake. That shit every day I hear shit every day. It's very contagious too. I had a lady, I lady, right?

Speaker 1:          06:39          Lady rolled down a window. She goes, where are you going to make a good movie again? I said, did you see the upside? I thought the upside was good. What's that? Oh Shit. Some movie. It's one of my movies that's out us think. I think it's a good movie. I didn't see that. All right, ma'am. You have a beautiful day. That's, yeah. All right. That's it. That's it. With such conviction, like literally I could have said a lot of shit. Like she rolled her window down. You could tell she still had the crank. I got to set a lot of shit girls. A lot of things that I can say to you, ma'am, where are you going to make a good movie? It's snapping that one out. The upside. You see the other side? What's that? Oh, it's a movie out now. Amazing that that's how she chose to come out here.

Speaker 1:          07:45          I see it. I get it. She chooses to come at you with a negative. I get it every day when you won't be funny again and I'm trying my best, trying my best. If it's not working for you, hopefully I do better soon. What do you, what do you, what am I going to feed into that and why? Why, why, why? For what? For what? It seems to have been working thus far. Are you getting this positive attitude towards life from life experience? Are you getting it from books? Did someone teach you how to find this? I'm getting it from the experiences and from the, the real understanding of perfection doesn't exist. Don't exist. Yo know we're in a time right now where people expect perfection. You expect perfection and I don't know where this came from. I don't know what happened. That this is the criteria for living.

Speaker 1:          08:49          My true understanding is, all right, you got one life and that one life. The goal for us is to live it to the best of our ability from the beginning to what said the n in the middle and the beginning. Middle. You're going to do things. You're going to make mistakes. You're going to fuck up. You're supposed to learn and then move forward with the understanding of what not to do and when you move forward. Live may get better, it may not, but somewhere along the lines is going to click and everything that went through back here was supposed to happen so that now that I'm here, I'm able to go ahead with such a high level of knowledge and I can make other people better. I can make myself better. I could do more from a family. Something happens. My Dad is the prime example, crazy drug addict and I'm out of jail.

Speaker 1:          09:47          Life was very bad, very fucking bad for my dead son, got successful son, then took money, gave it to his day. Here's your house, here's your truck. Here's your monthly. At this age, I want you to live your life. You may have mistakes. You can't rebuild and correct the things you've done. I'm your son. I love you. You can't go back in and Redo. You can't try to keep going backwards and about me. You got grandkids. Go be the best grandpop you can be for these grandkids. That's your focus now. Where's this energy devoted to being a grandpa for the grandkids? Don't worry about me, but something happened in your life. Something happened that took you into the direction to reap the benefits of your son's happiness and success. My energy is now contagious is enough and I hand it to you, so now you're able to give that off to all these other people that you're around.

Speaker 1:          10:46          Something happens and that's an every single life in every life I under stand that there's a payoff for bad eventually cause a pay off. It can't be bad, but for so long, if you got the strength and the understanding to realize that shit will change, it will change. It's impossible. It's just like poker. I don't know if you play poker nut, I don't. You play poker. You can run bad forever, but it will eventually turn around. Once you grasp the understanding of the game, eventually it's going to turn around blackjack. You're never going to be at the casino, but eventually you're going to have a good run. If you catch a run, you'll do good. Get the fuck out of there. You waited long enough for it to happen here, come catch it. Leave anything in life will eventually tie. Good. Now.
