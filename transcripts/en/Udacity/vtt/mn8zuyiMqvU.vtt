00:00:00.117 --> 00:00:04.407
The answer is if we use Car.methods as the prototype for new instance, then

00:00:04.407 --> 00:00:09.030
fell property look ups to those instances, we'll fall through to Car.methods.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.340
And thus every instance will appear to have a .move method.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.960
Even if we don't manually copy them over on this line.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.780
That means, we can get rid of this line entirely.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.160
We do still need to make sure this loc property gets added to our new object,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.950
since it's no longer in line as part of an object literal.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.840
We're instead using this object that creates syntax.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.850
As of this change,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.220
we've arrived at the completed prototypal pattern of writing your class.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.130
This is not to be confused with the pseudo-classical pattern,

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.260
which is coming up next.
