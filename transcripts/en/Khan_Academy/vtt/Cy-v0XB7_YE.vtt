00:00:00.283 --> 00:00:01.559
- [Voiceover] Okay, this video is about

00:00:01.559 --> 00:00:05.786
the long essay section on
the AP U.S. History exam.

00:00:05.786 --> 00:00:07.597
Now you might also have heard this called

00:00:07.597 --> 00:00:11.102
the free response question or FRQ.

00:00:11.102 --> 00:00:14.300
I think it is officially
called the long essay question,

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.413
so that's what we're
gonna go with for now.

00:00:16.413 --> 00:00:19.619
Now this is the last essay
that you'll be writing

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.499
on the AP exam,

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:24.356
and you get 35 minutes to do it,

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:27.839
which is considerably
shorter than the DBQ section,

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:29.371
but the nice part about this is that

00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:31.531
you don't have so spend so much time

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.014
looking at all of those primary documents.

00:00:34.014 --> 00:00:35.523
The more challenging part, however,

00:00:35.523 --> 00:00:38.938
is that it's drawing on
your own personal knowledge

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:40.794
of the subject matter.

00:00:40.794 --> 00:00:43.650
So unlike the DBQ where
you're analyzing documents

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.019
and looking at just
what's in front of you,

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:48.991
here you're really using
your own background

00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:51.314
understanding of U.S. history

00:00:51.314 --> 00:00:54.192
and also bringing up specific details

00:00:54.192 --> 00:00:56.631
to help you make an argument.

00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:58.302
So on this section of the exam

00:00:58.302 --> 00:01:00.138
you're gonna have the option to choose

00:01:00.138 --> 00:01:02.877
between two different essay prompts

00:01:02.877 --> 00:01:04.689
and you can choose which of them

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.244
you want to write about.

00:01:06.244 --> 00:01:07.963
You only have to write about one.

00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:10.446
And of course, I recommend
writing about the one

00:01:10.446 --> 00:01:13.164
where you feel most confident.

00:01:13.164 --> 00:01:16.019
Maybe it's about a
topic that you like more

00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:18.179
or maybe it's a topic
about what you feel like

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:20.176
you can give more information,

00:01:20.176 --> 00:01:23.031
but in these cases always
play to your strengths.

00:01:23.031 --> 00:01:25.586
So out of the two prompts that I was given

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:29.510
there was one about whether
the American Revolution

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.717
was actually revolutionary,

00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:33.760
and then there was this question about

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.011
whether the New Deal was actually new

00:01:36.011 --> 00:01:38.426
or whether it was more
conservative in nature.

00:01:38.426 --> 00:01:39.983
Now I love the New Deal,

00:01:39.983 --> 00:01:42.607
so that is the question
that I want to take on here.

00:01:42.607 --> 00:01:44.580
Plus I can remember a
lot about the New Deal

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.113
off the top of my head,

00:01:46.113 --> 00:01:47.320
so that's gonna give me a lot

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.456
of extra information to work with.

00:01:49.456 --> 00:01:52.080
So of this 35 minutes that you have on

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.497
the long essay question,

00:01:53.497 --> 00:01:55.400
I would recommend that you spend maybe

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.094
five to 10 minutes of that

00:01:58.094 --> 00:02:01.044
and I think 10 minutes would really be max

00:02:01.044 --> 00:02:03.807
to plan your essay.

00:02:03.807 --> 00:02:05.920
To write a little outline for yourself,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.940
to decide what your thesis is going to be,

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.448
and come up with a game
plan that is gonna direct

00:02:10.448 --> 00:02:12.444
the rest of your writing time,

00:02:12.444 --> 00:02:17.041
which should be the rest
of the time that you spend.

00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:21.819
The 25 to 30 minutes in this exam period.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.282
Now again, your mileage may vary on this.

00:02:27.282 --> 00:02:30.671
You might be the sort of
person who can plan really fast

00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:32.343
and take a lot of time writing,

00:02:32.343 --> 00:02:34.642
or you might be the sort of person who

00:02:34.642 --> 00:02:36.779
knows that they can write pretty fast

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:38.752
so they can spend some more time planning,

00:02:38.752 --> 00:02:41.677
but I think this is just
kind of a good overall

00:02:41.677 --> 00:02:45.532
guideline for how you want
to be spending your time.

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.854
Okay, so once you've taken a look

00:02:47.854 --> 00:02:50.571
at each of the topics
for the essay prompts

00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:52.591
and decided which one you want,

00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:55.888
the next step is to read the prompt itself

00:02:55.888 --> 00:02:57.816
really carefully.

00:02:57.816 --> 00:02:59.417
You want to make sure
that there aren't any

00:02:59.417 --> 00:03:03.203
sort of hidden strictures
in there that might

00:03:03.203 --> 00:03:06.267
direct what you are allowed
to write about in the prompt

00:03:06.267 --> 00:03:09.171
and what you aren't allowed
to write about in the prompt.

00:03:09.171 --> 00:03:11.863
Okay, so let's take a
look at this question.

00:03:11.863 --> 00:03:15.533
"Some historians have
argued that the New Deal

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:19.433
"was ultimately conservative in nature.

00:03:19.433 --> 00:03:23.312
"Support, modify, or
refute this interpretation,

00:03:23.312 --> 00:03:27.792
"providing specific evidence
to justify your answer."

00:03:27.792 --> 00:03:30.882
Okay, so it seems like
the heart of this is about

00:03:30.882 --> 00:03:33.319
whether the New Deal

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.028
was conservative

00:03:38.288 --> 00:03:41.813
or radical.

00:03:45.115 --> 00:03:48.180
And I think in this context
the word conservative

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.616
doesn't mean politically
conservative or right-leaning,

00:03:51.616 --> 00:03:54.867
but rather conservative as in the sense of

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:58.235
keeping something that existed before.

00:03:58.235 --> 00:04:01.693
So were the ways of a society conserved

00:04:01.693 --> 00:04:04.876
over time or did they change over time?

00:04:04.876 --> 00:04:06.408
One thing I notice about this question

00:04:06.408 --> 00:04:09.936
is that it really doesn't
give us much in the way

00:04:09.936 --> 00:04:13.536
of a specific timeframe to talk about.

00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:16.764
So it doesn't say talk
about whether the New Deal

00:04:16.764 --> 00:04:20.293
was conservative or radical in the period

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:23.404
between 1920 and 1940,

00:04:23.404 --> 00:04:26.307
it just asks us to say in
the grand scheme of things

00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:28.373
do you think the New Deal was ultimately

00:04:28.373 --> 00:04:30.998
a conservative or radical movement.

00:04:30.998 --> 00:04:33.111
So that means if we want
to we could actually

00:04:33.111 --> 00:04:35.865
talk about a lot of different things

00:04:35.865 --> 00:04:37.608
really up to the present.

00:04:37.608 --> 00:04:39.372
And it doesn't even say that we only have

00:04:39.372 --> 00:04:41.322
to talk about the United States.

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:43.529
I mean, this is AP U.S. History,

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:45.619
so the bases of everything you're writing

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:47.917
has to be about American society,

00:04:47.917 --> 00:04:50.263
but there's nothing
saying you can't compare

00:04:50.263 --> 00:04:54.001
American society to other
nations in this time period.

00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:58.058
Okay, so our time scope is broad

00:05:01.431 --> 00:05:05.722
and even our geography
is relatively broad.

00:05:09.535 --> 00:05:11.996
All right, so how do we decide
what we're gonna write about?

00:05:11.996 --> 00:05:15.571
Well, I think it's given
us three main options here.

00:05:15.571 --> 00:05:18.173
Can support this idea.

00:05:18.173 --> 00:05:22.230
So we could argue that yes
the New Deal was conservative.

00:05:29.853 --> 00:05:33.075
We can refute and say no

00:05:33.075 --> 00:05:36.650
the New Deal was radical.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.043
It's not conservative at all.

00:05:39.043 --> 00:05:40.900
Or we can modify,

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.175
which might take the form of saying

00:05:43.175 --> 00:05:46.148
oh, maybe it was both
conservative and radical

00:05:46.148 --> 00:05:48.633
or maybe you even want to say

00:05:48.633 --> 00:05:50.723
this is not the right question to ask.

00:05:50.723 --> 00:05:52.836
So the modify option is kind of like a

00:05:52.836 --> 00:05:56.795
both or neither

00:05:56.795 --> 00:05:59.349
kind of way of looking at things.

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:01.438
Now how do we decide which of these three

00:06:01.438 --> 00:06:03.111
arguments we want to make?

00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:04.643
I think one of the most useful things

00:06:04.643 --> 00:06:08.172
you can do at this stage
is just make a list

00:06:08.172 --> 00:06:11.191
of things that you
might want to talk about

00:06:11.191 --> 00:06:12.422
in this essay.

00:06:12.422 --> 00:06:15.207
So if we're thinking
about the conservativeness

00:06:15.207 --> 00:06:17.901
or the radicalness of the New Deal,

00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:20.990
what sorts of things might we bring up?

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.125
So first let's just refresh ourselves

00:06:23.125 --> 00:06:25.564
on what the New Deal was about.

00:06:25.564 --> 00:06:29.256
And the New Deal was this package

00:06:29.256 --> 00:06:32.502
of programs

00:06:34.179 --> 00:06:38.492
which were passed during
the Great Depression

00:06:43.003 --> 00:06:46.206
by Franklin Delano Roosevelt

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:50.421
as a means to try to restart
the American economy.

00:06:50.421 --> 00:06:53.115
And people often talk about the New Deal

00:06:53.115 --> 00:06:56.943
kind of taking the three forms of relief,

00:06:58.483 --> 00:07:00.444
for people who are suffering,

00:07:00.444 --> 00:07:03.748
for people who need immediate aid.

00:07:03.748 --> 00:07:05.138
Recovery,

00:07:05.138 --> 00:07:08.761
to try to get the economy

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:10.456
back on track.

00:07:10.456 --> 00:07:12.360
And reform.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.380
Ways to try to change laws,

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.191
change the way the economy worked

00:07:16.191 --> 00:07:18.072
so that something like
the Great Depression

00:07:18.072 --> 00:07:19.720
didn't happen again.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.509
And with the New Deal we often think about

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:24.410
this kind of alphabet soup of agencies.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.497
There's the CCC, the
Civilian Conservation Corps.

00:07:28.497 --> 00:07:32.746
There's the TVA, the
Tennessee Valley Authority.

00:07:32.746 --> 00:07:36.834
There's the NRA, the National
Recovery Administration.

00:07:36.834 --> 00:07:40.873
And the WPA, the Works
Progress Administration.

00:07:40.873 --> 00:07:43.033
And these were all
programs that were intended

00:07:43.033 --> 00:07:45.007
to get people back to work,

00:07:45.007 --> 00:07:46.934
to try to modernize the country,

00:07:46.934 --> 00:07:49.930
and to try to moderate relationships

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.018
between workers and corporations.

00:07:53.018 --> 00:07:54.504
So what are some of the
other things we know

00:07:54.504 --> 00:07:56.036
about the New Deal?

00:07:56.036 --> 00:08:00.485
Well, the New Deal was a
reaction to the Great Depression,

00:08:00.485 --> 00:08:04.745
which was brought on by some irresponsible

00:08:04.745 --> 00:08:07.765
banking in the 1920s,

00:08:07.765 --> 00:08:10.551
a time of what was known

00:08:10.551 --> 00:08:13.453
as laissez-faire economics,

00:08:13.453 --> 00:08:15.287
which kind of said the government

00:08:15.287 --> 00:08:18.282
was to keep its hands out of the economy.

00:08:18.282 --> 00:08:21.325
Laissez-faire is French for
let them do what they will,

00:08:21.325 --> 00:08:23.530
so let the economy do whatever it wants.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.131
Well, this all right came crashing down

00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:30.329
somewhat literally in 1929
with the stock market crash.

00:08:31.193 --> 00:08:33.887
And then for another three years

00:08:33.887 --> 00:08:36.673
the Depression continued
to get worse and worse.

00:08:36.673 --> 00:08:38.949
Hoover had a largely hands-off approach

00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:40.434
to the Great Depression,

00:08:40.434 --> 00:08:43.383
and so he's creamed in
the election of 1932

00:08:43.383 --> 00:08:45.125
by Franklin Delano Roosevelt,

00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:47.842
who promises that he's gonna
get things back on track.

00:08:47.842 --> 00:08:50.999
And so Roosevelt had a really experimental

00:08:50.999 --> 00:08:52.973
response to the Great Depression.

00:08:52.973 --> 00:08:56.641
It was kind of a try something
and see if it works approach.

00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:58.593
So he and his administration just kind of

00:08:58.593 --> 00:09:02.075
threw a lot of different
experimental solutions

00:09:02.075 --> 00:09:06.093
at the problem to see what they could do

00:09:06.093 --> 00:09:08.938
about the Great Depression.

00:09:08.938 --> 00:09:11.236
But the other thing we
know about the New Deal

00:09:11.236 --> 00:09:14.255
is that in the end it didn't really work.

00:09:14.255 --> 00:09:17.576
Now this was partly
because the Supreme Court

00:09:17.576 --> 00:09:21.059
rolled back a lot of the New Deal programs

00:09:21.059 --> 00:09:23.845
saying that they weren't constitutional,

00:09:23.845 --> 00:09:27.978
which led FDR into his
famous court packing scheme

00:09:27.978 --> 00:09:30.486
where he tried to add new justices

00:09:30.486 --> 00:09:31.869
to the Supreme Court,

00:09:31.869 --> 00:09:34.145
basically tilting it in his favor.

00:09:34.145 --> 00:09:35.887
And he failed at that.

00:09:35.887 --> 00:09:37.373
And the Depression continued to get worse

00:09:37.373 --> 00:09:40.112
throughout the end of the 1930s.

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:43.291
It really wasn't until World War II

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:46.820
that the mobilization for war,

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.584
the American manufacturing for the war,

00:09:49.584 --> 00:09:53.665
got the United States out
of the Great Depression.

00:09:59.242 --> 00:10:00.868
So I think it's clear that the New Deal

00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:04.258
was this really unique
period in the United States

00:10:04.258 --> 00:10:07.276
when the government just tried whatever

00:10:07.276 --> 00:10:09.344
they could think of in order to try to

00:10:09.344 --> 00:10:11.341
improve the economy.

00:10:11.341 --> 00:10:13.013
But I think the question is

00:10:13.013 --> 00:10:15.171
if we think about the basic assumptions

00:10:15.171 --> 00:10:16.890
of the New Deal itself,

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.443
were those radical or
were they conservative?

00:10:19.443 --> 00:10:21.534
Okay, let's pause here to think about that

00:10:21.534 --> 00:10:23.902
a little bit more and in the next video

00:10:23.902 --> 00:10:25.691
we'll decide which way we want to lean

00:10:25.691 --> 00:10:28.778
and think about how to write that essay.
