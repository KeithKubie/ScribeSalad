00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.979
Mark: Good afternoon. My name is Mark Pollager
and I'm here for the Authors at Google program.

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:10.830
And we're here to welcome Jonathan Bender.
He's the author of "Lego: A Love Story," which

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.590
was released just this past May.
It covers the year that Jonathan spent immersed

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.170
in the Adult Fans of Lego community, traveling
to conventions in search of the world's largest

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.260
private Lego collection.
His journey also took him abroad to Billund

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.490
 -- I think is the correct pronunciation -- in
Denmark, which is Lego headquarters where

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.550
he was able to take a factory tour and also
see the secret set vault, which I'm sure none

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.280
of us have been able to see.
It's on the web? Aw man!

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.280
&gt;&gt; [Laughter]

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.780
Mark: -- ruin all the surprises.
While I was attempting to understand why adults

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.219
are so drawn to a child's toy, he and his
wife were starting a family of their own.

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.420
Originally a journalistic documentary third
party â€“ sorry, third person project, he

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.329
quickly felt himself drawn into the world
of adult fans and attempted to build alongside

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.309
them.
And nobody can really resist the draw of a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.840
pile of Lego bricks just waiting to be built.
He's a freelance journalist. His writing has

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.360
appeared on CNN, ESPN, Women's Health, and
the Kansas City Star amongst others.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.619
He makes his home in Kansas City with his
wife and has significantly more -- he tells

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.409
me -- than the 62 Lego bricks that exist for
every man, woman, and child on earth.

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.689
And with that, please join me in welcoming
Jonathan Bender.

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:26.810
&gt;&gt; [Applause]

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.520
Jonathan Bender: Thank you, everybody, for
coming out today.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.701
So what I wanted to do very quickly was introduce
myself, talk to you about some of the things

00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:41.439
that I, I learned and saw over the course
of the book.

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.880
And then, Mark was very nice to forward on
to me three or four questions that, that people

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.909
had had in advance.
So I'll answer those after I give my talk.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.209
And then, feel free to open it up to questions.
If some of you feel shy, I'm also going to

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:58.200
stick around and, and sign books afterwards
and you can ask me questions then.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.840
But I think this is going to be a lot of fun.
And I always really enjoy talking about Lego

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.670
bricks.
And to some degree, the past 24 hours I think

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.519
have been a bit of a dream experience, 'cause
at this time yesterday, I was actually on

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.709
a panel at Comic Con talking about Adult Fans
of Lego.

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.159
So coming to Comic Con and then Google here
in Mountain View -- I think that's sort of

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.390
like a geek's perfect game.
You know, I feel like I'm kind of nailing

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.290
it right now.
So that feels pretty good.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.519
So thanks for having me here.
And I really -- I look forward to kind of

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:36.959
sharing with you what I learned.
So, I want you to picture, if you can, basically

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.590
a world that's like today.
The economy is pretty terrible.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.769
And obviously, people are having trouble selling
their homes.

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.770
Now, in particular, there's a carpenter.
He's a master carpenter in Denmark, and he's

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.609
built three homes.
He owns the largest home in the small town

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.440
of Billund.
And he's in danger of losing that home because

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.390
he can't sell any of those three homes because
the economy has, has gone through the Great

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.690
Depression.
So it's a very difficult time to be in the

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.950
world of carpentry.
And that man is actually in the center of

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.150
your slide screen there.
Looks a little bit like Walt Disney.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.099
It's "Ole Kirk Christiansen" -- is the man's
name.

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.260
And Ole Kirk Christiansen is the founder of
Lego.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.159
And so, in 1932, he does a very very smart
thing.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.390
He realizes that people will not buy wooden
houses, but they will always buy things for

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.969
their children.
And so, Lego actually began as a wooden toy

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:32.760
company.
Most people think of the classic plastic bricks,

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.189
but it started with wood.
And they made trains and tractors and wooden

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:42.049
ducks, and sort of very classic, simple wooden
toys.

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:47.109
Now, the issue with making wooden toys is,
wood is extremely flammable.

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:52.900
And there were actually four separate fires
at the factory where they made wooden toys.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.200
And so, I think Ole Kirk Christiansen realized
pretty quickly that it's a bit of a mistake

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.550
to work just in wood.
And then, as the company itself became more

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.650
popular, he realized that he should probably
be using something that could be mass manufactured,

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.909
and plastic came to mind.
So, "Lego" is actually two Danish words put

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:14.579
together -- 'leg' and 'godt' -- which stands
for "play well."

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:19.030
That's the loose translation in English.
And actually, at the time, Christiansen didn't

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.530
know, but there's a third translation in Latin,
which means "I put together." So actually

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.400
in three languages, "Lego" means the same
thing, which is -- it's kind of neat.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.360
And so, in 1958 -- this is actually the original
patent for the Lego brick.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.580
On top, you can see are the tubes which are
those little holes on bottom.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.819
And the bottom figure is actually for the
studs which are what click into the tubes

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:47.030
and allow Lego bricks to stick together.
And what's pretty amazing about this is, this

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.360
first patent that's from 1958 is actually
the same Lego brick we have today.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.590
So there's not a lot of products that I feel
like have stayed similar for so long, but

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.130
this one is one that has endured.
So Lego still makes a lot of very different

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.860
products.
They're starting to move into electronics

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.740
and robotics, which I'll talk about a bit
later.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:13.030
But, for now, they've really relied on having
things as an offshoot of this classic 2 x

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.020
4 plastic, blocky brick.
So the one you think of when you first think

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.800
of Lego is really the one that they started
with.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.340
And so, in 1961, Lego was looking at coming
to the United States.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.810
And when you're thinking about who would be
a natural partner for Lego in the U.S., obviously

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.250
your first thought is Samsonite, the luggage
maker. [laughter]

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.620
They had experience in both plastics as well
as retail sales.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.780
And so, Lego signed on to allow them to sell
their company's products in the U.S.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.220
Not surprisingly, Samsonite didn't do a particularly
good job of marketing Lego bricks to children

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.740
because I don't know how much crossover there
is between luggage purchasers and toy purchasers.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.930
And so, in 1973, Lego took back their franchise
and began licensing and marketing Lego in

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.710
the United States themselves.
And that's the beginning of when Lego really

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.860
started to take off.
But the true year that Lego really started

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:16.669
to seize the U.S. market was 1978, and that's
because that's the year I was born. [laughter]

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:22.900
And so, beyond me being born, Lego also made
a couple really important distinctions in

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.250
'78.
They introduced the Lego mini figure, which

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.139
you see here, although the first one had none
of these facial features or even arms.

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:34.440
He was a really simple guy.
And so, that was part of it -- that there

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.669
was this element of play to Lego that had
never been there before.

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:40.460
And then, in addition, they also introduced
themes.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:46.550
So this is the classic "space" theme.
There was also "castle" and "town." So what's

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.720
great is some of these initial themes -- this
is called the "Yellow Castle."

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:56.599
It's the first Lego set that was introduced
in '78 as a play theme in the United States.

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:01.870
And so, if you run across one of these at
a garage sale or on Ebay, you should buy it,

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.099
because it's, it's the kind of thing that
could fund your kid's college tuition in a

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:08.169
couple years.
Right now, this set probably goes for about

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:13.849
$1500 or $2,000 in mint condition, which -- if
you think about a Lego set in a store -- is

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:17.810
pretty incredible.
It's part a mix, I think, of sentimental value

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.221
and then also actual rarity.
So the nature of Lego bricks is that they

00:07:22.221 --> 00:07:24.740
all get jumbled up.
So the idea that somebody would not only keep

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:30.569
the original box and also all the pieces together,
that concept of collecting wasn't as developed

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:33.749
in '78.
And so, I think things, things like this just

00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:39.759
 -- you don't see very often.
So when I was 12, if you'd ask me what I wanted

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:42.030
to be, I would have said, "A master model
builder."

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:47.740
They're the guys who work for Lego at theme
parks and then also just for the company in

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.639
general building big, giant models of just
about everything you can imagine.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:55.040
And so, this is a picture of, of me and my
dad.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.960
Obviously, I'm much older than 12 in that
picture.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.389
This occurred after I'd started to get back
into researching the book.

00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:13.289
What's in that diorama box, which is on your
left, right -- my left -- is the Sears Tower

00:08:13.289 --> 00:08:18.069
that I built with my dad in fourth grade.
And that's part of the genesis for how the

00:08:18.069 --> 00:08:21.949
book came about, was -- Lego was a big part
of my childhood.

00:08:21.949 --> 00:08:27.920
But when I turned 12, I, I gave Lego up.
I found soccer and piano and all manner of

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.590
other things that you get into when you're
starting to grow up a bit.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:35.290
So those bricks went into the closet.
But what was great is, when I got back into

00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:40.380
it at 30 -- as I started to do some research
for the book -- Lego has a series of sets

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:45.000
that are called "Brick Structures," or "Lego
Architecture," which are actual re-creations

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.860
of the landmarks.
In this case, the Sears Tower.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.770
So 'Lego set' and 'my set' are both pictured
there.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:55.940
And I had the rare opportunity to go back
and build the Sears Tower again with my dad

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.560
18 years later.
And I feel like it was just a wonderful experience

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:05.510
for the two of us, because here we were building
as adults, but it was a bit like when he had

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:10.440
built with me when I was a kid.
And so, one of the things that really grabbed

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:17.160
me when I first started thinking about the
book was this, which is a Lego 22-foot Titanic.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.770
It's built entirely of Lego bricks.
It comes apart in three 7-foot sections.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.730
And it's built by an adult fan named Scott
Fowler.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:29.850
And it sort of triggered something in me -- the
"what, where, when, why" that are sort of

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:34.440
hardwired into journalists.
And I wanted to know why somebody could build

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.790
this, how they would go about building it,
and then, who would want to?

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:42.720
And what was great about that is there's a
period of time called the "Dark Ages," which

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.620
is what adult fans refer to when you give
up Lego bricks.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.280
So when you turn 12 or 13 or 14, you go into
the Dark Ages, and then, something pulls you

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.020
out of it.
And for those rare fans who continue to play,

00:09:55.020 --> 00:10:00.160
some might have Dim Ages where they make compromises,
and they continue to play with Lego bricks.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:05.160
Others will just play straight on through.
And it's actually a phenomenon that Lego recognizes

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.250
now.
So the, the company thinks of kid builders

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:12.030
 -- or "child" -- up to age 13.
And so, up to 13, you're safe, and you're

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.310
probably gonna keep building.
And then, 13 -- for whatever reason -- is

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.430
the magical age when you put it down and go
into the Dark Ages.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:22.930
So if you've made it past 13 and you still
play with Lego bricks, you're considered an

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.151
adult builder by Lego, and I'm, I'm jealous
of you.

00:10:25.151 --> 00:10:29.950
Because it was about 18 years that I didn't
have playing with Lego bricks in my life.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:37.130
So I feel like I'm making up for lost time.
And so, when I went back to a series of conventions

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:41.640
around the country -- adult fans hold conventions
like Trekkies, or comic book collectors like

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:46.920
Comic Con -- they're on a much smaller scale.
And this is actually the first thing I built

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.850
since I got back into Lego.
Appropriately, it's built with Lego Duplo

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:55.390
bricks, which are meant for preschoolers.
Like, you start at about age one and a half.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:59.060
That was right about my building skill level
at the time in 2008.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.460
And I think this is a great picture, because
I feel like it illustrates where I was then

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.790
and where I'm still about now.
In the foreground, you'll see what I termed

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:11.130
a "crocodile" or "alligator."
I like to think that it is recognizable as

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:14.311
such.
But in the 20 minutes that it took me to build

00:11:14.311 --> 00:11:20.160
that 7- or 8-piece figure, one of the adult
fans who was at that convention in Michigan

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.850
built a Tyrannosaurus Rex out of Duplo bricks.
And he wasn't bragging; he was just much better.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:30.740
And so, to me, it was illustrative of -- I
sort of saw that I had a long way to go.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:35.060
Because, at 30, it's very different to think
about becoming a master model builder than

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:40.770
it is at 12.
So, one of the great things is, as adults,

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:45.870
I think we bring a lot of our fan interests
and then also our experiences to what we build.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.911
And so, there are two huge camps among adult
fans of Lego.

00:11:49.911 --> 00:11:53.880
There are the "customizers."
And so, these are guys who build things like

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.260
the Ironman that you see behind me, which
is great.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.760
It's a standard mini fig.
So if you took that castle mini fig I showed

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.980
you earlier, you would use Brasso or something
abrasive on the chest to rub off any figures.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:10.460
And then, you would drill a hole through the
arm to insert a small aftermarket LED in the

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:16.560
chest, hands, and then, feet.
And, to me, it's almost like requiring surgery

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:23.870
or some incredibly complex skill in order
to turn a tiny mini figure into a tiny Ironman.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.640
But the idea here is that some people feel
limited by what Lego produces.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.750
So they say that there's only a certain number
of parts and colors and elements and I'm not

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.430
satisfied with that.
And I want an Ironman, so I'm going to go

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.080
build it.
But what I love is, there are people who are

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.850
purists.
And so, for them, the idea of cutting into

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:43.940
a mini figure and putting lights in it is
sacrilege.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:48.910
The idea that my dad and I painted and glued
the Sears Tower would make them shun me.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:54.270
And so, what's, what's neat about the purists
 -- just to show you for contrast -- is that

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.320
this is a piece that's built entirely out
of Lego elements.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.370
There's a builder named Jordan Schwartz.
He's an 18-year-old high school kid who just

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:06.380
graduated in Rhode Island.
This is built primarily out of Lego tires,

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:11.450
most of which are inverted so the two eyes,
and then, the bell or base of that octopus.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:15.000
But he built an octopus, which I think is
akin to sculpture.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.680
When I've shown it in previous slideshows,
people have thought it was made of clay or

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.610
something that wasn't just Lego elements,
but everything you see in there is from an

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.930
actual Lego set.
So the nice thing is, I think, depending on

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:30.100
who you're talking to -- whether it's a purist
or customizer -- it's very easy to be swayed

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.870
by their argument because of what they can
create.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:41.440
So now -- a lot of things that happen at conventions
 -- so for example, the next one coming up

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.290
is "BrickFair," which is in Washington, D.C
 -- are group displays.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:50.820
Adult fans tend to congregate by region or
get together online into what are called "LUGs"

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:55.100
 -- so, Lego User Groups.
And the great thing is, out of those lugs

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.450
and then also at conventions, there are these
huge group displays.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.360
This one is from a convention in Seattle called
"BrickCon."

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:09.450
And it's actually the Zombie Apocafest.
So it's displaying a theoretical zombie attack

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.660
on a blown-out city.
If you can see a yellow school bus in the

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:18.020
back, that is the best thing in the display
and it's because I built it. [laughter]

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:23.290
So what's fun about that is, the idea is everybody
builds on the same scale and brings pieces.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:29.000
So you'd bring a building or vehicle or even
just use your mini fig customization ability

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.020
to build zombie mini figs -- which, up until
this summer with the mini fig collectibles,

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:38.320
Lego had never made a zombie.
So it was up to you to either use your creativity

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:43.530
and repurpose troll pieces or to actually
sit down and build one out of clay and paint

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:47.800
and who knows what.
But what I like about conventions too is that,

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:52.370
you can also have individuals who have collections
large enough to make displays as large as

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.470
any group display.
And so, this is a builder named Brian Darrow

00:14:55.470 --> 00:15:01.720
out of Indianapolis who has a 33-foot display
called the "Blacktron Intelligence Agency."

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:06.970
It's based on a black and yellow space theme
from the 70s and 80s, and for him, this is

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:11.860
 -- it's great, because he, he literally sets
it up over the course of about 14 hours.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.830
And this is all just one guy's imagination
kind of run amuck.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:21.230
He has a collection of a couple hundred thousand
bricks -- a lot of which go into his display.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.640
And it's just as magnificent as that group
display that you saw.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.140
But you don't have to be constrained by how
many bricks you have.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.330
So you can build very small and still have
a pretty large impact.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:38.330
And when I was talking earlier about different
fandoms, the Harry Potter sets went into hibernation

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:42.180
for a few years based on licensing and movies.
And so, they're coming out with new sets in

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:46.040
October.
Lego just released the Harry Potter video

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.320
game sort of based on like the Star Wars,
Indiana Jones blocky theme.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.690
But this was at a convention in North Carolina
this year.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:59.450
It's a vignette of a Quidditch match.
And so, the players appear to be flying.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:03.250
They're on brooms.
And Lego did make Harry Potter figurines,

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:07.170
but they obviously didn't make a Quidditch
sort of vignette or style or setup.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:12.420
And so, here's someone who just wanted to
use what they saw as inspiration.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.061
And, in this case, it happened to be Harry
Potter.

00:16:14.061 --> 00:16:18.120
They built the whomping willow and the inside
of Hogwarts with flying letters.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.430
But I thought it sort of a wonderful example
of -- I mean, this looks like it could be

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:26.220
a set, and it's actually only on one green
base plate which you guys have upstairs in

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:30.730
the little Lego dump room.
So you can go ahead and build it yourself,

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:35.530
assuming you have all the parts.
Now, one of the things I was looking for was

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:40.350
the largest collection in the U.S.
And, and probably one of the best contenders

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.690
is a guy named Dan Brown who lives in Bellaire,
Ohio.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:47.660
And, and he has the unofficial Toy and Plastic
Brick Museum.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:52.840
And what's great about that is, he is a computer
recycler by trade who decided the thing he

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.040
wanted to do with his life was honor Lego
art and sculptures.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:02.280
So he bought not one, but two, middle schools
at auction in 2004 -- one, to store his Lego

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:07.289
collection and one to build a museum.
And what I love about Dan is, the one that

00:17:07.289 --> 00:17:12.500
holds his collection has about two million
bricks, which the average set has between

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:17.429
a hundred and a thousand -- 1500 -- bricks.
So, I mean, it's a lot of sets for him to

00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:20.839
accumulate that many bricks.
And then, the second setup is a middle school

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:25.179
that is slowly being transformed into a museum,
classroom by classroom.

00:17:25.179 --> 00:17:29.710
And so, each one has a theme or a setup.
This particular theme is from the zoo room.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:33.669
And so, it's a Winnie the Pooh that's behind
homemade chicken wire.

00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:38.179
And the great thing is, it's really like walking
into a middle school that is essentially the

00:17:38.179 --> 00:17:41.461
structural equivalent of that Sears Tower
diorama that I built.

00:17:41.461 --> 00:17:45.929
This is all ideas that come from Dan's mind
and then, he translates into building out

00:17:45.929 --> 00:17:49.730
his museum.
And so, you're walking around a place that

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:54.400
really -- I think -- takes you into somebody
else's mind or what they really love about

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.650
Lego art.
So, for example, in the basement, he has a

00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:02.210
robotic band called "Plastica" that used to
play at F.A.O. Schwartz in New York City -- that

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:07.429
I remember from when I was 12.
He told me it was $60,000 worth of robotics.

00:18:07.429 --> 00:18:11.010
And so, on a Sunday night in the middle of
summer, I'm sitting there listening to this

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:18.830
robotic band play Lego music in a middle school
gymnasium in front of what's now the World's

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:23.200
 â€“ world -- like Guinness Book of World
Records for the largest mosaic in the world,

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.050
which Dan holds.
And it's a tiny town of 5,000 on the border

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:29.679
of West Virginia.
And it's the kind of thing that I feel like

00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:34.990
nobody knows about, but in many respects is
an actual manifestation of just how excited

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:36.860
people build.
And Dan is on the cusp.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:41.419
This is the first generation of adult fans.
And so, for him, he really wants to preserve

00:18:41.419 --> 00:18:44.600
Lego art.
And one of the people who he wants to preserve

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:49.399
is a guy named Nathan Sawaya.
And Nathan designed the cover of my book.

00:18:49.399 --> 00:18:55.080
And he's a guy who has commissions, where
all he does -- he was a corporate lawyer who

00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:01.429
left his job to build Lego commissions.
This is actually a 10-foot speedboat that

00:19:01.429 --> 00:19:07.179
has a working rudder and tan bucket racecraft
seats that I helped move.

00:19:07.179 --> 00:19:12.629
It's about 250,000 Lego bricks, and it weighs
several hundred pounds.

00:19:12.629 --> 00:19:19.169
And, for about 30 minutes, it was on a 4-foot
wooden dock as we carried it over the Pacific

00:19:19.169 --> 00:19:22.519
Ocean out into the parking lot, because this
was at a convention in Seattle.

00:19:22.519 --> 00:19:26.159
So what was really exciting about that, if
it had dropped off the dock, it would have

00:19:26.159 --> 00:19:31.440
sunk immediately.
And so, Dan paid $5,000 for this model.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.909
And it's sort of the "What's going to happen
next with Lego art?"

00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:38.769
You know, trying to figure out what it's worth,
not only in terms of the actual value of the

00:19:38.769 --> 00:19:44.679
bricks themselves, but then for creating an
art piece out of a medium -- potentially anybody

00:19:44.679 --> 00:19:49.659
could build this boat, but as to whether they
have the skill, time, and bricks to do it

00:19:49.659 --> 00:19:53.399
is the question.
So -- What price do you put on Lego art?

00:19:53.399 --> 00:19:56.750
And then, Can Lego be art?
-- I feel like are some of the things being

00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:01.899
debated now.
And so, now, Nathan is an interesting guy

00:20:01.899 --> 00:20:04.559
in the sense that he worked as a master model
builder at Lego.

00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:07.320
He had my dream job.
And then, he left to go out on his own.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:14.370
He's one of 14 certified Lego professionals.
So they build commission jobs and I mean,

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:19.299
they really have a dream job from that perspective.
But one guy who was in his old position is

00:20:19.299 --> 00:20:23.679
named Gary McIntire.
And Gary's actually at Legoland in San Diego,

00:20:23.679 --> 00:20:27.929
just down the road.
And Gary gave me a tour of the park before

00:20:27.929 --> 00:20:29.590
it opened.
And he does something called "Park Check"

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:33.350
every morning.
So the idea is that he has to fix all of the

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:37.360
Lego models which get beaten up over the course
of the day just to make sure nobody gets hurt.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:42.460
And what I love about this is that here Gary
is fixing what they call a "maxi fig."

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:48.039
It's -- she's about 3-feet tall, just a scaled-up
version of a mini fig model that's built entirely

00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:51.580
out of Lego bricks.
Now, unfortunately for her, her nose was knocked

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:56.419
off because she, she has the sad distinction
of being located next to the only miniature

00:20:56.419 --> 00:21:00.169
golf course in Legoland.
And so, invariably, her nose lasts about two

00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:06.259
to three days because somebody decides to
take a mini golf club to her nose.

00:21:06.259 --> 00:21:09.590
But the nice thing is, she was not harmed.
And since she's made out of Lego, she can

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:14.110
be rebuilt in seconds.
And so, Gary is actually an adult fan of Lego

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:19.480
 -- as is Nathan and a lot of the people that
I met over the course of this book who are

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:24.720
working with Lego or attempting to figure
out how they can turn their passion for Lego

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:30.299
into a full-time job. And so, this is one
of the things that Gary built, which got a

00:21:30.299 --> 00:21:34.230
lot of press recently, is the inauguration
for President Obama.

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:39.799
And so, these are miniland scale figurines.
Everything in here is, is built to scale.

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:43.190
So, all of these guys would translate to about
6-foot people.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:47.240
If you're holding them in your hand, they're
three, three-and-a-half inches tall, depending

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.700
on what they are.
But it's a great visual depiction of different

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.480
sizes and scales.
There's Miniland, which is at the Legoland

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.370
park itself.
And there's Miniland, Las Vegas and Miniland,

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:03.520
New York -- so, actual creations of real places.
There's "mini fig scale," which is where you

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:08.920
build something four or six studs wide in
order to be attached to a mini fig driver

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.700
or just a house that would fit a mini fig
person.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:17.180
And then, there's maxi fig or just sort of
big, big ass building which doesn't have a

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:19.779
name.
So but, we'll go with "big ass building" from

00:22:19.779 --> 00:22:24.309
now on.
So then, another way that adult fans are working

00:22:24.309 --> 00:22:28.320
with Lego -- some of you may have seen this.
One of the first brick structure sets was

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.749
that Sears Tower that I mentioned.
This is actually Fallingwater.

00:22:31.749 --> 00:22:39.509
So it's an official Lego set that is same
as Frank Lloyd Wright's iconic building.

00:22:39.509 --> 00:22:43.129
What I love about this is, it, it changes
your perception about Lego a bit in the sense

00:22:43.129 --> 00:22:45.919
that this is something that's meant to be
built and displayed.

00:22:45.919 --> 00:22:52.029
You're probably not gonna take it apart.
And to some degree it's become a niche hit

00:22:52.029 --> 00:22:57.919
with architects and designers because there
are genuine design elements at work here.

00:22:57.919 --> 00:23:00.769
And it's also a bit of something that's easy
to fetishize.

00:23:00.769 --> 00:23:05.110
I think you can look at it and sort of have
a, a great appreciation.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:09.360
And so, it's built by Adam Reed Tucker, who's
a former architect out of Chicago.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.611
And now this is his sole business where he
builds what are called "Brick Structures."

00:23:13.611 --> 00:23:17.399
The latest one is the "White House," that
just came out last month.

00:23:17.399 --> 00:23:22.200
And it's some of the examples of how Lego
is working with adult fans in order to try

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.650
and figure out ways to leverage either their
building skills or their interests and see

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:32.390
is there a way for them to have a partnership?
Now, I've shown you a lot of examples of things

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:36.110
that people do very well.
But I think it's important -- it's easy to

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:39.879
be intimidated when you see great things.
And so, this is something that I built.

00:23:39.879 --> 00:23:43.340
And I think it's important that -- it's fairly
recognizable.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:49.090
The yellow thing is a, is a whale, and the
white, yellow, and red thing is a camel.

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:52.509
You probably could guess one of the two of
those by looking at that.

00:23:52.509 --> 00:23:56.401
But I'd show this for one very particular
reason, 'cause I think it's important.

00:23:56.401 --> 00:24:00.110
And the adult fan community is extraordinarily
welcoming.

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:05.360
And to them, it's a bit like Little League
where participation matters more than skill.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:10.690
And so, I think my sort of ending note or
the thing I want to suggest to you is that

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:14.669
you don't have to build well as an adult in
order to be a part of this community; you

00:24:14.669 --> 00:24:18.919
just have to build.
So, find the thing that you like doing -- whether

00:24:18.919 --> 00:24:23.309
it's Harry Potter or something else like whales
 -- and give it a shot.

00:24:23.309 --> 00:24:26.919
'Cause I think it's very easy to be self-critical
as an adult.

00:24:26.919 --> 00:24:30.490
Thirty-year-old me is very different than
12-year-old me, because I sit and look at

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:35.190
what I build and I judge it the entire time.
So I think you have to try and put that aside.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:39.460
And Mark had mentioned to me that there's
a nice thing here, "the ugly baby syndrome"

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:44.889
 -- where you can hold onto something because
you, you really don't want to show it.

00:24:44.889 --> 00:24:47.190
And then, when you do, you get worried about
that criticism.

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:51.179
But you'll find I think that most people are
willing to tell you how to improve something

00:24:51.179 --> 00:24:55.090
as opposed to focusing on the shortcomings.
So I encourage you all to build.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:58.320
I've had a wonderful experience since coming
out of my Dark Ages.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.950
And with that, I'd just like to turn it over
to the few questions that you guys asked in

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:05.350
advance, and then, open it right up to the
rest of the panel.

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:09.620
I'll read them first just so you have an idea
what people asked, and then, hopefully answer

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:12.649
them.
If whoever asked them is here and feels like

00:25:12.649 --> 00:25:17.419
I didn't cover it properly, call me to task
and I'll see what I can do.

00:25:17.419 --> 00:25:21.289
So, the first question that somebody asked
was if I had any experience with Mindstorms

00:25:21.289 --> 00:25:25.179
and FIRST LEGO League.
And so, the honest answer with that is very

00:25:25.179 --> 00:25:29.380
very little.
When I was researching the, the book, I went

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:34.559
to one FIRST LEGO League meeting.
And it taught me that I would have to, I think,

00:25:34.559 --> 00:25:39.889
go to about 50 to understand exactly what
FIRST LEGO League entails and to become proficient

00:25:39.889 --> 00:25:43.509
about it.
And so, I ended my FIRST LEGO League participation

00:25:43.509 --> 00:25:47.960
at that one meeting.
But one of the interesting things about Mindstorms

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.881
to me -- which is Lego robotics, for those
of you who don't know -- is that, adult fans

00:25:51.881 --> 00:25:56.210
have had a big role in shaping how Mindstorms
have come to play.

00:25:56.210 --> 00:26:01.330
So the first version of Mindstorms Robotics
Invention Systems debuted in 1998, and it

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:05.389
was wildly successful for Lego.
It's one of the reasons the company is as

00:26:05.389 --> 00:26:09.259
successful as it is today and it has managed
to transition to a digital space, because

00:26:09.259 --> 00:26:14.159
it showed that Lego was capable of applying
its principles to the world we live in today.

00:26:14.159 --> 00:26:18.869
And then, in the same light, it tapped into
this need for math and science education.

00:26:18.869 --> 00:26:23.369
And so, as Lego looked at the sales numbers
for those first million units that they sold,

00:26:23.369 --> 00:26:27.669
they discovered something incredible. The
adult fan market is typically five percent

00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:31.960
of the total of people buying Lego.
So only five percent of people are actually

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:36.790
adults who buy Lego bricks.
But for the Robotics Invention Systems -- for

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:42.169
this Mindstorm stuff -- it was 50 percent.
They dubbed these adults the "shadow market,"

00:26:42.169 --> 00:26:45.619
because there were as many adults buying robotics
kits as kids.

00:26:45.619 --> 00:26:50.929
And so they reached out to some of the more
proficient and/or visible adults sort of Oceans

00:26:50.929 --> 00:26:53.549
Eleven style.
So the idea was they wanted to get somebody

00:26:53.549 --> 00:26:58.399
who knew software and somebody who knew hardware.
And they flew four guys out to form the initial

00:26:58.399 --> 00:27:03.440
Mindstorms Users Panel.
And those four guys really helped guide some

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:09.149
of the development for the second iteration
which is Mindstorms NXT that came out in 2006.

00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:13.429
And so what's great about that, it was the
first example of Lego really reaching out

00:27:13.429 --> 00:27:17.830
to adult fans in order to develop a product
 -- both internally and externally.

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:22.269
So a lot of those guys still act as ambassadors
for the product and are in stores teaching

00:27:22.269 --> 00:27:25.649
people how to use it.
And then, in the same light, shepherded the

00:27:25.649 --> 00:27:29.659
change from studded to studless building.
So, it's very different.

00:27:29.659 --> 00:27:34.799
In the Mindstorms NXT, there's no studs -- it's
all teknik, which are pins and holes -- and

00:27:34.799 --> 00:27:37.559
if we're getting too technical here, please
let me know.

00:27:37.559 --> 00:27:41.629
But you went away from that studs and tubes
system that I showed you earlier -- that patent.

00:27:41.629 --> 00:27:46.620
And so it represents really a whole new system
of Lego building even if it's founded on the

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:51.470
same Lego principles.
So, the second question that was asked talked

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:57.340
about -- so it said, "Do you keep original
sets apart or mix them?

00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:00.259
And if you mix, do you sort first by color
or shape?

00:28:00.259 --> 00:28:06.490
And which is the one true religion?" [laughter]
So, the answer is, I think, among adult fans

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:11.149
of Lego, the one true religion has something
to do with midi-chlorians and/or Jedis.

00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:15.110
There's a lot of Star Wars geeks. That was
my joke.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:19.639
And so, the real joy of that is that I think
you try and keep things separate, but you

00:28:19.639 --> 00:28:24.720
never can, because Lego bricks end up in a
big Sterilite or Tupperware tub.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.830
And they're under your bed or they're in the
closet.

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:31.730
There's sort of no way to keep sets separate
unless -- I think a lot of adult fans just

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:37.379
adopt a strategy of buying multiples and they
are emphatic and/or sort of militaristic about

00:28:37.379 --> 00:28:40.690
separating it out.
So this is my set that I'm going to put together

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:44.509
and this is my set that I'm never going to
open and this is my set that I'm going to

00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:46.749
part out.
And so, before you know it, you're buying

00:28:46.749 --> 00:28:52.260
four and five copies of a set, which at thirty
to a hundred dollars -- yeah -- can be, delightfully

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:56.419
expensive.
But in, in many ways is possibly the only

00:28:56.419 --> 00:29:01.950
way that you can keep everything separate
 -- is to sort of be a bit -- I guess maniac-al

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:05.730
or maniacal about what you're doing.
But other than that, I think you just have

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:08.899
to embrace the idea that things are going
to get mixed.

00:29:08.899 --> 00:29:12.570
And then, that's which leads to the third
question which is about sorting.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:20.419
And so, the sorting question I enjoyed, because
it talks about, "if you sort by color or shape."

00:29:20.419 --> 00:29:23.830
And so, you start with color. That's the easiest
for everybody.

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:28.389
It's the most distinct.
Yellow goes in one bin, blue goes in another.

00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:31.309
And then, there comes a point where you can't
find anything to build what you want.

00:29:31.309 --> 00:29:36.649
So then you move on to shape, and you sort
by part or element piece.

00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:40.129
So there's a lot of different names.
And one of the things that was most daunting

00:29:40.129 --> 00:29:43.499
when I was researching the book was about
the language of adult fans.

00:29:43.499 --> 00:29:49.869
The names for specific bricks are multivaried
and confusing and change from region and country.

00:29:49.869 --> 00:29:54.559
And so, for example, there are the flat ones
which some might call "flats."

00:29:54.559 --> 00:29:56.669
Other people call "plates." That's their actual
name.

00:29:56.669 --> 00:30:01.830
And then, there's "bricks" and "slopes," which
is anything that has an actual slope on it.

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:06.850
So when you start sorting by piece or element,
then you break it out according to that.

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:10.679
So now you had two iterations of sorting -- one
by color, one by piece.

00:30:10.679 --> 00:30:13.309
And you've gotten to the same place where
you just can't find anything while you're

00:30:13.309 --> 00:30:15.869
building.
And you're spending as much time rifling your

00:30:15.869 --> 00:30:20.580
hands through a tub as you are actually building.
So now, you move to what you would consider

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:25.220
to be like the real advanced stage, which
is sorting by part and color.

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:29.860
And that's really, you're starting to be a
pro, because you are buying specific things

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:34.950
at hardware shops or hobby lobbies.
And they look like the nuts and bolts containers

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:39.190
that are segregated so they're plastic.
And you just keep having smaller and smaller

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:42.169
groupings of parts because you need to keep
things more specific.

00:30:42.169 --> 00:30:46.470
Your house begins to look like a garage.
And by this point, your collection has overgrown

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:48.860
one room and it's threatening to take over
your entire house.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:52.870
It's a bit like the blob.
And then, the problem is now you think you're

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:55.020
done.
But you're gonna come to a point where once

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:58.389
again, you can't find anything.
So that shouldn't be possible, but it is,

00:30:58.389 --> 00:31:03.489
because you keep buying Lego bricks.
It's sort of an addiction.

00:31:03.489 --> 00:31:06.909
Just Lego bricks attach -- attract each other
like magnets.

00:31:06.909 --> 00:31:10.229
And once you have a little bit, you tend to
have a lot.

00:31:10.229 --> 00:31:14.519
And so, that final sorting phase is where
you actually are sorting by individual piece.

00:31:14.519 --> 00:31:19.619
It's not enough to just do shape and color.
It's like every piece gets their own tiny

00:31:19.619 --> 00:31:22.019
compartment.
And when you've reached that point, you're

00:31:22.019 --> 00:31:27.200
basically a master model builder. So, congrats.
I mean, that part is -- there is an element

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.600
that your building skill ideally will improve
with sorting.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:35.100
And then, the last question that was here
was about the design program.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:39.609
And it said, "Is there a particular design
program that I'd recommend for building things?

00:31:39.609 --> 00:31:43.450
And then, specifically, vehicles."
So you basically have two options -- both

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:49.119
of which are 3D modeling or CAD-based programs.
The first is actually Lego's own program.

00:31:49.119 --> 00:31:54.889
It's called Lego Digital Designer. It's LDD.
And that's on Lego's website.

00:31:54.889 --> 00:31:57.609
They have a program that's factory and designed
by me.

00:31:57.609 --> 00:32:02.549
So the idea is, you can use any parts that
are on their site to design your own set or

00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:07.039
kit or creation.
And then, you'll get customized building instructions,

00:32:07.039 --> 00:32:11.929
and they'll mail you all the pieces.
And you are basically your own set designer.

00:32:11.929 --> 00:32:16.269
What's neat about that is, it lets you be
as creative as you want and gives you the

00:32:16.269 --> 00:32:20.009
opportunity to see some 3D modeling tricks
or techniques and work with that.

00:32:20.009 --> 00:32:23.559
I think that's where you should start, but
I don't think that's where you should finish.

00:32:23.559 --> 00:32:30.869
The best one you can use is called LDraw.
It's just at LDraw.org. and it has a larger

00:32:30.869 --> 00:32:34.039
element and color palette.
So the beauty of that is, you're not constrained

00:32:34.039 --> 00:32:39.200
by what Lego sells on their website, but instead,
you can use any of the parts that are in Lego's

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.450
universe.
So the idea is similar to how you would add

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:46.539
something to Google maps.
I saw the 3D version of the Google map and

00:32:46.539 --> 00:32:51.580
somebody can render a picture of the pavilion.
People can render individual parts and add

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:54.669
them to LDraw.
So suddenly you're working with a really rich

00:32:54.669 --> 00:32:58.980
composition of things.
And you end up with a, a 3D mockup of what

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:02.859
it is that you want to build that has the
same capability as a Lego's website.

00:33:02.859 --> 00:33:06.519
So you can have customs instructions if you
wanted to give it to somebody else, and you

00:33:06.519 --> 00:33:10.409
can also break it out by what parts you've
used, which is really helpful for ordering.

00:33:10.409 --> 00:33:14.039
So there's a secondary marketplace called
BrickLink.com.

00:33:14.039 --> 00:33:18.210
And that works exactly like Ebay.
So if you found that you needed 50 white pieces

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:23.679
 -- rather than having to buy 50 sets, you
can just go to BrickLink and order those specific

00:33:23.679 --> 00:33:29.769
parts so that way you can build your Ecto-1.
And, at this point, you guys have been exhausted

00:33:29.769 --> 00:33:33.860
of your pre questions.
I hope I've inspired some new ones. Are there?

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:42.090
Q: I have a funny story.
A friend of mine from grad school went to

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:50.340
work -- I guess as a consultant -- to build,
Lego company -- to work on vision algorithms

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:56.059
for identifying Lego pieces for sorting them
out so they could like straighten out the

00:33:56.059 --> 00:34:01.070
mess the builders had made at the end of the
day. Failed totally. [laughter]

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:03.749
A: I'll be in back.
And I'm glad to talk to any of you more, but

00:34:03.749 --> 00:34:04.749
thank you guys for your time today.

00:34:04.749 --> 00:34:04.750
&gt;&gt; [applause]
