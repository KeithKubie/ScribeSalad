00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:03.700
PROFESSOR: There's other kinds
of bogus proofs that come up.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.500
Let's just run through
this one quickly.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.020
Here's a fact that you
about, roots of polynomials.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.260
Every polynomial has
two roots, at least

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.490
over the complex
numbers, over c.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.700
And how do you prove that?

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.490
Well, you just write down
the formulas for the roots.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.910
You know the quadratic formula.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.392
One root is a minus b
plus this square root

00:00:21.392 --> 00:00:22.620
of this quantity of 2a.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.250
And the other root is minus
b minus this square root

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.926
of b squared minus 4ac over 2a.

00:00:27.926 --> 00:00:29.300
And that's the
end for the proof.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.800
You can just plug-in
this formula for r1

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.710
for x into this
polynomial and it

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.107
would simplify to
be equal to 0, which

00:00:38.107 --> 00:00:39.190
shows that this is a root.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.400
You could plug that one
into this formula for x

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.240
and simplify algebraically
and discover it was 0,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.070
proving that r2 is a root.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.660
We've just proved that every
polynomial has two roots.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.130
Well, that's not true.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.440
We haven't proved it.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.185
This is a proof by
calculation that has problems.

00:00:56.185 --> 00:00:58.560
What's the problem? well let's
look at a counter example.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.690
What about the polynomial
0x squared plus 0x plus 1?

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.830
It doesn't have any roots.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.090
It's just a constant 1 which
never crosses the origin.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.810
So it's got no roots.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.420
What about 0x squared
plus 1x plus 1?

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:21.200
Well that's 45 degree
line, the y equals x line,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.630
and it only crosses
the origin once.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.770
It has only one root.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.730
What happened to the
two formulas, r1 and r2?

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.240
And the answer
was, in this case,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.040
we had to divide by 0 error.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.500
If you look at that
formula, there's a quotient,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.700
there's a denominator of 2a.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.310
Divide by 0 and these
formulas don't work right.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.740
They aren't the roots.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.140
And so implicitly, in
order to have two roots,

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.510
we need to assume that the
denominator, a, the leading

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.600
coefficient of the
polynomial is not 0.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.120
So that fixes those two bugs.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.420
Is that all?

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.580
Well, no, because look
at this polynomial.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.270
1x squared plus 0x
plus 0 has one root.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.280
The only possible
root of this is 0.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.830
Because if you look
at this, the only way

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.330
to get 1 times something
plus 0 to equals 0

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.920
is if the something is 0.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.200
So there's only one root.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.350
And what's going on here?

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.280
Well, what's happened is that
in this case, the two formulas,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.710
r1 and r2, which were
different formulas, evaluate

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.640
to the same thing when b
is 0 and c is 0 and a is 1.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.120
And that's why they look
like different formulas

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.900
but they evaluate to the same
thing so there's only one root.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.050
The fix to that is to
require the quantity

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.940
by which the two
root formulas, r1

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.910
and r2 differ to be non-zero.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.860
And that's the quantity that we
were taking the square root of,

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.420
the discriminant it's called.
b squared minus 4ac needs

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.290
to be 0 and then r1
and r2 will differ

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.780
and we will get the two roots.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.260
Now, there's still
a complication.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.740
It sounds like
we've now verified

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.167
that indeed our
proof by calculation

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:15.250
is correct now that we've
put in these qualifiers,

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.360
that a is positive
and d is non-zero.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.225
But what happens if d is
non-zero but negative?

00:03:22.225 --> 00:03:23.600
It's an interesting
complication.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.250
And let's look at the
formula, x squared plus 1,

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.340
where b squared minus 4ac
is going to be minus 3.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.130
And that will turn out
to have two roots, namely

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.500
i and minus i.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.740
And it's not possible
to tell which

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.770
is which. r1 is taking the
square root of minus 1,

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.589
and r2 is taking the
square root of minus 1.

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:50.630
One of them is adding the
square root of minus 1.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.926
The other one's subtracting
the square root of minus 1.

00:03:52.926 --> 00:03:54.300
But which square
root of minus 1?

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.390
There's no way to tell
the difference between i

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.235
and minus i, abstractly.

00:03:58.235 --> 00:04:00.630
They both behave the same way.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.640
And so we have an ambiguity
about which one is r1

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.480
and which one is r2.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.860
It doesn't hurt at
all for the theorem

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.210
that r1 and r2 are different.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.030
And so there are two roots.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.830
But ambiguity can
be problematic.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.850
And let me give you an
illustration of that.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.740
When there's ambiguity,
I can do things

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.540
like proving easily that
1 is equal to minus 1.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.930
Here's the proof.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.870
And I will let you contemplate
that and try to figure out just

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.680
where in this reasoning
that step by step

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.460
seems pretty reasonable,
but nevertheless I've

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.540
concluded that 1 is equal
to minus 1, which is absurd.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.310
It's taking
advantage of the fact

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.450
that you don't know whether
the square root of minus 1

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.040
means i or minus i.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.730
So the moral of all of
this is that, first of all,

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.490
be sure that you are
applying the rules properly.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.100
There's an assumption of
an algebraic rule in there

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.860
that isn't true.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.920
And again, that kind
of mindless calculation

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.420
is risky when you don't really
understand what you're doing,

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.190
you don't have a clear memory
of what the exact rules are.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.080
So it's understanding
that bails you out

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.080
of this kind of blunder.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.170
Let's look at 1 equals
minus 1 a little

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.190
because it lets us wrap
up with an amusing remark.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.740
What's terrible about
1 equals minus 1?

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.212
Well, it's false, and you
don't want to ever conclude

00:05:23.212 --> 00:05:24.170
something that's false.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.040
That's worrisome.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.620
It's disastrous
when you conclude

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.620
that something is false.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.700
Let me give you an
illustration of why.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.290
Because let's suppose the 1
is equal to minus 1 and let's

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.640
reason in a correct
from that assumption

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.380
that we have falsely proved.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.630
But let's assume that we
start off with the assumption

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.670
that 1 is minus 1.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.880
Well, if I multiply both
sides of an equation

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.260
by the same thing, it's equal.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.730
So I can multiply
both sides by 1/2,

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.230
and I get 1/2 is
equal to minus 1/2.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.970
Now I can also add the
same thing to both sides.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.260
That's a perfectly sound move
for reasoning about equalities.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.485
If I add 3/2 to both sides, I've
turn 1 equals minus 1 into 2

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.640
is equal to 1.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.210
Now I'm in great shape to
prove all kinds of things.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.280
Here's a famous one.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.000
"Since I am the
Pope are clearly 2,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.220
we conclude that I
and the Pope are one.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.920
That is, I am the Pope."

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.830
And I've just proved to
you this absurd fact.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.500
This is a joke
that's attributed--

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.770
a witty remark that's
attributed to Bertrand

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.770
Russell, the famous philosopher,
logician, pacifist, Nobel Prize

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.420
winner, who supposedly was
approached by some socialite

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.920
at a party who had heard
that mathematicians thought

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.991
that if 1 is equal to minus 1
then you could prove anything.

00:06:37.991 --> 00:06:40.240
And so she challenged him,
prove that you're the Pope.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.610
And supposedly Russell, who
was a notoriously quick wit,

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.964
came up with this example.

00:06:45.964 --> 00:06:47.130
Who knows whether it's true.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.510
It's a good story.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.410
There's a picture
of the great man.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.970
And you might care
to learn more about

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.092
this remarkable contributor
to logic, and philosophy,

00:06:59.092 --> 00:07:00.990
and politics.
