00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And again, if you think of a program as a succession of states that passing assertion

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
can immediately tell you that there is large parts of the state

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
where the infection cannot have taken place.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If these were the time object in your state, you would know that all of them have correct values

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
because none of their assertions has failed.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
One problem, however, remains without time class.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You can still pass floating point numbers as arguments here

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and then get an error while we're trying to print the time.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So here is your programming exercise, extend the code such that all parameters up here

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
are automatically converted into integers.
