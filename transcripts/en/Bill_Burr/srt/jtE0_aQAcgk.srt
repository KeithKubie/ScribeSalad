1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:01,420
Okay.

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,510
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:04,511 --> 00:00:09,130
Just before Friday, Monday morning
podcast and I'm checking in on Ya.

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,230
I know my voice is still fucked up.

5
00:00:11,231 --> 00:00:15,760
I'll be back or maybe I shredded it
for life. What am I doing right now?

6
00:00:15,761 --> 00:00:19,540
I'm sitting on a pullout couch and
what is supposed to be my office,

7
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:24,290
but no work gets done in here. Um,
yeah. I'm just fucking chilling out.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,130
I got a little half a grapefruit
here then I'm going to eat later.

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,690
Cause all freckles is a fat
fuck and he's turning it around.

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,040
That's what I'm doing. I'm turning around.

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,880
I'm not going to try to blame Hollywood
for fucking given me an impossible body

12
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:44,280
image to live up to. I'm going
to, I'm going to use it as a goal.

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,130
All these fucking pussies out there now
a days. Whoa. That's too hard. Yeah,

14
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:53,360
it is hard. Eat An apple.
Get your fat ass at the gym.

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:54,740
Okay.

16
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,580
That's what America needs right
there. Now for this fucking,

17
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,200
okay.

18
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,050
I don't know what this patty cake,
we're plug and play with everybody.

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,120
Jesus fucking Christ. You live in a
great country. There's too many cookies.

20
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,200
All right? No that and leave the
house. It's all you gotta do.

21
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:19,190
Fucking sitting here blaming RBS for
your fat ass. Huh? Hating on those.

22
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,090
Those fucking Victoria's
secret models are, uh,

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,410
whoever the new fucking Brad Pitt guy
is with his fucking eight pack. Ah.

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,250
Oh, that's been airbrushed.
Oh fuck you. You Fat.

25
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,490
You ain't a big king every
fucking day for the last 20 days.

26
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:41,320
That's your problem. It's not
society. It's that you have a car.

27
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,530
They have a drive through and
you have singles in your wallet.

28
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,570
Where are you going to spend it? Drive
your fat ass down to the supermarket.

29
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:51,210
Just like my doughy midsection.

30
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,470
I'm bringing it down there
looking like the fucking freckled.

31
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,620
Imagine the Pillsbury Pillsbury
dough boy with like freckles.

32
00:01:56,621 --> 00:01:59,020
That's what I'm looking right
now by my fucking shirt on.

33
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,650
Put on a good 12 pounds, a
writers' room weight. You know,

34
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,430
you know what I like to go for? I
like the Hershey's many inches, right?

35
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:09,640
Get that fucking sugar rush.
Then I'm like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

36
00:02:09,641 --> 00:02:11,500
Then I eat a handful of fucking pretzels.

37
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,670
Bring me back down with the salt and
then where am I? Oh, late night. Oh,

38
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:18,160
we're working late again. Did I
all, let's get a fucking pizza.

39
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,930
I'm just going to have one slice,

40
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,070
four slices hot right
down the fucking pie hall.

41
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,760
And who am I blaming? Huh? My blaming
those whores on Instagram. I'm not,

42
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,620
not me. I'll take a responsibility
for my gluttonous acts.

43
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,030
I am a fucking ONA. I'm not
a mess. I'm turning around.

44
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,663
Okay.

45
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,310
Old Daddy, white legs here. Get
up to almost a buck 86 you know,

46
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,140
now I'm back down to a buck 82 my goal
is just to be in the one seventies but

47
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,550
I'm in the fucking one seventies by
the time we're done with the next two

48
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:57,730
episodes. Right? A couple, two or three
pounds of the next two weeks. Right.

49
00:02:57,731 --> 00:03:01,270
I can do that shit even though
the of July is coming up. Right.

50
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,010
And that's the big day we celebrate
Independence Day. You know,

51
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,620
wasn't that the day we had the fight
with the British and we said a one if by

52
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:15,610
land two of spicy and get those
native Americans off my property.

53
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,600
Isn't that, isn't that what
happened on that day? Um,

54
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,740
we declared independence
from England on July 4th,

55
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,440
1776. We were like, we're
sick of you oppressing us.

56
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,720
We would like to be the oppresses and
it's took us almost 300 years to get there

57
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,560
and God dammit, what dealt with doing
it as good as England ever did it.

58
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,340
Take that Fuckos

59
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,553
um,

60
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,520
anyways, got to drink the throat coat tea.

61
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:49,160
I don't know why I never drank
this before. I can tell you,

62
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:51,590
you know something that's fucking
delicious as a God damn grapefruit,

63
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,500
not a regular grapefruit.
A goddamn grapefruit.

64
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,720
They're right next to the Sunkist.
You go in there, you, hey,

65
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,260
you got a goddamn grapefruit. I'm sorry.
We only have Sunkist and then you say,

66
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:03,530
well fuck you buddy. Fuck
you. When you create a salary.

67
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,460
That's what I'm back to salary at night.
My little scoop of fucking peanut,

68
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,590
right. I'm six months into this year.
My drinking's back under control,

69
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,230
not that will bring your drinking back
under control like eight fucking corona

70
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:21,770
lights that somebody left at my
fucking fridge, Jesus Christ.

71
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,460
But slowly knocking those things back
one a day and it's just such a horrible

72
00:04:27,741 --> 00:04:30,920
experience. By the end of it, it's like
I did, not only do I not want another,

73
00:04:30,921 --> 00:04:34,900
I don't think I ever want to drink
again, you know? Oh, so whatever.

74
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,480
So I'm only had one cigar this month,

75
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,140
so I've had nine for the
year, so that's good. Right?

76
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,120
It's going to go off the rail soon, right.

77
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,000
We've got 4th of July and then I got
fucking the European brand coming up,

78
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,800
you know, and uh,

79
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,020
I was on a flight and I somehow discovered
this part of Ciga affection that Oh,

80
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,010
um, it's places to smoke. Few like cigars,

81
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:06,011
people go on cigar affection out or.com
and you click on search cigar aficionado

82
00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:12,560
oneF who know? Um, I thought it was
spelled like after with two F's.

83
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,100
Right? I'm kidding. I just love all the
people when I play up, how stupid I am.

84
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:19,000
They just love, you
know, you guys dominant.

85
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,890
You're right next to me
at the Applebee's, right?

86
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,050
Just order your fried
fucking pickles. You can't,

87
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,350
um, [inaudible]

88
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,370
scarf.

89
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:32,370
Actually not a oneF as in fuck
and a Google places to smoke.

90
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,100
I mean, it's just, it's
fucking, it's incredible. So

91
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,140
I've, um, I've done that all across
Europe, but I just did it like every,

92
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:46,020
like fifth city or something. So I don't
go off the rails when I'm over there.

93
00:05:46,021 --> 00:05:49,680
So I've got a couple of days in
London, I'm going to smoke there,

94
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,970
and then I think I'm just gonna fucking
haul ass for the rest of the trip and

95
00:05:53,971 --> 00:05:57,480
maybe take a few days off, a
little vacation, little holiday,

96
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,930
you know, somewhere down
the Mediterranean, right.
Look at all fancy freckles.

97
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,710
You like this? What a fucking life.
Flunked everything in high school. Huh?

98
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,350
You need two years of a
language. No, you don't.

99
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,420
You just need to be a silly comment and
have enough people get into you and all

100
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:15,650
of a sudden you too.

101
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,030
You too can not add up how much your
vacation costs and then get a credit card

102
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:24,140
bill. It'd be like, Ooh, what the
fuck? That's one of my favorite things.

103
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,850
I might sound a little more jovial
than usual. There's a reason for that.

104
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,240
There is a fod as a fucking reason
is the great Sam Kinison would say.

105
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,050
I um, I uh, I finally bought a car.

106
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,780
Daddy bought a whip. Oh look who's here.

107
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:45,470
The Levenia just in time for me
to talk about my new fucking car.

108
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,550
Let's turn up the Mike Nini.
I gotta tell you I bought,

109
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,560
you know when I bought yes, I
bought the BMW bitch magnet.

110
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,820
That's what it's called. No, I
didn't buy a BMW. I bought a Jaguar.

111
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,340
Um, and I ordered it.
I bought a Jag and I,

112
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,590
and I ordered the color cause I didn't
want to be another douche driving a

113
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:07,011
black,

114
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:12,011
white or fucking red car as
they make calls me driving a,

115
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,090
what does that British racing green.
Yeah, like every was supposed to be,

116
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,420
oh, you're hating. You hate on me
right now. It's fucking beautiful.

117
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,190
Cold freezing in here. You notice
that I'm wearing like, oh you're,

118
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,310
you're fucking Apollo 13 jacket. Yeah,

119
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,010
go turn off the AC bombers. Well, cause
it was, it was hot as hell on you. Oh,

120
00:07:33,011 --> 00:07:36,050
okay. Yeah, I'm a white.
The cold doesn't affect me.

121
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,760
You know how I get on the beach and
look like I'm having heat stroke.

122
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,020
You're sitting there frolicking
around. Why isn't this great?

123
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:47,030
I'm under that giant fucking umbrella

124
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,160
looking like it was my final wish to go
to the beach for the first time ever in

125
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:56,120
my life, it of my life. Remember that guy?

126
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,720
Do you know what somebody
told me to buy on the, uh,

127
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,150
on the old inner web there? Is
Richard Wrong? He says, yeah,

128
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:09,170
downstairs saying in her webs. I love
when he says that. Why I love that guy.

129
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,080
Get Yourself. Because I look at him going,

130
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,290
he flunked everything in high
school too, and he still made it.

131
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,640
They put so much emphasis
on being smart in school.

132
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:21,690
You don't have to be
everything in school. What was,

133
00:08:21,691 --> 00:08:24,170
when I say I flunked
everything up the ceiling,

134
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,990
the glass ceiling I couldn't
push through was cs.

135
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,480
And then there was a bunch
of ds and then just the, uh,

136
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:35,210
the math was just the old right
there, Fred. Ugh. What about,

137
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:39,770
I've never shown you my fucking,
I think I still, I have this desk,

138
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:41,930
my parents don't throw anything
out. It's still in there.

139
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:44,330
And every once in a while there's
this little thing and I open it up to,

140
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,660
oh my God. Really? Oh, I
was showing you all my,

141
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,220
my achievements certificates.
Yeah. Oh, opposites attract Neil.

142
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,990
But it's like a, it's a
bunch of C's and easiest.

143
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,480
It's like English and stuff
like that. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

144
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,110
I stopped going. I stopped
getting A's and B's. Right.

145
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:07,620
I did well until through junior high.

146
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,210
And then when it counted

147
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,580
when the fucking colleges were
gonna have to do more than share,

148
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,541
the greatest thing,

149
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:20,160
the greatest thing I ever
did was completely fuck up
in high school because why?

150
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,600
Because of I did well, if I
did well and I lived the dream

151
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,053
like,

152
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,660
and I w I got accepted into a big time
college that had a great fucking football

153
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:39,081
program and I joined a Frat and I had
penny loafers with no socks on and all

154
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:42,270
that. Just live in the white guy dream.

155
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,200
We definitely wouldn't
be right if I did that.

156
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,920
Like I,

157
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,850
I just think I would have been doing
so well in life that getting into this

158
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:57,090
business never would have dawned
on me. I would've been like, well,

159
00:09:57,091 --> 00:10:01,140
I can't leave. Right. I'm
driving a convertible Audi.

160
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,850
I got a, I got the extra special cubicle
and I don't think I would've done it,

161
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:10,851
but the fact that I fucked up so bad that
my options were only going part time,

162
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:18,170
two low level schools and unloading trucks
that then going and doing an open mic

163
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,610
that wasn't as scary. Like what was
I walking away from? That's true.

164
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,960
Lower back pain. I mean, look at me
now. I Erica, I think it's curious. Um,

165
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,250
penny loafers with no socks. I feel
like that's a big red flag to me.

166
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,490
Like there's just something
about it that I just, yeah,

167
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,520
it's like when black people
weren't loafers with no socks.

168
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:41,340
That's like on w certain white
people see black guys in hoodies.

169
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,480
It's the same thing. Yeah,
it is. I said, well, no,

170
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:47,940
it isn't because of the power
structure, but it's the same thing.

171
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,260
You're totally looking at him.

172
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,200
You look at those penny loafers with
no socks and you're like, frat boy,

173
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:54,360
date rapists. Yeah, it's true.

174
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:00,590
We agreed to have aggressive sex and
you end up face down dead in a park.

175
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:05,850
Yeah, exactly. Yes. You're
allowed to say that, right? Yeah.

176
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,680
Okay. I'm not allowed to say that.

177
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:09,820
I'm not allowed to see a black
guy with a Hoodie at 12 midnight.

178
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:10,441
It's we'll be like, oh,

179
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:13,440
he's working on an app and he just
came outside to stretch his legs.

180
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,060
Then I ended up in a trunk
of a car. Ah. But I do.

181
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,600
I do feel that way and I know that that's
a stereotype and I know that that's

182
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:25,770
wrong. Why do you have yes. Yeah. Well,
you know, it's, if I think about like,

183
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,410
why do you have like
Kennedy's and you have like,

184
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,730
you have this Trump white
eyeliner on here. Oh No.

185
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:36,750
I think that's my eye cream that I
didn't fully blended my skin. Oh God.

186
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:40,470
You're spoiled. I'm not spoiled.
I think that's my ice cream.

187
00:11:40,471 --> 00:11:44,850
I put it on at night. I have a
promoter that's a bad stereotype.

188
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,880
What is preppy guys?

189
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,570
Preppy white guys or serial
killers are date rapists.

190
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,980
But I feel like if they were to
be, they would get away with it.

191
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,680
Good. I just feel like it's a safe
thought is money. It's a safe thought.

192
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,370
The think is a woman [inaudible]
just go with the bad.

193
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,830
So you get home in one piece? Yeah. If
you think somebody is going to eat you,

194
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,640
you, you got to go with
that thought. Yeah.

195
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,300
And just just avoid regardless of how
many people's feelings you hurt. Right.

196
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,290
But like I get just people wearing like,

197
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,720
so how do you think white
people should handle pants?

198
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,620
How do you think white people
should handle the other situation?

199
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,950
And like boat shoes and like blazers
or like shorts with whales on them.

200
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,980
Then you got you gotta you fucking got
this person down or like their hair is so

201
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:46,820
perfect and they've got their
like color pop, just so on.

202
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,790
They're like Ralph Lauren,
like yellow, buttoned down.

203
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,900
You've got issues with salmon shorts
and like a white belt with a blue stripe

204
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,800
down the middle of it.

205
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,740
So what if a guy like that came walking
up to you and started talking to you in

206
00:13:00,741 --> 00:13:04,820
the club? I would feel very only, what
is your name? Is it something ethnic?

207
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,030
My name is Scott [inaudible].

208
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,790
Scott. Uh, no,

209
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,710
I'm being very stereotypical right now.

210
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,800
There are plenty of those guys that are
a part of the yacht club and the golf

211
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,070
and glove and, um, are they're lovely
people. Where did you meet those people?

212
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,440
I've never been, I'm really white. I've
never met those people. I've just, yeah,

213
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:31,130
I'm, I'm being, I'm being
stereotypical and it's wrong.

214
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,780
Do you know one time I met he
wasn't, he wasn't like a waspy guy.

215
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,810
He was a Jewish guy. Right.

216
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,570
And I was at this wedding for buddy
of mine who was Jewish. Right?

217
00:13:38,571 --> 00:13:40,220
So I was like one of
the only gentiles there,

218
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
and eight I had just moved to fucking
Manhattan and this guy fucking big lead to

219
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:47,270
me big time. Right?

220
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,370
I was living on this out
walkthrough bedroom on 97 east,

221
00:13:52,371 --> 00:13:56,980
97th street. Right. And, uh, you know,

222
00:13:56,981 --> 00:14:00,190
crack heads smoking underneath the
thing, the total New York experience.

223
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,310
Like the first night I'm laying
in my single bed, you know,

224
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:08,670
just just like a little kid bed and a
like a roach walked across my chest that

225
00:14:09,121 --> 00:14:12,310
night and I just thought that was
part of, I didn't even kill it.

226
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,620
I just thought it was part of the
New York experience. I was like,

227
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,040
all right man, I need to get tough.
So I was like, fuck it. Alright,

228
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,520
bugs are gonna crawl on me. I can take
this shit. Right. So I go to the uh,

229
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:26,050
but I was still excited. Oh, it's such
a German, Irish toughy. Fucking dope.

230
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:28,960
You guys will put up with any
yup. And that's why we die young.

231
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,000
That's all we die young. One day I'll
let it all out and I'll do that epic cry.

232
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:36,460
Like that black dude on the intervention.

233
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,640
Cause I still do and I'll be like

234
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,033
[inaudible]

235
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,330
when you watched that yesterday,

236
00:14:50,331 --> 00:14:54,560
the cry of man who hasn't cried
and like ever who was a baby,

237
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:59,150
we watched that yesterday in the writer's
room and then we watch one of the

238
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:04,151
worst ones ever because I love the Guy
Mike Schmidt retiring from baseball.

239
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:10,580
We watched that one and it's such a shame
the amount of shit that that guy gets.

240
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,160
Cause he could literally
at this still at this age,

241
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:16,100
he could literally pick me up and throw
me out of the major league in field.

242
00:15:16,101 --> 00:15:19,990
I would land shallow left, but he
just goes like, you know, whatever.

243
00:15:19,991 --> 00:15:24,160
Like I forget how it whip. It was like
20 years ago a boy left, blah, blah,

244
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,840
blah, Wisconsin. Where did the hell he
was with the dream to play originally.

245
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,890
He went all the way. I was like,
oh no. So somebody had that video,

246
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,510
major league and then they
immediately cut to the black. I got,

247
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:41,450
ah dude, we fucking died. We fucking died.

248
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,430
And I was actually sitting there
when I was [inaudible] watching that.

249
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:44,840
How hard we were all laughing.

250
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,810
I was wishing I could reach out to the
person that made that cause I would be

251
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:49,010
psyched, you know,

252
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:51,920
if I wasn't in this business and a bunch
of people in a writer's room right now

253
00:15:51,921 --> 00:15:55,580
on a fucking show, like we don't laugh
at Shit, dude, we will fucking dying.

254
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:58,970
So I mean, I wish my standup got that
kind of fucking left in my writer's room.

255
00:15:58,971 --> 00:16:03,560
That's all right. What's the setup as
a tracking and all of that shit. So,

256
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,190
um, anyways. Um,

257
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:11,340
all right. So where are we now?
Where are we talking about?

258
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:15,830
We were talking about your car.
Oh yeah. Your Jaguar. Jaguar.

259
00:16:15,831 --> 00:16:19,660
So like about the Jaguar, the
Jaguar. DXF Are you excited for,

260
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,790
I'm so fucking excited. I'm not
excited that it doesn't come for,

261
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,440
it's 100 days away.

262
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,220
That's what happens when you order a
custom color countdown every single day.

263
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,220
Yeah. If you don't mind,
can I be excited about this?

264
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:35,450
I drove a fucking Prius for
nine years. You're right. Yeah.

265
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,320
I've been gay bashed for the better
part of a decade. Driving that car. Yes.

266
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,620
Long overdue. I can tell you that's
a hot fucking car though. The Prius.

267
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:45,440
I've had two people already
offered to buy it. Can I buy it?

268
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:49,460
Can I buy it off here? I know that
car is done right by us. Yes it is.

269
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,630
Although it smells,

270
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:56,120
you got a detailed that one time and then
we came home and it was a hot day and

271
00:16:56,121 --> 00:16:58,010
the windows were up in
whatever that chemical was.

272
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,480
Did they put in the seat if fucking
baked in there and like, yeah,

273
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,320
know how to get it out? Yeah.

274
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:05,760
It's like somebody died in
there that cleans houses. No,

275
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,040
it doesn't smell like somebody
died in there. It's this, this got,

276
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,130
you know a certain, yeah,

277
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,710
you have to eat something and you kind
of think you like it and then there's yet

278
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:17,360
weird after taste and you're like, Whoa,

279
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,300
we can't sell it until we figure
out how to get rid of that.

280
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,650
You need to learn to talk into the
mic. There you go. Not to. Okay.

281
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,690
You know what they're not. They'll just
pick a height. Can hear me. All right,

282
00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:33,110
I'm going to turn you up a mile away. I'm

283
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,350
sorry. It's because of you. Hey,

284
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:43,310
I don't like that or that Remy Ma just
cause she shot somebody that's fucking

285
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:47,510
great. So many people in that genre
act like they would do shit like that.

286
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:50,490
But at the end of the day, like what
am I a fucking, I got a Bentley.

287
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,910
I don't need to be shooting people. Yeah.

288
00:17:51,911 --> 00:17:54,810
She actually shot somebody
and she went to jail for it.

289
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:59,510
I don't think she's like proud of it by
any means, but, well no. You know what?

290
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:02,370
I know I had to see her out and do it.
I'm not advocating shooting people.

291
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:06,270
What I'm saying, what's cool is that
if she talks about shit like that,

292
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,080
you know that she's not pretending.
Oh, I certainly wouldn't fuck with her.

293
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,080
Yeah. Like I'm still waiting for
Robert Blake to put out an album.

294
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,910
You know he fucking flake.
Yeah, he plays guitar. Wait,

295
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,250
he's not dead. No, he's out.

296
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,180
I went into a guitar shop one time
and he was in there. No. Yeah,

297
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,230
I would run the other way. He's so scary.

298
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,080
Don't go to bed with the
price on your head. No.

299
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:39,150
So you enjoy, you enjoyed
watching the bet awards with me.

300
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,360
I did the whole prince tribute and
all that. It was fucking tremendous.

301
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,960
Fucking tremendous. I don't know why
you guys were upset about the Oscars.

302
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:47,340
You guys have a better award show.

303
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,630
Just do one yourself and
show us how to do a good one.

304
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,180
I don't know why the fuck
you're trying to get there.

305
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,640
Yeah. Our shows generally
seem to be more fun,

306
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,400
but oh Jesus. Where the
hell is on you? No, no.

307
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,110
It's not more or less fun. It's just
you're going to be able to be yourselves.

308
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,340
I don't know who that is. I
Dunno what the fuck happened.

309
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:21,270
All of a sudden I got on this list like
congratulations your businesses one and

310
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:26,250
just hang up. What kills me is they
keep calling, which means somebody out.

311
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:29,820
It's enough people at works on.
There's enough people that sit there.

312
00:19:29,821 --> 00:19:34,770
Congratulations. Like holy
Shit Allen. Get it here. Eight,

313
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:38,130
four, four number. Cause I
have some weird eight, four,

314
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:40,440
four number that keeps
calling me and it's business,

315
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:42,870
but you know they have those
machines that like this.

316
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:46,920
Try every single combination of phone
numbers and whatever one hits and someone

317
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:48,240
picks up, they're like, hello,

318
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:54,310
I have some exciting news for you. Yeah,

319
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,900
it's not exciting. It's fucking annoying.

320
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,070
You know what the worst is when I'm out
walking Cleo and I'm listening to some

321
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:04,140
song, right? I'm listening
to some songs, so of course,

322
00:20:04,141 --> 00:20:05,580
any song that I listened to,

323
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,390
I am on stage with the band playing
drums and I'm killing it and they're all

324
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,070
turning around and
looking at me like, wow,

325
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,770
this guy has more skills than we thought.

326
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,430
That's what I do with the entire time
I'm out there fantasize and then all of a

327
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:20,760
sudden the phone comes on and I'm
old. Whenever it's a random number,

328
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,070
I just think at some radio
station that I used to do,

329
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:25,830
and that's always good for business. I
pick up the phone, I make people laugh,

330
00:20:25,831 --> 00:20:27,030
drive time, you know, whatever.

331
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:29,310
I'm not even in the city and
they're hearing me make them laugh.

332
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,300
Maybe they'll come out to a show.

333
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,080
So I always pick up and I'll be
like in the middle of a, what was,

334
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:37,760
I was listening to Queens of the stone
age today. I'll listen to them. And, uh,

335
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,160
ozone gay man ain't gay, Gay, Gay,

336
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:45,270
da Da da and nicotine and get up like
a day or extra speed. Whoa, whoa.

337
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,950
Okay. Okay. But it, yeah, I'm
just fucking listening to it.

338
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:53,960
Of course I'm on the drums going gay,
gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay kid, right.

339
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,760
Fucking kill it, Josh. Turnaround
Code. Wow. Right. Totally impressed.

340
00:20:57,761 --> 00:21:02,050
Which will never happen.
Right? So I can dream.

341
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,560
And then the fucking photo
rank. He's impressed with you,

342
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:08,740
but not for your musical skills.
I know he's not impressed with me.

343
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,970
Why would you say that and ruin
this great story. He fucking, uh,

344
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:16,110
so I'm walking down the street and the
fucking phone rings and then I stopped

345
00:21:16,111 --> 00:21:20,050
listening to that and I fucking, uh, I
pick up, it was like, congratulations.

346
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:24,420
Your fantasy as over a year, your best,
this letter won a free trip to a room.

347
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,320
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

348
00:21:25,321 --> 00:21:28,260
So even if you know you
don't have a radio station,

349
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,140
you'll just still pick
up random numbers. Yeah.

350
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,260
You have to stop doing that also. Why
wouldn't you? Hey, do you a thank you.

351
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,980
Do you ever think he ever like dialed
somebody? Dial the number incorrectly?

352
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,780
Well, I guess you don't
do it that much anymore,

353
00:21:40,781 --> 00:21:44,290
but every once in a while you just fucking
dial a number. You'd dial it wrong.

354
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,250
You ever think he actually like called
somebody famous? Like they have phones,

355
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,540
they got to get wrong numbers.

356
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,930
They don't pick up numbers that
they don't recognize. Yeah, they do.

357
00:21:52,931 --> 00:21:57,670
You don't think Jay Lo picks up. It's
like, oh, whatever. She sounds like what?

358
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,900
She goes, I'm just, I'm
just chatting on the Bronx.

359
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:07,120
I don't know what the fuck she said.
You wouldn't pick up like Bill Clinton.

360
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,540
I don't understand. I Bet Bill Clinton
picks up random numbers. Oh, of course.

361
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:15,070
Yeah. You know, he does. He's
like, hmm. Oh, could this be,

362
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,540
I dunno what now he's looking
like very frail. Uh, yeah,

363
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,190
he's old and Vegan now,

364
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,920
so I feel like that is that why he looks
like a scarecrow that came to life.

365
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:30,280
If a scare crow fucked a snowman
for scarecrow, fuck the snow man.

366
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:34,210
That's what he looks like cause he's
keeps his pasty as a snowman and his

367
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:38,470
skinny. I've never felt more alive.

368
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,570
He comes at you with that
fucking chicken neck. Um,

369
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,580
can we talk about how you kind of like
to like in the same vein as you picking

370
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:53,950
up numbers and being like, yeah, sure.
How you just don't pay attention.

371
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:55,540
What stuff?

372
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:00,540
Like what happened when I asked you
to get minute rice and grapefruit.

373
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,733
What did you bring home?

374
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,400
A cantaloupe and a regular
rice that took 20 minutes.

375
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:12,230
I thought Uncle Ben's was always minute
rice. He thought he had shit the dope.

376
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:18,570
I was wrong. Ben Can hang around. Hmm.

377
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,400
Came on with the cantaloupe. What do you
want from me? It was delicious though,

378
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,270
wasn't it? It was,

379
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:26,870
but I just feel like you've just get a
vague idea of like what's supposed to

380
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:30,120
happen and just kind of run
with it. Like you're like, oh,

381
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,800
that's around melon fruit or
something. Not even a melon.

382
00:23:33,801 --> 00:23:34,970
You weren't even supposed to get a Mellon.

383
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,630
Just you just knew it was round and it
was probably next to the grapefruit and

384
00:23:38,631 --> 00:23:41,740
you just grabbed it not thinking, yeah,

385
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,980
you want to do, you know it's
sure. Alright, so I bought
you a nice fucking car,

386
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:52,850
right? And you park and under a
tree. So I got this fucking the top,

387
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,710
the tarp that fits your car like a
fucking glove and you're not putting it on

388
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,340
and the fucking saps coming down on
your car. So I sit there and go near.

389
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,850
Why don't you put the
top on the car and like,

390
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:08,150
is there anyway somebody can
turn back the tree? It's like,

391
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,690
or you could just put the
fucking tarp on the car. I know,

392
00:24:11,691 --> 00:24:14,750
but I also feel like that she
needs to be cut back in general.

393
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:18,650
Why that tree is right out
side can hear you right now.

394
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,660
Don't worry buddy,

395
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:25,040
you're not going anywhere because it's
just trapping those weird things all over

396
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:28,010
the place. It's called nature
called nature. Nia. We live.

397
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,880
We shouldn't even be out here.
That tree should be out here. Okay.

398
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:34,730
I'm not saying that you should cut it
down and like it should be just cut it

399
00:24:34,731 --> 00:24:35,360
back.

400
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,110
That's all I'm saying is cut it back
or maybe like cut it so that it grows.

401
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,270
Why don't you just put the
fucking tarp on the car?

402
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,120
I have a problem putting a
tarp, the tarp on the car.

403
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:46,080
Then there you go with salt.
Yeah you do have a problem.

404
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,791
Cause I went down there,

405
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:50,640
there was shit all over your car and
I'm telling you the fucking last night.

406
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,560
And what happens is a lot
of people don't know this.

407
00:24:52,561 --> 00:24:54,060
I learned this the hard
way. What happens is,

408
00:24:54,061 --> 00:24:55,860
and I'm explaining this and I
know you don't like this, but I'm,

409
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:59,340
I explaining when the fucking
PSAP gets on your fucking car,

410
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:02,400
you gotta end up not talking
to you. You got to get it off.

411
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,560
Cause what happens is
when your car heats up,

412
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:08,940
the paint expands and then
at night when it cools off,

413
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:12,330
it contracts again and
it's like a motion, right?

414
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,370
The SAP and the paint become one.

415
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,280
It's like a tattoo and then
it's underneath your fucking
paint and you can't get

416
00:25:17,281 --> 00:25:20,520
it up. At least that's what the guy at
the car wash told me. Cause I was like,

417
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:23,220
Hey, what about these spots here? And
he's like, oh my friend, my friend.

418
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,710
We're not friends. Tell me what happened.

419
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:32,240
So I like your blue dress.

420
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:38,180
What'd you get it? Top shop. Top
Shop? Yes. Is that expensive?

421
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:43,550
No, I'm actually good. Good
Job Nini. Get a red one too.

422
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,270

423
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,310

why? Cause they'd send me some dresses.

424
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:56,480
Yeah, yeah, that fit me. Ideally
I'm the host. I get the dresses.

go is to one of those races.

427
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:10,550
Once you see the fucking the WHO has
at that fucking thing, the money,

428
00:26:10,551 --> 00:26:15,020
I should say, oh, we're going to go to
the Grand Prix and Mako at some point.

Oh, I'd love to. I'd love to. And just

435

467
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:43,320
I just had a bath. I just, you know,
I don't know anything about sports.

468
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,730
So call me when we know a little bit.

469
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:49,040

got traded for Shea? Well, Oh,

470
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:49,831
I know that you are.

471
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:52,080
Just couldn't stop talking about
it this morning while we were,

472
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:54,270
I couldn't believe it. I
thought he was a hab full life.

473
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,670
I fucking hate when
that happens. You know,

474
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,220
Joe Barton had talked me off the ledge.

475
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,300
He said fucking Nashville needed a staff
and something about the habs needed to

476
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:06,210
be a little more solid and tougher
on defense is some shit like that.

477
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:09,510
So I guess it's a good trade.
Who the fuck knows? But, uh,

478
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,910
I hate when big stars like
that. That's why I was like,

479
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:16,410
Steven Stamkos resigned with
Tampa. Like, you know, he's, he's,

480
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,890
he's like, and he's, I can't say a
lightning. It's such a stupid fucking,

481
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:23,880
I hate when they named teams after
weather, whatever, pks a hat, man,

482
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:28,140
that's fucked up. Even as a Bruins Fan,
I'm going to miss like a, you know,

483
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,830
I never really hated the guy. These one
of those guys. He was so fucking good.

484
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:34,860
You couldn't hate him. You know what
I mean? The Montreal Canadian fans,

485
00:29:34,861 --> 00:29:39,090
however, you know, with this silly socks
and little pockets squeezed in. Yeah.

486
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,790
Um, all right. I gotta wrap this
thing up cause I have to go, uh,

487
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:46,090
we're doing the record for, uh,
actually still number eight.

488
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:49,780
We're writing number nine. Everybody,
I'm coming out the fucking,

489
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,260
what's that thing that comes out?
The Golfer, right? Groundhog.

490
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:57,760
Groundhog pokes his fucking head out.
Keep much of my head came out. I mean,

491
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:01,630
how many more fucking weeks of
winter would that be? Um, all right,

492
00:30:01,631 --> 00:30:04,630
that's 30 minutes. It's
going to be a long winter

493
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:10,810
and I'll never forget 2016
when the round is white.

494
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:15,811
His head ever came out of that hole
and an email about a seven night

495
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:19,660
Mediterranean cruise riding from
Venice starting at eight 99.

496
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,800
But I don't think that's the kind of thing
that we underneath the boat or we set

497
00:30:23,801 --> 00:30:25,090
the refugee special.

498
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,470
I think that's the kind of thing where
it's like we have to work on the boat

499
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:33,460
when we go there and like 4,000 other
people at the, at the buffet line.

500
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,860
Oh yeah. You can't even
get a cruise for that.

501
00:30:35,861 --> 00:30:39,370
There's no fucking way you're getting
on this. What does the boat look like?

502
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,070
I don't know. It's a dinghy. Yeah. All
right. Well I don't know. I'll have to,

503
00:30:45,071 --> 00:30:47,410
I'll have to do something evil
to ever be able to afford that,

504
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:52,270
but it's nice to notice. Um,
all right. That's it. Ah,

505
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:56,710
that's the a Thursday afternoon
podcast for um, wait a minute.

506
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:01,150
What not and yeah, to go to
work. I totaled the pyramid game.

507
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:04,170
That's the only reason why. Oh fuck.
All right. Let's Do the pyramid game.

508
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,830
All right. Where are we? I
don't want to make you late.

509
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:08,860
Should we save it for now? Let's do
it. I said, so we want to do it next.

510
00:31:08,861 --> 00:31:09,581
Monday's a holiday.

511
00:31:09,581 --> 00:31:13,030
Are you going to do as it are you going
to do a podcast on the 4th of July?

512
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:17,060
Yeah, of course. No days off. Yeah.

513
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,920
This is how much fun this fucking is.
Okay. So I fuck around the advertising.

514
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:25,360
I don't give a shit if they're here or
not. I'm still going to do it. All right,

515
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:29,290
so those of you who weren't listening
the past week, I got fucking a,

516
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:33,040
what do you say there? Uh, what did
we do that, that $10,000 pyramid,

517
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:39,450
it all came about because we were talking
about how you just notoriously, uh,

518
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:44,160
sort of just gets things wrong or
it was really more about how your,

519
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:47,350
your movie titles, that's how
it started. Yeah. You know,

520
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:52,450
I danced around the last days of
Dracula set of same Pearl Jam.

521
00:31:52,451 --> 00:31:55,780
I'd be like a flannel
shirt. Oh, I'm in a trance.

522
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:00,370
This music's making me go crazy.
I don't like George Bush. Exactly.

523
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,530
But I knew that one. That's
any better. Yeah. So then

524
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,930
we started playing the
pyramid game. All right.

525
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:11,440
So evidently I sucked at giving clues.
Let's see if you're better. All right,

526
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:15,430
you ready? Oh wait, so I'm
going first. No, it's your turn.

527
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:21,010
I gave last time. You received
like I thought I also gave,

528
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,670
I thought we both know. No, we did.
We both did. No, it doesn't matter.

529
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:29,980
But now you do. Do you have them
in your head? Uh, I'll, you stink.

530
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:34,090
He was supposed to make a list. I know
what's in it for next time then. No,

531
00:32:34,091 --> 00:32:37,060
you can't do that to people.
Well, I'm sorry people. Well,

532
00:32:37,061 --> 00:32:39,160
I'm going to hit pause. You're
going to do it right now. All right.

533
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:42,040
They're going to be easy. All right, we're
back. She said they're going to beat.

534
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:44,120
Don't make them easy. It's
three. Okay, here we go.

535
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:47,720
And let's get the clock going
here. All right. And Go.

536
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,130
So, uh, Michael Jordan has won a ring.

537
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,790
Steph curry mistress. I think
that secretary has one of the,

538
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:58,950
people think they're ugly.
I'm sure Lebron has haircut

539
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,170
sneakers makers. Okay. Um,

540
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,940
they're not native to California, but
they're everywhere. They Avocados,

541
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,950
they provide shade people, real
housewives, them real housewives.

542
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:17,570
All fake Tammy victims. They're
natural palm trees. Yes. Bam.

543
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:22,240
Um, 4th of July celebration at
Fox heart attacks. They're in the

544
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:28,000
fireworks. Yeah, I'll come
on. That was a joke. No,

545
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:30,830
I was too easy then. You know what? You
just made me feel like I was special.

546
00:33:30,831 --> 00:33:32,840
Come up. Think of a
difficult one right now.

547
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:38,660
Some obscure so I can guess.
Okay, you got it. All right,

548
00:33:38,661 --> 00:33:43,120
and three a two a one. They're a big,

549
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:47,860
huge animal. That's bad. When you think
Cheetah, they're in the water catch.

550
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:51,610
They're vicious. SCO Sharks, a Barracuda,

551
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:55,240
whales sweat. They're, they can run fast.

552
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,000
They're in the water and they can run
fast frogs. They're very plant a Pulitzer.

553
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,611
This is,

554
00:34:00,611 --> 00:34:05,611
and they attack you Barracuda there in
an iPhone commercial and it says at the

555
00:34:05,681 --> 00:34:09,190
end, not on an iPhone. Can you

556
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:12,640
a game from the Sapa leaf seventies
and eighties getting more eighties,

557
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:17,940

00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,860
a big fat animal, a whale,

560
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,540
a walrus sale.

561
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:31,600
And in the game there was
four of them in each corner.

562
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:35,920
And you and your friends like hit it and
they had the like, Oh I hit ball. Yes.

563
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,710
God thought you meant the ocean. Ah, fuck.

564
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:45,210
That's only like three minutes to get,
you should have said that. Hungry,

565
00:34:45,211 --> 00:34:49,020
hungry. Cause I didn't want it
to be too easy. Oh, there you go.

566
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,870
I could have done better. No, that
was good. See you make them hard.

567
00:34:51,871 --> 00:34:56,260
They make them hard then it's done the
bit last longer. Make it easy. I'm easy.

568
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:59,760
See I'm you open when
it rains umbrella. Okay.

All right. I have to go.
All right. 100 more days

570
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,260

Can't wait. All right, a,

572
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:18,030
Have a great July 4th weekend. Uh,

00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,150
thank you to everybody in this country

574
00:35:21,151 --> 00:35:25,980
to England for losing that great
battle today on uh, July 4th.

575
00:35:25,981 --> 00:35:28,380
Right. Then they lose a battle
and we signed a paper like, ah,

576
00:35:28,381 --> 00:35:32,820
you motherfuckers, we
got, you know, I know,

577
00:35:32,821 --> 00:35:34,850
I know what it is. We
declared over into foot.

578
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,660
I just like doing it
because it makes them feel

579
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:42,720

Cozy, smug counts. And then you give him
the old right there, Fred. All right,

581
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:47,940
that's it. Go fuck yourselves.

582
00:35:47,941 --> 00:35:50,370
Have a wonderful weekend and
I'll talk to you on Monday there.

583
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,283
[inaudible]

584
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:14,683

585
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:23,940
Oh, okay.

591
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,660
I don't know. I don't know where it is.

592
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:20,730
The last Monday in June and I can't
believe how much the summer is just flying

593
00:37:20,731 --> 00:37:24,930
by Jay. When somebody say say
that every fucking summer,

594
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:26,110
you know,

595
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:29,790
you know what's going to fly by because
the weather is awesome cause it's fun.

596
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,270
It's like eating cookies,
you know, you open a bag,

597
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,680
you think you're just going to have one.

598
00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:37,890
Next thing you know the whole
bag's gone. You know why?

599
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,660
Because they taste delicious too.

600
00:37:39,661 --> 00:37:42,630
You really need some douchebag
to stand there next to you.

601
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,780
The one like couldn't your blue
how good those cookies were.

602
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:50,520
I can't believe they're already gone. Um,

603
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,380
I wish someone would
say that in the winter.

604
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,590
Can you believe how fast
the winter's going by?

605
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:58,390
What kind of person would say that? Huh?

606
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,880
Some sort of mountain man who's into
snowboarding. Alright. That was awesome.

607
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:07,850
I don't fucking, alright, it's the
Monday morning, but Monday, June 30th.

608
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:08,601
Sorry. I'll, okay.

609
00:38:08,601 --> 00:38:12,200
I was riffing and I was looking
up with the date was all right.

610
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,700
As I've told you guys in past podcasts,

611
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,770
I have one of the oldest still
functioning laptops out there.

612
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:23,150
I told you mine is actually
made out of Birch. I, uh,

613
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:27,410
I got it down at the, uh, pottery barn
back when they used to sell laptops.

614
00:38:27,411 --> 00:38:30,050
A lot of people don't know that.
They think that they were, uh,

615
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,440
just into furniture. But there was
a moment there where they'd stay,

616
00:38:33,441 --> 00:38:37,540
tried to branch out into computers and
electronics and needless to say fail.

617
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,040
And, uh, actually, you know what I was
thinking about getting a new laptop, but,

618
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,390
um, good friend of mine told me how
to, what? Add more memory to this one.

619
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:49,990
So I'm thinking, why the fuck? Why
would I go out and get a new one?

620
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:54,400
I don't understand why people keep
going out and buying new laptops.

621
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:59,830
Like they're fucking Steven Spielberg
and they're dumping like hours of film

622
00:38:59,831 --> 00:39:03,130
footage. You're not doing it. Okay.

623
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:07,930
They cost like two, three fucking
grand. What are you doing?

624
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:09,761
You know what I mean?

625
00:39:09,761 --> 00:39:12,160
Do you ever just stop and think
what the fuck you're doing?

626
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:17,610
Just get off the Goddamn fucking hamster
wheel for a second and just realize how

627
00:39:19,421 --> 00:39:24,421
ridiculous it is that you spent $2,500
on something and it's acceptable that the

628
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:30,550
thing is going to shit the bed within
fucking two years been two years,

629
00:39:30,551 --> 00:39:31,384
something's going to happen.

630
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:35,300
You know the battery's gonna mess up and
then you're going to go down to the Mac

631
00:39:35,301 --> 00:39:38,980
store or the fucking Bill Gates store,
whatever the hell they got out there.

632
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:42,450
And they going to be like, yeah,
um, it's not under warranty. Uh,

633
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,370
can we fix the year? We can fix it. Book.

634
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:51,030
Oh to fix it for some stupid
fucking reason is gonna
Cause 2100 and a new app up

635
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:57,370
is 25. So, you know, I mean, we'll fix it,

636
00:39:57,371 --> 00:40:01,390
but you know, the whole
thing is fucking bullshit.

637
00:40:01,391 --> 00:40:05,890
There's no reason they should cost that
much. You know, you know something,

638
00:40:05,891 --> 00:40:07,990
if nerds had any fucking brains,

639
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:10,000
the amount of pussy they
would be getting right now

640
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,360
just by fixing their friends,

641
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:18,250
laptops and saving everybody 2,500
bucks instead of charging people 1800,

642
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:23,020
why don't you charge charge like
500 bucks? You fucking nerds go out,

643
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,820
you know, buy something flashy that
always attracts the horse. They like that,

644
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:32,320
you know? No. Just to give yourself
a little makeover with the, with the,

645
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:35,320
with your laptop fixing
abilities, money, you know,

646
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:37,000
like one of those bad eighties movies,

647
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:40,480
you can turn your life into
like a montage, you know,

648
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:44,350
play some songs like the fine young
cannibals as some chick takes you to the

649
00:40:44,351 --> 00:40:48,100
mall, you know, takes off your glasses.

650
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:51,730
I always hated that in those fucking
movies. Like whenever like somebody,

651
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,160
you know, whenever they
were going to have like, uh,

652
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:57,910
like the nerdy Chicco all of a
sudden become gorgeous. Right?

653
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:01,780
Like the way they made her ugly was they
put her hair up and they made her wear

654
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:04,450
black frame glasses. You know what I mean?

655
00:41:04,451 --> 00:41:08,170
Like you still couldn't see
that she was gorgeous, you know?

656
00:41:08,171 --> 00:41:11,500
And then they just take her hair down
and then she take off her glasses and

657
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:16,150
everybody's like, oh my
God, who is that? You know?

658
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:19,870
And then the date rape is football player
comes up to her and then she always

659
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:23,950
like a, it's like, no, I
don't think so. You know,

660
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,350
you didn't like me when I,

661
00:41:25,351 --> 00:41:28,660
when I had my hair up and I was
wearing these glasses. Okay.

662
00:41:28,661 --> 00:41:31,090
But this nerd over here,
he always liked me.

663
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:34,550
So now we're going to go to the prom and
we're going to dance and that's going

664
00:41:34,551 --> 00:41:36,470
to be the end of the fucking movie. Okay.

665
00:41:36,471 --> 00:41:39,560
And I always hated that moment in the
movie cause it always reminded me that I

666
00:41:39,561 --> 00:41:43,970
was watching a movie because
in real life, okay, that girl,

667
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,720
as much as she liked the nerd, she
wouldn't like him in that way. Okay.

668
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:49,700
They can't help it send that fucking DNA.

669
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,220
They want to breathe with the
strongest cock in the room.

670
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:54,470
And I don't care how much of a Dick,

671
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:58,730
that guy that quarterback was being toward
the second she got the attention that

672
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,600
that would fill her up because all those
years they have in her hair up wearing

673
00:42:02,601 --> 00:42:07,070
those fucking Malcolm x glasses
gave her low self esteem. And uh,

674
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:07,970
she,

675
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:12,970
she would at least for a four to six
year period would have to go out and

676
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:19,220
instill herself up with, please
accept me cock. You know,

677
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:23,330
before she kind of was able to
regroup and be like, you know what,

678
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,320
these guys are assholes. I
wonder what that nerds up to.

679
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:32,360
And by then it'll be too late
because a nerds generally, you know,

680
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,860
they married the first thing that a
lot of, let them fuck them, you know,

681
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,190
so by the time she, she, you
know, she runs through, you know,

682
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,640
the time she's down to
fucking the place kicker.

683
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:47,120
That nerd is already married with
three kids and he invented a,

684
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:50,530
invented the iPhone. Wait a
minute. No, he's t's fucking event.

685
00:42:50,531 --> 00:42:52,000
These damn laptops, they've got it.

686
00:42:52,001 --> 00:42:55,780
That's got to get repaired every couple
of years. That's their fucking payback.

687
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,420
Wow. I just figured that out.

688
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:04,000
That's why there's no god damn nerds out
there being able to fix these fucking

689
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:07,750
laptops for 500 bucks.
That's all 1800 bucks.

690
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,810
Because in math that when they gave
the fucking nerdy chicken make over,

691
00:43:10,811 --> 00:43:13,770
she still blew the quarterback.
So now, now we gotta pay for it.

692
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:19,420
Ridiculous man. All right. This is
the Monday morning podcast and uh,

693
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,190
my name is bill burns. I do one of these
every fucking Monday. And uh, you know,

694
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,290
give you some laugh
about and uh, you know,

695
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:31,330
keep you in my thoughts. Actually
keep me in your thoughts.

696
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,290
That's why I'm doing this.

697
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,420
I'm not doing it cause I
give a fuck about you people.

698
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,950
I'm trying to give you guys a reason to
keep coming back to my site and maybe

699
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:40,690
you'll tell other people to come to my
sites and the next time we go to Raleigh,

700
00:43:40,691 --> 00:43:44,530
North Carolina, I'm not standing
in front of 25 people, you know,

701
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,830
so then I can make some more money
and then I can buy some shiny shit.

702
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:50,860
And then I can make up for the
fall, all the fucking pussy.

703
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:54,220
I never gotten high school,
see how that works. So anyways,

704
00:43:54,221 --> 00:43:58,030
I do one of these every week I talk
about stuff that I have coming up in my

705
00:43:58,031 --> 00:43:58,864
career.

706
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:03,340
I talk about a comedy
date and a, you know,

707
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:07,000
whatever like is a great
example for you. I have a,

708
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:11,380
an upcoming CD DVD release.
I just like saying that CD,

709
00:44:11,381 --> 00:44:15,440
DVD release, um, and a one hour, um,

710
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,030
comedy central special
and that will be shown,

711
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:22,140
I believe it's August 23rd. Um,

712
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,750
it will be shown the first time
CD's coming out in August. CV.

713
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:30,580
I don't have an exact date yet. And
the DVD is coming out in September.

714
00:44:30,581 --> 00:44:34,470
I don't have an exact date for that. I
just have a month at this point. Okay.

715
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:38,940
So cool. You fucking jets. All
right. We got July 4th coming up.

716
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:43,410
Just relax. There's plenty of holidays
between now and the goddamn release.

717
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:45,930
And when I get the information, I'm
going to let you know what's up.

718
00:44:45,931 --> 00:44:49,980
So that's what I have coming up. Okay.
It's gotta be in a container in that.

719
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:53,250
So let me try it. Let me, let me try to
say it a little more clearer. In August,

720
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:58,170
I have a CD coming out and a one
hour comedy central, uh, special.

721
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:03,360
Um, and in, in, uh, September,
the DVD is coming out.

722
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:07,150
So a by October you guys should
all be sick of me, but by then, uh,

723
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:11,070
hopefully I'll be filthy, stinking
rich. I'll have a brand new,

724
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:15,870
a Ludwig drum kit and a big
house and I'll stand up there,

725
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,973
you know,

726
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:20,970
naked with the bathrobe that's partially
opened looking down on the city,

727
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,550
realizing that I'm still
empty inside. Okay.

728
00:45:23,551 --> 00:45:27,390
But we're going to cross that bridge
when we get to it, ma'am. All right. Um,

729
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,650
people ask me questions every week on
my podcast and I like to try to answer

730
00:45:31,651 --> 00:45:34,740
them. People also send me in
stories. They give me information.

731
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:37,530
What do you want to start with first?
You want to start with the questions?

732
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:41,460
You want to go with the stories? How
about a story? Let me scroll down here.

733
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:43,860
Okay. Last week, you know,

734
00:45:43,861 --> 00:45:47,010
people were talking about
their cars getting fucked
up and everything like that.

735
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,370
God Damn. And somebody sent me a funny
one and I forgot to copy and paste it.

736
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,660
I gotta read that one next week,

737
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:55,170
but I told you last week I was
going to tell you the second half,

738
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,980
basically everyone was telling me these
stories about how their car got fucked

739
00:45:58,981 --> 00:46:01,800
up and then everybody's
story. They would the victim,

740
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:05,310
except for this one dude who talks
about how he was hitting on some fucking

741
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:08,070
chick and she doesn't
want to hook up with them.

742
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:09,990
So he goes out in the parking lot,

743
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,520
hammered and backs his car into another
truck. And I was trying to tell him,

744
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,500
you know, you're not
really the victim there,

745
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:19,590
so it's Kinda hard to feel bad for you.

746
00:46:19,591 --> 00:46:24,591
So what the fuck did the girl do
that made you do something like that?

747
00:46:25,111 --> 00:46:26,580
That we should all feel bad for you?

748
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,980
Me and my 14 podcast listeners should
feel bad for you. So yeah, he goes this,

749
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:34,970
this is the other half. This is his
reason for doing that shit. Uh, okay.

750
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:39,060
Hey Bill, thanks for reading my story.
Share my gloom with everyone. Ha Ha.

751
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:41,370
Let me tell you what happened
with girl number one. All right?

752
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:44,430
This is why he got, he
got pissed in the club,

753
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:49,020
was a little tipsy drunk gun in
his car, evidently did not look

754
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,560
stomped on the gas and
backed into a truck,

755
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:56,810
fucked his car up and didn't do shit
to the truck. All right. He said, uh,

756
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:57,690
all right. Me and the girl,

757
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:01,410
we've been working together for about a
year now and everyone in this building

758
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,610
would like to get with her.

759
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,410
We've been on and off
talking a lot or not at all.

760
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:12,420
It's a big company. She's kind of
a teeth. She's kind of a tease.

761
00:47:12,421 --> 00:47:14,280
Okay, well, you know, I'm
going to take your word for it,

762
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:16,740
but I mean it kind of sounds like
she's a good looking woman. You know,

763
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,190
who's got a lot of caulk
coming at her and uh, you know,

764
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:24,240
maybe she's a little defensive. Um,
anyways, she kind of a tease, but hell,

765
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:27,330
I don't care. She's damn hot and I
haven't sealed the deal yet. All right,

766
00:47:27,331 --> 00:47:30,430
now I'm rooting for you. That's right.
Go in and fucking hit it. All right.

767
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,940
I was damn sure that
this was the night. Um,

768
00:47:33,941 --> 00:47:37,780
I was going to hook up with it cause we
were hanging out and talking a lot for

769
00:47:37,781 --> 00:47:40,570
the few weeks leading up to
this particular night out

770
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:45,640
since it was her birthday.
Okay. So here he is, you know,

771
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:46,960
chat her up for two weeks.

772
00:47:46,961 --> 00:47:50,530
He's going in the patient room as opposed
to those other guys who are walking

773
00:47:50,531 --> 00:47:54,130
into the cubicle with their pants
already have on zip. You know,

774
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:57,820
I respected, everybody likes
a full court press, but uh,

775
00:47:57,821 --> 00:48:01,030
that usually doesn't work, especially if
you weren't dockers. It's just creepy.

776
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,640
So anyway, so this guy, you
know, works if the two weeks,

777
00:48:03,641 --> 00:48:07,150
now it's your birthday.
Okay. And uh, let's see.

778
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:12,370
And apparently most girls like to get
down on the day when the clock rolls over.

779
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,050
Okay, I'm with you anyway.

780
00:48:14,051 --> 00:48:19,051
I completely fumbled the ball by not
paying enough attention or not flirting

781
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,800
enough that night or some shit.

782
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,600
And I got pissed when I knew that this
was probably the last chance I had,

783
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:29,410
which then led to the affirmation story.

784
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:34,780
So basically you did two weeks of
reconnaissance, you went out there,

785
00:48:34,781 --> 00:48:35,860
it was her birthday,

786
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:41,140
and you're trying to hit
on her to close the deal.

787
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:44,320
And basically every other hot chick
that walks by and you're looking at him,

788
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:45,183
you know what,

789
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,150
there's not one person in their early
twenties that does not have that fucking

790
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,910
story that it's just what it
is. It's just pussy as to,

791
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:55,130
it's still too amazing for you with the,

792
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,510
you're in your thirties you'll be able
to block out the other shit and you'll be

793
00:48:58,511 --> 00:49:01,340
able to focus on your target. And uh,

794
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,050
of course by then you'll be in your
thirties. So you'll be hitting on some,

795
00:49:05,051 --> 00:49:09,370
a cougar as they say. I
hate that fucking word.

796
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,930
And I hate those broads who think they're
still fucking hot. Like they're 22.

797
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:16,450
Okay. I'm not saying that
hot for a 43 year old,

798
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:21,040
but we estopped wearing shit that 22 year
old chicks wear. You know what I mean?

799
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,060
I just turned 40. Okay. My
days of wearing a hap shirt

800
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:32,230
and fucking socks up to my knees, like
I'm in that movie dazed and confused.

801
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:36,130
You know what I mean? You'd look at me
like I was a retard. All right, stop it.

802
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:39,970
You're hot fee or age, you
look good for your age. Okay.

803
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,720
But let's leave it at
that. Okay. Let's, uh,

804
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:48,010
you're in your dressing elegant years.
You're in your address. Classy. Okay.

805
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,270
You know, once you past
fucking, you know, I dunno,

806
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:56,140
somewhere in your mid thirties if you're
still dressing like a Jello shot girl,

807
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:58,180
I don't know what to tell you.
You know what that's like.

808
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:03,160
That's like the fucking, the former
muscle head who stopped working out,

809
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:07,240
but he still has the whole
cog Hogan Wardrobe, you know,

810
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:09,400
so we still got on the tank tops,

811
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:12,910
but now he's got those flabby grandmother
arms and it's just like, dude,

812
00:50:12,911 --> 00:50:17,890
you need to get a full shirt or
start doing some curls because yeah,

813
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,713
it's not working.

814
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:24,680
It was like Billy Crystal's grandmother
and a Mr Saturday night number.

815
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:28,490
Then they were making sandwiches out of
the arm, the fat on the back of her arm.

816
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,810
Um, all right. So anyway, so what did,

817
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:35,660
so you got pissed because you weren't
able to close the deals and you backed up

818
00:50:35,661 --> 00:50:39,140
and smashed your car. That's
actually fucking hilarious. Um,

819
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:44,360
that's a whole different segment because
stories I was trying to get people to

820
00:50:44,361 --> 00:50:45,380
tell is, you know,

821
00:50:45,381 --> 00:50:49,730
you went into go buy some
a face moisturizer and you
came out and your bumper

822
00:50:49,731 --> 00:50:53,840
was gone. You know, the whole,
I didn't do shit and uh,

823
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:58,800
somebody raped me stories. Um hmm.
I guess you created a new one.

824
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:01,100
People will fuck up their car cause a,

825
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:04,440
they were trying to fuck the hot chicken
work on her birthday. Okay. And uh,

826
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,740
I don't know. They looked at some of
the chicken. I don't know what happened.

827
00:51:07,741 --> 00:51:12,740
Anyways, whatever man to man, I
feel bad for you. Okay. Is, uh,

828
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:16,500
last story I'm going to read here.
Um, all right, bill a, your Ranson.

829
00:51:16,501 --> 00:51:21,270
American Airlines ring true as they
screwed a marine I met while on vacation.

830
00:51:21,271 --> 00:51:22,860
I don't know if you guys
listen to this shit every week,

831
00:51:22,861 --> 00:51:25,440
but American Airlines
fucked me over awhile.

832
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,370
Back to the point I did a puff
daddy a remix of their song.

833
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,190
Um, when little stop
like this wave up man,

834
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:36,760
fucking you. What?

835
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:41,750
In the aish ass h so you
can still get it on the air.

836
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,540
All right, so this is, this is
this guy's story. All right.

837
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:47,600
While returning from Mexico,
I was in DFW airport.

838
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:51,170
I love when people write their DFW.
Like I know what the fuck that means.

839
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,450
Is that Detroit fucking where
port. Oh, Dallas. Dallas.

840
00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:00,290
Dallas. Fort Worth. There
we go. The Delaware.

841
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:06,410
All right. I don't know. Um,
Detroit fucking, I dunno.

842
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:09,180
I went in with the fucking guy
is, he's at DFW airport. Okay.

843
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,070
And I know for all you pilots out
there, hey, people do flown into lax.

844
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:18,560
Kelly x is actually a great JFK lax.
People know that. But stop saying DFW.

845
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,730
Like I know where the fuck that is. All
right. I was in DFW airport and I left,

846
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:28,190
said no voc. I'm in the OCC. Barely.
I don't know what the fuck that is.

847
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:33,800
Orange County, I still don't know what
that is. It's south of Los Angeles.

848
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:36,050
Thank you. Thank you.

849
00:52:36,051 --> 00:52:40,520
You mean that place that nobody fucking
goes to in between Los Angeles and San

850
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:45,440
Diego. All right. I was in DFW airport
and met this guy at the tram. Oh,

851
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:48,440
just fucked it up. That word
just makes my skin crawl.

852
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,830
All the airports I've been,
I was at the tram. Uh,

853
00:52:51,831 --> 00:52:55,310
I met this guy at the tram who was
fuming mad. He told me he was headed to,

854
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:56,263
to Gulfport,

855
00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:00,890
Mississippi from California and the plane
had engine trouble and had to return.

856
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:05,210
He then caught the next flight and
then had to land in Dallas due to bad

857
00:53:05,211 --> 00:53:06,044
weather.

858
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:11,030
He was then told that all all flights
out were on standby and while talking to

859
00:53:11,031 --> 00:53:14,900
the gate agent, the employee got pissy
with them. What a fucking surprise.

860
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,360
He mentioned that he had orders and
needed help getting any flight out and the

861
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:24,500
clerk said, sir, I can't help you.
Please enjoy your night in the airport.

862
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:29,250
After the marine calmed down, I asked
him what airline he was on. He replied,

863
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,120
motherfucking air, American
Airlines, they suck.

864
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,920
I hope they go under Jesus
Christ. They even fuck over a guy.

865
00:53:37,921 --> 00:53:42,030
Was He in uniform? Sharing can help you.

866
00:53:42,031 --> 00:53:45,810
Please enjoy your night in the airport.
Really, please enjoy this fucking

867
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,640
Timberland T. I already said the c
word enough in this God damn thing.

868
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:56,270
It's ridiculous. Do you know something?
You know, just go on their website.

869
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:59,580
Just start complaining. I'm really trying
to do that shit. You know what I mean?

870
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:01,200
Somebody's got to do something.
You know what I mean?

871
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:05,250
If somebody fucking do something,
do they respond when you complain?

872
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,860
Somebody sent me a fucking email about a,

873
00:54:07,861 --> 00:54:12,120
they returned something at best buy
and they charged him a 15% restock fee,

874
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,020
which basically they bought something.
It sucked. They brought it back.

875
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,590
Okay. If it costs a grand,

876
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:23,430
they charge them 150 bucks just
to put it back on the shelf.

877
00:54:23,431 --> 00:54:27,330
So they still make money. So personally,
I'll never shop in a best buy again.

878
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,380
That's it. I'm done. That's what I'm
saying. That's just like, you know what,

879
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,930
I'm not eating fast food ever again, man.

880
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:37,380
So that basically means I'm not
fucking with best buy for three months.

881
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:40,170
I don't know. I'm sorry. I said, let's
get, let's get on with the questions.

882
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:44,100
Okay, this fucking, this podcast started
off really good and now it's just,

883
00:54:44,101 --> 00:54:47,370
it's brining to a fucking halt. Let
me see if I can up the comedy here.

884
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,180
Take it up a notch. Okay.
This podcast is like,

885
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:55,110
it's like the Lakers in game
six. You know what I mean?

886
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,330
I never seen a team with west hard. Jesus
Christ. I'll fix her up by 40 points.

887
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:04,620
They're still shooting three pointers.
You think he would've put up with that?

888
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:08,400
Kareem, those guys would've been
throwing elbows. Larry Burton,

889
00:55:08,401 --> 00:55:12,660
all of them would've been holding up the
trophy looking like Bobby Clark and the

890
00:55:12,661 --> 00:55:16,170
Lakers just stood there
and watched it. All right.

891
00:55:16,171 --> 00:55:19,920
Questions a number one. By the
way, I'm a Celtics fan and yes,

892
00:55:19,921 --> 00:55:21,330
I am totally psyched and I'm sick.

893
00:55:21,331 --> 00:55:23,470
All you like offense talking
to bite me about this,

894
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:28,290
buying them guy like he's the second
coming of fucking Bill Russell and Michael

895
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:30,990
Jordan. Okay. You guys need
to work on your heart first.

896
00:55:30,991 --> 00:55:35,980
Why don't you draft a fucking heart first
and then talk to me about, you know,

897
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:41,010
fucking kid a coming off the goddamn
bench. Cause I don't give a fuck. Woo.

898
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:43,440
Got a little hostile there.
All right, question number one.

899
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:46,620
So when a comedian does the
comedy central presents,

900
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,750
is there an applause o meter?

901
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,850
Because sometimes it seems like an
odd place for an applause break.

902
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,590
Also. Is there an opening act to
warm up the crowd? Uh, let's see,

903
00:55:58,591 --> 00:56:02,070
is there a plaza meter?
No, they just actually,

904
00:56:02,071 --> 00:56:03,780
I think they just edit it in.

905
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:09,290
They'll take applause from a different
joke that really killed and uh,

906
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:10,141
I don't know,

907
00:56:10,141 --> 00:56:14,160
maybe cause there's a low and for some
reason they think the viewer at home

908
00:56:14,161 --> 00:56:18,570
isn't gonna notice or like when they cut
to somebody who's laughing hysterically

909
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,990
at another joke, that was hysterical.

910
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:25,090
That maybe even that didn't
even tell. They'll actually,

911
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:29,110
if they get a good laugh or in the
crowd, they use that as stock footage.

912
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:34,090
You know, Kinda like, you know, a
battle footage. You don't like the,

913
00:56:34,091 --> 00:56:35,680
you don't want to show
the atom bomb. It's the,

914
00:56:35,681 --> 00:56:39,060
they have like two or three views of that
stock footage of the fucking Adam Bond

915
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:42,370
. That's the same, it's the same
thing in standup comedy. Okay.

916
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:46,330
Some lady lost her shit laughing in
1983. You haven't ever noticed that.

917
00:56:46,331 --> 00:56:49,210
Sometimes like they'll cut
to somebody. It's really bad.

918
00:56:49,211 --> 00:56:52,840
Like on v t they'll cut to somebody
with a hairstyle that is just like from

919
00:56:52,841 --> 00:56:55,420
fucking 20 years ago. You
know what I mean? Like,

920
00:56:55,421 --> 00:56:59,500
remember black people used
to have the three levels,

921
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,590
like high top fade, like
three different levels.

922
00:57:02,591 --> 00:57:05,340
So it was like a parking garage or like a,

923
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:08,170
some sort of fancy stairs
that would lead into like a,

924
00:57:08,171 --> 00:57:11,410
a serving room or some shit. I
remember the, you know, during the, uh,

925
00:57:11,411 --> 00:57:15,220
the Bobby Brown, uh, my
prerogative, that's what they'll do.

926
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,780
They'll show a guy,

927
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:20,980
black dude or a white dude or whatever
on comic view and he'll tell a fucking

928
00:57:20,981 --> 00:57:23,890
joke, you know, that dress, you know,

929
00:57:23,891 --> 00:57:27,160
they got a Obama and o a t
shirt, right? The comedian.

930
00:57:27,161 --> 00:57:31,720
And then they'll cut to somebody who looks
like one of the guys and fucking boys

931
00:57:31,721 --> 00:57:36,640
to men sworn like one of those lime
green fucking seven up sports coats.

932
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:41,650
Um, okay. Yeah, I think, I think I
overly explained that. Alright. Also,

933
00:57:41,651 --> 00:57:44,910
is there an opening act to warm up
the crowd? Uh, if you're lucky? Yes,

934
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:49,480
there is. Uh, if there isn't, it sucks
because it's like nobody's laughing.

935
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:52,750
They're just sitting there and all of
a sudden you come out and you're just

936
00:57:52,751 --> 00:57:56,710
like, what's up with lamps? These
things crazy and it's really shocking.

937
00:57:57,310 --> 00:58:01,600
So hopefully there is a warmup act.
All my experiences there has been.

938
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:03,550
Okay. Question number two.

939
00:58:03,551 --> 00:58:08,290
The question is why does asparagus
make your kiss stick? Um,

940
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:12,070
I just looked at, you said Piss, you know,

941
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,590
like they should have been the
f word in that sentence. Just,

942
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:18,280
just to prepare me for pis. I
should've been. Why does your,

943
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:22,720
why does asparagus make your
urine smell for a while?

944
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,690
Is fucking asparagus make you
pitch stick? You know what I mean?

945
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:28,330
You've got gotta be consistent
here. The first half,

946
00:58:28,331 --> 00:58:31,900
you're like Dan rather reading off the
teleprompter and then you know the second

947
00:58:31,901 --> 00:58:35,560
half you go and dice clay on me. All
right. Asparagus contains or this is,

948
00:58:35,561 --> 00:58:38,560
this is the answer. I actually looked
it up. This was the first thing I saw.

949
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:40,180
So I'm going with this
like it's the truth.

950
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,770
Asparagus contains a sulfur
compound called Merck captain.

951
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:48,990
It's also found in rotten eggs,
onions, garlic and in this,

952
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,920
in the secretion of skunks, when
your digestive track breaks down,

953
00:58:53,921 --> 00:58:57,250
this substance byproducts are
released. That caused the funny sense,

954
00:58:57,550 --> 00:59:00,430
the funny scent. I don't think it's
funny you guys think it's funny.

955
00:59:00,431 --> 00:59:01,660
It's actually kind of disgusting.

956
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:05,860
The process is so quick that your urine
can develop the distinctive smell within

957
00:59:05,861 --> 00:59:08,290
15 to 30 minutes of eating asparagus.

958
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:13,600
She sources for more info. I left
that last part in there just in case.

959
00:59:13,601 --> 00:59:16,680
I actually tried to play that
off like I wasn't reading it. Um,

960
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:19,210
so that's why it does it, you know,

961
00:59:19,211 --> 00:59:24,211
cause there's some sort of sulfur compound
mercaptans that's also fun and rotten

962
00:59:24,441 --> 00:59:28,280
eggs, onions, garlic and in the secretion
of skunks. You know what I mean?

963
00:59:28,281 --> 00:59:30,350
That's just one of those bucket
things that the second you hear it,

964
00:59:30,351 --> 00:59:31,280
just forget it. Okay.

965
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:34,310
Cause there's no way to say that at
a party and it's going to get you any

966
00:59:34,311 --> 00:59:36,800
further with the person
you're talking to. You know,

967
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:40,820
either talking them into bed or trying
to get a promotion that's just like,

968
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:41,900
it just makes you weird.

969
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:46,400
And people just sorta rates raise their
eyebrows and nod and fucking walk away.

970
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:48,470
And you're left with a awkward silence.

971
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:51,200
And that's when you take out your cell
phone and you pretend you got to call.

972
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:56,060
You don't have a call. All
right, question number three. Oh,

973
00:59:56,061 --> 00:59:58,340
this is a great question.
So who is more Badass?

974
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:02,720
Ty Domi above prober for those of
you who don't, uh, watch hockey,

975
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:07,940
these are two of the all time
great enforcers in NHL history.

976
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:12,050
Who's more Badass? This
is ty Domi or Bob Proberg.

977
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:16,160
It's not even a question. It's
fucking Bob Prober. Not In, not even,

978
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:21,230
I'm not even talking about at the height
of his career where he beats the shit

979
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:25,040
out of every tough guy and let me beat
the shit out of every tough guy in the

980
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:28,100
league. He didn't start losing
fights towards the end. Okay,

981
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:31,670
so everybody knows what he did on the
ice. This is what he did off the ice.

982
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:33,830
Here's a little blur by
finding him on the Internet.

983
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:38,390
Died a former NHL enforcement,
Bob pro truck, Bob Probert,

984
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,090
so I don't do the news. I can't
even read his back in jail.

985
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:45,770
He was arrested Friday night in Delray
beach after a scuffle with Florida police

986
01:00:45,771 --> 01:00:48,800
that led to pro Bert being shocked
with the Taser Gun. This is,

987
01:00:48,801 --> 01:00:51,140
this is what he's doing after his career,

988
01:00:51,141 --> 01:00:52,730
when he's supposed to be
out on the golf course,

989
01:00:52,731 --> 01:00:56,090
hanging out with Charles Barkley doing
cell phone commercial charged with

990
01:00:56,091 --> 01:01:00,980
battery on a law enforcement officer
resisting arrest with violence and

991
01:01:00,981 --> 01:01:02,150
disorderly conduct.

992
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:06,710
Trovert was held without bail at the
Palm Beach County jail while playing for

993
01:01:06,711 --> 01:01:10,400
the Detroit Redwings in the eighties and
nineties propriate served a prison term

994
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:13,910
when he was caught trying to carry cocaine
into the United States from Canada.

995
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:17,930
He also had alcohol problems and was
charged with numerous driving expenses.

996
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:23,290
Provo probate was placed on inactive
status for the eighties 94 to 95 season

997
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:27,680
after he was involved in a motorcycle
accident and test showed alcohol and

998
01:01:27,681 --> 01:01:28,700
cocaine in his system.

999
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,590
This is what he does off the ice is what
he was doing off ice during his career.

1000
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:35,810
He probably had three fights that night.

1001
01:01:35,811 --> 01:01:38,270
Beat the shit out of a whole nother
team and that still wasn't enough.

1002
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:42,860
He's like, Eh, you know, drink a 12
pack of fucking Schaffer, you know,

1003
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:44,990
get an eight ball and
jump on a fucking Ninja.

1004
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:50,180
They'll rate police officers first
spotted program at this. This is a,

1005
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:54,680
this is for my July, June 4th, 2004 he's
well into his forties at this point.

1006
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:56,443
All right.

1007
01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:01,520
They spotted him on Friday as he was
parked in his white BMW sport utility

1008
01:02:01,521 --> 01:02:02,210
vehicle,

1009
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:07,210
the wrong way on a side street and
began hanging out his window to yell at

1010
01:02:08,211 --> 01:02:09,044
several men

1011
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:16,700
before 1:00 AM and he was out
of his mind fucking pussy.

1012
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,193
You know

1013
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:24,180
[inaudible] you probably still wearing
the hockey gloves. I bet they're like,

1014
01:02:24,181 --> 01:02:25,410
he has to do that. He has,

1015
01:02:25,411 --> 01:02:28,210
he has to drop gloves before he
could fight or it's just like,

1016
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:32,310
it's like no mark Nomar Garciaparra
before he hits, he's got a fucking,

1017
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:36,030
you know, click his feet in his
shoes and justice gloves, you know,

1018
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:36,980
his batting gloves or Betty.

1019
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:39,870
He literally has to walk around
in hockey gloves or he won't,

1020
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,480
he won't get the first couple
of shots off. So anyways,

1021
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:48,090
for officers intervened when pro
Bert, a native of Windsor Ontario,

1022
01:02:48,091 --> 01:02:52,320
got out of the car and tried to start a
fight with one of the men according to

1023
01:02:52,321 --> 01:02:52,741
the report,

1024
01:02:52,741 --> 01:02:56,910
he then fought with the
officers and refused their
orders to drop to the ground.

1025
01:02:57,510 --> 01:03:00,540
As two of the officers
struggled to handcuff Filbert,

1026
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:06,090
I'm opposite. Thomas Tolbert shot him
with a taser gun and he fell backwards.

1027
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:10,320
But probate continued to resist their
efforts when they tried to handcuff them.

1028
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:11,700
This is after getting tasered.

1029
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:16,410
So Tolbert use the Taser gun to
stunt probate several more times.

1030
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:19,590
Hey

1031
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:24,400
is fucking unreal. The gun shoots Bob
probes. Yeah, that's that Bob. Why Shit?

1032
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:27,730
I don't know if you guys know like it's
not like science fiction where they just

1033
01:03:27,731 --> 01:03:29,200
shoot electricity at you.

1034
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:34,090
It shoots out these two
medieval fucking uh, inquisition

1035
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:39,880
hooks in it hooks under your skin.
India chest like fucking eagle talents.

1036
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:44,410
Like that's not enough to make you just
scream like a bitch and drop to the

1037
01:03:44,411 --> 01:03:48,940
ground. They then shoot electricity
into that. Okay. It's bad enough.

1038
01:03:48,941 --> 01:03:51,490
The guy's already fighting two
cops, you know, cops. Okay.

1039
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:56,140
There's little cops like they
have like many UFC skills.

1040
01:03:56,141 --> 01:04:01,141
They all know armbars and choke holds
and they have guns and clubs and shit and

1041
01:04:01,481 --> 01:04:02,560
he's fighting two of them.

1042
01:04:04,330 --> 01:04:06,700
They still have to take them
two or three more times.

1043
01:04:06,701 --> 01:04:07,990
So I would go with Bob Prober.

1044
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:10,870
I would say Bob Roberts a little
cuff and the tied to Omi. Okay.

1045
01:04:10,871 --> 01:04:15,820
Until Domi fights for fucking cops in
his mid forties and has to get Tabors

1046
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:17,680
tasered numerous fucking times.

1047
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:21,670
I'm going to go with Bob Prober and I
don't want have any sort of fucking hockey

1048
01:04:21,671 --> 01:04:24,820
geek. Come on here and talk to
me about fucking career stats.

1049
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:30,250
Bring out dome use, arrest record.
All right. Has he been arrested?

1050
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:33,250
I didn't even look it up. That's how
fucked up probate's arrest record was.

1051
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:34,060
I didn't even have,

1052
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:37,830
I didn't have the decency to look up
tied only so there you go. All right,

1053
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:40,400
I've got to wrap this thing up
here. This is getting too long. Um,

1054
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:43,420
there's a couple more questions.
I'll ask the answer real quick.

1055
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:47,500
Have you ever done any work on
a cruise ship? Uh, yes I did.

1056
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:51,130
And they won't be asking me
back. The captain wrote a letter,

1057
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:52,840
said I was offensive to all races.

1058
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:57,910
Said I made fun of Handicapped People
Cause I did a joke about midgets. Um,

1059
01:04:58,030 --> 01:05:00,190
you know, I don't, I don't know
what to tell you. You know, uh,

1060
01:05:00,191 --> 01:05:02,620
I was told that at the night. You
already answered this question.

1061
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:03,633
Did I answer this question?

1062
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:08,190
They told me he's going to be young people
and then I got on the cruise ship and

1063
01:05:08,191 --> 01:05:13,050
the first person I saw was that old
Vietnamese lady lady with no teeth asleep

1064
01:05:13,051 --> 01:05:16,740
with their mouth open. Wearing that
on picking rice hat. Then I tell you,

1065
01:05:16,741 --> 01:05:20,970
I told you that, right? I don't
fucking remember. All right,

1066
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,680
let's get on with it. Okay.
That's the podcast for the week.

1067
01:05:23,681 --> 01:05:26,500
I'm going to tell you some
of my, uh, my fucking, uh,

1068
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,660
my dates they have coming up here,
my slow computer, June, 2008.

1069
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:35,250
Um, alright. Oh, big
date here. I've got, uh,

1070
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:39,310

up, uh, July 10th through the 13th.

1071
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:40,380
Um,

1072
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:44,620
I'm actually coming in town the day
before cause I'm going to be going to that

1073
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:47,230
pirates game. So, uh, if
you go to the pirates game,

1074
01:05:47,231 --> 01:05:50,350
I'm sure you're going to be able to see
me cause it's gonna be me and 18 other

1075
01:05:50,351 --> 01:05:54,730
fucking people sitting out
there at the Goddamn game.

1076
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,400
But that's, uh, July
10th through the 13th.

1077
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:01,690
And then July 31st through August 3rd,
I'm going to be at the comedy. I'm sorry,

1078
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:05,620
August 2nd. I'll be at the
comedy works in uh, Denver,

1079
01:06:05,621 --> 01:06:08,680
Colorado and uh,

1080
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:12,370
August 14th to the 17th. I'll
be at the Improv in Miami.

1081
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:16,240
Then I got a bunch of other dates coming
up cause right on the 23rd of August,

1082
01:06:16,241 --> 01:06:16,751

1083
01:06:16,751 --> 01:06:20,560
my specialist coming out and then I'm
going to be doing a tour and information

1084
01:06:20,561 --> 01:06:24,910

so keep the questions coming. Uh,

1085
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,250
let me know how you
guys think the story is.

1086
01:06:26,251 --> 01:06:27,520
Sometimes I think the stories are good.

1087
01:06:27,521 --> 01:06:31,420
Sometimes I think kind of slows
me down from a joking around.

1088
01:06:31,421 --> 01:06:34,030
I don't know if they're boring or if
they're interesting, please let me know.

1089
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:35,170
Please give me your feedback.

1090
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,680
I'll probably regret saying that cause
now I'm going to get a bunch of yeah and

1091
01:06:38,681 --> 01:06:41,890
you started too much during
them and blah blah blah. So

1092
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:46,960
what, why would I open myself up to
more criticisms in life? Anyways,

1093
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:49,600
thanks everybody. I really
appreciate all you guys listening.

1094
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:52,480
I know I say I only have 14 listeners.
I know it's a lot more than that.

1095
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:54,250
It's gotta be at least 32 at this point.

1096
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:57,430
And I really appreciate that you guys
keep telling me that you like them.

1097
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:58,900
As long as you're telling
me you keep liking them,

1098
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:01,900
I'm going to keep doing
them and I feel like I'm me.

1099
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:03,310
You don't have to fucking listen.

1100
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:07,390
I don't know why I have this hippy
thing today. Uh, all right. That's it.

1101
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,010
That's the Monday morning podcast.

1102
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:12,520
God bless all of you and it's off
to Chicago and let's win there.

1103
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:17,680
I'll talk to you guys. A, what
the fuck is it? Next Monday.

1104
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:23,350
All right, happy July 4th
weekend. God bless America and uh,

1105
01:07:23,351 --> 01:07:26,980
you know, stop taking shit from American
Airlines and other airlines and stuff.

1106
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:30,430
Taking shit from these corporations.
Go to their websites and complain.

1107
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:32,860
Use a lot of words like
outrageous, ridiculous.

1108
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:37,540
Try to go to a privately owned
shit. That's what I like doing.

1109
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:40,660
I tried to do that. Then you go in
there and they shit all over the food,

1110
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:44,140
all over the spoon. I mean,
this is food all over the spoon.

1111
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:47,830
God just fucking, this is why, you know,

1112
01:07:47,831 --> 01:07:51,010
most people when they read the
dyslexic, I like to speak in dyslexia.

1113
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,600
This is why I became a comedian.

1114
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,930
If she ever fucking wondered
why this is why I did it,

1115
01:07:56,170 --> 01:08:00,730
because I'm too much of a moron to
exist in the real world. And secondly,

1116
01:08:00,731 --> 01:08:04,390
when I'm in the real world, um, I like,

1117
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:08,040
I just keep hearing this voice
over and over and just going,

1118
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:11,770
this is fucking stupid. This is
fucking stupid. Fucking stupid.

1119
01:08:11,771 --> 01:08:13,420
That's all I would hear. You know,

1120
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:16,970
I tried to sit in the meetings as they
talked about how to make the product

1121
01:08:16,971 --> 01:08:20,300
better and to try and
increase the revenues.

1122
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:25,280
And everyone was sitting there and they
had out little little notebooks cause it

1123
01:08:25,281 --> 01:08:29,110
was the 80s, early nineties and
it was fucking writing shit down.

1124
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:32,360
And I just got so I couldn't hear what
the person was saying cause my brain just

1125
01:08:32,361 --> 01:08:34,700
kept going. This is fucking
stupid. This is fucking stupid.

1126
01:08:34,701 --> 01:08:38,780
I don't want to do this. I don't
wanna fucking do this. All right,

1127
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:43,160
I don't fucking do this. Alright,
there you go. That's my job history.

1128
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:44,450
Before I became a comedian.

1129
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:49,430
It was me doing one job after another and
hearing a loud voice in my head going,

1130
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:51,130
I don't want to fucking
do this, so I don't,

1131
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:54,530
and now I do this and this is too long.
All right, I'll talk to you next week.

1132
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:55,423
Have a great week. Bye.

1133
