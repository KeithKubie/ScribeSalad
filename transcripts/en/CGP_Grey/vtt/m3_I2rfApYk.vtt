00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
Brexit!
The British exit from the European Union.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.320
It's a thing that's happening – or maybe not.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.920
Or maybe the United Kingdom is falling apart.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.280
There's a lot going on, so let's talk about Brexit, briefly.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.420
First: How'd we get here?

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.720
In the UK, voters for UKIP—the UK Independence Party—
grew in number over the last few elections.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.440
Now, because the United Kingdom uses a terrible
first-past-the-post voting system,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.680
UKIP, rather than getting a proportional
number of seats in Parliament,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.560
largely drained votes from the Conservative Party.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.740
So, in the 2015 election, Conservatives promised to hold
an in-or-out referendum on the EU if they won,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.060
presumably to try and sway UKIP voters to their side.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.680
The Conservatives did win, in what was, by the way,
the most unrepresentative election in UK history—

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.600
—thanks again First Past the Post,
click here for more details—

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.300
and the promised referendum was scheduled.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.740
With huge voter turnout, Brexit won 52 to 48.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.920
So what happens next?

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.040
Well, the EU has a law called Article 50
saying countries can exit.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.900
Basically it's a "press here to leave" button.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.180
But the Conservative Prime Minister who promised
upon Brexit victory to press it immediately,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.580
instead resigned immediately,
leaving the UK politically doing nothing.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.960
There was talk of a second Brexit—

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.240
"No-but-seriously-it-might-actually-happen-if-you-vote-for-it-this-one-is-legally-binding-Referendum",

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.620
or re-electing Parliament.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.840
But then the new UK Prime Minister was appointed
and she said that wouldn't happen.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.660
Presumably the UK Parliament
now needs to pass a

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.650
"Yes we are really pressing the Brexit button law",

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.380
but they seem to be in no rush.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.180
Meanwhile the EU wants the UK to get on with it,
but the UK wants to pre-decide

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.960
all the details of what an independent
UK's relationship with the EU would look like,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.820
but the EU doesn't want to talk
until the UK actually leaves.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.300
Not surprising because talking before gives negotiating
advantage to the UK, and talking after to the EU,

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.140
and since the EU can't force the UK to press the button,

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.020
there's a sort of negotiating stalemate.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.420
Finally, because there's really
no procedure for anything,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.800
the only correct answer to
"What happens next?" is...

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.630
"Who knows!"

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.820
We are standing in a fog with naught
but speculation, so...

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.400
Speculation time!

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.080
Acting as a Brexit bookie, I'm putting 15% odds
on the chance of Maximum Brexit occurring,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.100
where the UK is a fully independent nation, with total
control over her trade deals and immigration and laws.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.120
The UK is to the EU as Brazil is to the EU:
just another country.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.160
If that probability seems low, what with
the new pro-Brexit Prime Minister,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.280
and with the required going against
the will of the people and all,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.580
here's my reasoning why.
Speculation the 1st:

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.290
The Conservatives didn't want the UK
to really leave the EU.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.480
Though they campaigned for the referendum,
they were officially neutral on the issue,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.960
and, I suspect, privately against.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.840
If you think the Conservatives are
the more business friendly party,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.480
the UK leaving the EU would be
bad news for many businesses

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.160
that prefer larger economic blocs – like banks.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.480
Pre-2015 election,
the Conservatives probably thought

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.180
citizens wouldn't really vote for Brexit,
so they could safely gamble to sway UKIP voters,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
but again – surprise! – 52 to 48.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.660
Even the new prime minister,
who's all "Brexit means Brexit",

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.720
was against it before she got her current job.
Speculation the 2nd:

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.670
Some Brexiteers didn't really want to win either.
The Brexit campaign admitted after winning,

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.200
they have zero plans what to do, which sounds a lot like
"We never planned to win."

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.180
The leadership of UKIP resigned – an odd choice on
what should be a theoretical crowning moment of glory,

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.840
and after the Conservative Prime Minister resigned, the
most prominent Brexiteers didn't want to take the job.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.740
Funny, that.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.360
Also interesting to note:
the referendum was set up to have zero legal power,

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.620
something all the parties agreed on before hand.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.580
It was essentially an opinion poll,
though not at all marketed that way to voters.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.320
All this is to speculate the majority of
people in power do not want Brexit to happen.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.140
To be clear, while governments could just totally
ignore the vote and still be technically correct,

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.480
there's no way that doesn't look
horrifically undemocratic.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.490
But, while Brexit was sold on the idea
of a stronger independent Britain,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.520
the international markets and national
economy have strongly disagreed,

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.480
and the geography of the vote have indicated
it might not be the whole of Britain leaving.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.560
After the vote, Scotland immediately said that
if the UK leaves the EU, Scotland isn't coming.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.460
She voted to stay, so she will.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.500
If maximum Brexit occurs, I put 97% odds
on Scotland leaving the UK and staying with the EU.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.810
Add to that, if Scotland leaves, I give 45% odds
of Northern Ireland leaving as well,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.200
rejoining Ireland Ireland.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.500
And, crazy as it sounds,
if Scotland and Northern Ireland leave,

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.500
I'll actually put 5% odds
on London leaving England

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.900
and becoming an independent city-state in the EU,
which would be kind of awesome,

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.800
because who doesn't love city-states?

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.380
This would leave England and Wales on their own,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.100
and of course while it's possible they'd do just fine –
there are plenty of comparable independent nations –

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.920
the international markets have already said
"do not want" to just the UK leaving as a whole,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.040
so I wouldn't bet on it being a rosy future,

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.820
and it's probably not something many Brexit voters
would have picked were it on the referendum.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.620
But even ignoring the breakup of the Union,
when thinking about the likelihood of Maximum Brexit,

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.060
on one side are the majority of people
who voted for it,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.600
and on the other side are
the businesses and the politicians,

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.220
even, I speculate,
many who pretend to be for it.

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.689
The politics of power here is why
I give such low odds to maximum Brexit,

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.909
and why I give 30% odds to the second option:
literally, nothing happens.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.710
The UK government plays the stalling game forever,
pretending to move forward while doing nothing.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.540
This politically tumultuous time becomes
a trivia fact for a future video

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.200
about how the UK has been in the process
of "leaving" the EU for a hundred years,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.720
like when countries sometimes discover
they're technically still at war

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.860
because there's an old declaration they forgot to annul.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.200
It's not a great outcome, because governments and
businesses and people don't like uncertainty,

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.580
but never underestimate the human ability to
procrastinate on paperwork.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.640
Even Miss "Brexit means Brexit"
is also Miss "Mustn't be too hasty"

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.100
about actually pressing the Article 50 button.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.880
But the last option I think is the most likely:

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.309
55% odds on a non-Brexit Brexit.

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:49.429
The European Union has many asterisks
and layers to her membership.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.320
The UK could leave the European Union,

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.460
slide over into the European Economic Area,
and be technically correct that she's left the EU.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.200
Actually, before this whole brouhaha,
the UK had arranged a deal with the EU

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.000
to become more like an EEA member,
that was dropped once the referendum started,

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.500
but that deal is lying on a table somewhere...
(just saying)

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.940
This would be the most pure compromise,
leaving both sides...

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.740
unhappy.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.000
Nothing Brexit voters actually
cared about would change:

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.600
Immigration, EU membership fees and binding EU laws,
all this would remain the same.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.680
The only thing different would be the UK giving up
all her representatives in the EU Parliament,

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.760
so she would have zero influence on EU law
she would still have to follow,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.460
which is not something pro-EU voters
probably wanted either.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.820
But nonetheless, I give the greatest odds
of this happening

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.660
because nothing would change for businesses,
making them happy,

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.140
and for politicians it's a face-saving maneuver
to have "listened to the people" and to "leave"

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.649
while doing neither and possibly avoiding
the breakup of the United Kingdom.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.580
Who wants to be prime minister during that?

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.300
In conclusion: None of these outcomes are clean wins.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.680
The first is very probably the end of the United Kingdom,

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.100
and goes against what seems to be
economic self-interest – but maybe not, who knows? –

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.830
and the other to go against, like, the idea of democracy.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.570
The UK stands at a path that splits into many futures.

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:57.039
Maybe the EU burns herself to the ground
due to all her problems,

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.340
and "Wales-gland" rises from the ashes
a mighty phoenix.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.400
Maybe the UK gets the worst of everything;
maybe literally nothing changes.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.560
Which leads where? Which is the best?
It's impossible to know.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.620
The UK can only stand in the fog,
speculate, and pick a path.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.760
Good luck, United Kingdom,
whatever you choose to do.
