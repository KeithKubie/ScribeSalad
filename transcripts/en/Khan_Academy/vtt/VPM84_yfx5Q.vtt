00:00:00.175 --> 00:00:02.477
- [Narrator] Administrators
at Riverview High School

00:00:02.477 --> 00:00:06.869
surveyed a random sample
of 100 of their seniors

00:00:06.869 --> 00:00:09.809
to see how they felt
about the lunch offerings

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.392
at the school's cafeteria.

00:00:12.392 --> 00:00:14.507
So you have all of the seniors,

00:00:14.507 --> 00:00:16.314
I'm assuming there's more
than a hundred of them,

00:00:16.314 --> 00:00:17.969
and then they sampled a hundred of them.

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:19.621
So this is the sample.

00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:23.084
So the population is all of
the seniors at the school.

00:00:23.084 --> 00:00:25.479
That's the population, all of the seniors.

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:27.467
And they sampled a hundred of them.

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:29.203
So the hundred seniors that the talked to,

00:00:29.203 --> 00:00:30.772
that is the sample.

00:00:30.772 --> 00:00:32.355
That is the sample.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.397
So they tell us, identify the population

00:00:35.397 --> 00:00:36.712
and the sample this setting.

00:00:36.712 --> 00:00:38.083
So let's just see which if these choices

00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:39.486
actually match up to what I just said.

00:00:39.486 --> 00:00:41.720
And like always, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.661
and see if you can work
through it on your own.

00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:47.887
So, the population is all high
school seniors in the world;

00:00:47.887 --> 00:00:52.054
the sample is all of the
seniors at Riverview High.

00:00:53.425 --> 00:00:55.078
No, this is not right.

00:00:55.078 --> 00:00:58.413
We're not trying to get an indication of

00:00:58.413 --> 00:01:00.760
how all of the high school
seniors in the world

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.078
feel about the food at
Riverview High School.

00:01:04.078 --> 00:01:04.926
We're trying to get an indication of

00:01:04.926 --> 00:01:07.406
how the seniors at Riverview High School

00:01:07.406 --> 00:01:11.323
feel about the lunch at
the school's cafeteria.

00:01:12.267 --> 00:01:15.031
So they did a sample of hundred of them.

00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:17.882
So this is definitely not going to be--

00:01:17.882 --> 00:01:20.049
let me cross this one out.

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:25.085
The population is all
students at Riverview High;

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:29.597
the sample is all of the
seniors at Riverview High.

00:01:29.597 --> 00:01:32.142
Well, they clearly didn't
sample all of the seniors,

00:01:32.142 --> 00:01:34.629
they sampled a hundred of the seniors.

00:01:34.629 --> 00:01:36.535
So this isn't gonna be right either.

00:01:36.535 --> 00:01:40.551
Let's hope that the third
choice is working out.

00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:43.822
The population is all
seniors at Riverview High;

00:01:43.822 --> 00:01:46.488
the sample is the
hundred seniors surveyed.

00:01:46.488 --> 00:01:48.526
Yep, that's exactly what we talked here.

00:01:48.526 --> 00:01:50.298
We're trying to get an
indication about how

00:01:50.298 --> 00:01:52.831
all of the seniors at Riverview High feel

00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:55.107
about the food, the lunch offerings.

00:01:55.107 --> 00:01:57.255
We probably think it's impractical

00:01:57.255 --> 00:01:58.698
or the administrators
feel it's impractical

00:01:58.698 --> 00:01:59.976
to talk to everyone.

00:01:59.976 --> 00:02:02.357
So, to get exactly what
the population thinks.

00:02:02.357 --> 00:02:03.190
So instead they're gonna do

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.773
a random sample of a hundred of them.

00:02:04.773 --> 00:02:07.271
So the sample is the hundred seniors

00:02:07.271 --> 00:02:09.438
who are actually surveyed.
