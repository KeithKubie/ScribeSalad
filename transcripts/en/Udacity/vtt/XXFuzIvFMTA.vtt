00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.560
Just about anything can be changed with texture mapping. Beyond color and

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.730
alpha, here's an example of changing the shininess for different locations on

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.790
the body. The face is fairly shiny. The back of the head and shoulders less so.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.680
Here are the color and specular textures for the face. In 3.js, the specular

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.770
map uses the red channel of the texture as the strength of the specular

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.530
contribution. A level of 255 means the specular component is scaled to one. In

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.550
other words, full strength dropping off as this value falls. Your task is to

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.290
apply a texture as a specular map. See the exercises code for the path to the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.870
texture. Look at the online documentation for how to set the specular map for

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.550
mesh fong material. On the left is the teapot without the specular map. Once

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.330
you're done, you'll see a teapot like the one on the right. As you change the

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.890
view, you'll see that just the specular highlights are textured.
