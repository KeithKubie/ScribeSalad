00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.310
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Hello and welcome
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.660
My name is Rob Casper, I'm the
head of the library's Poetry

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.840
and Literature Center here,
and I could not be more excited

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.150
to celebrate the
50th anniversary

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.920
of the acclaimed essential
International Writers Program

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.400
at the University of Iowa.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.880
It's a historic occasion for
literature and for our country.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.880
I would like to take
this opportunity

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.420
to thank not only
IWP for being here,

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.380
but also thank our presenting
partners, the Hispanic division

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.160
of the Library of Congress
and the Bureau of Educational

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.890
and Cultural Affairs at the
U.S. Department of State.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.930
Before we begin, let me ask you,

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.790
since you are all taking
pictures of yourselves,

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.640
why don't you just
put them on silent.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.270
I'm going to turn mine off just

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.810
to make sure they
don't interfere

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.220
with the recording event.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.320
This is being recorded and we'll
have a Q&amp;A section at the end.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.310
By participating in that
section, you give us permission

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.770
for future use of the recording.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.990
Second, let me tell you a
little bit about the Poetry

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.460
and Literature Center.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.600
We are home to the
U.S. Poet laureate;

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.240
our current poet laureate is
Tracy K. Smith and we put on 20

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.080
to 30 programs like this
one throughout the year.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.190
In fact, next week on November
9th, in honor of Veterans Day,

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.600
we are featuring Pulitzer Prize
Winning Poet Yusef Komunyakaa

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.490
reading his favorite poems
of World War I in honor

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.850
of our exhibit upstairs,
Echoes of the Great War,

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.700
American Experiences
of World War I.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.620
To learn more about
the programs that we do

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.980
and programs sponsored
by not only the Poetry

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.310
and Literature Center, but
also the Hispanic Division,

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.720
you can sign our signup
sheet out in the foyer.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.880
You can also visit our
website www.loc.gov.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.750
Speaking of the Hispanic
Division, I know most of you got

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.540
to check out the collections of
Gabriel Garcia Marquez 100 years

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.560
of solitude books
that we have there,

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.420
curated by our reference
librarian Heather Gomez.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.420
If you haven't had a chance
to check them out, you should.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.100
They're wonderful and
exciting and show the history

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.670
of that book, which we'll
talk about in today's program.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.850
You can read about the
participants in today's program

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.410
in your print program,

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.430
you should all have
one at your seat.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.010
But I need to introduce
Chris Merrill,

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.730
the longtime director
of the IWP.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.660
Chris Merrill has published
six selections, six collections

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.510
of poetry including Watchfire,

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.370
for which he received the
Lavone Younger Poet's award

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.870
from the Academy
of American Poets.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.410
Many works of translation
edited volumes, among them,

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.320
The Forgotten Language
Contemporary Poets of Nature

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.390
and six books of nonfiction.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.030
His work has bravely
been translated

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.000
into nearly 40 languages.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.180
And his honors include a
Knighthood in Arts and Letters

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.230
from the French government.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.660
His journalism also appears
in many publications.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.840
As Director of the IWP,
Merrill has undertaken cultural

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.810
diplomacy missions for
more than 50 countries

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.740
and I can say personally
that Chris is a tireless,

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.360
inspiring advocate for
writers and writing.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.930
Please join me in welcoming

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.510
and congratulating
Christopher Merrill.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:02.510
[ Applause ]

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.810
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:
Thank you, Rob.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.440
It's a thrill to be here today.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.710
The IWP has had the good luck
to partner with the Library

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.900
of Congress for the
last several years

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.500
and this year is an
especially rich moment for us.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.040
So, I'm going to read just
a tiny little introduction

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.670
to what we'll be doing today.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.250
Many years later, when he
faced the firing squad,

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.270
Colonel Aureliano Buendia was to
remember that distant afternoon

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.010
when his father took
him to discover ice.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.520
So, begins 100 years
of solitude,

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.670
Gabriel Garcia Marquez's
masterpiece,

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.590
which was published 50
years ago in Buenos Aries

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.680
and is widely regarded
as the key text

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.340
in the Latin American boom,
the literary Renaissance

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.080
of the 1960's and 70's that
reshaped world literature.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.330
The Columbian novelist,
journalist and Nobel laureate,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.440
Garcia Marquez and fellow
writers like Jorge Luis Borges,

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.040
Julio Cortazar, Jose
Donoso, Carlos Fuentes

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.250
and Mario Vargas Liosa were
not only bold explorers

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.270
of foreign history and politics,

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.020
but also influential
thinkers whose works continue

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.280
to inspire intrepid spirits
to strike out on their own.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.980
Take that opening sentence,
which brings together a wealth

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.830
of dispirit elements, a firing
squad, a visit to an ice house,

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.600
a father and son past and
present in the service

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.980
of what critics from
term, magical realism.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:44.130
A vision of the human condition
that resonated around the world.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.640
In that same year, 1967, the
American poet, Paul Engle

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.430
and his soon to be second wife,

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.650
a Chinese novelist Nieh Hualing
hosted the first residency

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.440
of the University of Iowa's
International Writing Program.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.310
Engle had directed the Iowa
writers workshop for decades

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.370
and upon his retirement,
Hualing convinced him

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.480
to start a similar program
for writers from abroad,

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.870
what he called the craziest
idea he had ever heard.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.740
Then he and Hualing proceeded
to build the IWP believing

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.960
that distinguished foreign poets

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.910
and writers would welcome the
chance to spend three months

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.610
in Iowa City working
and exchanging ideas

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.750
with their counterparts
from other lands.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.970
In this, the Engle's anticipated
Kevin Costner's famous line

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:40.390
from Field of Dreams, a film
set in Iowa and based on a novel

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.990
by a graduate of the
writer's workshop who wrote,

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.800
If You Build It They Will Come.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.230
With funding from the
U.S, Department of State,

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.420
the university arranged
through philanthropic sources

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.410
and through bilateral
agreements, the IWP has hosted

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.930
over the last half century,
more than 1,400 writers

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.730
from 150 countries,
including 189

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.570
from Central and South America.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:14.800
The IWP, included in this
are two prize winning,

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.250
two Nobel laurates, Orhan Pamuk
from Turkey, Mo Yan from China,

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.280
best-selling writers from every
continent and major boom figures

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.170
like Jose Donoso, the Chilean
author of The Obscene Bird

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.860
of the Night, as well
as post boom writers

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.270
like Luisa Valenzuela,
the Argentinean author

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.920
of the Lizard's Tale

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.650
and Gustavos Sainz
the Mexican author

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.830
of the Princess of the Palace.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.410
In short, the IWP
brings together writers

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.670
from distant lands in the
service of literature,

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:52.230
that magical arena in which all
manner of memory's, impressions

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:56.560
and stories continue, combine
to address the complicated days

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.280
and nights of characters
real and imagined

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.130
and cultural diplomacy which
has been defined as the exchange

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.410
of ideas and information.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.890
The result, on the one
hand, poems and novels,

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.650
plays and films, essays
and nonfiction works,

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:17.200
all seeking to bear witness
to our walk in the sun

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.470
and on the other hand, the
gift of cultural exchange,

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.790
which is the capacity
to entertain a larger,

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:28.150
more nuanced understanding of
the infinitely diverse peoples

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.530
with whom we share this earth.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.820
That's the theme of what
we'll be talking about today

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.660
and we'll begin with Cynthia
Schneider, the professor

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:39.410
from Georgetown who has,
who probably knows more

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:42.790
about cultural diplomacy
than anybody on the planet.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.090
Cynthia.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.040
[ Applause ]

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.670
&gt;&gt; Cynthia P. Schneider:
That's a [inaudible] idea

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.420
but thank you, thank
you very much.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.120
And it's really wonderful
to be here.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.220
I don't want to take up
too much of your time away

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.170
from these wonderful writers
we're going to hear from.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.840
But I think I'm going to begin
by quoting a Dutch historian

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.940
who said, Johan Huizinga
who said,

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:13.690
if you want to understand
America, read Walt Whitman,

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:17.020
and after that, watch
American cinema.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:22.530
Now, this idea that you
understand a country

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:25.710
through its writers,
through its creative writers

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.080
who of course are also
involved in cinema is

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:36.340
such an important idea, I
think, and I wish very much

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.090
that it was an idea
that policy makers

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:45.140
in America not only
believed in but practiced.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:53.790
I have been trying for the last
10 years to integrate politics

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:59.620
and culture to try to
persuade policy makers here

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:03.020
that culture is not
just a nice thing

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.930
that you praise once a year
at the Kennedy Center Honors,

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.220
but actually something
that is essential

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.870
to international relations.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:17.100
If you look around you can
see how successful I've been.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:22.740
But, this idea came to me
when I had the great privilege

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.420
of serving as U.S.
Ambassador to the Netherlands

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.640
under President Clinton and
there, I came to that position

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.760
as an art historian and in

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.790
that position I could see
first-hand the power of culture

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:42.020
in the context of diplomacy
and with all due respect

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.830
to the State Department
colleagues here,

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:48.320
they are not implicated
in this, I also could see

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.760
that the State Department just
didn't take culture seriously.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.900
It just puts it to one
side and so I have tried

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.770
through my position at
Georgetown to embrace other ways

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:04.160
and initiatives to try to
demonstrate the importance

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:10.810
of culture in diplomacy and
the role I think is captured

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:15.250
by great Nigerian playwright
novelist, Wole Soyinka,

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:21.100
who said at the one national
conference on cultural diplomacy

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.380
that was held in November,
2000, at the White House,

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.800
Soyinka said, and
I'm condensing,

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:34.560
culture humanizes,
politics demonizes.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.110
And I think, you know,
we've never been more aware

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:40.940
of the latter phrase
than we are today.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:45.380
And this kind of
separation of culture

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:49.000
and politics was not always
true in the United States.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.410
Interestingly, at
times of conflict,

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:56.060
and I would argue we are
in a time of conflict now,

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.840
when in times of conflict
the U.S. Government

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.360
and policy makers
turn to culture

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.650
and have played a
very important role.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.780
I'll give you two examples.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:14.090
One in Latin America, in 1941
there was a symbiotic aligning

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:19.430
of the stars when animators
in Hollywood went on strike

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:24.110
and the U.S. Government, taking
advantage of this, asked,

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:29.570
invited Walt Disney to create
a couple of animated films

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:33.740
for the Latin American
audience with the goal

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:37.790
of stemming the tide
toward fascism in the lead

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:40.710
up to World War II
in South America.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.870
This was kind of an amazing
idea when you think about it.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.420
And if you think
that is amazing,

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:49.710
what is even more incredible
is that the government,

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:54.300
instead of just saying OK go
make movies for Latin America,

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.880
sent Walt Disney and
his whole animating team

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:06.500
on a nine-week tour of Latin
and South America to try to,

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:11.290
incredible idea, understand
the audience and see

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.620
where they are coming from.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:18.280
And create films that will
be, you know, appropriate

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.100
and understandable
and meaningful

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.280
in some way in that context.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.480
And there's a wonderful
documentary about this made by,

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:31.360
directed by the son of one
of the animators called Walt

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.400
and El Groupo, that's
what they were called.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.110
And it's based on the
letters they wrote back,

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:41.470
because of course that was the
means of communication then.

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:42.910
And they produced
a couple of films

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:44.790
that really were
quite successful.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:49.520
Did they, you know, they didn't
say resist totalitarianism,

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.550
they had particularly
independent minded speaking

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:56.180
birds and you know,
things like that.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.010
But I've had students who said,
oh yes, I remember those films,

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.460
my parents always
talked about those films,

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.120
they loved those films.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.520
And so, there is one example
and the other is, I think,

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:11.670
very well known to you, the use
of culture during World War II.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:16.440
I'm sorry during the Cold War,
and I think what's best known is

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.630
of course the jazz musicians
who travelled all over the world

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.090
and I think such an
important point to make

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:27.300
about that particularly
in today's climate,

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.760
is that these are of course
mostly African American

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:36.570
musicians travelling as
ambassadors of a government

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:41.470
that suppressed them horribly
at home in the United States,

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:45.100
this was during the era
of extreme segregation

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.210
and the Jim Crow laws.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:50.450
And what made an
incredible impression

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:55.540
on audiences abroad particularly
behind the iron curtain,

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.480
but in any country with
a totalitarian government

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.600
which was most countries they
visited, was that these artists,

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.970
they were there to play
music and they did,

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:09.790
but if anyone asked them
about their life at home,

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.240
they were very honest about it

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.980
and what I think is
most commendable is

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.880
that the state department
that sent them knew that.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.950
There's a famous story in
Dizzy Gillespie's autobiography

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:24.820
where he says, they
wanted me to go

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.750
to some briefing
before the trip,

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.670
but I don't need any briefing,
I know what this country is

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.600
and I have my own story to tell.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.760
Well, the people who sent
him knew that and sent him.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:40.110
And nobody said, oh you're just
musicians, you can't speak,

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.530
you don't have anything to say.

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:46.140
And it was this very
freedom of expression

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:49.030
that was not only tolerated
by the U.S. Government,

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:53.020
but actively supported
and actually funded,

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.740
that made such an
extraordinary impression.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.870
But what we understood in the
Cold War, and I think that's

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:03.900
so important in today's
context, was it wasn't just

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.800
about sending American's abroad,

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.580
we also spent a phenomenal
amount of money,

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:14.920
some say up to a million
dollars a year, publishing

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:19.470
and distributing rush
literature from Eastern Europe

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.120
and particularly from Russia.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.690
It was the United States that
got Dr. Zhivago out of Russia

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:30.030
and [inaudible] writings
and not only that,

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:34.030
but also distributed
them inside Russia.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.780
So, there was a recognition
of something so important

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:41.470
that it's not just about
sending Americans around

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.160
and American's writings around,

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:49.050
but it's about leveraging local
voices, which was something

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:53.810
that really just the United
States had the capacity to do.

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:58.490
And getting that word out,
getting those creative voices

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:02.910
out and telling the world what
was the story of the Gulag

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:07.210
and disseminating it within
the vast, then, Soviet Union,

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:13.450
was so important in
seeding the idea of freedom

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:18.040
and seeding the idea
of a different system.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.710
And when you look at the
situation we're in today,

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:25.620
we are locked in a kind
of ideological battle

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:29.790
and what's our answer?

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:36.440
Drones, special forces,
you know, that has a role,

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:40.080
but we're really
talking about ideas here

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:44.830
and we have amongst our
writers in every country

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:49.020
that is problematic in this
war against extremists,

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.540
also has their own writers.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:55.080
Very often they're suppressed
by their own governments,

00:17:55.080 --> 00:18:00.180
and I wish that we would spend
as much attention and learn

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:06.310
from our own history, lifting
up those writers and the ideas

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:09.360
and the vision and
the imagination

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.190
about individual freedoms
and a different kind of life,

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:16.270
a life that's appropriate
in that place.

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:19.220
And, you know, we have
the capacity to do that

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.720
and I think the State
Department's support

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.640
for this wonderful program
shows that, you know,

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:29.980
we know how to do this, at
least in the United States.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:33.840
I just wish the people in
the regional bureaus dealing

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:39.420
with all these countries
would take this seriously,

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.640
because it's a very
serious thing,

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.160
the incredible work you produce

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.510
and everyone should take it more
seriously, even when it's funny.

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:54.650
[ Applause ]

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:55.950
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill: And now

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:57.250
for the State Department,
Amy Storrow.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:00.460
&gt;&gt; Amy Storrow: Thank you.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:05.280
I'm looking forward
the Q&amp;A afterwards,

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.580
we might have [inaudible].

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:10.790
Thank you, Rob, thank you Chris,
thank you Iowa and thank you ECA

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.090
for this invitation today.

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.910
It's really a pleasure
to be here.

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.760
I'm going to tell four
short, tiny stories

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.770
and then draw some
conclusions from them.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.930
I'm kind of an odd bird
in the State Department

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:23.380
in that I myself have a Master

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.280
of Fine Arts and
Creative Writing.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.100
And I wanted to begin by telling
the story of my taking the exam

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.180
to get into the Foreign Service.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.770
There was a structured day where
they run you through all sorts

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:35.810
of tests and at the end
of the day they say,

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:39.250
is there anything you'd like
to talk about, and I said yes,

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:41.830
I'd like to explain why
a Master of Fine Arts

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.220
and Creative Writing is
excellent preparation

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.560
for the Foreign Service.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:50.310
And this was my argument, first
of all it produces good writers

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.960
and you can't write well
if you can't think well.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.180
Secondly, it produces
people who have read deeply,

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.460
and if you've read deeply,
you have an understanding

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.600
of human consciousness
that cannot be gotten

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:05.570
in any other way and what could
be more important for diplomacy.

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.240
It also means that you've
spent extensive time

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.170
in creative writing workshops

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.880
which means telling
people things very gently

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.680
that they don't want to hear.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.360
[ Laughter ]

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.670
So that they absorb them
and telling them things

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:23.580
that they do want to
hear that they'll dismiss

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.520
because they don't want
to be embarrassed by them.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.160
So, that was the background
that I came in with.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.180
I guess that speech
was successful.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.450
My second tour I had the great
privilege of serving in Scopje,

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.390
Macedonia as a cultural
affairs officer there.

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:41.050
And when I arrived within
a day or so I learned

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:44.590
from the cultural
affairs specialist there,

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.830
[inaudible] that the famous
writer, Caroline Forche,

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.860
was coming for the Scopje,
for the [inaudible] festival

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.720
and I had met her when I was
19, and I was dazzled, you know,

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.000
I thought this was
like Mick Jagger coming

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.670
to the states or something.

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:03.180
So, she came and
she was spectacular.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:05.380
She loved the community there.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:11.290
She met, as did I, Vladimir
Martinovski, and the thing

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:13.510
about it was that, you
know, back in the states

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.920
if I told somebody, even
if I told, to be honest,

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.750
my fellow Foreign Services
officers at the embassy,

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:22.840
a famous poet is coming, they'd
say, oh Amy, that's an oxymoron,

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.170
there's no such thing
as a famous poet.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.650
But there she was, she was
like the Dalai Lama, you know,

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:29.930
she was on the front page
of all the newspapers.

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.800
She did major evening
talk shows, they loved her

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.730
and she came back more than
once, I believe, since then.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.120
What that taught
me is that although

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.050
in America we have ideas
about poetry as a kind

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:48.040
of niche activity, sometimes
in a high culture context,

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:51.920
the rest of the world poets and
writers are public intellectuals

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.290
and they are here
to, to a degree,

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:56.680
but sometimes they've been
usurped lately by comedians.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.850
Also, there I met Nikola
Madzirov, who was a,

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:03.580
IWP graduate who went
on to great success.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.340
Caroline and I kind of
badgered poor Chris to make sure

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:11.080
that he got into the
program, and he went on to,

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.160
his work is now available
in more than 30 languages

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.410
and he's one of the,
often called one

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:18.970
of the most powerful
voices in European poetry.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.740
That resonated for me what, the
hunger for poetry and so I drew

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.430
from work of a group that I
used to work with called Writers

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:30.560
in the Schools in
Houston, Texas,

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.430
and decided that what we needed
were the writers and residents

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:38.640
that are American spaces, which
are like small branch libraries.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.900
So, a woman named Merilee
Cunningham agreed to come

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.920
and she spent a week
in residence at each

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.790
of our three American spaces
teaching creative writing

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:48.220
to young people.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:51.300
That program went so
well it spread to Serbia

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.970
where she worked in all of
their American spaces there,

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:57.020
and I also brought a
different writer, Tilapia.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.170
The thing about that too was

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.620
that there was Merilee
Cunningham

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.590
on the morning talk show,
because in Macedonia

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.140
at that time, the idea

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.660
of formally teaching creative
writing to young people,

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.590
that is teaching
critical thinking skills,

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:13.940
that is teaching how to think
clearly, was not something

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.900
that was taken for
granted as an activity.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.920
My third little story is
my previous job I was head

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.400
of the alumni office at
the Bureau of Educational

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.320
and Cultural Affairs and there
we launched a program called

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.510
Washington Circle, which
is an online talk show.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:32.040
So, we had the privilege of
having the poet, Edward Hirsch,

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.680
as a guest to talk about
civic engagement in the arts.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.250
And he was a spectacular
guest but I think the thing

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.020
that really struck me
was that the room that,

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.380
we did this in the Foreign
Press Center in New York,

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.630
was full of exchange students,
current exchange students

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.610
and there were a bunch of
people there from China and one

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:53.230
of them, and he was talking you
know about all kinds of work

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:56.020
and he mentioned Chinese poets
and I think someone thought,

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.900
haha, I'm going to play gotcha
with Ed Hirsch and said,

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.440
well you know, could you
talk about some Chinese poets

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.190
that have really influenced you?

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:06.910
He said, well you know, for
example, Li Po, and they just,

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:11.990
they were staggered, so I think
it's really this idea to go back

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:14.620
to what Ambassador Schneider
was saying, of mutuality,

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.110
that Americans certainly
don't know all the answers

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:19.160
about everything, nobody does,

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:23.450
but people to people exchanges
are really, really integral

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:28.360
for building common shared
language and shared values.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.560
And I wanted to also highlight
for you that the next episode

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.140
of the show will be on
November 8th at 2:00 p.m.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.300
and it will feature Margot Lee
Shetterly who is the author

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.330
of Hidden Figures,
which became a film.

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:44.720
So, if you can watch
that, please do.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.570
So, what do we make
of all of this?

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:47.870
Why does it matter?

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:49.170
I'm going to argue two things.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:52.270
First, that there are
intellectual gains

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:56.270
at the individual level, which
everybody here already knows.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:25:01.370
Creative writing in particular,
it's the most complex

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:04.460
and nuanced form of freedom
of expression that we have

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:07.010
as human beings, that's verbal.

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:09.780
With writers in the schools,
that group that I worked

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:13.120
with way back when, and that
group, the two poets who came

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:16.240
to Eastern Europe, they've
done a bunch of studies

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:20.100
about the impact of their
work and what it shows is,

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.980
and this was a third party
evaluator from University

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.590
of St. Thomas, the
students who participated

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:29.000
in the program showed measurable
gains in writing skills

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.050
and confidence in writing
and creativity as well

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:33.350
as an overall increase

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:35.850
in standardized test scores
compared to a controlled group

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:37.660
who did not participate
in the program.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.940
And these are evaluations that
have been going on since 1999.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:45.180
So, at the societal level,
what that programs does,

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.300
and many others like it, and
the work that you do, you know,

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.430
you who are participants,
is you create the core

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:54.350
of an educated citizenry,
and there's nothing more

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:57.450
than important than that.

00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:01.590
Another thing at the societal
level is that you are all,

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:04.670
you know, a core of public
intellectuals and I wanted

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:07.970
to highlight Vladimir
Martinovski's work for a second.

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:11.000
I reached back to the Post and
asked them, what would then

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.260
like me to say here at
the Library of Congress,

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.630
and they wanted me to
talk about Vladimir's work

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:18.290
with the professor's
[inaudible].

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:21.450
The main goal is to
ensure independence

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:25.350
of higher education institutions
and the work and freedom

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:29.000
of expression that then spread
from that goal to a wider range.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.830
So, poets are civic activists,
it's built into your DNA

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:35.310
because you care about words
and you care about thinking

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:36.980
and you care about people.

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:38.510
And we need you, so thank you.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:42.840
We know there are many
distinguished members

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.140
of the IWP.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.120
For those of you who are
current participants,

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.730
I want to highlight some
opportunities that are available

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:51.950
to you through the
Office of Alumni Affairs.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:54.630
When you get back home,
please do, you know,

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:59.610
knock on your embassy's door
or call them, and ask to talk,

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:03.170
if you can, say that you want to
get involved if you have time,

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:06.600
teach some workshops,
do something, give back,

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.910
I know that you want to, I know
that's built into who you are.

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:12.830
There are programs
through the alumni office,

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:15.630
the address is Alumni.state.gov.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.350
I particularly want to highlight

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:20.090
for you the alumni
engagement innovation fund

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:24.270
which offers grants of up
to $25,000 for programs

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:25.830
that you design yourselves.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:29.040
It's a competition that we'll
launch again in February.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.020
Because I asked for you, what
will you do with your success?

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.630
What will you do with
your medal that you wear

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.330
as a public intellectual?

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:38.510
And I thank you for that
and for your time today.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:47.040
[ Applause ]

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.340
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:
Thank you Amy.

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:50.790
I do want to say that
you're welcome to visit us

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:53.860
in Iowa City anytime you like
because that's the one place

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.510
in America where if you
tell someone you're a poet,

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:59.880
they're excited about it,

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.590
which is why we are
a city of literature.

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:07.800
Next, we're going to turn to
Santiago Giralt, our film maker,

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.470
novelist, writer of screen
plays from Argentina.

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:14.510
&gt;&gt; Santiago Giralt:
Thank you very much.

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:19.750
Well, I will mix a little bit of
biographical with a little bit

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:22.330
of some historical ideas.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:25.560
I want to talk about
international changes

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.470
versus cultural isolation.

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:31.810
When I was five years old,
my sister, one year older,

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:34.940
started studying English
in an English Academy.

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.840
Back then I wanted to
do everything she did,

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.940
she was like my twin sister.

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:42.840
So, she taught me how to
read a year before I supposed

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.140
to learn it in school.

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:48.560
I convinced my mother to go to
the same lessons that she went

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.030
at the English Academy
and a few weeks later

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.450
after the classes started,

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:56.420
my mother received a phone
call from the academy.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.490
At first, she worried
because a phone call was not

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:01.920
like an ordinary thing.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.490
It was not about my
sister, it was about me.

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:08.590
Christina, the woman said on
the phone calmly to my mother,

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:11.440
you have to pay the tuition
for your younger kid.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.900
He's participating in
class, solving problems

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.270
on the chalkboard, and
honestly seems more interested

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:19.500
in the language than
your daughter.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.360
So, I started reading English

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:25.130
and Spanish almost
at the same time.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.970
Years later there was a famous
French song called Joe Le Taxi

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.770
by Vanessa Paradix.

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:31.630
I love this song in
French, I asked my mom

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:33.670
to send me to the [inaudible].

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:34.990
I've never forgotten the basics

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:37.690
of the language I
learned in those days.

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:40.690
American, British, Irish
writers made me love English.

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:43.040
I consider myself an anglophile.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.150
Television sitcoms, subtitled
movies and books did the rest

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:49.730
until I had some time to immerse
in the language when I was 19

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:52.260
and I spent a year abroad.

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.510
With my French, I used to
go stronger with [inaudible]

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:58.420
after I discovered
Marcel Proust and I wanted

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:02.300
to enjoy the [inaudible] themes
without subtitles and I hope

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.940
to live to learn much more
languages, I love languages.

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.960
I decided to be a
writer in a country

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.700
where we have already one
sacred cow, Jorge Luis Borges.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:21.220
And at least a few other
international representatives,

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:22.520
[inaudible].

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:26.200
Many people ask me often, more
often than I would expect,

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.230
how could you write under
the influence of [inaudible],

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:31.790
I just respond, he is
my influence as much

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:35.020
as Marcel Proust in
Virginia Wolf or John Irving.

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.720
My nation is human kind,

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.200
my influences are not
localized geographically.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.570
I would also ask that same
person, how could you write

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:46.480
after Cervantes and there
would be no Spanish literature

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.020
to be begin with.

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:54.260
So, after the Latin American
boom, a literary phenomenon

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:57.500
that meant an expansion of Latin
American literature in the world

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.050
and some of Argentina
in particular.

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:03.920
After that, in Argentina
we had a big dictatorship

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.910
then democracy.

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:08.360
And after the crisis of 2001,

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.660
a few years of populous
government.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:14.890
After the crisis of 2001 the
politicians in Argentina had

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:18.220
to reveal the identity and
the confidence of the nation

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:23.070
by focusing only on internal
affairs on local culture.

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:27.230
As a result, the politics became
a way to reimagine Argentina

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:29.950
within its own borders
and a result of this,

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:33.410
a new form of naturalism and
cultural isolation emerged.

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:36.180
It's like the country
closed on itself

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:40.990
and we started getting less news
about international affairs.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:42.540
It was all about Argentina

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:46.700
as if it was the only
thing that mattered.

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:50.270
So, populism focused their
attention on the needs

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:54.680
of Argentina and recreated
them to the fractured nation.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.580
But the breech ran deeper
and deeper and after 12 years

00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:02.250
of populism the rich became,
the crack became an abyss.

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:05.020
Now a day's society
is divided in two

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:08.590
and the two fractions fight each
other in a silent civil war.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:12.430
And cultural isolation
became stronger and stronger.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:15.900
In Argentina there is only one
big airport and less than 5%

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:20.550
of the population travels
beyond the bordering countries.

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.880
It is a hard place for a
free thinker and an artist

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.740
who doesn't think the needs

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.000
of Argentina history
are untouchable

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.560
and who questions
many of the ideas

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.540
that constitute the
nations identity.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.320
Actually, my first
novel is about an affair

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.310
that [inaudible] had
with a 14-year-old girl.

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:39.690
So, imagine how I embrace
the Argentinian [inaudible].

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:44.160
I am an Argentine who doesn't
eat meat, I love traveling and I

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:50.210
like to discuss all the time
about the meats of Argentina.

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:58.610
So, where is my haven,
where did I find my haven?

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:01.430
First, in the foreign
languages that I learned

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:04.720
in visiting other cultures,
living inside a foreign land,

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.480
which one that is not
your mother tongue,

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.660
is finding an adopting nation.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:13.350
To expand this concept,
art has become my nation.

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:16.930
For example, I studied a year
cowriting and directing a play.

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:20.420
I had to learn many
words, for example,

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:24.750
every piece of clothing is
called differently in Spain.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:28.070
A sweatshirt we call
buzo, it's called sudadera

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:32.230
and the name we use in Argentina
means for them a diver.

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:38.250
A woman's sweater, a pullover
for us, would be a [inaudible],

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:41.500
name that came from
the Hitchcock movie,

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.040
and they use now for
the piece of clothing.

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.190
And so that's why I had
to understand the nuances

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:48.370
of the culture in order to
understand basic things,

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:51.620
and we are talking about
things like clothing.

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:54.530
I spent the last 11 weeks
in Iowa City sharing

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:56.460
in the International
Writing Program

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.780
with 34 other participants.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:01.920
Every time we had a discussion
about gender, sexuality,

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:05.820
politics, I felt like I was
walking on broken glass.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.120
Understanding the boundaries

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.190
of every culture was
a fundamental aspect

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:11.770
of this experience.

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:13.070
Creating a common ground

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:16.940
to share our experiences
was another one.

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:20.780
Artistic exchanges are a way
to break cultural isolation,

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.850
or at least they are for me.

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:25.010
It creates a land of exploration

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:28.080
for many people beyond the
boundaries of their own country

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:31.710
or region and allows people
to build a temporary society

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:35.440
with temporary rules that
apply to everyone involved.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:39.510
These rules allow the group
to understand its own need.

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:47.040
[ Inaudible Conversation ]

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:50.690
So, these rules allow the group
to understand its own needs

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:55.180
and to explore dynamic forms
of organization, gender, race,

00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:59.770
religion, sexuality, systems of
belief, are obliged to coexist

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:02.340
in a parallel society,
a micro cosmos

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.650
that reflects all societies.

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:07.990
In my own experience, it pushed
me to go beyond my comfort zone

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:10.380
and explore the beauty
of human bonds.

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:13.360
It's a way to remember
how societies are built

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:16.510
and how human forms of
organization emerge.

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:18.310
Thank you.

Garcia Arreaza from Venezuela,

fiction writer and poet.

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:36.850

Well, thank you so much

for having me here, it's an
honor to be in Washington

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:54.580
as a resident in International

to say this, it's an honor
to be in front of you,

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:03.510
For the last time
at least for once.

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:13.100
[ Foreign Language ]

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:17.980
Some years ago, a prominent
writer from my country asked me,

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:20.460
why do you plan to
publish a book with a title

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:23.630
of The Forest of Birches?

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:27.530
In Venezuela, evidently,
we don't have birches

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:30.040
or snow or [inaudible].

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:44.020
about being sad and poor.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:49.520
So, one day you will discover
that you must face and deal

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:53.100
with stupid people who
use an abject nationalism

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.530
to keep you in your place.

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:58.970
Classists are as
uncomfortable with themselves

00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:03.090
as with the rest of the world.

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:06.260
For me, first as a reader,
and then as a writer,

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:10.880
opening my arms and my mind
was the most obvious approach.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:14.280
My national boundaries
were a blur

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.970

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:20.480

We should go beyond
the act of surviving.

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:11.620
We should grab the life that,
that life is an act of terror

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:16.860
and integrating beauty in the
ethical and aesthetic sense.

I know I am not wrong.

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:45.390
The eternal question about
identity also depends

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:48.970
on the fact that we are many
in search of the same answer

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:53.360
and on the way, it can be fun
and stimulating to recognize

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.720
that spark of similarity
and difference.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.570
It is good to feel that
you belong to a place

During my time of
International Writing Program,

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:15.960
I saw how people love their own
language and at the same time,

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:20.380
develop new facets of themselves
in a temporary language.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.110

of their spiritual framework.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:34.230
Writers, we are not easy
people but I think that most

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:38.300
of us start from the
fundamental conviction,

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:42.330
nothing important can be
accomplished without tolerance,

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:45.650
without the divine curiosity
that allows us to knock

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:48.450
on a door and peek through.

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:53.910
In Iowa I have the opportunity
to translate into Spanish poems

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:57.540
by authors that I have found
on my way and to listen

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.320
to my own work in
other languages.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:02.580

of the happiest revelations
of my life so far.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.940
So, once again, it
is clear to me

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:13.810
that literature is a human
act and therefore political,

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:18.240
not because of its
implication or etiological uses,

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:22.100
but because it teaches us
nothing more and nothing less

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:25.210
than what we are made
of alone and together.

And while we're waiting for you
for formulate some questions,

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:53.170
I think I might just say,
it seems to me that Santiago

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:55.860
and Enza both gave us
really wonderful definitions

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.530
of writing, maybe inadvertently

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:01.990
because Santiago described
what happened in the IWP

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:05.110
as a dynamic form
of organization

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:08.850
which also struck me as being
a good way to describe a novel,

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:12.150
right, as a dynamic
form of organization.

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:17.980
And Enza was talking about the
essential of integrating beauty

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:22.260
which is also what I think we
try to do as writers, and Amy,

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:25.880
it occurred to me when you
talked about Nikola Madzirov,

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:30.790
I recalled that during his
residency we had a night we

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:33.250
called global express
of staged plays

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:36.440
and that year we gave
the writers a prompt

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.560
and Nikola ended up writing
a short play together

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:43.350
with an Iranian poet and
they wrote it in English

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:47.370
and by the time the
play was staged,

00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:51.000
neither one could remember
who had written which lines,

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.810
so I think that's another kind
of dynamic form of organization.

00:41:55.810 --> 00:41:59.500
So, I'm just treading water
here looking for a question

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:04.920

in the Educational and
Cultural Affairs Bureau

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.790
to have the regionals come
to us over and over and ask

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:25.400
for more resources,
more programs.

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:26.700
It's been really wonderful.

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:28.880
&gt;&gt; Cynthia P. Schneider:
I'm so glad to hear it,

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.590
that is really fantastic.

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:34.700
I just, I might just go a
little bit to your question

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:37.460
since I was appointed
ambassador having served,

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:39.460
having been an art
historian my whole life

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:42.560
and having done 17th
century Dutch art

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:47.380
and travelled many times to
Holland and knew the language

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:51.870
and history and the culture
and I found that actually

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:56.380
that background as an academic,
I mean I taught at a university

00:43:56.380 --> 00:44:03.050
where you basically have
to do a lot of research,

00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:08.470
try to understand a new subject
and then talk about it to people

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:10.500
who may or may not agree

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:13.430
with what you're saying,
you're my students.

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:17.350
That was great background
to be an ambassador

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:21.880
because that's what you
have to do all the time

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:25.750
and I do remember, though, the
nervousness of my wonderful DCM

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:29.760
and officers the first time I
went to talk to the Administer

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:33.610
of Foreign Affairs and Minister
of Defense and there is,

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:35.900
I experienced this
kind of macho thing

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:38.430
where everybody else
can have like notepads

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:40.650
but the ambassador is not
supposed to, you're supposed

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:44.470
to know it and talk and not look
down to your little notebook

00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:48.860
and I could see they were just
terrified and just had no idea

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.610
if I was going to know what
to say or start spouting off

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:53.450
about Rembrandt or something.

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:59.790
And it was hard, but I did
memorize a lot in my life

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:04.950
so I was able to talk about
strike fighters as much

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:10.220
as about Rembrandt, and I did
find that being able to make

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:15.440
that connection as someone
who had spent my career

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.450
up until then trying to
understand the culture

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:21.840
of the country where I was
serving, that meant so much

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:26.000
to the Dutch so that I was
able to take, you know,

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.600
the Prime Minister and
the Foreign Minister

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:33.670
around their own museums and
show them their exhibitions.

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:39.000
I also did that with
my own embassy staff.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.290
There were some great
Rembrandt exhibitions and stuff,

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:45.430
so I got them all in when
the museums were closed and,

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:48.430
you know, was able to introduce
them to the local culture

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:53.910
as well, and I just would
mention that I also had,

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:56.160
every ambassador has, it
was a wonderful privilege

00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:59.410
to have a collection
of art in the embassy.

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:01.520
Some go with their own
personal collections.

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:05.120
I did not have one and did
not do that, but with the help

00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:07.710
of the fantastic bureau
at the State Department

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:09.940
that supports this program,

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:14.450
I was able to identify just
really fantastic works of art

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:16.900
that in one way or another
showed the connection

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:18.820
between the Netherlands
and the United States

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:23.680
from the Calder Mobile in the
front hall to Claes Oldenburg

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.270
to William De Kooning as well

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:30.000
as the great Rembrandt Peale
portrait of Thomas Jefferson

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.440
and you know, that was a regular
part of when people would come

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.870
to the residence, I
would give them the tour

00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:38.060
and they would walk in and they
could see they may not know what

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:42.130
the works of were but they could
see right way that connection

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:43.870
and they loved seeing
that connection.

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:46.230
You know, they'd say wow a
new American artist thought

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:47.920
that much about Holland.

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:51.600
After, I'll just leave you
with one story of the impact

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:54.550
of culture, and this was
on someone who worked

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:57.110
at the embassy, I love this.

00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:00.360
I left in June, 2001 so I
wasn't there for the fourth

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.730
of July party and someone I
encountered later in July said,

00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:06.600
oh my gosh, I was just
at your residence,

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:10.410
I was there for the fourth
of July party and a member

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:14.650
of your staff gave a me a tour
of the collection that you had.

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:17.490
And I said, but it was
gone, all the paintings

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:21.150
and sculptures had been sent
back to their owners by then,

00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:24.600
and the person said, yes
that's right, but the person

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:27.360
from your staff loved
that collection so much

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:30.280
that they took me through
the house and said,

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:34.300
this is what used to hang here,
and this is what it looked like

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.830
and this is why it was there.

00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:41.710
So, that was one of my favorite
public diplomacy actions.

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:49.340
&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you very much
for your presentations,

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:53.030
I found them very fascinating.

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:55.010
I was listening to [inaudible]

00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:59.320
but I have a question
for Amy Storrow.

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:06.240
You referred to active
cultural diplomacy on the ground

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:10.080
with a lot of open
mindedness and you know,

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:13.240
a lot of understanding
of the [inaudible]

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:16.960
on American cultural
regions, and I was wondering

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:21.130
if this was something
that was restricted

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:26.430
to a particular cultural
context, is this still going on,

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:32.130
would this be something
that would happen

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:33.910
like today, for example?

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:37.290
I ask this question
because as the director

00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:39.400
of [inaudible] I have
a lot of relationships

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:42.190
with cultural diplomacy
of various countries,

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:47.730
including your own, and I have
had, I've heard the expression

00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:52.330
that cultural diplomacy is
there to soften the ground

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:56.520
for political and [inaudible]
action and I'm wondering

00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:01.310
which of these perspectives
correspond

00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:10.450
to U.S. Cultural diplomacy let's
say, over the past 20 years.

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:15.010
&gt;&gt; Amy Storrow: That's a
wonderful, thank you Cynthia,

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:16.310
that's a wonderful question.

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:19.310
I think I'm going to
take, first the part of it

00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:21.790
about when visitors come,

00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:24.050
I think I can give a
really clear example,

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:27.500
so my first visitor, as I
mentioned, was Carolyn Forshay.

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:30.430
This was during the George
W. Bush administration time.

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:34.410
And she had some differences
with official policy

00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:36.560
and so she gave a lot of
interviews and in some

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:39.640
of them she spoke against
official U.S. policy

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.640
and so I consulted
my boss, you know,

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:45.190
as a new officer what is
a guideline and he said,

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:47.220
this is freedom of
expression in action,

00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:48.970
this is why we have people

00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:52.650
of varying perspectives
give their views.

00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:55.190
There was another, sort
of famous case of that

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:58.270
of Juno Diaz going
to Santa Domingo

00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:01.500
and speaking very strongly
against official U.S. policy

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:04.170
and it really surprised
the people who live there

00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:07.490
because they assumed that
somebody was being paid

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:09.680
by the government
on the program had

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.400
to speak that government line.

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.370
And for them, that
idea of freedom

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:16.560
of expression was
really eye opening.

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:19.090
As far as softening the ground
or not softening the ground,

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:21.810
I think people view these
things in different ways.

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:25.450
Sometimes people view
things as transactions,

00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:26.950
I think that's a
very limited way

00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:30.730
to view the world generally
speaking and ground comes

00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:32.830
in all different
kinds of states,

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:34.990
but that we are all people
and the more we can learn

00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:37.290
from each other the
better we all are.

00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:53.800
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] Mexican
writer, and I was wondering,

00:50:53.800 --> 00:51:00.660
and this is for everyone
[inaudible].

00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:09.420
We know that languages create
traditions, literary traditions

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:18.200
in some way handling
American literature relying

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.560
to English tradition

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:30.200
and of course that's an American
tradition and Spanish tradition,

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:35.570
but how important
is it these days

00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:45.830
if we could have
American tradition

00:51:45.830 --> 00:52:00.030
across the whole continent like
we have the European tradition

00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:05.830
in European literature, I think
how important it is to build

00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:10.080
that tunnel or that wall that
they are building right now

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:13.410
that will open up a whole
literature of Americas

00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:19.680
and we stop saying it's really
in English, or really in Spanish

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:23.700
and say it's really
on this continent

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:28.030
and it's really important
and matters to all of us

00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:31.430
and what are the efforts
that are being done to build

00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:35.040
that bridge, literature
bridge and break this idea

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:38.660
that it's English versus
Spanish, if America is one

00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:40.300
and [inaudible] any
thoughts or ideas

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:42.610
of how build this
bridge [inaudible]

00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:45.900
about the Americas
and not America?

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:47.730
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:
Santiago or Enza?

00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:52.630
Do you want to take that up?

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:57.110
&gt;&gt; Santiago Giralt: I think
is sounds utopian the idea

00:52:57.110 --> 00:53:01.580
that we could breech
the language differences

00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:08.160
because even in South America
the Portuguese who had the

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:13.030
like the population of
almost of all the rest

00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:17.010
of the countries
together becomes a barrier

00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:18.680
because translations are
[inaudible] so little

00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:23.590
and I also feel like, in my
country in particular, literacy,

00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:27.330
we have a big literacy,
like there's a lot

00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:30.140
of literacy in Argentina.

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:33.300
I mean, kids could read,

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:37.570
but there's very
little public library's,

00:53:37.570 --> 00:53:40.890
very little bookstores left.

00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:42.580
Like there's some small towns

00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:44.650
that don't even have
a bookstore.

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:48.030
Somehow, I still feel like
the fight has be again,

00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:53.020
first it needs to be stronger
locally and it needs to be kind

00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:55.780
of like pushed from
the local countries.

00:53:55.780 --> 00:54:01.030
In Argentina, in Buenos Aries
luckily it seems like a paradise

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:06.400
because the bookstores
stay open until midnight

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:12.060
and there's beautiful café's and
some big theaters have turned

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:13.600
into beautiful bookstores.

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:17.460
But if you go beyond the
borders of Buenos Aries,

00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:18.760
the fights, it's strong.

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:21.420
Like I remember when I was
a kid, there was this truck

00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:25.670
who would come to the
town with books and it was

00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:30.960
like a [inaudible] bookstore and
I would go there and spend time

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:36.340
because my hometown had only one
library that was like really,

00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:43.590
really, really old and
nobody wanted to have them.

00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:49.530
So, I thing before that,
somehow, I feel like we have

00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:53.450
to create readers for the
future because all the kids are

00:54:53.450 --> 00:55:00.430
with their cell phones and with
their pads and stuff like that,

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:04.340
so in a way I feel that
before I could think

00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:08.070
of this broader idea I think
with stronger literacy and more,

00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:10.180
yeah, more access,
better access to books,

00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:11.480
I think it's a fight I would go

00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.550
for in my own country
to begin with.

00:55:13.550 --> 00:55:14.850
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:
Santiago, as you said that,

00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:16.150
I was remembering being in Aman,
Jordon last December and we went

00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:17.660
to an event and when we came
outside there was a car covered

00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:19.160
with books and it turned out
it was this guy who would drive

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:20.460
from village to village to
sell books for, you know,

00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:21.760
like a dollar and bought
a couple books from him.

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.060
I think, yeah.

00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:24.360
&gt;&gt; First of all I'd like to
say hello to Christopher,

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:25.660
I haven't seen you
in almost a decade.

00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:26.960
My name is Tracey [inaudible]
and I am a retired art historian

00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.260
and for a number of years I
worked at the Hirshhorn Museum

00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:29.560
and Sculpture Garden and
it was during that time

00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:30.860
that through the Department
of State a colleague of mine,

00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:32.160
we coordinated a program with
the International Writers

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.460
and The Hirshhorn had in place
a program called Music Art

00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:34.760
to Inspire Writing and
the writers would come.

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:36.060
Do you still remember that?

00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:37.360
And they would-- .

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:38.660
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill: I
also remember you sent one

00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:39.960
of your great proteges to
the Des Moines Art Center

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:41.260
and she's still there,
I think, right?

00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:42.560
&gt;&gt; Yes. And the writers would
come and read collectively

00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:43.860
from the works in
one of the galleries

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.160
and the next day Christopher
would select a group of writers

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:46.460
who conducted a workshop
with the locals

00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:47.760
who in turn produced
writing that was read

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.060
on Sunday afternoons and all
of this was put in a bulletin

00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:50.360
and had quite a following and
he was there from 2002 to 2005.

00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:51.660
So, I'd like to thank you and
I happened to get the email

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:52.960
and discovered that you
were going to be here,

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:54.260
that's why I came here and
invited my colleague [inaudible]

00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:55.560
from Pennsylvania and she was
trying to get here to say hello

00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:56.860
to you as well, so I'm
very happy to be a part

00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:58.160
of this program,
thank you so much.

00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.960
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:02.730
[ Applause ]

00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:07.520
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:
Let's go here and here.

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:19.750
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm just wanting to
add [inaudible] to the comment

00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:28.640
about [inaudible] because I've
been in the business sector

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:38.580
for a very long time and one
of my exit interviews was

00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:44.370
about the [inaudible] for women
directors [inaudible] I just

00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:49.340
wanted to ask, to what extent
do you have your writing

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:53.450
[inaudible] your writing goes
to the masses of ordinary people

00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:56.420
because one of the
best things I've found

00:56:56.420 --> 00:57:00.080
in Iowa was not the readings
of the people [inaudible],

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:01.700
the readings to the community.

00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:07.860
Because it was just amazing
that their questions [inaudible]

00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:10.160
so how did you do that
in your own countries?

00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:19.550
&gt;&gt; Enza Garcia Arreaza: I
think, I don't have that in mind

00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:21.760
when I'm writing
because it's dangerous.

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:26.870
I just want to write for
the people who is there

00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:30.830
in that moment, for someone
who needs to read that story

00:57:30.830 --> 00:57:32.630
that I brought to life.

00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:42.540
And I don't know, I mean, after
my last book, someone told me,

00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:46.530
oh I don't like anymore
your writing

00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:51.830
because you're not sexy
anymore, you write now a lot

00:57:51.830 --> 00:57:55.670
about Japanese reference,
now your characters talk

00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:59.660
about the books they are
reading in that moment.

00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:03.050
Your writing now
is like too serious

00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:05.820
for a small group of people.

00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:10.860
And well, I don't know, it's
sad but I don't want to write

00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:13.770
for a specific audience,
I just want to be

00:58:13.770 --> 00:58:16.440
who I am when I write.

00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:20.290
The other day, with Natasha
in the class, I said something

00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:25.250
that really moves me now, I
said, you know I hate people,

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:31.140
it's difficult for me to be
among a crowd but when I write,

00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:35.220
I really love the things,
the words, the characters,

00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:40.800
the humanity, so in the end
I really love that person

00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:43.310
that I am when I write.

00:58:43.310 --> 00:58:44.720
And that's it.

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:47.020
Thank you.

00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:53.100
&gt;&gt; Santiago Giralt: What I could
add only is as a film maker,

00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:58.070
you have more pressure from the
production structure to think

00:58:58.070 --> 00:59:00.950
about your viewers
because it's a more,

00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:05.130
although the publishing
industry could be tough,

00:59:05.130 --> 00:59:08.570
the film industry there's so
much money you have to back

00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:10.360
that they really think
about the audience,

00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:13.060
so you are in this conversation,

00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:16.190
sometimes you get these screen
tests that are really weird.

00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:18.180
So, that's why I
do the [inaudible]

00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:20.230
to be free from that.

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:25.110
And to expand the
possibilities of that.

00:59:25.110 --> 00:59:28.560
I also got my first novel
got published by mistake

00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:30.980
because it was financed for
this international price

00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:36.600
so I didn't even, like think it
would be published so quickly.

00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:43.700
So, yeah, I really, but what I
really love from literature is

00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:47.240
that the feedback that you
get from your readers it's

00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:50.600
so intimate, it feels,
people like talking

00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:53.300
about themselves much more
than when they're talking

00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:57.560
about movies because a movie
is more like a social thing

00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:00.250
and literature is so private.

01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:04.750
Even my mother reads
my novels like my diary

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:08.670
and so goes crazy every time.

01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:13.000
I also wanted to say that
I would like to remember

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.850
so other Argentinian
writers that came

01:00:14.850 --> 01:00:16.810
to the International
Writers Program.

01:00:16.810 --> 01:00:22.220
One of them happens to be
one of my greatest friend.

01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:26.510
He's [inaudible] and [inaudible]
another writer/director,

01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:30.370
Christina Pena, like I know
many of them and I really think

01:00:30.370 --> 01:00:33.270
through the years many people
who have been lucky enough

01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:40.590
to be part of the program have
become lamplights for the,

01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:43.720
how you say, lanterns,
yeah, for all the ones

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:48.650
who were coming behind,
so I even wanted to come

01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:51.790
to the International Writers
Program when I read it

01:00:51.790 --> 01:00:53.470
in the cover of one
of [inaudible] books,

01:00:53.470 --> 01:00:55.210
he's one of my favorite writer,

01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:58.780
oh what is this, I
want to go to it.

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:05.210
It's also, it becomes a utopian
place to be a part when you feel

01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:11.910
like your country is not really
getting your inner poetry,

01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:15.060
you inner self and so, yeah.

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:17.430
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill: I'm
so glad you mentioned Martine,

01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:23.880
who is both a fiction writer
and a film maker and that year,

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:27.380
for a variety of reasons,
the writers had roommates

01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:30.600
and his roommate was the
playwright Mike Finn,

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:34.260
and I said to him one day,
so, how is it with Martine

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:38.600
and he said, well you know, I
wasn't really planning to write,

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.680
I was planning to
enjoy myself here

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:44.520
but Martine writes everyday
so, now I'm writing.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:49.960
There was a question here?

01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:02.270
&gt;&gt; So this for both Amy Storrow
and Ambassador Schneider.

01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:05.090
I'm wondering, from
being out in the field,

01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:07.370
did you see other countries
doing cultural diplomacy,

01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:09.260
did you see them
doing it differently,

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:13.840
do you see this agenda
being more important

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.640
for like the smaller countries

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.940
or perhaps other
larger countries?

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:24.170
&gt;&gt; Cynthia P. Schneider: Well,
I might tie an answer to that

01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:30.650
into coming back to the
other Cynthia's question

01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:35.500
when you were asking about
culture kind of softening,

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:38.850
softening the ground and I think

01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:42.930
that there is also this
entity called public diplomacy

01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:47.540
which is different from
cultural diplomacy, particularly

01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:51.840
as hearing about it
practiced here and the larger

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.360
in the United States
State Department,

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.620
the largest bureau
is public diplomacy

01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:59.960
with the mission really of
promoting the understanding

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:03.370
and acceptance of
America's policies,

01:03:03.370 --> 01:03:08.480
which is think is a fabulous
idea from the 1950's and not

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:13.000
so appropriate now in this
age of global communications

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.970
and fortunately, you
can talk about this more

01:03:15.970 --> 01:03:19.690
but I have the sense that the
way cultural diplomacy operates

01:03:19.690 --> 01:03:22.850
is more in the way
of cultural relations

01:03:22.850 --> 01:03:26.880
and interestingly enough,
the British have gotten rid

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.130
of the word cultural
diplomacy, and just talk

01:03:30.130 --> 01:03:31.660
about cultural relations.

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:35.590
I think to avoid the
idea of what you said,

01:03:35.590 --> 01:03:40.740
that this is not a kind of
backdoor way into getting you

01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:44.910
to accept what other nefarious
policy we want you to accept

01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:47.640
so while you're up watching a
science movie we're doing this,

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:53.690
and you know, and even, and
cultural diplomacy is a term

01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:58.480
which I've used a lot, I'm
increasingly troubled with it

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:02.860
because it has that kind
of sense of, I have a goal

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:05.800
and I'm going to use
this to get to that goal,

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:09.150
but I think what you've heard
today is much more in the nature

01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:14.360
of cultural relations and
cultural exchange, whatever,

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:17.050
you know, whatever
it might be called.

01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:21.370
I've seen some examples, I
think that I really admire

01:04:21.370 --> 01:04:27.410
that are more in the way of this
leveraging local voices idea,

01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:29.800
and it is often the
smaller countries,

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:33.910
although Great Britain has bee
doing this for a long time and,

01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:37.100
you know, the whole structure is
different with other countries

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:40.670
where they tend to, Great
Britain, France, Italy, Spain,

01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:43.450
they all have, Scandinavian
countries,

01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:47.380
they all have a slightly
separate arm's length division

01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:53.360
that takes care of culture and
so, they're a little bit less,

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.040
in my experience, I'm sure
there's some exceptions to this,

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.600
but there may be
a little bit less

01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:00.770
about promoting their
culture per se

01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:03.760
as leveraging local cultures.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:06.480
I saw for example a fantastic,
no you don't think so,

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:09.230
well I'll just give you a couple
of examples that I have seen,

01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:14.480
they may not do it all the time,
but a fantastic hip hop event

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:19.550
that the Scandinavians did in
Alexandria in Egypt bringing,

01:05:19.550 --> 01:05:24.090
you know, providing a stage and
a platform and the opportunity

01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:28.480
to perform to local hip hop
groups, which they don't have

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:31.750
but that's what they want, to be
able to reach their audiences.

01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:35.350
At the same time, the way
this may have changed,

01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:37.340
this was about six
or seven years ago,

01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:39.560
at the same time the
United States policy was

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:42.250
to send American
artists to places,

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:44.710
so those are two
different approaches.

01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:47.910
I'll give one other example that
I think was really brilliant,

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:51.210
which is what Great Britain
did during the Olympics

01:05:51.210 --> 01:05:55.780
with Shakespeare and it was
a fantastic way, I think,

01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:59.330
of showing how global
Shakespeare is and that is

01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:03.730
that they invited performances
of different Shakespeare plays

01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:07.130
in local languages
and in local idioms

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:09.800
and they were performed
every night at the Globe.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.600
And you know, I don't know
who assigned the plays,

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.920
it was kind of weird, like
China had Richard the Third

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:18.010
and of all things, Pakistan
had the Taming of the Shrew.

01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:19.780
So, there were some odd things,

01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:23.690
but the plays were really
incredible and what a way,

01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:26.690
you know, without saying,
Shakespeare is global,

01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:32.210
it just came out through
all the performances.

01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:34.900
&gt;&gt; Amy Storrow: I would say
it a tiny bit differently

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:38.750
but not hugely, from my
perspective and I think

01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:40.870
from the perspective of
the State Department,

01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:43.900
cultural diplomacy is
part of public diplomacy

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:47.670
and it's also a subset
of exchange programs.

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:49.270
So, one interesting thing,

01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:51.800
you are all exchange program
participants who came here

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:54.650
on J-Visa's, which are
foreign exchange programs.

01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:57.330
It's how many of them
are bilateral agreements?

01:06:57.330 --> 01:07:01.430
So, for example, the Fulbright
program I believe that funding

01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:04.270
from Germany is three times
the amount of American funding

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:06.000
that goes into the
Fulbright Program.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.590
So, many of these programs are
in fact, they go both ways,

01:07:09.590 --> 01:07:11.670
so the more that we can
collaborate with each other

01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:15.780
and not view it as a
competition, I think is great.

01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:18.720
There are models out
there that I admire,

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:21.810
I think that what the Brits
do, or what the British do

01:07:21.810 --> 01:07:24.820
with English in particular
is very impressive,

01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:27.560
but I think we've all got a
lot to learn from each other

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.140
and I do want to go back

01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:33.920
to the softening the
ground comment for a second.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:36.880
It's an interesting idea but
I don't think that life works

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:40.260
that way, hahaha, we're going
to send Cynthia on a program

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:42.370
and then or nefarious plan next,

01:07:42.370 --> 01:07:44.090
to go back to Ambassador
Schneider,

01:07:44.090 --> 01:07:47.550
then this will happen, you know,
like it's far to complicated

01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:49.590
and complex for that
kind of thinking

01:07:49.590 --> 01:07:50.950
for that to really work.

01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:54.400
I am a kind of true believer
and a purist in a lot of ways.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:57.810
And I really, really believe
that exchange programs

01:07:57.810 --> 01:07:59.730
and cultural programs,
but all kinds

01:07:59.730 --> 01:08:02.910
of exchange programs are what
make the world a stronger,

01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:04.730
safer, better place.

01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:08.140
Right now, around the world,
one-third of all current heads

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:11.880
of state or current heads of
government, exchange alumni

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:15.460
of U.S. Government funded
programs like this one.

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:19.710
It's a tremendous
legacy that you share,

01:08:19.710 --> 01:08:22.010
you as alumni, or
as almost alumni.

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:29.070
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] and I'd
like to make a comment

01:08:29.070 --> 01:08:34.600
about Professor Schneider
[inaudible] presentation.

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:37.700
It is so important
that indeed poetry

01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:43.260
and writers are [inaudible]
in many countries.

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:45.930
In Chili [inaudible] a
national day of mourning

01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:50.140
and this [inaudible]
in Latin America

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:52.820
and [inaudible] in
the United States.

01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:56.080
So, thank you for
explaining all that.

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.380
Excellent.

01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:58.680
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:
Thank you.

01:08:58.680 --> 01:08:59.980
&gt;&gt; Cynthia P. Schneider:
You know,

01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:02.770
I would just recall a former
poet laurate, Robert Pinsky,

01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:08.700
here who had a wonderful project
called the Favorite Poem Project

01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:11.120
that he did around
the year 2000.

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:14.320
And, just to say, I think
it is absolutely true

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:18.450
that we don't have the same, I
think we do have the same kind

01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:20.200
of public intellectuals
but again,

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:23.460
for whatever reason we
don't take them as seriously

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:26.920
as they are in other countries,
which are absolutely right

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:30.120
and Palestine [inaudible]
is really the founder

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:34.890
of the country or Iqbal
or Pakistan, and yet,

01:09:34.890 --> 01:09:37.130
why don't we automatically
say Walt Whitman here.

01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:41.700
I don't know, but Robert
kind of punctured that idea

01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:45.340
with his wonderful Favorite
Poem Project where he,

01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:47.130
and this was before
the internet really,

01:09:47.130 --> 01:09:49.450
he was really interviewing
people all over the country,

01:09:49.450 --> 01:09:50.750
all different walks of life,

01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:53.590
asking them what was
their favorite poem,

01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:55.880
and the book puts
it all together,

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:59.280
the construction worker
loves Walt Whitman

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:03.040
and the Cambodian refugee
loves Langston Hughes,

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:06.880
there's two examples I remember,
but these are very much people

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.860
from all walks of life for whom
poetry is really important.

01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:12.520
So, I think it's out
there but somehow,

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:13.820
we just don't see it as much.

01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:16.960
&gt;&gt; Amy Storrow: I think
that Chili had some model

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.940
of Neruda to draw from.

01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:23.420
Yes, yes, as a diplomatic
poet and I read once

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:30.260
that more Neruda has published
more books than any other work

01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:33.110
of literature except
for the bible.

01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:36.590
So, that is a global
legacy right there.

01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:40.560
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:
We were getting the look

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:41.860
but hands keep going up.

01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:43.420
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: I think
we're going to end things.

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:48.730
You do have the opportunity,
though, if you want to talk

01:10:48.730 --> 01:10:52.850
to all of our panelist
afterwards, please do so.

01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:54.150
[inaudible] showed herself.

01:10:54.150 --> 01:10:56.120
Mary Jane Deeb, the chief

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:58.880
of the African Middle
Eastern division is here.

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:02.490
Our areas study divisions
have amazing reading rooms

01:11:02.490 --> 01:11:05.370
and if you're not
scheduled to go see them,

01:11:05.370 --> 01:11:10.230
African Middle Eastern,
Hispanic, European and Asian,

01:11:10.230 --> 01:11:12.090
you should check them out
today while you're here

01:11:12.090 --> 01:11:13.990
and maybe meet the curators

01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:15.520
that are responsible
for your countries.

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.880
But for now, let's
thank our panelists,

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.680
thanks so much for being here.

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:27.260
[ Applause ]

01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:30.900
