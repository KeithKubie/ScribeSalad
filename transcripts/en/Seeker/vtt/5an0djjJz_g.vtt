00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.139
Humans created farming around 12,000 years
ago.

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:08.140
But there was another species that independently
created farming waaay before we did….

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.390
55 million years before, in fact.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.630
It wasn’t the neanderthal, or any ape, actually…
it was an insect.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.250
The lowly ant.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.510
Specifically these guys.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.110
You’ve all probably seen a clip like this
on a nature documentary, setting the scene

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.710
of a wild rainforest.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.520
But, in the rainforest it’s not really obvious
what they’re doing.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.340
Let me put it this way, if you put leafcutter
ants into an ant farm, and watched them build

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.340
a colony.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.390
You’d have an ant farm farm!

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.930
They don’t farm corn or cows -- but fungus!
(we’ll come back to that).

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.989
Leafcutter ants like the famous Atta cephalotes
literally cut leaves and then carry them on

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.450
their backs to their colony.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.350
But have you ever thought what they do when
they get there?

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.480
Because the ants don’t eat those leaves
they carry.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.090
That’s what I thought they did.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.090
Nope.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.330
They use them to grow crops… for agriculture!

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.489
Agriculture, by definition is “the science
or practice of farming, including cultivation

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.009
of the soil for the growing of crops and the
rearing of animals to provide food, wool,

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:09.139
and other products.”

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:10.139
Ants are doing this!

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:15.490
They dig growing chambers in deep tunnels
to control the temperature, and bring dew

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.280
and water from the surface to the chambers
to control humidity of their crops

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.329
-- and this is where the leaves come in.

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.060
The Atta ants drink the sap, clean the leaves,
crush them up, and compost them with their

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.549
own fecal liquid.

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.789
And the fungus (basidiomycete type) grows
on this “soil” they create.

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.139
Then, they harvest bits of the fungus and
use it to feed the colony.

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:39.310
Just like human farmers.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.719
We’re still new to farming.

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.649
Wheat is one of the oldest farmed grains,
but it wasn’t until Norman Borlaug bred

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.840
two special wheats together that humans could
finally use it to feed millions of people!

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.200
He won the Nobel Peace Prize for that in 1970.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.250
But that is n00b science in comparison to
ants who have been using agriculture to feed

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.710
millions of ants for millions of years.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.479
Atta ants have evolved over millions of years
alongside their crops, weeding, watering,

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:06.479
and preening.

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.430
One species of ant has even cultivated a fungal
line that produces high-yields to feed more

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.430
ants!

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.720
No Peace prize for them though.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.459
The coolest part about this, is some of the
250 species of ant that have evolved agriculture,

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.150
have also cultivated their crop so much, that
without the ants, it would die.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.709
The fungus only exists to feed the ants!

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.550
The other cool thing?

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.620
Ants aren’t the only farming species out
there.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.239
Termites also are fungal farmers -- and here
you thought they were just eating your house,

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.219
nope they feed some bits to their fungal friends.

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:42.879
Damselfish are the only known fish to be agriculturalists,
farming algae for their food.

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.349
There are even species of beetle and snail
with this practice.

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:47.349
But c’mon.

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:48.719
Why should we care?

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.660
Because we’ve only been farming 12,000 years.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.510
And scientists are not sure farming is sustainable
practice.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.859
We have to feed billions of people, meaning
we need monocultures -- one super-plant that

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.950
can feed lots of people, like the Borlaug
wheat.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.540
But growing crops this way can deplete soil
(like with corn) or subject large crops to

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.800
disease (like with monoculture bananas).

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.410
The Atta ants and other fungal farmers have
been cultivating monocultures for millions

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.410
of years.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.959
If we can learn how they manage to avoid devastation
by disease, or how they protect their crops

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.340
from parasites -- maybe we could support another
few billion of our own human colony.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.349
Aren't ants awesome?

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:30.420
Want to learn more about them?

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.310
We talked to a bug scientist and you can check
out the interview here.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.010
What do y’all think of these mini farmers?

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.329
