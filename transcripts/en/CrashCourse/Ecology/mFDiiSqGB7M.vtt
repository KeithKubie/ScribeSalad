00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.899
Of all the ways that species interact on this planet, maybe the one that fascinates us the most is predation, and why not?

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.039
It's hard not to be captivated by, say, an Alaska Brown Bear, one of North America's apex predators,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.419
even though they get much of their nutrition
from nuts and bugs and berries.

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:17.630
But you can also tell that it's a pretty big
fan of crushing the bones of other animals

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.670
because of this amazingly pronounced sagittal
crest, which is where its jaw muscles connect.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.279
And maybe part of why we're so fascinated
by predation is because we are,

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.670
in many ways, the planet's top predator, at
least for now.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.370
That's how most of these guys got here,

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.930
but for hundreds of thousands of years,
we were preyed upon as well,

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.670
not just by bears and wolves, but by viruses
and bacteria and parasites.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.940
Because predation isn't just animal eats animal.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.000
This musk-ox or this big-horned sheep can also be considered predators, even though they only eat plants.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.510
But perhaps what's most important to understand
about predation is the evolutionary pressures

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.719
that come with hunting and being hunted for
thousands of years.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.959
Because of these pressures, predation has driven all sorts of truly amazing adaptations that we see all around us.

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.329
From the grizzlies enormous claws and teeth,
to the wolves' habit of hunting in packs,

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.789
as well as defensive adaptations, like the speed of the pronghorn, the fastest animal in North America.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.480
In the end, the effect of predator-prey is
an evolutionary arms race that results in

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.120
the mind boggling amount of diversity we see
in any ecosystem from the Northern Rockies

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.910
all the way to the African Savanna.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.500
This arms race is known as co-evolution, the
process by which the interactions between

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.200
two species affect the evolutionary development
of both.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.680
It's been going on since the Cambrian explosion
more than half a billion years ago

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.520
and it will continue spawning new bursts of diversity long after we humans have eaten ourselves into extinction,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.330
and maybe, we'll end up in a place like this.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:43.720
[Theme Music]

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.940
We tend to think of predation in terms of
animals

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.440
-- lions hunting zebras, wolves killing sheep,
hawks eating mice --

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.880
but predation is much more than just carnivores
doing their thing,

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.040
it applies to any number of interactions where one type of organism kills another for its energy.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.800
That's an important thing to note, because a lot of ecology comes down to the flow of energy through nature,

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.900
and every living thing needs energy to meet its twin evolutionary goals of staying alive and making lots of babies.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.900
Predators kill because they're hungry, but they're hungry because they need energy to survive and reproduce.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.700
For prey, these interactions are especially
high-stakes, obviously,

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.160
because nothing quite quashes your reproductive
chances like being dead.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.640
But almost all energy on earth starts with
plants, so consider bison eating grass,

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.840
that's a type of predation called herbivory, where an organism eats plants or algae to capture their energy.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.350
It may not really seem like predation to you,
but bison eating grass, manatees eating seaweed,

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.520
and sea urchins munching on algae are all
examples of organisms eating other organisms

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.250
to ingest the energy of the sun.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.670
There's also parasitism, another form of predation
in which organisms derive energy from the

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.870
host usually harming it and sometimes killing
it in the process.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.460
Hair worms, for example, devour the insides of grasshoppers and then brainwash them to make suicidal leaps into water.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.600
How exactly the waterborne worm finds its
way to a grasshopper is a mystery,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.250
though larva carried by mosquitoes is a likely
route.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.280
Once inside the grasshopper, the worm eats
everything non-essential to its host as it

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.750
grows several times the length of its host's
body.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.850
When only the grasshopper's head and legs
remain, the hairworm is ready to reproduce,

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.780
and that's when the brainwashing begins.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.319
See, hair worms breed in water, but grasshoppers
can't swim,

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:25.419
so hair worms pump their hosts full of chemicals that prompt an inescapable urge to leap into a body of water.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.960
Once the grasshopper makes the leap, the hairworm is free to burrow out of the host and find a mate.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.160
Ew. Yeah, chasing and eating a gazelle is one thing, but turning your prey into, like, a suicidal zombie,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.060
that my friends, is predation.

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.429
So clearly, predator and prey both have millions of years of tricks up their sleeves or stored in their DNA

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.610
because everyone's ultimately playing by the
same set of evolutionary rules.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.230
Whether lion or zebra, grasshopper or hairworm,
bison or grass,

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.440
gaining energy while not being eaten is a
prerequisite to reproductive success.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.860
So, the need to survive constantly forces
predator and prey to adapt weapons and defense

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.230
in a never-ending evolutionary arms-race.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.319
On the predator side, hunting and feeding
adaptations are obvious and familiar:

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:14.539
a wolf's keen sense of smell and flesh ripping teeth, and an eagle's sharp eyes and prey-gripping talons.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.959
Other creatures like rattlesnakes use heat-sensing
organs to seek out small rodents and toxic

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.440
venom to strike them dead,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.200
but this is where co-evolution takes the stage to give the prey a stake in the evolutionary arms-race, too.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.770
Since being caught by a predator is kind of terrible for anything that hopes to spread its genes,

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.900
species have adapted to all sorts of ways
to avoid getting killed.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.220
These can be broken up by what kinds of predatory behavior these adaptations are designed to avoid,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.080
namely, detection, capture, and handling.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.860
To avoid detection, some prey adapt cryptic
coloration, which we better know as camouflage,

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.750
to help a species blend into the background.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.060
Stick insects that have adapted to look like
sticks, leaf insects that look like leaves,

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.930
snowshoe hares that turn white in the winter
to blend in with the snow

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.600
and brown in the summer to blend in with the
grasses are all good examples.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.260
Avoiding capture is, at times, pretty straightforward.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.220
Antelope, for example, flee predators with
great leaping speed.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.400
Others find safety in numbers, such as bison forming a giant herds or herring grouping in schools.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.460
This kind of grouping certainly doesn't keep
the prey from being detected,

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.750
but it greatly reduces chances that any individual
will get picked off by a predator,

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.300
especially fit members of the group in the
middle of the pack.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.300
And finally, some of the coolest and most familiar adaptations are those that prevent handling.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.699
Plants are experts at these, think of a rose's
thorns; or tree sap that traps insects;

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.999
or the branches of an African acacia tree -- they're most thorny within the range of tree-munching giraffes,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.120
but above where the long-necks reach, there
aren't as many thorns.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.940
Other plants also produce chemical weapons,
such as the tobacco plants nicotine

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.449
and the tannins produced by many plants like
grapevines to fend off foragers.

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.400
But things get really weird when you see what
animals do with this bag of chemical tricks,

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.090
because often these critters not only have
wicked toxic cocktails to defend themselves,

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.120
many have also evolved aposematic, or warning
coloration.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.860
The bright contrasting colors such as yellow
and black splotches on the fire salamander

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.520
or the red, yellow, and black bands of the
coral snake

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.000
make it clear to predators that eating them
would be a serious mistake.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.479
And when you think of it, nature is full of species that are black and yellow in color, or red and black;

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:16.169
we tend to avoid them at all costs. We're
smart that way, and so are most other predators.

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:20.630
This, of course, is no coincidence, as German
naturalist Fritz Muller noted in the 1870s,

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.550
unpalatable species such as Cocobees, Yellowjackets --

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.430
actually, almost every kind of bee and wasp resemble each other using similar colors and patterns.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.440
He figured out that the more unpalatable prey
there are that use the same color patterns,

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.060
the more likely predators are to avoid all
prey with that appearance in general.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.260
This defense technique is today known as Mullerian
mimicry.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.680
But it turns out, unsurprisingly, some critters
that look dangerous are getting the last laugh

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.900
because many of them would actually be quite
tasty to any predator;

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.640
they just trick everyone by copying the looks
of the truly dangerous species.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.500
This technique is called Batesian mimicry, and to explain it to you, I'm going to need to sit down.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.860
I'll give you one guess to figure out who
first described Batesian mimicry.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:11.259
That's right, it was Bates. More specifically, it was Henry Walter Bates, a 19th century British naturalist and explorer.

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:15.739
Bates was born in 1825 to a middle-class family
that paid the bills by making hosiery.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.620
He spent most of his spare time reading often
about bugs,

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:23.940
and by the young age of 18 he was a budding entomologist with a publication on beetles already to his credit.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.760
It was a few years later that he met the famed
entomologist Alfred Russell Wallace.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:33.330
The two hit it off, and Wallace in 1847 proposed to take a trip to South America to collect insects.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:38.610
They would finance their travels by sending collected specimens back to England for sale  to museums and private collectors.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:43.870
The pair set sail the following year, and after four years in the field Wallace moved on,

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.500
but Bates, apparently not wanting to get into
the hosiery business, stayed behind,

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.980
spending the next eleven years in the jungle.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:56.900
All told, he collected nearly 15,000 species,
about 8,000 of them new to science.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:03.020
Just a few months after Bates arrived home in 1859, Darwin published his On The Origin Of Species.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.880
Bates read it and figured he could contribute
evidence to support the new theory of natural

00:08:06.889 --> 00:08:08.490
selection from his insect collection.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:12.639
Two years later, he presented a paper that
showed how different species of butterfly

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:15.679
developed nearly identical color patterns
on their wings.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:21.140
For example, butterflies called Heliconiinae, which were slow-moving and abundant -- but toxic --

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.580
were nearly identical to Pieridae, which were
more rare, but harmless.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.740
Bates concluded that natural selection had
driven the harmless butterflies to mimic the

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.819
patterns on the harmful butterflies for their
individual bids to survive predation by birds.

00:08:34.819 --> 00:08:38.019
The discovery helped launch Bates's career
and reputation,

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.000
and he went on to recount his adventures and other discoveries in a book,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.990
The Naturalist on the River Amazon,

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.210
and later took a job as secretary to the Royal
Geographic Society.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:53.020
Though Bates died in 1892, the concept of Batesian mimicry continues to fascinate scientists today.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:58.200
Why, for example, are so many mimics not perfect
imitations of their dangerous counterparts?

00:08:58.209 --> 00:09:01.579
Is it because perfect imitation isn't necessary
to do the job,

00:09:01.579 --> 00:09:06.209
or because mimics lack the genes necessary
to perfectly resemble their poisonous counterparts.

00:09:06.209 --> 00:09:11.869
Perhaps budding entomologists armed with 21st-century tools will finally unlock the answers.

00:09:11.869 --> 00:09:14.600
But don't think that prey are the only crafty
mimics out there --

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.399
in the arms-race, some predators have learned
how to win food through imitation as well.

00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:22.579
You've heard me talk about snapping turtles with tongues that resemble wiggling worms to lure fish,

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.620
and don't get me started about anglerfish!

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:30.760
If predation teaches us anything, it's that nothing lasts forever, not just for prey, but for every living thing,

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.411
because the interaction between predator and
prey keeps driving evolutionary change.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.519
But the communities themselves that we've
been talking about for the last two weeks

00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:39.860
don't stay the same either, of course.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.720
New tenants are always moving into a habitat and every now and again, a new landlord takes over.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.700
That's part of what makes the living world such a dynamic and beautiful and exciting place --

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.720
and it's what we'll be exploring next week.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.920
