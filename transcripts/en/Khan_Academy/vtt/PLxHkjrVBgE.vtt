00:00:00.586 --> 00:00:02.625
- [Voiceover] So we've already established

00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:04.077
that these three definitive roles

00:00:04.077 --> 00:00:05.622
are going to be equal to zero

00:00:05.622 --> 00:00:07.253
over slightly different conditions.

00:00:07.253 --> 00:00:08.401
Let's keep on going,

00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:10.350
and remember the goal here
is to make it simple for us

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.105
to find our Fourier coefficients
in a few videos from now.

00:00:14.105 --> 00:00:16.960
So now let's think about
the definitive role

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.017
from zero to two pie if we're taking

00:00:20.017 --> 00:00:23.850
the product of sine of
mt times sine of nt dt,

00:00:28.703 --> 00:00:31.451
and we're gonna think about
it in two different scenarios.

00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:35.368
We're gonna think about
when m does not equal n

00:00:37.374 --> 00:00:39.920
or m does not equal negative n,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.249
and really we care more
about this scenario

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:43.881
because in the Fourier series

00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:46.148
we're gonna be dealing
with positive integers,

00:00:46.148 --> 00:00:48.710
or non negative integers
I guess we could say,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.287
but this is going to be
true for both of them

00:00:51.287 --> 00:00:53.138
and we're gonna see when this is true

00:00:53.138 --> 00:00:56.374
this integral is going to
be zero when that's true,

00:00:56.374 --> 00:00:59.291
and it's gonna be equal to pie when

00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:03.642
m is equal to n,

00:01:03.642 --> 00:01:05.414
or another way we could write this.

00:01:05.414 --> 00:01:07.357
Actually let me write it this way.

00:01:07.357 --> 00:01:09.857
This integral is equal to zero

00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:13.584
when m does not equal n

00:01:16.106 --> 00:01:18.606
or m does not equal negative n

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:23.658
and we're gonna assume integers.

00:01:23.658 --> 00:01:26.216
When integers m does not equal n

00:01:26.216 --> 00:01:28.181
or m does not equal negative n,

00:01:28.181 --> 00:01:31.449
and then if n is equal to m or visa versa.

00:01:31.449 --> 00:01:34.819
We could say that the
integral from zero to two pie.

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:37.058
Let me do this in a different color.

00:01:37.058 --> 00:01:39.662
Just 'cause I think it will look nice.

00:01:39.662 --> 00:01:42.524
So the integral from zero to two pie.

00:01:42.524 --> 00:01:44.554
If m is equal to n we could write that as

00:01:44.554 --> 00:01:46.685
sine of mt times sine of mt

00:01:46.685 --> 00:01:50.586
which is gonna be sine squared of mt dt.

00:01:50.586 --> 00:01:53.109
We're going to establish
that this is going

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:55.360
to be equal to pie.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.499
Now how are we going to do that?

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:01.752
Well we can rewrite this
original thing right over here.

00:02:01.752 --> 00:02:04.094
We can rewrite this original thing

00:02:04.094 --> 00:02:07.128
using a product to sum formula.

00:02:07.128 --> 00:02:09.618
So let's actually do that.

00:02:09.618 --> 00:02:11.454
So rewriting this integral.

00:02:11.454 --> 00:02:14.224
It's the integral from zero to two pie

00:02:14.224 --> 00:02:17.084
and I can rewrite, and this
is just a trig identity

00:02:17.084 --> 00:02:18.871
that I'm going to be using.

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:23.038
This is the same thing as
one half times times cosine

00:02:26.648 --> 00:02:27.898
of mt minus nt.

00:02:32.372 --> 00:02:35.455
So we could write that at m minus n t

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.669
and then minus cosine of mt plus nt,

00:02:41.204 --> 00:02:44.287
or we could write that as m plus n t,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.103
and actually let me put parentheses around

00:02:47.103 --> 00:02:50.779
these whole things so it's
more clear what's going on.

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:53.744
This right over here is just
the product to sum formula.

00:02:53.744 --> 00:02:55.876
When you're taking the product of the sine

00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:58.010
of two different things here,

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.196
and of course this is going to be dt.

00:03:01.196 --> 00:03:04.847
Now if we use some of our
integration properties

00:03:04.847 --> 00:03:06.632
we can rewrite all of this

00:03:06.632 --> 00:03:10.215
as being the integral
from zero to two pie.

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:14.649
In fact we could put that
one half out front twice.

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:16.727
I'm gonna write this is,

00:03:16.727 --> 00:03:18.913
I guess you could say the
difference of two integrals.

00:03:18.913 --> 00:03:20.208
Two definite integrals.

00:03:20.208 --> 00:03:22.791
So we could have this one half.

00:03:23.948 --> 00:03:26.814
Let me write it in that same color.

00:03:26.814 --> 00:03:31.410
That one half right over there
times the definite integral

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.577
from zero two pie of cosine
of m minus n t dt minus,

00:03:41.572 --> 00:03:43.928
and once again I'm just
distributing this one half,

00:03:43.928 --> 00:03:46.825
so minus, and taking it
out of the integrals.

00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:50.575
So minus one half times
the definite integral

00:03:52.377 --> 00:03:54.127
from zero to two pie,

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.964
and I'm gonna have the dt out here,

00:03:56.964 --> 00:03:59.995
so let me just write the
dt out there in magenta,

00:03:59.995 --> 00:04:02.412
of cosine of m plus n, t, dt,

00:04:09.196 --> 00:04:11.308
and this is a slightly
different shade of blue

00:04:11.308 --> 00:04:13.087
so let me color that in as well.

00:04:13.087 --> 00:04:14.941
So once again we get from that to that

00:04:14.941 --> 00:04:16.954
just using our integration properties.

00:04:16.954 --> 00:04:18.610
You can distribute the one half

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.596
and say okay the integral
of the difference

00:04:20.596 --> 00:04:22.987
is the same thing as the
difference of the integrals.

00:04:22.987 --> 00:04:25.205
You could take the one half
out of the integration sine

00:04:25.205 --> 00:04:27.343
and we get to this right over here.

00:04:27.343 --> 00:04:29.728
Now what do we know about this

00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:32.895
in the case where m and n are integers

00:04:34.086 --> 00:04:36.681
that either don't equal
each other or don't equal

00:04:36.681 --> 00:04:38.420
the negatives of each other?

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.851
Well they don't equal each other

00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:41.886
or don't equal to the
negatives of each other.

00:04:41.886 --> 00:04:45.679
Then this right over here is
going to be a non-zero integer.

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:49.429
Non-zero integer and
this also is going to be

00:04:51.087 --> 00:04:52.670
a non-zero integer,

00:04:56.194 --> 00:04:58.893
and so we already know
that if we're taking

00:04:58.893 --> 00:05:02.109
the definite integral of cosine of mt dt

00:05:02.109 --> 00:05:03.557
from zero to two pie.

00:05:03.557 --> 00:05:05.585
Where m is some non-zero integer.

00:05:05.585 --> 00:05:07.955
Where the coefficient on
t is a non-zero integer

00:05:07.955 --> 00:05:10.368
then that integral's
gonna evaluate it to zero,

00:05:10.368 --> 00:05:12.022
but that's what we're doing over here,

00:05:12.022 --> 00:05:13.472
and it doesn't look exactly the same

00:05:13.472 --> 00:05:15.600
but this is a non-zero
integer coefficient.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.738
This is a non-zero integer coefficient.

00:05:18.738 --> 00:05:20.717
So this whole integral's gonna be zero,

00:05:20.717 --> 00:05:22.372
this whole integral's gonna be zero,

00:05:22.372 --> 00:05:23.987
and even if you multiply it by one half

00:05:23.987 --> 00:05:25.742
you still get a bunch of zeros.

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:27.813
So hopefully that makes you feel good

00:05:27.813 --> 00:05:29.648
about that statement right over here.

00:05:29.648 --> 00:05:33.177
When m does not equal n or
m does not equal negative n,

00:05:33.177 --> 00:05:35.463
this whole thing is just
going to evaluate it to zero.

00:05:35.463 --> 00:05:38.769
That's gonna be zero and
that is going to be zero.

00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:42.879
Now let's think about the
situation where m does equal n,

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:45.235
and actually let me just
delete this a little bit

00:05:45.235 --> 00:05:47.931
so that we have some space to work with.

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:49.605
So if we assume.

00:05:49.605 --> 00:05:51.997
Actually let me keep that part there.

00:05:51.997 --> 00:05:54.747
So let me keep all of that there.

00:05:56.463 --> 00:05:58.941
Alright, now if m is,

00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:01.866
and actually I even colored.

00:06:01.866 --> 00:06:06.033
So if we assume in the
case of sine squared of mt.

00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:13.518
If we assume if m is equal
to n then what happens here?

00:06:15.467 --> 00:06:17.660
Remember, the thing I wrote in green

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.094
is just the top one where m is equal to n.

00:06:21.094 --> 00:06:22.962
If m is equal to n.

00:06:22.962 --> 00:06:27.384
Well what happens is this
second integral right over here.

00:06:27.384 --> 00:06:31.551
This is still going to be a
non-zero integer coefficient.

00:06:33.725 --> 00:06:36.642
So that one is going to still be zero

00:06:36.642 --> 00:06:38.284
based on what we just argued,

00:06:38.284 --> 00:06:39.634
but this right over here,

00:06:39.634 --> 00:06:41.997
m minus n, that is going to be zero.

00:06:41.997 --> 00:06:43.944
You're going to have a
zero coefficient there.

00:06:43.944 --> 00:06:45.919
So it's going to be cosine of zero t.

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:48.493
Well cosine of zero t,
that's cosine of zero

00:06:48.493 --> 00:06:49.872
regardless of what t you have,

00:06:49.872 --> 00:06:52.231
and cosine of zero is
going to be equal to one,

00:06:52.231 --> 00:06:55.425
and so everything in the
case where m is equal to n.

00:06:55.425 --> 00:06:58.862
This whole thing
simplifies to the one half

00:06:58.862 --> 00:07:02.948
times the integral from zero to two pie,

00:07:02.948 --> 00:07:06.865
and I could write of one
dt if we like, one dt.

00:07:10.548 --> 00:07:13.103
Remember this is the case
where m is equal to n,

00:07:13.103 --> 00:07:15.797
and so what is that going to be equal to?

00:07:15.797 --> 00:07:19.901
Well that's going to be
equal to one half times.

00:07:19.901 --> 00:07:23.117
Well the anti derivative of one is just t.

00:07:23.117 --> 00:07:27.284
So it's just going to be t
evaluated at two pie and zero,

00:07:30.141 --> 00:07:34.182
and so that is going to
be equal to one half.

00:07:34.182 --> 00:07:36.869
I'm doing the same color so
we can keep track of things.

00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:39.425
So that is going to be
equal to one half times

00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:41.446
two pie minus zero.

00:07:41.446 --> 00:07:43.029
Two pie minus zero.

00:07:43.886 --> 00:07:46.049
Well two pie minus zero is just two pie.

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:49.021
So I could just write that's
one half times two pie.

00:07:49.021 --> 00:07:51.819
Which of course is just
going to be equal to pie.

00:07:51.819 --> 00:07:54.982
So we just said, look
when m is equal to n.

00:07:54.982 --> 00:07:58.296
Well if m is equal to n
the magenta expression

00:07:58.296 --> 00:08:00.506
is the same thing as
what I wrote in green,

00:08:00.506 --> 00:08:02.940
and so when m is equal
to n at this integral.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.185
That integral, when m is
equal to n is going to be,

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:08.413
and that's the same thing
as sine squared of mt,

00:08:08.413 --> 00:08:11.246
that is going to be equal to pie.
