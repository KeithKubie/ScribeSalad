coming from nuclear we have some very

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320
coming from nuclear we have some very
 

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.180

thought that methane is cleaner burning

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:11.370
thought that methane is cleaner burning
 

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:14.030
thought that methane is cleaner burning
than coal it is in the sense that you're

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:14.040
than coal it is in the sense that you're
 

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.730
than coal it is in the sense that you're
burning ch4 rather than basically carbon

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:16.740
burning ch4 rather than basically carbon
 

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.510
burning ch4 rather than basically carbon
and so you get more energy per co2

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520
and so you get more energy per co2
 

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.300
and so you get more energy per co2
emissions and natural gases therefore

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:23.310
emissions and natural gases therefore
 

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:27.260
emissions and natural gases therefore
put forward as a transition energy to

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:27.270

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.620

something that's truly lower zero carbon

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:30.630
something that's truly lower zero carbon
 

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:33.410
something that's truly lower zero carbon
but what this study shows is that the

but what this study shows is that the
 

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.770
but what this study shows is that the
amount of methane that leaks almost

works is very significant and methane

remember is one of the six main

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:45.210
remember is one of the six main
 

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:48.140
remember is one of the six main
greenhouse gases and so even though the

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:48.150
greenhouse gases and so even though the
 

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:51.530
greenhouse gases and so even though the
carbon dioxide side is lower the methane

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:51.540
carbon dioxide side is lower the methane
 

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.740
carbon dioxide side is lower the methane
burden is much higher and it turns out

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:54.750
burden is much higher and it turns out
 

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.980

strangely enough both the Clinton era

strangely enough both the Clinton era
 

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.520
strangely enough both the Clinton era

just about Africa's biggest donor in
infrastructure investment and I think

00:24:24.169 --> 00:24:24.179
infrastructure investment and I think
 

00:24:24.179 --> 00:24:26.390
infrastructure investment and I think
one of the really interesting aspects of

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400
one of the really interesting aspects of
 

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.340
one of the really interesting aspects of
Development Assistance is whether as the

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:28.350
Development Assistance is whether as the
 

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:31.790
Development Assistance is whether as the
shape of geopolitics changes the shape

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:31.800
shape of geopolitics changes the shape
 

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.160
shape of geopolitics changes the shape
of this development effort can also

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:34.170
of this development effort can also
 

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:39.669
of this development effort can also
change effectively alongside it and

00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679
change effectively alongside it and
 

00:24:39.679 --> 00:24:43.549
change effectively alongside it and
interestingly I the the south-south

00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559
interestingly I the the south-south
 

00:24:43.559 --> 00:24:45.799

cooperation is not only a gimmick but

00:24:45.799 --> 00:24:45.809
cooperation is not only a gimmick but
 

00:24:45.809 --> 00:24:49.370
cooperation is not only a gimmick but
actually it has some really tangible

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:49.380
actually it has some really tangible
 

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.400
actually it has some really tangible
important elements to it and I'll just

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:52.410
important elements to it and I'll just
 

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:56.299
important elements to it and I'll just
end the answer with the an example we

00:24:56.299 --> 00:24:56.309
end the answer with the an example we
 

00:24:56.309 --> 00:24:59.900
end the answer with the an example we
had a major company working with

00:24:59.900 --> 00:24:59.910
had a major company working with
 

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:02.480
had a major company working with
Ericsson in Nnamani villages and it's a

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:02.490

wonderful partner in the connectivity

00:25:05.299 --> 00:25:05.309
wonderful partner in the connectivity
 

00:25:05.309 --> 00:25:07.850
wonderful partner in the connectivity
and the information technology and they

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:07.860
and the information technology and they
 

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:11.440
and the information technology and they
came with the new solution for low-cost

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:11.450
came with the new solution for low-cost
 

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:13.549
came with the new solution for low-cost
connectivity of primary and lower

00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559
connectivity of primary and lower
 

00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:16.610
connectivity of primary and lower
secondary schools really a clever set of

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:16.620
secondary schools really a clever set of
 

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.230
secondary schools really a clever set of
technologies both hardware and software

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240
technologies both hardware and software
 

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.830

they showed us and they said yes you

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:23.910
they showed us and they said yes you
 

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:27.830
they showed us and they said yes you
know we we got this from India we

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840
know we we got this from India we
 

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.990
know we we got this from India we
acquired this Indian company which is

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000
acquired this Indian company which is
 

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.480
acquired this Indian company which is
rolling this out in

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:31.490
rolling this out in
 

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:34.570
rolling this out in
in Indian communities and it impressed

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:34.580
in Indian communities and it impressed
 

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:37.000
in Indian communities and it impressed
me that this was a case absolutely of

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:37.010
me that this was a case absolutely of
 

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.220
me that this was a case absolutely of
technology transfer but coming from

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:39.230
technology transfer but coming from
 

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:43.450
technology transfer but coming from
India to Sweden and then back to Africa

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:43.460
India to Sweden and then back to Africa
 

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.990
India to Sweden and then back to Africa
so it's really in India to Africa

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000
so it's really in India to Africa
 

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.880
so it's really in India to Africa

well one of the so the question is how
 

00:26:30.969 --> 00:26:34.139
well one of the so the question is how
do we finance the the future of climate

00:26:34.139 --> 00:26:34.149
do we finance the the future of climate
 

00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:37.979
