00:00:07.097 --> 00:00:11.442
The Naming of Clouds

00:00:11.442 --> 00:00:14.694
On a cold December evening in 1802,

00:00:14.694 --> 00:00:17.264
a nervous young man named Luke Howard

00:00:17.264 --> 00:00:21.513
stood before the assembled members 
of a London science club

00:00:21.513 --> 00:00:24.730
about to give a lecture 
that would change his life

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.068
and go on to change humanity's
understanding of the skies.

00:00:31.068 --> 00:00:33.733
Luke Howard was a pharmacist
by profession,

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.494
but he was a meteorologist by inclination,

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:40.353
having been obsessed by clouds
and weather since childhood.

00:00:40.353 --> 00:00:44.336
As a school boy, he spent hours
staring out of the classroom window,

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:47.357
gazing at the passing clouds.

00:00:47.357 --> 00:00:51.681
Like everyone else at the time,
he had no idea how clouds formed,

00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:53.968
or how they stayed aloft.

00:00:53.968 --> 00:00:57.590
But he enjoyed observing 
their endless transformations.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.641
By his own admission, Luke paid little
attention to his lessons,

00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:04.375
but fortunately for the future
of meteorology,

00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:07.653
he managed to pick up 
a good knowledge of Latin.

00:01:07.653 --> 00:01:10.472
Compared to the other natural sciences,

00:01:10.472 --> 00:01:14.204
meteorology, the study of weather,
was a late developer,

00:01:14.204 --> 00:01:16.647
mainly because weather is elusive.

00:01:16.647 --> 00:01:18.734
You can't snap off a piece of rainbow

00:01:18.734 --> 00:01:22.621
or a section of cloud
for convenient study.

00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:26.665
You can, of course, collect rain water
in calibrated containers,

00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:30.731
but all you really end up with
are buckets of water.

00:01:30.731 --> 00:01:33.823
Understanding clouds required
a different approach,

00:01:33.823 --> 00:01:37.161
which is where Luke Howard's idea came in.

00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:40.192
His simple insight based 
on years of observation

00:01:40.192 --> 00:01:43.366
was that clouds have 
many individual shapes

00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:46.290
but they have few basic forms.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.591
In fact, all clouds belong 
to one of three principle types

00:01:50.591 --> 00:01:52.619
to which Howard gave the names:

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.579
cirrus, Latin for tendril or hair,

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.947
cumulus, heap or pile,

00:01:58.947 --> 00:02:03.219
and stratus, layer or sheet.

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.245
But that wasn't the clever part.

00:02:05.245 --> 00:02:10.576
Clouds are constantly changing,
merging, rising, falling, and spreading

00:02:10.576 --> 00:02:12.303
throughout the atmosphere,

00:02:12.303 --> 00:02:16.000
rarely maintaining the same shapes
for more than a few minutes.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.253
Any successful naming system

00:02:18.253 --> 00:02:21.400
had to accommodate 
this essential instability,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.197
as Howard realized.

00:02:23.197 --> 00:02:25.929
So, in addition to 
the three main cloud types,

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:29.981
he introduced a series of intermediate
and compound types

00:02:29.981 --> 00:02:36.007
as a way of including the regular
transitions that occur among clouds.

00:02:36.007 --> 00:02:40.216
A high, whispy cirrus cloud
that descended and spread into a sheet

00:02:40.216 --> 00:02:42.469
was named cirrostratus,

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:46.473
while groups of fluffy cumulus clouds
that joined up and spread

00:02:46.473 --> 00:02:49.364
were named stratocumulus.

00:02:49.364 --> 00:02:51.520
Howard identified seven cloud types,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.796
but these have since been expanded to ten,

00:02:54.796 --> 00:02:58.877
cloud nine being the towering 
cumulonimbus thunder cloud,

00:02:58.877 --> 00:03:04.785
which is probably why being on cloud nine
means to be on top of the world.

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:08.648
Howard's classification had an immediate
international impact.

00:03:08.648 --> 00:03:12.075
The German poet and scientist
J.W. von Goethe

00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:16.158
wrote a series of poems 
in praise of Howard's clouds,

00:03:16.158 --> 00:03:18.909
which ended with the memorable lines,

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:23.540
"As clouds ascend, 
are folded, scatter, fall,

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.646
Let the world think of thee 
who taught it all,"

00:03:27.646 --> 00:03:30.798
while Percy Shelley 
also wrote a poem "The Cloud,"

00:03:30.798 --> 00:03:33.111
in which each of Howard's 
seven cloud types

00:03:33.111 --> 00:03:35.480
was characterized in turn.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.855
But perhaps the most impressive response
to the naming of clouds

00:03:38.855 --> 00:03:41.189
was by the painter John Constable,

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:46.876
who spent two summers on Hampstead Heath
painting clouds in the open air.

00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:49.604
Once they had been named and classified,

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:51.881
clouds became easier to understand

00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:57.216
as the visible signs of otherwise 
invisible atmospheric processes.

00:03:57.216 --> 00:04:00.558
Clouds write a kind of journal on the sky

00:04:00.558 --> 00:04:03.380
that allows us to understand
the circulating patterns

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.493
of weather and climate.

00:04:05.493 --> 00:04:08.452
Perhaps the most important breakthrough
in understanding clouds

00:04:08.452 --> 00:04:12.342
was realizing that they are subject
to the same physical laws

00:04:12.342 --> 00:04:14.783
as everything else on Earth.

00:04:14.783 --> 00:04:16.869
Clouds, for example, do not float,

00:04:16.869 --> 00:04:20.597
but fall slowly 
under the influence of gravity.

00:04:20.597 --> 00:04:22.172
Some of them stay aloft

00:04:22.172 --> 00:04:25.182
due to upward convection
from the sun-heated ground,

00:04:25.182 --> 00:04:29.660
but most are in a state of slow,
balletic descent.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.830
"Clouds are the patron goddesses
of idle fellows,"

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.839
as the Greek dramatist Aristophanes
wrote in 420 B.C.

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:41.886
and nephology, the study of clouds,
remains a daydreamer's science,

00:04:41.886 --> 00:04:44.098
aptly founded by a thoughtful young man

00:04:44.098 --> 00:04:48.129
whose favorite activity was staring
out of the window at the sky.
