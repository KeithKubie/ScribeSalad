00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.830
With social media sites being used by ⅓ of the entire world, they’ve clearly had

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.720
an major influence on society. But what about our bodies? Here are 5 crazy ways that social

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.610
media and the internet are affecting your brain right now!

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.759
Can’t log off? Surprisingly, 5-10% of internet users are actually unable to control how much

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.900
time they spend online. Though it’s a psychological addiction as opposed to a substance addiction,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.199
brain scans of these people actually show a similar impairment of regions that those

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.259
with drug dependence have. Specifically, there is a clear degradation of white matter in

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.680
the regions that control emotional processing, attention and decision making. Because social

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.460
media provides immediate rewards with very little effort required, your brain begin

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.840
to rewire itself, making you desire these stimulations. And you begin to crave more

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.340
of this neurological excitement after each interaction. Sounds a little like a drug,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.730
right?

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.559
We also see a shift when looking at multi-tasking. You might think that those who use social

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.879
media or constantly switch between work and websites are better at multitasking, but studies

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.339
have found that when comparing heavy media
users to others, they perform much worse during

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:05.000
task switching tests. Increased multi-tasking
online reduces your brains ability to filter

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.800
out interferences, and can even make it harder
for your brain to commit information to memory.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.960
Like when your phone buzzes in the middle
of productive work. Or wait...did it even

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.680
buzz? Phantom Vibration Syndrome is a relatively
new psychological phenomenon where you think

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.470
you felt your phone go off, but it didn’t.
In one study, 89% of test subjects said they

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.689
experienced this at least once every two weeks.
It would seem that our brains now perceive

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.840
an itch as an actual vibration from our phone.
As crazy as it seems, technology has begun

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.079
to rewire our nervous systems - and our brains
are being triggered in a way they never have

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.680
been before in history.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.200
Social Media also triggers a release of dopamine
- the feel good chemical. Using MRI scans,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.439
scientist found that the reward centres in
people’s brains are much more active when

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.780
they are talking about their own views, as
opposed to listening to others. Not so surprising

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.740
- we all love talking about ourselves right?
But it turns out that while 30-40% of face-to-face

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.119
conversations involve communicating our own
experiences, around 80% of social media communication

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.140
is self involved. The same part of your brain
related to orgasms, motivation and love are

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.260
stimulated by your social media use - and
even more so when you know you have an audience.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.580
Our body is physiologically rewarding us for
talking about ourselves online!

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.760
But it’s not all so self involved. In fact,
studies on relationships have found that partners

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.300
tend to like each other more if they meet
for the first time online rather than with

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.540
a face to face interaction. Whether it’s
because people are more anonymous or perhaps

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.830
more clear about their future goals, there
is a statistical increase in successful partnerships

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.970
that started online. So while the internet
has changed our verbal communication with

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.010
increased physical separation, perhaps the
ones that matter most end up even closer.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.620
Speaking of social media, we had you ask us
questions on twitter, instagram, facebook,

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.110
tumblr, google+ and every other social platform
we could find and did a Q&amp;A Video over on

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.250
AsapTHOUGHT! So if you feel getting some insider
info on AsapSCIENCE and behind the scenes,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.659
check it out with the link in the description!

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.800
Got a burning question you want answered? Ask it in the comments or on Facebook and Twitter.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.349
We also finally got a PO Box, for all of you
amazing science lovers who have requested

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.330
to send us mail or other stuff over the years.
And we’d love to hear from all of you! So

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.730
feel free use the address on the screen or
in the description box.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.380
