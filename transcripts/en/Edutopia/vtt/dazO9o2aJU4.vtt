00:00:04.456 --> 00:00:07.406
&gt;&gt; I began with the real part
of my professional career

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:11.536
in a school that was
broken in about as many ways

00:00:11.536 --> 00:00:18.346
as a school can be, and knew
this has to be done better.

00:00:18.346 --> 00:00:20.466
My name is Jason Singer
and I'm the principal

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.046
of Kipp King Collegiate
High School.

00:00:22.436 --> 00:00:27.606
What really galvanized for
me when I started thinking

00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:29.926
about Kipp as a solution was

00:00:29.986 --> 00:00:35.976
that your zip code did not
confer upon you a limited amount

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:41.476
of opportunity, as
opposed to a limitless one.

00:00:41.476 --> 00:00:44.636
We've told our kids since
fifth grade that the focus

00:00:44.636 --> 00:00:46.386
of your work is to
get to college.

00:00:47.236 --> 00:00:49.576
And our theory of
practice at King is

00:00:49.576 --> 00:00:50.936
that critical thinking
wins the day.

00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.516
&gt;&gt; My name is Jared Kushida.

00:00:53.816 --> 00:00:56.266
I teach history at Kipp
King Collegiate High School

00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.566
in San Lorenzo, California.

00:00:57.696 --> 00:01:00.166
If there's a constant theme
throughout my teaching,

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.476
it's that I wanna have
Socratic dialog, you know,

00:01:02.536 --> 00:01:04.996
critical thinking
skills almost every day.

00:01:05.346 --> 00:01:09.686
&gt;&gt; The hallmark of it is
questions, thought provoking,

00:01:10.306 --> 00:01:12.896
difficult questions
being asked by a teacher,

00:01:13.696 --> 00:01:14.876
and thought provoking

00:01:14.946 --> 00:01:18.356
and difficult questions
being asked by students.

00:01:18.776 --> 00:01:21.886
&gt;&gt; If you were like, 'Hey,
Kushida, what can I--

00:01:21.886 --> 00:01:23.316
how much does an A
cost in this class?'

00:01:24.046 --> 00:01:27.166
and you took out your wallet
and, you know, I was like,

00:01:27.376 --> 00:01:29.816
'I think 50 bucks would work,

00:01:29.816 --> 00:01:32.076
which one of us would
be corrupt in that case?

00:01:32.076 --> 00:01:36.956
&gt;&gt; The trust that Kushida gives
them is what empowers them.

00:01:37.146 --> 00:01:38.066
&gt;&gt; It would be you.

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:43.076
Because you're the one
that's asking for it, right?

00:01:43.076 --> 00:01:46.196
So whoever is asking
for an illegal

00:01:46.196 --> 00:01:48.586
or immoral favor is corrupt?

00:01:48.586 --> 00:01:50.656
&gt;&gt; You're the one that's
asking for the money.

00:01:50.926 --> 00:01:53.116
&gt;&gt; But what's the
relationship between us?

00:01:53.216 --> 00:01:56.106
What's the power relationship?

00:01:56.106 --> 00:01:59.396
I'm higher power, so could you
be corrupt in that relationship,

00:01:59.436 --> 00:01:59.976
or would it have to be me?

00:02:00.426 --> 00:02:02.696
&gt;&gt; It really had to grow on
me, because in ninth grade,

00:02:02.696 --> 00:02:04.006
I was not a good student.

00:02:04.006 --> 00:02:05.886
But then, meeting the teachers,

00:02:05.886 --> 00:02:07.806
and their passion
really just made me want

00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:10.056
to stay and want to learn.

00:02:10.326 --> 00:02:15.466
To me, critical thinking means
thinking beyond what you hear.

00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:17.316
It makes me think about
myself differently.

00:02:17.316 --> 00:02:18.796
It makes me think about
education differently.

00:02:19.426 --> 00:02:21.156
It's more than just
about academics.

00:02:21.296 --> 00:02:23.596
It's about, you know, what
you know in your brain,

00:02:23.596 --> 00:02:24.736
in your heart, in your soul.

00:02:26.056 --> 00:02:27.066
&gt;&gt; My name is Kate Belden.

00:02:27.476 --> 00:02:28.546
Currently, I'm the
assistant principal

00:02:28.546 --> 00:02:29.906
of Kipp King Collegiate
High School.

00:02:30.406 --> 00:02:34.166
I teach Leadership One
and Leadership Two.

00:02:34.476 --> 00:02:38.106
We're on a team where everyone
is devoted to our mission,

00:02:38.106 --> 00:02:40.266
that it is possible for
every single student

00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:43.406
that attends our school to
have the opportunity to go

00:02:43.406 --> 00:02:46.556
to four year college if
they want to do that.

00:02:46.556 --> 00:02:48.926
&gt;&gt; When they walk on a college
campus for their first time,

00:02:48.926 --> 00:02:52.396
you know, they're gonna
be hit almost immediately

00:02:52.616 --> 00:02:55.106
with so many crises
of confidence.

00:02:55.376 --> 00:02:59.666
They're going to be surrounded
by predominantly white students,

00:02:59.896 --> 00:03:02.576
when their entire
education here,

00:03:02.976 --> 00:03:05.196
they've been surrounded
predominantly

00:03:05.196 --> 00:03:06.966
by people of color.

00:03:06.966 --> 00:03:10.236
&gt;&gt; We can't control the
fact that they're gonna be

00:03:10.236 --> 00:03:11.636
in a situation for
the first time,

00:03:11.636 --> 00:03:13.006
at least in the last
eight years, where they're

00:03:13.006 --> 00:03:14.636
with a lot of affluent students.

00:03:14.636 --> 00:03:16.716
We can't control those
things, so we think about,

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:19.946
how can we best prepare them to
be extraordinarily comfortable

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:21.826
in the academic setting?

00:03:21.916 --> 00:03:23.606
&gt;&gt; When that professor
starts speaking,

00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:27.506
if their legs kinda steel
beneath them, and they're able

00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:31.836
to say to themselves, 'I got
this,' then at that point,

00:03:31.926 --> 00:03:33.796
it's beyond just having power.

00:03:34.126 --> 00:03:36.146
What we want them to
have is influence.

00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:38.456
&gt;&gt; What does control mean to you

00:03:38.456 --> 00:03:39.766
and what does influence
mean to you?

00:03:40.156 --> 00:03:42.526
&gt;&gt; For control, it's
kinda like yourself,

00:03:42.526 --> 00:03:43.606
and then for influence, is

00:03:43.606 --> 00:03:45.266
that a lotta people
can influence you,

00:03:45.866 --> 00:03:48.846
so it's individual
and then more people.

00:03:48.846 --> 00:03:50.096
&gt;&gt; The people we
are controlling,

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:51.376
they don't really have an option

00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:53.446
to do something else
besides what you say,

00:03:53.546 --> 00:03:56.026
whereas influence is more like,
you're giving them an option,

00:03:56.026 --> 00:03:58.726
or like persuading them
to do a certain thing.

00:03:58.726 --> 00:04:01.906
&gt;&gt; I feel that in order to
gain control, you must have

00:04:01.906 --> 00:04:06.176
like influence as a catalyst,
and to gain influence,

00:04:06.176 --> 00:04:07.166
you should have control.

00:04:08.216 --> 00:04:12.276
&gt;&gt; We have no idea whether
students at King are persisting

00:04:12.276 --> 00:04:16.536
in college, because we're
graduating our first class now.

00:04:16.716 --> 00:04:18.446
I mean, time will tell.

00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:21.336
Persistence rates
will either prove

00:04:21.336 --> 00:04:23.096
or disprove this notion we have

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.656
of the importance of
critical thinking.

00:04:25.096 --> 00:04:27.716
But when I look at our seniors,

00:04:28.586 --> 00:04:31.156
there is a difference
in disposition.

00:04:32.826 --> 00:04:37.976
They have a presence that
really gives me confidence

00:04:37.976 --> 00:04:38.896
that they're ready to succeed.
