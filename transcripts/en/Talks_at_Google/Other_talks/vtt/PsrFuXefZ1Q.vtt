00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.490
[applause]

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.790
&gt;&gt;Dan Roam: Thank you Stephan. I wanna thank
you all for coming. What Stephan said is right

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.230
and it's remarkable to me because as I was
driving down here earlier today I was thinking,

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.970
"My gosh I can't believe that it's actually
been four years since I came to this room

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.560
and gave a talk about my previous book." And
I'm thinking, "From my perspective four years

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.689
it's gone by really fast, it doesn't seem
like all that much has happened. I've written

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.980
some more books, I've had a chance to talk
with a lot of people." But then I was thinking,

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.030
"My gosh in Google time four years is incredible."
I mean think how much must have changed here.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.350
So when I came here four years ago I had a
very specific point that I wanted to make

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.620
to people which was that we don't draw enough
and we tend to not think very well because

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.620
we don't use our visual mind very well.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.489
So my first book was all about solving problems
with pictures and I realize now as the years

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.000
have gone by that a lot of things have changed
in these last four years in terms of helping

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.970
us think visually. There have been a lot of
books that have come out about visual problem

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.670
solving, there's been a lot of interest around
creating applications that people can use

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.810
to help them articulate software that are
more visual, and there's been a whole slew

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.979
of tools that have been released online, many
of them belonging to you, that allow us to

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.369
communicate using pictures a lot more effectively
than we could in the past. But I also realized

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.100
that we're not there yet.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.150
In these last four years we haven't gotten
to the point where we've solved all of our

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.200
problems. We still seem to have these challenges
ahead of us and what I really wanted to set

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.689
out to do as I was working on this new book
was kind of double down and say, "If my first

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.359
book was just about using pictures, what I
wanna talk with you about today, and what

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:46.850
my new book is about, is using that combination
of words and pictures to make every idea that

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.940
we have become incredibly clear." Because
I think that the story I'd like to share with

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.249
you is a pretty simple one. As I think about
the ideas that are out there, there are so

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:01.109
many of them, and we now have so many different
channels by which people communicate their

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:05.459
ideas to us, it all starts to sound after
a little while like this, just this endless

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:11.150
wall of words of blah, blah, blah descending
upon us. It's really difficult to begin to

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.690
understand what are the ideas that we really
wanna pursue? What are the things that are

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.780
really interesting to us?

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.890
So what I want to share with you today is
this simple idea of can we move from a world

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.110
that looks like that to a world where maybe
we can start to think about how we can communicate

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.910
our ideas better by using fewer words? We're
still going to use words but we're going to

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.100
help make those words become incredibly powerful
by introducing the idea of combining them

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.100
with pictures.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.440
And so I think that the best way to start
out to make this real is I'd like to start

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.380
out with kind of two different case studies
of organizations I've worked with over the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.110
last couple of years and they represent kind
of a spectrum to me. On one side an organization

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.550
that has used pictures exceedingly well to
explore really complex ideas and now that's

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.650
the good side of the spectrum. And then on
the bad side of the spectrum an organization

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.430
that hasn't used pictures at all and communicates
miserably.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.620
So I'd like to start with the good one. On
the good side, a couple years ago I had a

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.700
chance to go up to Seattle and work with a
number of the program managers that are overseeing

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.130
the development of the new 787, the new Dreamliner,
arguably the most complex machine that has

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.010
ever been made. And what they shared with
me is it's even more complex than I had thought

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.690
because the 787 is being built at the same
time in 17 different countries by people speaking

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.170
13 different languages.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.760
So for example, the fuselage section in the
front, everything that's in light blue, is

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.770
built in the United States. Everything that's
in green, the main fuselage component, is

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.930
being built in Italy. Everything that's in
red is being built in Japan; everything that's

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.410
in yellow is being built in China, etcetera.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.430
So the question I had is how is it possible
for someone in say Shanghai, let's say the

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.190
person who's working on the wing root, to
know how to build their component to within

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.150
tolerances of in some cases millions of an
inch so that it perfectly lines up with the

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.180
component being built by someone in Italy
and a component being built by someone in

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.430
Japan? All the pieces get shipped back to
Seattle and they snap together and they fit.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.370
Well the thing that they showed me up at Seattle
is the reason they're able to that is because

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.440
everything, every aspect of the design, maintenance,
constructions, training, everything that has

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.660
to do with that machine is communicated through
pictures; it's as if they've replaced spoken

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.289
language completely. And I'm not just talking
about really sophisticated computer aided

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.470
design. I mean Boeing has had that for decades.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.710
What is interesting here is the creation of
a global network of a visual language so that

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.449
if have a question about what am I supposed
to do I don't need to read anything, I go

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.219
online, I look at the picture and I see what
I'm supposed to do. And the really remarkable

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:59.729
thing is that in the end it actually flies;
it works. So that's a really good example,

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.319
that's the good end of the spectrum and I
promised you that I'd show you a bad end of

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:04.569
the spectrum as well.

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.970
So I wanna talk to you about an organization
where I think communication doesn't work at

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.550
all. Now I have had an opportunity to work
with the United States Senate and a number

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.680
of different governmental organizations. And
the reality is people are incredibly smart,

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.939
people are working very, very hard, but the
problem is that often, because it's all about

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:28.940
politics, the ideas that this guy is generating
he wants to make absolutely sure that this

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.990
guy does not understand. "I wanna make sure
that you don't know what I'm doing, it's secret,

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.800
this is my political agenda." Well that's
part of the problem.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.930
The other problem is that even when those
people agree on what they're trying to do,

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:47.840
the result of their work looks like that.
Think of how invested you have to be in this

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.169
piece of policy or this idea to be willing
to drill all the way down through it to try

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:57.229
to figure out what it's really about. It doesn't
work, it doesn't fly, and in the end we end

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:01.990
up with people who become really politically
agitated because they don't know what it is

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.909
that Washington is actually trying to say.
What is the solution? We don't know.

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:12.660
So what I wanna share with you is something
that is, I think is a tool that can help clarify

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.199
this. How do we use the pictures and the words,
put them together? This is something that

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:23.979
I call vivid thinking. Now vivid is a mnemonic.
Now I am one of those people, my memory just

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:27.830
sucks, it's not anywhere near as good as it
could be or as I'd like it to be so I rely

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.849
on mnemonics and visual devices all the time
to help me remember things.

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:41.419
So let me walk you through what vivid actually
stands for. So the V-I stands for visual;

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:53.020
the V stands for verbal; and the I-D stands
for interdependent. So if we put that together

00:06:53.020 --> 00:07:00.029
what do we have? Visual, verbal, interdependent
thinking. That's the kind of thinking I want

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:03.069
us to have and then an idea will become truly
vivid.

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:07.930
Now there's a more vivid way to describe that.
So what it means is I'm no longer going to

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.389
believe that you know what you're talking
about if you can just talk about it. No matter

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:16.550
how articulate you might be I'm not going
to believe you have fully explored your idea

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:22.300
if you can only talk about it. Nor am I going
to believe that you have fully explored your

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.960
idea if you can only draw it.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.680
Vivid thinking means that we will combine
both. And for some neurobiological reasons

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.970
that we'll talk about in a few minutes this
is the really critical factor. When we want

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:40.439
out mind to light up on an idea, when we have
an idea and we wanna share it with someone,

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:45.680
when we combine words and pictures, which
most of us have never been taught to do, it's

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.090
almost magic that happens the way it lights
up other people's minds and our own.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:54.629
So what vivid thinking really is, for anybody
who has an opportunity to look through my

00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:59.720
book, vivid thinking in the end of the day
is a very simple set of tools that since most

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.741
of us believe we are primarily verbal and
that's what we've been taught in school, so

00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:09.180
our default thinking process for most of us
involves writing or speaking. What vivid does

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:14.340
is it gives us a very simple set of tools
to overlay on top of those words and say,

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:21.629
"If I had to create a visual to compliment
those words what would I do? Because I don't

00:08:21.629 --> 00:08:26.990
know how to draw." It tells us, vivid thinking
tells us exactly how to do that.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:32.070
The reason why this works, there are a couple
of unwritten rules about visual problem solving

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:36.570
and vivid problem solving. And I wanna share
with you the most important one goes like

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:44.550
this: whoever best describes the problem is
the person most likely to solve the problem.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:48.710
Now what I mean by that is if any of you are
in a position to assign budgets or to assign

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.960
work to others, and I'm assuming many of you
are, if someone came running into your room

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.360
and said, "Give me money, the sky is falling,
I'll fix it," you're probably gonna say, "Not

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.399
so fast." But if the person came in and said,
"Look I've started to map out the problem

00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:07.209
and I've realized that when these people or
these constituents get together in this way

00:09:07.209 --> 00:09:12.709
there seems to be a series of consistent outcomes
and what I'd like to do is explore why this

00:09:12.709 --> 00:09:16.029
one always goes badly. Could you give me some
more money to explore it?"

00:09:16.029 --> 00:09:22.230
The fact is the person who has already begun
to map out the problem is the person who proves

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:27.250
that they have the greatest grasp of it and
also is beginning to find what the solution

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:33.070
is likely to be. So the really mercenary subtext
here, and this is true, is whoever draws the

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:37.720
best picture gets the funding; absolutely
true rule number one, whoever draws he best

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.670
picture gets the funding. We don't see this
rule very often because we don't draw very

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:47.520
often, but every time somebody does they win.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.360
And I wanna show you the best example of this
ever, the best sort of back of the napkin,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:57.230
simple, visual idea ever. So we're out here
in the Bay Area, let's fly out here to Washington,

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:01.171
'cause as I've mentioned I had chance to work
with the Senate and the U.S. Navy, and some

00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:03.500
other organizations in D.C.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:08.660
And after one of my talks a guy came up to
me who was head of the new policy for the

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:12.880
United States Senate for the Democratic side
of the Senate, and he said, "Dan, I have the

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.540
perfect, simple picture back of the napkin
story for you from politics." And he shared

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:23.560
this picture and it goes back to 1974, so
we're talking kind of ancient history now,

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:28.250
when Ford, President Ford was in power.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:33.569
President Ford ran a very conservative, fiscally
conservative administration. There was a very

00:10:33.569 --> 00:10:41.810
popular economist at that time, his name was
Arthur Laffer, USC economist, very conservative

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:47.000
in his views, who spent a lot of time in D.C.
doing consulting for the Ford Administration.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.020
So one night Arthur Laffer goes out to a bar
with two senior aides to President Ford, they

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:58.180
go to a bar in Washington D.C. and they start
talking about taxation and monetary policy.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:02.170
And at one point Laffer pulls out the cocktail
napkin and he says, "Guys I have an idea.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:06.220
Do you mind if I draw a little picture for
you?" And the two guys he's with said, "No,

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:12.360
no go ahead." So on his napkin Laffer draws
a very simple little x, y plot, something

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.649
I'm sure all of us have done at one time or
another, and since they're talking about taxation

00:11:16.649 --> 00:11:23.209
on the horizontal axis he maps out the percent
tax rate that the government is charging on

00:11:23.209 --> 00:11:30.240
our income from zero percent up to one hundred
percent. And on the vertical scale he maps

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:35.790
out how much money does the government actually
collect in tax revenue from zero dollars up

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:40.190
to lots and lots of dollars. And he says to
the guys that are there in the bar with him

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:45.410
on this napkin he says, "Okay so if the government
charges us zero percent income tax how much

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:51.199
is the government going to make? Zero." And
then he said, "But think about this: if the

00:11:51.199 --> 00:11:56.030
government charges us one hundred percent
income tax, how much money is the government

00:11:56.030 --> 00:12:00.540
going to make? Also zero because no one will
work."

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:06.259
Think about that, if every single penny of
every dime of every dollar that you earn came

00:12:06.259 --> 00:12:10.450
in one pocket and you immediately had to pay
all of it back out in income tax, what would

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:13.220
be the point of even working? You might as
well just forget about it, just go to the

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.220
beach.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:18.610
So he drew on his napkin what actually seems
to happen is there must be some kind of a

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:24.720
curve that goes like that. And at some point
isn't it interesting that reducing the rate

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:30.269
of taxation actually increases the amount
of money the government collects?

00:12:30.269 --> 00:12:34.029
Now the two guys who were with Laffer that
night in the bar thought that was pretty interesting;

00:12:34.029 --> 00:12:37.550
these are the two guys. They said, "Can we
take that napkin back to show it to President

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:43.360
Ford? There is a fundamentally interesting
idea in that drawing." He said, "Please take

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.360
the napkin."

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.111
They took and they showed it to President
Ford who was very intrigued by the idea, he

00:12:47.111 --> 00:12:52.160
got it, he liked it. Ford passed that napkin
off to the Republican National Committee,

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.660
who then passed that napkin off to the economics
team of a guy named Ronald Reagan who was

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:02.990
thinking of running for President. And quite
literally that napkin sketch became the basis

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.110
of Reaganomics.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:08.440
That is the first instance anywhere in the
public record of anybody ever talking about

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.959
what became known as supply side economics.
The idea, when someone would come to President

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:18.540
Reagan and they'd say, "Wait a minute in order
to increase taxable revenue, government revenue,

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.920
you're gonna decrease the rate of taxation
especially for the wealthy? What?" He would

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.810
draw them out that picture and they'd say,
"Oh, I get it."

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.170
Now the interesting part about this story
is the two guys who were with Arthur Laffer

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:35.360
that night in the bar are these two guys:
Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.350
and Former Vice President Dick Cheney were
the two guys who were sitting in the bar that

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:44.820
night with Arthur Laffer. It was those three
guys with that cocktail napkin who basically

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:50.839
invented Reaganomics that night in that bar.
That became pretty much underlying American

00:13:50.839 --> 00:13:56.129
economic policy for most of the last 30 years
and we are still debating to this day is it

00:13:56.129 --> 00:13:57.560
a good idea or not?

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:01.819
But here's the question I have: who says a
simple little sketch on the back of napkin

00:14:01.819 --> 00:14:07.330
doesn't have power? It has extraordinary power.
That's what I was referring to when I was

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:12.370
saying, "Whoever draws the best picture gets
the funding." The person who comes up with

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:22.449
the visual clarity of their idea always wins
for a very simple reason. We are of two minds,

00:14:22.449 --> 00:14:27.209
and I am not talking about left brain and
right brain thinking. Everybody's familiar

00:14:27.209 --> 00:14:30.819
with the idea of right brain and left brain
thinking; one of our hemispheres is creative

00:14:30.819 --> 00:14:34.639
and one's analytical. No, it is nowhere near
that simple.

00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:40.879
Now one thing we do know is that all, the
brains of all mammals, all mammal brains,

00:14:40.879 --> 00:14:44.810
have a bilobed neocortex, the part on the
top of the brain is split in half. But as

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:50.721
far as we can tell right now, to the limit
that tests allow at this point, humans seem

00:14:50.721 --> 00:14:55.899
to be the only mammal in which it is true
the two hemispheres have evolved to have slightly

00:14:55.899 --> 00:15:00.439
different function. And now we are beginning
to realize what the difference between the

00:15:00.439 --> 00:15:05.230
two hemispheres of our brain really is and
it boils down to something like this: one

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:11.459
half of our brain has evolved to become really
good at looking at the world in terms of little

00:15:11.459 --> 00:15:18.069
bits, pixels, little bits of focus. The other
half of our brain has evolved to become really

00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:21.310
good at being the glue that pulls them back
altogether.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:25.790
So there's another way of looking at this
that says, "This part of our brain has evolved

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:31.029
to be really good at focus." Somewhere in
our evolutionary past it was very important

00:15:31.029 --> 00:15:36.040
for us to be able to scan the horizon and
see the one thing that we wanted to go get.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:40.480
But if we only focus on that we're gonna be
attacked by something from behind us. So the

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:46.160
other half of our brain evolves to be really
good at peripheral vision. Pretty fascinating

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.910
what we're starting to find is that half our
brain is really good at the focus and the

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:54.550
other half is good at the larger picture.
That's what we know.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:16:00.459
Another way to think about this, the way this
has further evolved, one way to diagram this

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:06.300
out, looks something like this. One half of
our brain does want to see the world like

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:12.370
that, little bits, letters, words, can I break
it down to its elemental pieces? The other

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:17.810
part of our brain wants to say, "That's not
what it's about. It's about the whole thing."

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:22.209
Now what's interesting is both of these are
the same and yet of course both of these are

00:16:22.209 --> 00:16:29.319
completely different. Which one is right?
Is this the right description or is this the

00:16:29.319 --> 00:16:31.220
right description?

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.790
Well the answer of course is that both of
them are the right description, but this is

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:42.900
the only one that for most of us in most of
our education we are ever taught to develop.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:47.120
We're given verbal syntax, we're given verbal
grammar, we're tested on our ability to write

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:52.629
a five paragraph essay, our intelligence is
judged by our ability to be verbally articulate.

00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:57.740
When has ever anyone given us a tool, a serious,
I mean a real tool in the same way that we

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:03.540
have grammar and syntax? When has ever anyone
given us a tool that helps us with that part?

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:09.310
And yet actually this part is bigger than
that part; we are more visual than we are

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:13.820
anything else. More of our brain is dedicated
to processing vision than any other thing

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:18.430
that we do and it's ironic to me that we haven't
got tools to take advantage of that. So that's

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.039
what we're gonna focus on now.

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:25.860
And to kind of get us moving I'd like to do
a little test with you. Very simple, I'm going

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:31.461
to show you four pictures. All of them are
going to look something like this and they

00:17:31.461 --> 00:17:36.440
just go in order, A, B, C, D. What I'd like
you to do is just look at the four pictures,

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.370
I don't want anybody to stress out this isn't
some kind of test where we need to look for

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.910
the hidden banana or something like that.
I just want you to look at these pictures

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:47.480
and see if you can identify that there are
some things in the pictures.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:53.890
So this is picture A. Do we all agree that
there are some things in this picture? Okay

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:58.720
so now I'm gonna go on to picture B for a
moment. This is picture B and I'm gonna go

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.990
back and forth a few times. I don't want anyone
to stress out, I want you to actually see

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:09.210
the differences so I'm going back to A now.
This is A and this is B. I'm gonna back again,

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:16.909
A and B. And let's go back one more time and
this time as I go from A to B I want you to

00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:23.380
ask yourselves a question: how much time do
you think might have passed between A and

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.450
B? How much time do you think might have passed?
Anybody?

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:27.890
&gt;&gt;male #1: Seconds.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:31.539
&gt;&gt;Dan Roam? Seconds, some number of seconds.
Alright I think so.

00:18:31.539 --> 00:18:33.630
So now let's continue. This is picture C.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.780
[pause]

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:40.250
I can hear that many of you are seeing that
something else has happened. And now let's

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.650
go on to the last picture, picture D.

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:43.240
[pause]

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.950
And we can see that something else has happened.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:50.850
Now I'm gonna go back to C for a second and
I want you to ask yourselves the same question:

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:56.720
between C and D how much time has passed from
this picture to this picture?

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.980
&gt;&gt;male #2: Hours.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.250
&gt;&gt;Dan Roam: Hours.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:03.919
So the first transition took place in a number
of seconds and this transition took place

00:19:03.919 --> 00:19:06.539
in a number of hours and we're pretty much
all in agreement with that.

00:19:06.539 --> 00:19:11.770
But here's the really remarkable thing: we
did all of that without the need to rely on

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:16.630
a single word to describe anything that we
were witnessing and yet every one of us saw

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:21.280
almost exactly the same thing. If we were
to be debriefed later most of us would say

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.059
we had witnessed exactly the same thing. It
didn't require a single word to do it.

00:19:26.059 --> 00:19:30.360
Now we know that that's the case but we don't
think about it very much. And that's what

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:36.230
I wanna do for the rest of this time, take
advantage of building some tools to help us

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:40.870
bridge the gap, to move from being good at
this part and knowing how to being better

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:47.030
at that part and then how to apply it to our
own ideas. How can we make this relevant?

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:52.980
So all of us, I mean my gosh in particular
all of you who work at Google, what are we

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:59.159
really in? What business are we really, really
in? We're in the business of ideas. And the

00:19:59.159 --> 00:20:03.200
trouble with most ideas is that they start
out kind of like this, this is like a pile

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:09.050
of coal; they're ugly, they're undifferentiated,
they're poorly defined, but like a pile of

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:12.120
coal they have incredible potential.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:16.080
But jokingly people say, "What's the worst
gift you can give to someone is a lump of

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:22.000
coal," because nobody wants to touch it. This
is exactly like our initial idea; we know

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.600
in our mind that we've got the potential of
something great and often what happens is

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.520
we go no further than this and we bring it
to our colleague or our boss or our investor

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:36.679
what have you and say, "Fund me." And people
are like, "No way. I'm not touchin' that."

00:20:36.679 --> 00:20:38.440
They don't realize the potential is in it.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.370
So what we're going to do with this vivid
thinking and the napkins and pens that I handed

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:48.250
out to you, is I 'd like to show you a tool,
a visual, verbal tool, that will help us take

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:57.529
any idea from its undifferentiated, kind of
ugly, nasty starting point to becoming something

00:20:57.529 --> 00:21:01.760
that is so crystalline and so beautiful that
nobody ever wants to forget it.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:06.539
And the really interesting thing to me about
this metaphor is of course we recognize that

00:21:06.539 --> 00:21:12.539
these two piles are exactly the same thing;
a pile of coal and a diamond are exactly the

00:21:12.539 --> 00:21:17.549
same thing. Both of them are 100 percent carbon
and nothing else.

00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:18.549
[pause]

00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:20.899
[sound of setting pen on table]

00:21:20.899 --> 00:21:28.190
The problem is in order to get from this one
to this one we have to go through a process.

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:32.740
And what I wanna help you do is figure out
what is the process we can go through to make

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.040
our idea become like that.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:39.670
So here's how we're gonna do it: you have
your napkin. I want you to draw with me now.

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:43.640
We're gonna draw out that process, we're gonna
draw out that tool. Now I hope everybody has

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:48.799
something that you can rest your napkin on
'cause you take those ball point pens and

00:21:48.799 --> 00:21:51.309
you're gonna dig through that napkin so you're
gonna have to put something under otherwise

00:21:51.309 --> 00:21:53.190
you're gonna end up drawing on your pants.

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:58.460
So here's what we do: when we want to draw
a problem solving picture we don't panic,

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:02.289
we don't think, "Oh I don't know how to draw."
The first thing that we do is we just draw

00:22:02.289 --> 00:22:06.210
a little circle, literally in the upper left
hand corner of your napkin I'd like you to

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:12.929
draw a little circle. And then that's the
visual part, but now let's activate both sides,

00:22:12.929 --> 00:22:17.540
let's get the verbal part in there too. Give
it a name. What am I gonna call that circle?

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:20.000
And I'd like you to call it me.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.620
[pause]

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:24.650
And for a little bit of extra credit let's
let the visual side of us take off, go ahead

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.330
and make the me look a little bit like you.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:28.730
[pause]

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:32.440
So we've gotten started now and now if we
drew one circle as our starting point what

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.790
might be a logical next step? Well how 'bout
we draw another circle and let's make another

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:44.809
little one down in the lower left hand corner
and I'm gonna call this one my audience.

00:22:44.809 --> 00:22:46.169
[pause]

00:22:46.169 --> 00:22:49.260
And let's make that one look a little bit
like someone to whom we're always trying to

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.130
explain our ideas. I'm gonna make it look
like my Mom 'cause I'm always trying to explain

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:56.970
to my Mom what exactly it is that I do. So
go ahead, so now we've got these two and our

00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:01.720
mind is leaping forward to say, "Okay I've
got the two pieces me and my audience, that's

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.520
me, that's my boss, this is me doing my perf,
that's the person who's gonna overlook my

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.539
perf, whatever it is. To whom do I need to
show this?

00:23:08.539 --> 00:23:12.210
And then I'd like you to draw a big circle
in the middle.

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:14.110
[pause]

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:17.710
And this one I'd like you to call my idea.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.419
[pause]

00:23:19.419 --> 00:23:23.830
Now what we are going to do and we're doing
it visually, we're doing it vividly, we're

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:28.559
allowing our mind to relax because we can
continue to look at the picture even as we

00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:33.590
describe it. Something neurobiologically powerful
is happening by virtue of the fact that we

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:38.169
can look at this picture as I describe it,
our mind actually relaxes because it doesn't

00:23:38.169 --> 00:23:43.419
have to remember anything; it's able to follow
along, it's able to see what the words mean

00:23:43.419 --> 00:23:44.919
at the same time.

00:23:44.919 --> 00:23:50.110
So now let's say we've got this idea. To just
explain our idea all at once is gonna be a

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:53.830
bit like that pile of coal, it's gonna be
largely undifferentiated. So what we're going

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:59.480
to do is we're gonna break our idea down into
six different slices. Just like take that

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.240
idea as if it was a pizza; we're not gonna
force someone to eat the pizza all at once

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:07.760
we're gonna give it to 'em slice by slice.
I'd like you to divide that idea up into six

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.860
slices.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:09.960
[pause]

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:16.289
And what we're gonna do for the rest of the
time here is label those six and step by step

00:24:16.289 --> 00:24:21.490
I'm gonna walk you through another mnemonic
device that is a nice tool to use when you've

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:27.180
got your idea and it begins time to start
qualifying it and clarifying it.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.710
So here's what I want you to do. In the six
slices I'd like you to write the following

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:42.910
letters: F, O, R, E, S, T. And what does that
spell?

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:43.950
[pause]

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:48.679
Forest. It spells forest. That's going to
be our mnemonic. It spells forest. Now why

00:24:48.679 --> 00:24:54.470
is that? Well number one 'cause it's a mnemonic
that I can remember, number two it also helps

00:24:54.470 --> 00:25:01.370
us remember that when we want to clarify our
idea it takes work. The first pass on our

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:05.870
idea is not the one we wanna show to someone
else, it's not vivid yet. The trouble for

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:11.730
most of us is we work in a really stressful
environment. Very often the environments in

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:15.820
which we are working, and I know here at Google
you have done many, many things to try to

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:20.850
alleviate this, but for a lot of the working,
the people that are out there working, we

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:25.090
have to go into a brainstorming session, we're
under continual pressure, there's noise, there's

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.600
crashing, there's lot of stuff going on around
us.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:32.059
The reason I like this idea of the forest
is because it reminds us that when it comes

00:25:32.059 --> 00:25:38.179
time to take our idea and make it vivid for
someone else it is worth finding the time,

00:25:38.179 --> 00:25:44.080
if only in our own mind, to find a kind of
a quiet place like a forest where we can spend

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:50.039
some time making sure our idea is really vivid
before we start running around and sharing

00:25:50.039 --> 00:25:51.130
it with someone else.

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:55.520
So here we go. We're gonna work through all
six of these and we're gonna do just a couple

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.581
of minutes and an example for each one. And
I'd like you to follow along with me as I

00:25:59.581 --> 00:26:00.581
go.

00:26:00.581 --> 00:26:03.480
So what F stands for is form –

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.610
[pause]

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:09.130
and go ahead and draw a little box with that
and if you wanna go ahead and make it like

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:14.780
a cube go ahead. F stands for the first thing
that we wanna find to make our idea vivid

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:20.470
is we want to find the idea's form. What is
its underlying shape? So that is the form

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:26.050
of a bicycle. I don't need to describe a bicycle
with words I can draw a picture and everybody

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:30.799
can see what it is. Now that's great if my
idea is a mechanical object, but what if my

00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:35.970
idea is more abstract? What if my idea is
a business idea, something that's not as easy

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:39.049
to draw as a bicycle?

00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:42.190
Often what happens is when we wanna describe
to someone the form of our business we write

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:48.000
a business plan. But let's be honest, how
many people actually wanna read that? Nobody

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.750
is going to read that business plan. We're
looking for the form of our idea in an encapsulated

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:58.310
way that we can so someone else can see what
we're talking about. Nobody's gonna read that.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:04.640
Well what is that? Does anybody know what
that is? That's a TV dinner tray.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.690
Now we all live in the Bay Area so of course
we have a lot more sophisticated tastes so

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:09.020
we have a Bento box --

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.020
[laughter]

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:14.470
but it's the same idea. We can understand
the form of our meal because everything fits

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:17.970
into its own little zone, into its own little
box.

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:21.940
Well now there is a really interested guy
out there who has created a way to create

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:28.480
business models in a Bento box. Now what he's
done, Alexander Osterwalder, brilliant book

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:34.480
Business Model Generation, has used vivid
thinking as well as anybody ever could to

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:39.510
say, "When I wanna communicate my business
idea to someone, what I do is I just divide

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:47.220
business up into these nine different categories:
my partners, my products, my propositions,

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:52.610
and all I need to do to build any business
is be able to populate each of those aspects,

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:57.399
each of those different segments in my Bento
box and look for the relationships between

00:27:57.399 --> 00:28:03.380
them and I can start to describe any business
idea in a way that doesn't require an entire

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:08.299
business plan and is very dynamic and people
get." So that's what I mean, this is the form

00:28:08.299 --> 00:28:11.090
of business. We need to find the form of our
idea.

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:16.299
O stands for only essentials.

00:28:16.299 --> 00:28:18.940
[pause]

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:21.799
And let's draw a little drop of water there.

00:28:21.799 --> 00:28:28.230
Now what I mean by that is that for an idea
to stick in someone else's mind the first

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:33.600
thing we wanna share with someone else is
the essence of the idea, that could be the

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:38.049
form, but it's the essence of it. What is
my idea in the end of the day really about?

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:42.510
Now I have done some work with the Navy and
what was fascinating to me is there I was

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:45.690
at the Naval War College and I was working
with a room of very smart people and they

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:52.440
introduced me to a term called B.L.U.F., B-L-U-F.
Now I had never heard of this term before

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.340
but what it means is that in the Armed Forces
in the Navy there is a standard. If you're

00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:05.880
gonna deliver a message you remember B.L.U.F.
which stands for bottom line up front. If

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:10.280
you wanna be heard you give the bottom line
up front; you do not come in with all the

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:13.570
details. You figure out what the end point
is, you figure out what the essence of your

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:16.920
idea is, you go in and you start your presentation
with that.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:21.070
Why would you do that? Because then it gives
your audience the opportunity to decide for

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:25.400
themselves whether the rest of your idea is
worth their time or not. Rather than sitting

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.830
through you having to go through a preamble
you say, "This is what it's about. This is

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:33.600
its essence." And if that appeals to them
then they will give you all time in the world

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.610
to go back through the details. I thought
that was pretty compelling.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:44.070
So I wanna give you an example. This is a
network diagram from one of our local Silicon

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:49.580
Valley companies that describes their network
security model. This was an advertisement

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:55.350
in a magazine and it was not a magazine for
people who are experts in computer technology.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:30:00.570
I don't think that this is a very good explanation
of the essence of an idea of security.

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:06.730
I was reading The Economist Magazine two months
ago and I saw an ad from Google. This was

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:13.590
the ad that described Google's security policy
in The Economist Magazine. I thought, "Brilliant.

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:16.799
Talk about the bottom line up front." If I'm
reading The Economist Magazine it's highly

00:30:16.799 --> 00:30:21.720
unlikely that I am an expert in technology
security. What I'm interested in is what do

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:25.840
I get from it? What is the benefit for me?
Talk about bottom line up front. Google's

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.429
verification process is two steps. First you
gotta get past the bear and then you have

00:30:29.429 --> 00:30:35.210
to escape from the snake pit. That's what
security means to us. Now that's intriguing.

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:39.889
I'm interested in that company's security
model; now I will go in and I will get into

00:30:39.889 --> 00:30:41.380
the details of it.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:47.809
Don't give me that. I don't know what that
means. Give me that. Plus it's clever which

00:30:47.809 --> 00:30:52.419
helps a lot. Plus it shows F, the form of
the idea.

00:30:52.419 --> 00:30:55.960
R stands for recognizable.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.090
[pause]

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:03.769
And let's go ahead and draw something simple,
draw some water with the sun over it; an image

00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:08.500
that all of us can, genetically encoded to
recognize what that image is.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:14.380
What do I mean by recognizable? For our idea
to be vivid it has to be something that the

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:20.139
moment someone looks at it they say, "Oh I
know what that is. I've seen that before."

00:31:20.139 --> 00:31:23.900
When we show our idea to someone what we don't
want to have happen in their mind is them

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:29.649
to say, "What? I don't know what that is."
What we want them to say is, "I got it already,

00:31:29.649 --> 00:31:30.929
now give me more of the details."

00:31:30.929 --> 00:31:37.210
So this is, they tell me, this is a map of
business strategy as it's taught in some of

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:42.700
our better business schools. Uh-huh. I run
a business; it doesn't look anything like

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:46.620
that. I don't know what this is about. I am
not gonna take the time to read this. It may

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:52.120
be visual but it is certainly not vivid. Businesses
to not look like that.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:58.580
Now what is this a picture of? This is a picture
of the ocean. We all know what that is. And

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:01.710
you know something interesting sort of visceral
happens when we look at this, I don't know

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:05.281
about you, but I look at this image and I
say, "I recognize it. That's the ocean, that's

00:32:05.281 --> 00:32:09.120
what I see out there every single day. There's
something intriguing about the possibilities

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:14.620
of an ocean. What would happen if I was able
to sail out there, way out into a place where

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:19.690
no one's been before? What's beyond that horizon?
I wanna go there."

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:25.080
The best selling business book in the last
five years is a book called Blue Ocean Strategy.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:29.179
And I will tell you, has anybody ever heard
of this book? Blue Ocean Strategy has absolutely

00:32:29.179 --> 00:32:35.640
nothing to do with the ocean, nothing whatsoever.
The original title for the book was about

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:40.509
something like Maximizing Shareholder Value
to Leverage Synergies in the Competitive,

00:32:40.509 --> 00:32:44.830
Non-Competitive Landscape, etcetera; something
completely unmemorable to someone who's not

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:49.659
an expert. But what the authors did is they
said, "We think that the idea in this book

00:32:49.659 --> 00:32:54.860
can be made to be something that is instantly,
almost genetically recognizable. What are

00:32:54.860 --> 00:33:00.090
we talking about? The appeal of going out
into a blue ocean that is unexplored." By

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:06.009
making their book title Blue Ocean Strategy,
is this an absolutely better strategy book

00:33:06.009 --> 00:33:10.190
than any other strategy book that's out there?
Well maybe, it's a great book. But is it really

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:15.639
that much better? What makes it become such
a great idea in our mind and so memorable

00:33:15.639 --> 00:33:18.899
is the fact that we recognize the image immediately.

00:33:18.899 --> 00:33:22.740
So I spend a lot of time with business books
and I was looking over what have been best

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:30.110
selling business books of the last few years
and every one of them has a visual, recognizable

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:32.110
aspect to the title.

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:37.190
So does anyone wanna guess what this business
book might be? This was a business book called

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:44.159
Switch; this one is called Drive; this one,
anyone wanna guess what that one might have

00:33:44.159 --> 00:33:50.130
been called, a very popular business book
three years ago driven entirely by a picture?

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:55.080
Anybody ever heard of the book called The
Long Tail? This is Linchpin. Anybody wanna

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:59.610
guess what that one might be? Made To Stick.

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:05.070
[pause] Made to Stick. This is of course our
Blue Ocean Strategy. Anybody can you see what

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:09.850
that is? Purple Cow about marketing. Anyone
know what this book might be?

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:11.620
&gt;&gt;male #3: The Black Swan.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:13.090
&gt;&gt;Dan Roam: The Black Swan. Anyone guess what
that one might be?

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:14.090
&gt;&gt;male #4: Tipping Point.

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:15.981
&gt;&gt;Dan Roam: The Tipping Point. What do you
think this one is?

00:34:15.981 --> 00:34:16.981
&gt;&gt;male #5: The World is Flat.

00:34:16.981 --> 00:34:19.460
&gt;&gt;Dan Roam: The World is Flat. Anyone wanna
guess what that is?

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:20.460
&gt;&gt;male #6: Blink.

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:21.460
&gt;&gt;Dan Roam: Blink, exactly.

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:27.669
Okay now think about is: this book and this
book were written by the Heath Brothers; massive

00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:34.220
best selling business book. This book and
this book were both written by Malcolm Gladwell;

00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:36.690
incredibly phenomenal best selling business
books.

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:43.770
What is it, this is also Seth Gooden and Seth
Gooden over here. What is it that the leading

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:49.540
idea people of the last 10 years, what is
it that Malcolm Gladwell, the Heath Brothers,

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:56.329
and Seth Gooden know that hundreds of thousands
of other business authors seem not to? If

00:34:56.329 --> 00:35:04.680
you can make your idea a visually recognizable
idea it is something that will stick in people's

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:09.980
minds instantly and they will decide immediately
to follow up on it. That's what I mean by

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.099
making it recognizable.

00:35:12.099 --> 00:35:19.200
E stands for evolving. And what I'd like you
to do here let's go ahead and draw a square

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:26.180
that makes its way into a diamond; evolving.
A vivid idea, what I mean by this is, a vivid

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:31.910
idea is one that starts out really clear,
yes it has great form, yes it's only the essentials,

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:37.420
yes it is recognizable, and on top of that
is it an idea that the person we're showing

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:43.670
it to can contribute something to it? The
idea is complete but it's not finished.

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:51.680
Now what I mean by that is, Leonardo da Vinci
way back in 1438 invented the first parachute.

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:55.349
He didn't actually build one but he drew it
in one of his notebooks. And Leonardo went

00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:59.680
really far because he actually specified how
big you would need to make a parachute, how

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:03.131
much fabric you would need, etcetera; he came
up with all the quantitative measures. Now

00:36:03.131 --> 00:36:09.150
he never actually built the parachute. It
took 300 years, 300 years for a Frenchman

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:15.079
Lenormand to actually review Leonardo's original
drawings and go and build a parachute and

00:36:15.079 --> 00:36:20.490
jump off a tower outside of Paris and live;
took 300 years for someone to have the guts

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:26.230
to do it and Sasha of course it was a Frenchman
who did it, right? So then another guy comes

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:29.970
along a hundred years later and continues
to refine the parachute and we get up to the

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:31.260
parachute that we have today.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:36.970
The point I wanna make is that the idea of
a parachute is vivid because the original

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:42.900
part of the idea is something we understand
and we can continue to incrementally evolve

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:48.359
that idea and it just gets better and better
because the original idea made such great

00:36:48.359 --> 00:36:49.390
sense.

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:50.430
[pause]

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:55.690
My favorite example of a business person who
is the greatest example of someone who could

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:59.690
evolve an idea is a guy named Edwin Land.

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:01.490
[pause]

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:07.650
Edwin Land is the second most prolific, second
number of patents of any American ever. Thomas

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:14.190
Edison was the first, Edwin Land is the second;
458 patents to his name. He was the inventor

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:18.480
of the Polaroid sunglasses, he was the inventor
of the Polaroid camera, he was the inventor

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.710
of the cameras that were held on the U-2 spy
planes that were flying over the Soviet Union

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:25.890
during the Cold War, he invented incessantly.

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:30.180
And what everyone who knew Edwin Land would
say is the way he worked is he would lock

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.520
himself in a room; he would go without eating
for three of four days; he would be one of

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:37.650
those people like Steve Jobs in a way, that
someone would have to bring food and remind

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:42.120
them, "You've gotta get back, you can't just
work on your product all the time." But he

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:46.700
would incessantly work on it, continuing to
refine it. And then he would come out with

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:50.902
this thing that was almost perfect in its
form from the first go and people would look

00:37:50.902 --> 00:37:55.680
at it and say, "You are such a genius. Did
that just come out of nowhere?" No it came

00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:00.430
out of coming up with a good original idea
and incrementally evolving it, evolving it,

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:06.150
evolving it. And that was the history really
of the Polaroid camera that for decades was

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:08.640
this incredible success.

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:13.050
Well even Edwin Land as brilliant as he was
could not have anticipated the arrival of

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:19.640
the digital revolution which spelled the end
of Polaroid. So Polaroid sadly, such a great

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:26.329
example of one time a great industrial company,
in about the year 2001 finally went bankrupt.

00:38:26.329 --> 00:38:27.550
[pause]

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:32.420
Polaroid is back now, investors have gotten
together, started Polaroid again and you know

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:37.750
who is the Chief Creative Officer of the new,
newly reborn Polaroid camera is Lady Gaga.

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:41.839
She's actually the Chief Creative Officer
of the new Polaroid. Talk about a company

00:38:41.839 --> 00:38:46.600
that is willing to evolve itself; that's what
I mean by a vivid idea. We understand that

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:51.730
the idea is good, how do we need to change
it to make sure that it stays topical?

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:53.280
[pause]

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:57.450
S stands for spans differences.

00:38:57.450 --> 00:38:59.660
[pause]

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:03.480
And let's go ahead and draw something that
looks like a balance; two circles that are

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:08.750
balanced. Now what I mean by this is that
a vivid idea, one that other people are going

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:14.060
to remember like that diamond, is one that
doesn't just have one point of view; it doesn't

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:19.280
just say this, it doesn't just say black or
white or right or left, it actually spans

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.280
both.

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:26.520
Now the best example I could come up with
for this was it has been a rule in automotive

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:32.810
engineering forever to say that if you wanted
to design a car, right from the beginning

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:40.230
you had to make a decision: was your car going
to be efficient or was it going to be powerful?

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:45.710
Because inherent in the limitations of the
internal combustion engine was that binary

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:49.380
distinction. And when you set out to design
a car the first thing as an engineer you had

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:54.620
to decide is which one am I going for? And
for a hundred years that was the driving model

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:55.930
behind cars.

00:39:55.930 --> 00:40:00.030
But that doesn't make any sense; it makes
sense given the limitations but then a couple

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:05.890
of other guys got together and realized the
problem with that distinction isn't that that's

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:11.030
a valid distinction, it has to be one or the
other, the problem the engine that we're using.

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:17.089
What would happen if instead of saying we
have to make a car that's efficient or powerful,

00:40:17.089 --> 00:40:22.820
what would we need to do to make a car that
is efficient and powerful? Well the first

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:27.420
thing we'd have to do is come up with a different
engine. And so the Tesla is born and literally

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:31.730
that was the thought process that the founders
of Tesla went through. You end up with a Tesla

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:37.670
now that is more efficient than a Mini and
more powerful than a Hummer. The breakthrough

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:41.770
wasn't in saying, "Gee an electric engine
would be a great thing to put in a car." The

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:50.940
decision came from saying, "Almost all engineering
starts out by us making binary distinctions

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:56.040
in putting out our initial spec. It's either
going to be this or it's going to be that.

00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:02.400
And those limitations are inherent in us moving
forward." The brilliant, vivid ideas come

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:06.859
from not being willing to accept the binary
distinction of this or that, but by saying,

00:41:06.859 --> 00:41:15.490
"What I wanna do is both. What do I need to
change in my thinking to do both?" That's

00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:19.310
where you get a car, a breakthrough like the
Tesla; that is a truly vivid idea.

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:24.610
And the last one: a vivid idea is targeted.

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:25.970
[pause]

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:31.280
Now what I mean by that is we've been talking
about, remember the first circle that we drew

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:35.680
was me, and now we've been talking about our
idea, going through all of these different

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:41.170
things, and for the most part in our sort
of forest we thought about, "Okay what's the

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:47.780
form of the idea? What would be its essentials?
How could I make it recognizable and yet still

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:53.140
evolving? And how could I make it be both
this and that?" But that's an exercise that

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:57.160
we could largely do by our self or with our
team. And that's great, that gets us partway

00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:03.140
there but there's one piece that's missing
which is the person that we have to show it

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.670
to.

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:08.810
Up to this point we've been working on our
own. Now the last piece is targeted. Let's

00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:16.059
go ahead and draw a little target. And what
I mean by that is a vivid idea is one that

00:42:16.059 --> 00:42:22.290
recognizes who its audience is. And isn't
pandering, it's not tailored to that audience,

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:27.710
but it says it recognizes that different people
are going to find something compelling, different

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:31.890
things in my idea. Can I think through who's
gonna look at it and what would make it most

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:32.930
compelling to them?

00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:41.520
So my favorite example is: this is a cup of
coffee. And back in the old days, Grandpa's

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:44.890
time, they'd say, "I could buy that cup of
coffee for five cents." And then when I was

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:49.609
a kid you could buy it for 25 cents or maybe
for 45 cents. And then someone came along

00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:53.931
and said, "Wait a minute. This is an undifferentiated
commodity, it doesn't target to anyone. It's

00:42:53.931 --> 00:42:58.800
just one size fits all. What would happen
if we went out and realized that there are

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:04.480
actually different people out there who might
react, want different things out of that cup

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:08.869
of coffee? What would happen if we targeted
it and we refined it so you've got one version

00:43:08.869 --> 00:43:12.250
for this group and another version for that
groups and another version that that group?"

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:18.240
And all of a sudden this thing that wasn't
a commodity business at 35 cents a cup becomes

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:23.630
a specialty business at $3.75 a cup because
it became targeted.

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:29.559
And out of that comes the possibility of taking
one original idea and not thinking, "What

00:43:29.559 --> 00:43:34.040
are all the things I could do with this idea?"
But thinking, "Who are all the different people

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:39.930
that might find this idea appealing and what
could I change in it incrementally to make

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:46.760
it very appealing to each one?" And you end
up with from this we get an entire range of

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:52.730
hundreds of different varieties all of which,
in the end of the day, make it more interesting,

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:56.470
more engaging, and something more of us wanna
buy more of.

00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:57.830
[pause]

00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:02.030
That's really the end of the prepared remarks
I have. I wanna wrap up with one kinda final

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:04.609
quick bit of history. Where did we get to
this point?

00:44:04.609 --> 00:44:08.450
But what I'd really like you to do, if there's
anything you could take away from this, take

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:13.329
that little napkin drawing, and I mean this,
really think this through because it will

00:44:13.329 --> 00:44:18.920
work. You've got your idea or your team's
idea and you have to convey it to someone

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:26.050
else. Think through how could I give my idea
a form? If I had to draw a picture of my idea

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:30.500
what would that picture look like? How could
I boil it down so that if I had to deliver

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:36.300
my idea, bottom line up front, what would
be the bottom line that I would say first?

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:41.301
How would I make my idea recognizable? What
kind of visual metaphor that people have seen

00:44:41.301 --> 00:44:48.190
before can I find for my idea? How can I make
sure that my idea is complete but it's not

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:52.510
finished, it's got room for someone else to
add their part? How can I make sure that my

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:59.490
idea spans both this and that, not just this
or that? And then in the end say, "And now

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:03.630
that I've done all that, how can I figure
out who's most interested in my idea and how

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:07.430
would I need to tweak it to make it most interesting
for each one of those people?"

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:12.030
And I promise you that if you do that, that
idea is gonna start to move from that coal,

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:16.370
that lump of coal, to start to become that
diamond in your mind and in the mind of the

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:18.260
people you're showing it to.

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:19.390
[pause]

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:24.569
I'd like to conclude with just a couple of
minutes of why does any of this matter?

00:45:24.569 --> 00:45:25.720
[pause]

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:30.819
Where did this come from? Well clearly at
some point in our past the fact that we are

00:45:30.819 --> 00:45:36.240
so visual, that we react so well to these
visual metaphors must be driven by the fact

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:40.619
that we needed to see the thing that was out
there ready to hunt us down in order to get

00:45:40.619 --> 00:45:45.109
away from it. We weren't talking about it,
we needed to see it. We've got a lot of visual

00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:52.170
processing to see it. But somehow over the
last 32,000 years we've started to shift;

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:54.590
we've shifted a lot in fact.

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:58.880
Here you have the 16,000 year history of how
we have gone from visual language to strictly

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:04.570
verbal language at least in the West, at least
in the European languages. So the Caves of

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:10.890
Lascaux people drew, drew a bull; 16,000 years
ago.

00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:15.030
Then 5,000 years ago if we move over the Egypt
you had hieroglyphics and someone's drawing

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:20.210
a bull that doesn't look too different and
that meant bull. A bull was a very important

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:23.950
part of the Egyptian economy, so you'd draw
a picture of a bull.

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:29.960
But then someone also realized that some ideas
are too conceptual to be able to be easily

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:34.140
represented, so let's just draw a simpler
picture to start to mean something else. So

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:39.599
the Phoenicians came sailing across to Egypt,
saw the hieroglyphic bull, copied the head

00:46:39.599 --> 00:46:45.430
of the bull and in Phoenician this was called
Alf, was the name of a calf. So they borrowed

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:49.970
that symbol and said, "Let's go ahead and
use that as the symbol for Alf."

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:53.670
And then over time the Phoenicians simplified
that symbol, but you can see that it's still

00:46:53.670 --> 00:47:03.970
a bull. And then it was borrowed by, the Phoenicians
continued to evolve it and it becomes the

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:08.870
letter Aleph, which becomes the first letter
in the Hebrew alphabet.

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:13.120
Which then the Greeks borrow, turn one more
time, and it starts to become Alpha and then

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:15.849
which we borrow and simply and make the letter
A.

00:47:15.849 --> 00:47:20.900
So here we have sort of 16,000 years history
of how we've gone from that symbol all the

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:26.190
way to that symbol. Now it's remarkable what
that has done for us because we know that

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:31.170
our ability to think using this type of symbol
is incredibly fluid and flexible and powerful

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:32.710
especially in the digital age.

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:38.550
But the question I wanna leave you with is:
this is a wonderful timeline, but what have

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:45.359
we lost along the way? Because now this has
become the way that we think and I'd just

00:47:45.359 --> 00:47:51.160
like to encourage us to remember we can also
think like that. And this one is more deeply

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.090
encoded in what we're going to react to and
understand.

00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:55.090
So --

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:56.680
[pause]

00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:00.820
why does any of this matter to us? Because
what I'd like us to do is be able to use our

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:06.040
visual thinking to help us avoid the incessant
blah, blah, blah that threatens to overwhelm

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:08.790
us and help us make our own ideas become very
vivid.

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:14.770
And with that I wanna thank you for your time.
I'm happy to stay if anybody has any questions.

00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:15.770
[applause]

00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:16.770
Thank you.

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:16.771
[applause]
