00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.330
Women decide whether or not they like a guy
within 15 minutes of meeting them.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.050
That’s a full 14 minutes and 59 seconds
longer than YouTube viewers.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.980
Welcome to DNews, I’m Ross Everett.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.470
Women’s intuition, aside from being the
name of my new fragrance line, is a very powerful

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.470
thing.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.470
Not unlike my new fragrance line.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.960
From the moment a woman lays eyes on a possible
mate they’re analyzing their traits, deciding,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.189
“do I want my offspring to have these?”

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.270
How do we knows this?

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.039
Well, findings from the Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland Ohio has been doing

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:39.670
experiments on the brains of… fruit flies.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.559
Ross, are you saying that women have the brains
of fruit flies?

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.039
Not at all… men do too.

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.940
Here’s a fun little factoid: fruit flies
are regularly used for research because they

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.859
share 60 percent of human genes.

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.809
So when someone says you have a flea brain,
they’re not far off.

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.039
Our brains share six of the same chemicals
that transmit messages as well as have the

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.010
same division of regions that process sound,
sight and smell.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.369
Think about that next time you’re about
to make a big decision.

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.190
When studying these fruit fly brains, scientists
identified one single gene that, when mutated,

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.040
rendered a female completely incapable of
deciding on a mate - even when a male is trying

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.140
really hard.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.840
Poor guy.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.730
From there, scientists were able to map this
courtship gene to a small number of excitatory

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.400
neurons located in just three distinct regions
of the brain - two of which they never even

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.430
knew had anything to do with mating behavior.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.900
So it’s that tiny number of neurons that
helps a lady-fly decide whether she’s impressed

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.450
by all his dancing, singing and pheromone-releasing.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.820
And if it takes a male any longer than 15
minutes to win her over, that’s pretty much

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.820
a “no.”

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.570
So, if you want to get a big consensual YES
from a partner, remember to always put your

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.980
most exciting foot forward.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.890
And if you get rejected, maybe it’s not
you - maybe her excitatory neurons are just

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.890
malfunctioning.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.030
Do you find yourself gravitating towards more
exciting options?

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.780
