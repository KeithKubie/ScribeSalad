00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.910
Let's do a bunch more of
these addition problems.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:12.420
So let's say I have
9,367 plus 2,459.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.700
So we can do this the exact
same way we've done in

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.730
the last few videos.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.620
We start in the 1's place
or you can even think of

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.340
it as the 1's column.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.590
So you're going to add the
seven 1's plus the 9 1's.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.260
So you're going to have 7
plus 9, which we hopefully

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.080
know by now is 16.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.260
So what we do is we write
the 6 in the 1's place

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.480
and we carry the 1.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.850
Let me switch-- if this 1 is
going to be the same thing

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.370
as that 1 right there.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.520
And this might look like a
little bit of a mystery or

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.460
magic, and the whole reason
we did that is that

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.805
this is the 10's place.

00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:50.870
And when you write 16 you
have six 1's and one 10.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.610
If you view this as money,
what's the best way to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.360
get $16 in a world where
there weren't $5 bills?

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.140
Where you only had $1
bills, $10 bills, $10

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.070
bills, and so on.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.440
Only multiples of 10.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.950
And we don't have any $5 bills.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.010
In that world you would
represent 16 as one $10

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.930
bill just like that.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.750
And then six $1 bills.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.060
So that's two $1 bills.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.460
That's two more $1 bills.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.570
And then that's two
more $1 bills.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.700
The whole reason why I'm
drawing it this way or I'm even

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.570
using this analogy or drawing
the dollar bills is to show

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.890
you what these places mean.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.240
When I say that this right
here is the 10's place, I'm

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.160
essentially telling you how
many $10 bills do I have?

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.965
If I've $16 and I'm doing it
as efficiently as I can in

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:52.380
a world without $5 bills.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.780
I only have $1's, $10's,
and $100's and $1,000

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.850
bills and so forth.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.630
And this is the 1's.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.190
So when I write it this way I'm
literally telling you, I have

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.050
one $10 bill and I
have six $1 bills.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.470
That's what $16 is.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.700
And so when I have 7 plus 9 is
equal to 16 I say that I have

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.780
six $1 bills and I
have one $10 bill.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.760
And I add that one $10
bill to everything

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.250
else in the ten space.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.770
And the tens place is
essentially telling you how

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.560
many-- that's the tens.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.500
I could write it like that or
I could write the 10's place.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.850
When I have 67-- 67 means
I have six $10 bills

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.470
plus another seven $1's.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.400
So that's six 10's, five 10's.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.690
So I add up everything
in the tens place.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.170
So 1 plus 6 plus 5.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.160
Let me do that in a new color.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.800
1 plus 6 plus 5 is equal
to-- 1 plus 6 is 7.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.000
7 plus 5 is 12.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.670
So I write the 2 in the 10's
place because remember, this

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.710
is twelve $10 bills because
we're in the 10's place.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.250
So I have two in the 10's place
and I put the 1-- I carried

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.240
this 1 right here into
the 100's place.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.950
Because if I have twelve
$10 bills, I have $120.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.070
I have one $100 bill.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.010
And I have two $10 bills.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.030
I'll stop going to the dollar
bill analogy just so we can

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.870
make sure we understand
the process.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.690
But I think you
see how it works.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.800
You start at the right, you
add the two numbers up.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.930
If it's a two-digit answer you
carry the left most digit

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:27.980
up to the next column.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.490
And you just keep doing that.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.720
So let's do this
one right here.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.580
1 plus 3 is 4.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.270
Let me write this down
in another color.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.980
1 plus 3 plus 4.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.260
1 plus 3 is 4.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.050
Plus 4 is 8.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.680
So 1 plus 3 plus 4 is 8.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.630
Nothing to carry.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.290
It was a one-digit number.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.930
And then finally,
I have 9 plus 2.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.070
That's equal to 11, so I
write the 1 down there.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.300
I write this 1 and then if
there was anything left here I

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.880
would carry the 10's or the
other 1-- the 1 in the 10's

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.570
place in 11-- I would carry it.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.265
But there's no where to
carry it to, so I write

00:04:07.265 --> 00:04:09.080
it down just like that.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:16.400
So 9.367 plus 2,459 is 11,826.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.530
And I just put that comma
there because it's

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:19.834
easier for me to read.

00:04:19.834 --> 00:04:21.160
Let me do a bunch
more of these.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.110
Let's do a really, really
daunting problem.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.770
Let's do something
in the millions.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.435
Just to show you that
you can do any problem.

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:37.860
So let's say we have 2,349,015.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.180
Let's throw a 0 in there.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.970
We have nothing in the
hundreds place there.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.920
And I want to add that to-- let
me switch colors just for fun.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:55.980
I want to add that to 7,--
let's put a 0 there-- 15,999.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.980
Let's add these two numbers.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.420
It seems like a hard problem,
but if we just focus on each

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.770
of the places I think you'll
find that it's not too bad.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.730
So we start off with 5 plus 9.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.970
That's equal to 14.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.210
Write the 4 down
here, carry the 1.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.490
Then you go into
the 10's place.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.880
1 plus 1 is 2.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.260
2 plus 9-- let me
switch colors.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.740
1 plus 1 is 2.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.130
2 plus 9 is 11.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.050
Carry the 1.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.530
Now we're in the 100's place.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.970
1 plus 0 is 1.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.070
Plus 9 is 10.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.935
So we write the 0 from
the 10, carry the 1.

00:05:34.935 --> 00:05:37.630
Let me switch colors again.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.740
1 plus 9 is 10.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.360
10 plus 5 is 15.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.580
Now we're in the
10,000's place.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.730
1 plus 4 is 5.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.110
And 5 plus 1 is 6.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.900
And there's nothing to carry.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.030
Now we're in the
100,000's place.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.770
3-- we have nothing to carry,
so we just have the three

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.570
100,000's plus zero 100,000's.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.960
Well, that's just
three 300,000.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.130
And then finally, we're
in the millions place.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.550
2,000,000 plus 7,000,000
is 9,000,000.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.360
Just like that.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.170
So this was a super
crazy number.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:17.960
2,349,015 plus 7,015,999.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.170
Just by keeping track of our
places and carrying the

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.700
two-digit numbers or the second
digit in the two-digit numbers

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.210
as necessary, we were able
to figure out that the

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:31.570
answer is 9,365,014.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.400
So hopefully this gives
you a pretty good sense.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.670
And let me just do one more,
just to really make sure that

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:41.120
we really understand how all of
this carrying business works.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:58.490
So let's do 15,999,001
plus 6,888,999.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.850
Let's just see how this
one's going to turn out.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.140
This seems like a like
a difficult problem.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.330
But once again, if we just
focus and don't get lost,

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.350
we're going to get the
right answer hopefully.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.210
So 1 plus 9 is 10.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.410
Write the 0, carry the 1.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.420
1 plus 0 plus 9 is 10.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.180
Write the 0, carry the 1.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.360
1 plus 0 plus 9.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.170
That's 10 again.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.980
Write the 0, carry the 1.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.790
Now 1 plus 9 is 10, plus 8.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.810
10 plus 8 is 18.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.460
Write the 8, carry the 1.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.940
1 plus 9 is 10.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.410
Plus eight is 18.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.270
Write the 8, carry the 1.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.890
1 plus 9 is 10.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.080
Plus 8 is 18.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.980
Write the 8, carry the 1.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.260
Now we're in the
1,000,000's place.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.700
1,000,000 plus 5,000,000
is 6,000,000.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.310
Plus 6,000,000 is 12,000,000.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:00.390
Write the 200,000,000 and then
carry the 1 because 12,000,000

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.730
is 2,000,000 plus 10,000,000.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:05.420
10,000,000 plus 10,000,000.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.460
This is one 10,000,000 plus
another one 10,000,000.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.880
That's 1 plus 1 is 2.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.070
And then we are done.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:23.450
15,999,001 plus 6,888,999
is 22,888,000.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.680
So you just saw, we're just
doing 7 and 8 digit number

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.590
additions, but you could apply
this-- if I had a number with

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.540
100 digits in it, you could
do the exact same thing.

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.140
You just have to start at the
right, go each column by each

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.550
column, and then if you end up
with a two-digit answer when

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:42.100
you add the two one-digit
numbers, you just

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.360
carry the 10's place.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.720
You just doing that and
work your way left.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.940
And if you make no errors,
you'll get the right answer.
