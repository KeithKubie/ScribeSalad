00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Remember, we've been talking about pass/fail signals and experiments.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
As you get out of the building and start talking

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to these potential customers

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
you need to set up some experiments.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
How do I know these are the right customers or the right buyers?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And so you want to set up a series of experiments

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to test interest and figure out where do you want to test it

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and what kind of experiments can you run,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and how many do you test?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
By the way, the how many is a classic question,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and the answer is it depends.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
In a business to business enterprise sale

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
you might get away with talking to less than 20 customers,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and that's a great number.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But if you have a mobile or web app

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
you want to talk to hundreds if not thousands of customers.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now, obviously you can't personally interview all of those

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
like you could in the enterprise, and so you want to get out and reach them virtually,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
but the number you want to get to really is an order of magnitude different

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
than if you were doing B to B direct sales.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Just a caveat and a warning.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
When you're out of the building trying to talk to hundreds or thousands

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
of potential web or mobile app users

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
you want to be careful that you're not completely dependent on online surveys.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
People simply lie on surveys, and so what you want to have

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
is some sample where you actually bring those people into your building

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
or you go see them, and you watch their pupils dilate

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
as you actually ask them the question and see if that

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
kind of diverges from the data you're getting when they're hitting your website

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
or you're sending them questionnaires, and then you'll have a correlation

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
to be able to figure out is that data valid or not?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Just keep that in mind when you're trying to reach hundreds or thousands

00:01:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
of people for customer discovery.
