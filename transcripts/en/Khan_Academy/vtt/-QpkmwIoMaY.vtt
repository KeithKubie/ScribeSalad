00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.910
This exercises is from chapter
12 of the Kotz, Treichel in

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.880
Townsend and Chemistry and
Chemical Reactivity book, and

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.020
I'm doing it with their
permission.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.190
So they tell us you place 2
liters of water in an open

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.110
container in your
dormitory room.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.590
The room has a volume of 4.25
times 10 to the fourth liters.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.100
You seal the room and wait for
the water to evaporate.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.170
Will all of the water evaporate

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.700
at 25 degrees Celsius?

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.580
And then they tell us at 25
degrees Celsius, the density

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.050
of water is 0.997 grams
per milliliter.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:44.180
And its vapor pressure is 23.8
millimeters of mercury.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.210
And this is actually the key
clue to tell you how to solve

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.720
this problem.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.730
And just as a bit of review,
lets just think about what

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.110
vapor pressure is.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.820
Let's say it's some temperature,
and in this case

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.820
we're dealing at 25
degrees Celsius.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.180
I have a bunch of water,
and let me do

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.530
that in a water color.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.140
I have a bunch of
water molecules

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.545
sitting here in a container.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.100
At 25 degrees Celsius, they're
all bouncing around

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.150
in every which way.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.790
And every now and then one of
them is going to have enough

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.380
kinetic energy to kind of escape
the hydrogen bonds and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.680
all the things that keep liquid
water in its liquid

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.140
state, and it will escape.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.780
It'll go off in that
direction, and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.955
then another one will.

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:29.190
And this'll just
keep happening.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.310
The water will naturally
vaporize in a room.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.930
But at some point, enough of
these molecules have vaporized

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.680
over here that they're also
bumping back into the water.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.910
And maybe some of them
can be captured back

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.520
into the liquid state.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.010
Now, the pressure at
which this happens

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.380
is the vapor pressure.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.190
As you can imagine, as more and
more these water molecules

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.860
vaporize and go into the gaseous
state, more and more

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.000
will also create pressure,
downward pressure.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.270
More and more will also
be colliding with the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.840
surface of the water.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.020
And the pressure at which the
liquid and the vapor states

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.170
are in equilibrium is
the vapor pressure.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.390
And they're telling
us right now.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.230
It is 23.8 millimeters
of mercury.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.870
Now, what we need to do to
figure out this problem is

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.320
say, OK, if we could figure out
how many molecules need to

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.830
evaporate, how many molecules of
water need to evaporate to

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.690
give us this vapor pressure, we
can then use the density of

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.250
water to figure out how many
liters of water that is.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.380
So how do we figure out how many
molecules-- let me write

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:59.690
this down-- how many molecules
of water need to evaporate to

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:14.740
give us the vapor pressure of
23.8 millimeters of mercury?

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.740
So what, I guess, law or
formula-- and I never like to

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.450
just memorize formulas, but
we've given this formal in the

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.030
past and it's probably one of
the top most useful formulas

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.230
in chemistry, or really all of
science-- what formula or law

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.230
deals with pressure?

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.230
They give us the volume of the
room because that's where the

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.890
pressure will be inside of.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.050
So we have pressure, the
equilibrium vapor pressure.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.620
We have a volume of a room
right over here.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.150
We know the temperature of the
room right over there.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.650
And we're trying to figure out
the number of molecules that

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.290
need to evaporate for us to
get that pressure in that

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.130
volume at that temperature.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.960
So what deals with pressure,
volume, number of molecules--

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.070
let's say in moles, so I'll
write a lower case n-- number

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.700
of molecules, and temperature?

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.170
Well, we've seen this
many, many times.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.920
It's the Ideal Gas Law.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.600
Pressure times volume is equal
to the number of moles of our

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.430
ideal gas-- in this case we're
going to use water as our

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.140
ideal gas, or vapor as our
ideal gas-- times the

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.950
universal gas constant
times temperature.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.600
And this should never seem like
some bizarre formula to

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.990
you because it really,
really makes sense.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.020
If your pressure goes up, then
that means that either the

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.660
number of molecules have gone
up, and we're assuming the

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.830
volume is constant.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.700
That means either the number
of molecules have gone up,

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.890
which makes sense-- more things
bouncing onto the side

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:51.740
of the container.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.820
Or your temperature has gone
up-- the same number of

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.480
things, but they're bumping with
higher kinetic energy.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.110
Or if your pressure stays the
same and your volume goes up,

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.230
then that also means that your
number of molecules went up,

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.370
or your temperature went up.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.760
Because you now have
a bigger container.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.270
In order to exert the same
pressure you need either more

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.070
molecules or more kinetic energy
for the molecules you

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.215
have.

00:05:12.215 --> 00:05:14.200
And you could keep playing
around with this, but I just

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.750
want to make it clear this isn't
some mysterious formula.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.810
The first time I was exposed to
this I kind of did view it

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.490
as some type of mysterious
formula.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.230
But it's just relating pressure,
volume, number of

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.980
molecules and temperature.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.320
And then this is just the
universal gas constant.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.370
So let's just get everything
into the right units here.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.585
And then what we're trying to
solve for, we want to figure

00:05:34.585 --> 00:05:36.290
out the number of molecules
of water.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.780
So we want to solve for n.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.210
And if we know the number of
moles of water, we can figure

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.320
out the number of
grams of water.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.580
And then given the density of
water we can figure out the

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.880
number of milliliters of water
we are dealing with.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.120
So let's just rewrite the Ideal
Gas Law by dividing both

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.340
sides by the universal gas
constant and temperature.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:07.245
So that you get n is equal to
pressure times volume, over

00:06:07.245 --> 00:06:10.680
the universal gas constant
times temperature.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.290
Now, the hardest thing about
this is just making sure you

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.490
have your units right and you're
using the right ideal

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.150
gas constant for the right
units, and we'll

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.310
do that right here.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:24.020
So what I want to do, because
the universal gas constant

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.960
that I have is in terms of
atmospheres, we need to figure

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.800
out this vapor pressuree- this
equilibrium pressure between

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.770
vapor and liquid-- we need to
write this down in terms of

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.040
atmospheres.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.450
So let me write this down.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:47.260
So the vapor pressure
is equal to 23.8

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.350
millimeters of mercury.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.040
And you can look it up at a
table if you don't have this

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.710
in your brain.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:06.540
One atmosphere is equivalent to
760 millimeters of mercury.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.110
So if we wanted to write
the vapor pressure as

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.580
atmospheres-- let me get my
calculator out, get the

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.690
calculator out, put it right
over there-- so it's going to

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:24.140
be 23.8 times 1 over 760,
or just divided by 760.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.210
And we have three significant
digits, so

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.920
it looks like 0.0313.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:40.110
So this is equal to 0.0313
atmospheres.

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:41.590
That is our vapor pressure.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.110
So let's just deal with
this right here.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.780
So the number of molecules of
water that are going to be in

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.900
the air in the gaseous state,
in the vapor state, is going

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.740
to be equal to our
vapor pressure.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.990
That's our equilibrium
pressure.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.240
If more water molecules
evaporate after that point,

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.140
then we're going to have a
higher pressure, which will

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.130
actually make them favor more of
them going into the liquid

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.570
state, so we'll go kind of past
the equilibrium, which is

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:07.140
not likely.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.060
Or another way to think about
it-- more water molecules are

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.455
not going to of evaporate at
a faster rate than they are

00:08:12.455 --> 00:08:15.050
going to condense beyond
that pressure.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:22.070
Anyway, the pressure here
is 0.0313 atmospheres.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:26.420
The volume here-- they told us
right over here-- so that's

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.880
the volume-- 4.25.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:35.210
4.25 times 10 to the
fourth liters.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.720
And then we want to divide that
by-- and you want to make

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.610
sure that your universal gas
constant has the right units,

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:46.370
I just looked mine up on
Wikipedia-- 0.08-- see

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.170
everything has three
significant digits.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.250
So let me just allow that more
significant digits and we'll

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:52.820
just round at the end.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:09:07.540
0.082057, and the units here
are liters atmospheres per

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:12.420
mole at kelvin.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.310
And this makes sense.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.890
This liter will cancel
out with that liter.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.330
That atmospheres cancels out
with that atmospheres.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.940
I'm about to multiply
it by temperature

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.150
right here in kelvin.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.220
We'll cancel out there.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.920
And then we'll have a 1 over
moles in the denominator.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.290
A 1 over moles in the
denominator will just be a

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.150
moles because you're going
to invert it again.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.230
So that gives us our
answer in moles.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.450
And so finally our temperature--
and you've got

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.490
to remember you've got
to do it in kelvin.

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.800
So 25 degrees Celsius-- let
me right it over here-- 25

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.160
degrees Celsius is equal to,
you just add 273 to it, so

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:52.300
this is equal to 298 kelvin.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:56.360
So times 298 kelvin.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.490
And now we just have
to calculate this.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:59.740
So let's do that.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.270
So let me clear this out.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:10.010
So we have-- let me use my
keyboard-- so 0.0313

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:21.340
atmospheres times 4.25 times
10 to the fourth.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.340
That e just means times
10 to the fourth.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.220
That's just the way that it
works on this calculator.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:39.310
And then divided by 0.082057
divided by-- actually, just to

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.100
make it clear, let me show you
that I'm dividing by this

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:47.610
whole thing, so let me insert
some parentheses right here.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.300
So in the denominator we also
are multiplying by 298.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.285
And let me close the
parentheses.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:02.270
And then we get 54.4.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:03.710
We only have three significant
digits.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:10.850
So this is equal
to 54.4 moles.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.580
And we could see this liters
cancels out with that liters.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.300
Kelvin cancels out
with kelvin.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.880
Atmospheres with atmospheres.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.880
You have a 1 over mole
in the denominator.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:24.040
So then 1 over 1 over moles
is just going to be moles.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:29.730
Now, this is going to be 54.4
moles of water vapor in the

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.580
room to have our
vapor pressure.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:36.070
If more evaporates, then more
will condense-- we will be

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.800
beyond our equilibrium.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.610
So we won't ever have more
than this amount

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:41.890
evaporate in that room.

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:47.440
So let's figure out how much
liquid water that actually is.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.550
Let me do it over here.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:59.170
So 54.4 moles-- let me write
it down-- moles of H2O.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:00.386
That's going to be in
its vapor form and

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:01.780
its going to evaporate.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.270
But let's figure out how
many grams that is.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:08.560
So what is the molar
mass of water?

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.110
Well, it's roughly 18.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:11.910
I actually figured
it out exactly.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:16.600
It's actually 18.01 if you
actually use the exact numbers

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.880
on the periodic table, at
least one that I used.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:28.120
So we could say that there's
18.01 grams of H2O for every 1

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.490
mole of H2O.

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:33.580
And obviously, you can just look
up the atomic weight of

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.470
hydrogen, which is a little
bit over 1, and the atomic

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:38.955
weight of oxygen, which is
a little bit below 16.

00:12:38.955 --> 00:12:40.250
So you have two of these.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.530
So 2 plus 16 gives you
pretty close to 18.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.990
So this right here will tell
you the grams of water that

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:51.760
can evaporate to get us to that
equilibrium pressure.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.580
So let's get the
calculator out.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:13:05.090
So we have the 54.4 times 18.01
is equal to 970-- well,

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.650
we only have three significant
digits-- so 900, if your round

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.380
this 0.7, it becomes 980.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:17.180
So this is 980 grams of H2O
needs to evaporate for us to

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.160
get to our equilibrium
pressure,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.540
to our vapor pressure.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:24.180
So let's figure out how many
milliliters of water this is.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.090
So they tell us the density
of water right here.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:33.500
0.997-- let me do this in a
darker color-- 0.997 grams per

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.920
millileter.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.370
Or another way you could view
this is for everyone 1

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:49.780
milliliter you have 0.997
grams of water

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.810
at 25 degrees Celsius.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.200
So for every milliliter-- this
is grams per milliliter-- we

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.470
want milliliters per gram
because we want this and this

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:59.600
to cancel out.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.260
So we're essentially just going
to divide 980 by 0.997.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.185
So what is that?

00:14:05.185 --> 00:14:06.860
Get the calculator out.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:16.760
So we have 980-- not cover up
our work-- divided by 0.997 is

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:21.580
equal to 980-- we'll just
round this-- 983.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:25.930
So this is equal to 983.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:29.230
This and this canceled out, or
that and that canceled out.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:32.620
So 983 milliliters of H2O.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:38.140
So we've figured out, using the
Ideal Gas Law, that at 25

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:44.090
degrees Celsius, which was 298
kelvin, that 983 milliliters

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:47.520
of H2O will evaporate
to get us to our

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.730
equilibrium vapor pressure.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:53.590
Nothing more will evaporate,
because beyond that if we have

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:57.540
higher pressure than that, then
you'll also have more

00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.930
vapor going to the
liquid state.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:01.640
Because you'll have more
stuff bouncing here.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:07.950
So if this much volume of water
evaporates, we'll have

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:11.020
the state where just as much is
evaporating as just as much

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:11.700
is condensing.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:16.350
So you will never get to a
higher pressure than that at

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.190
that temperature.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:21.320
So going back to the question,
we figured out that 983

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.990
milliliters of water
will evaporate.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:26.940
The question was is that we
placed 2 liters of water in an

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.360
open container.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.920
So we just figured out that only
983 milliliters of that--

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.200
so that's a little bit
less than a liter.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:40.460
So this is a little bit less
than 1,000 milliliters, and

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:41.960
this is 1 liter.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:47.050
So a little bit less than half
of this will evaporate for us

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:48.430
to get to our vapor pressure.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.370
So to answer our question--
will all of the water

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.390
evaporate at 25 degrees
Celsius?

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.730
No-- if we're assuming the room
is sealed-- well, no, all

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:56.870
of it will not.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.980
Only a little bit less
than half of it will.
