00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.020
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.610
So here is my public disclaimer
that will go on the video

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.000
so that no one will
judge you for having only

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.920
had one day to do this project.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.770
They will be amazed at
how much you got done.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.710
So we're going to present,
and no one's project

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.740
is completely finished,
so don't stress.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.430
This is a thing that
you had one day to do,

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.550
and you will have three days and
a weekend to do the next one.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.730
So this is just a practice
run, because next Friday you'll

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.150
have a much bigger project
and we'll invite other people.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.520
So here is about supporting
and learning from each

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.050
others' process and learning
about what things you had

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.790
success with and what
things you didn't.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.490
So if somebody was
able to implement

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.030
a lean, then afterward you go,
hey, how did you do that lean?

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.130
Can I have your scripts?

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.660
Or if somebody had
a cool gesture,

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.810
or if somebody had a nice
video game animation where

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.850
something grew and
something did something

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.710
in response to the
growth, you can ask them

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.080
how they implemented that.
