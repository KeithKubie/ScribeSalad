INTERVIEWER 1: If I told you
about a place where mud boils,

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.250
water explodes from the ground,
and bearded, horned beasts

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.860
walk across steaming red lakes.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.420
You'd think I was crazy.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.990
But I promise you,
this is a real place.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.850
The man who dared to visit this
ominous hellscape was this guy.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.570
JONO HEY: Hi, my
name is Jono Hey.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.280
I'm a designer living in London.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.227
We were actually on a
road trip at the time.

00:00:32.227 --> 00:00:36.490
[INAUDIBLE] from Nevada and
Idaho from San Francisco

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.560
to Yellowstone itself and to
the neighboring Grand Tetons.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.980
And then down through Utah,
to Bryce Canyon National

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.219
Park, Zion National Park, and
then back through Yosemite.

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.260
INTERVIEWER 1: This picture
is of Grand Prismatic

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.550
Spring in Yellowstone.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.410
And, OK, it's not the ominous
hellscape I made it out to be.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.130
Yellowstone is visited by 3 and
1/2 million people every year.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.643
And it's actually the oldest
national park in the country.

00:01:03.643 --> 00:01:05.215
JONO HEY: Grand
Prismatic Spring is

00:01:05.215 --> 00:01:08.005
one of the most beautiful
and otherworldly sites

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:08.985
on the planet.

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:12.125
It just looks spectacular,
like a giant eye.

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:15.630
It's essentially a boiling
lake with just a rainbow

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.980
of colors from all the
bacteria in it that color it.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.250
From this beautiful blue
water in the middle,

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.900
to this bright oranges
and reds on the outsides.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.140
INTERVIEWER 1: And this
shot wasn't easy to get.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.900
With outdoor photography there
are a lot of different elements

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.820
to deal with.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.729
From both the nature around
you, and your own technology.

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.770
JONO HEY: I remember when
we arrived at the site.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.400
We could see
something in the mist.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.240
These dark shapes.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.740
So you sort of
follow the boardwalk.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.260
And I remember, sort of, saw
these shadows in the mist.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.010
And we started
hurrying towards them.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.070
Yet you had this
joint feeling of like,

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.430
this is really exciting
and these are Bison,

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.050
and Bison are really scary.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.710
And I remember as we
got closer to them,

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.460
and started to try and
take some photos it

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.570
was a constant battle.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.610
There was the spring
clean-up steam all the time.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.280
And my wife was there
with a len's cloth,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.660
wiping the front of the
lens as I would take a few,

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.860
and then it would steam up.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.670
But despite all that, we
did still come away managing

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.024
to get this picture of
this incredible moment.

00:02:16.024 --> 00:02:18.190
INTERVIEWER 1: It's a picture
that perfectly sums up

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.040
why Yellowstone is so popular.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.780
Vibrant colors, the wild
animals, and the alien feel

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.560
of the landscape, makes it
one of the most unique places

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.066
on earth.

00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:29.690
JONO HEY: It was an
awesome combination

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.939
in the true sense of the word.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.020
INTERVIEWER 1: Hey guys,
if you like this video,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.920
check out this next
one on some of the most

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.980
bizarre roadside
attractions across America.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.230
INTERVIEWER 2: Attractions,
or road side distractions,

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.190
as I like to call them.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.600
I've been visiting them again
as long as I can remember,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.470
but this one is
really a highlight

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.269
because of its obscurity.

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.310
INTERVIEWER 1: Thanks for
watching and as always,

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.090
please subscribe.
