[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.960
SPEAKER: We're here today with
a very dear and old friend

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.860
of mine, Fran Hauser, whom I
met when I was working in LCS.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.320
And she was our client
while she was at "People."

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.500
So this was over a decade ago.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.560
We met at one
fateful, fun dinner.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.110
So those dinners that we
do for our clients really

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.240
do pay off in spades with
friendships to last the years.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.220
So Fran I have been
in touch while she

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.100
has been on her journey
of writing and publishing

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.600
this book.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.470
And it's really a
wonderful and candid read

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.720
on some of the experiences
that she's had personally.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.695
Experiences about women around
her, women that she's mentored.

00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:46.070
And as we can see
by the turnout,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.130
it's a very relevant
topic for most of us.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.990
So Fran is a startup investor,
a longtime media executive

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.620
and former president of digital
at Time Inc., the author

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.500
of "The Myth of the Nice
Girl: Achieving a Career You

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.440
Love Without Becoming
a Person You Hate."

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.920
She has held senior positions
at some of the world's largest

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.900
digital media businesses,
including Time Inc.'s "People,"

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.510
"InStyle," and "Entertainment,"
as well as AOL and Moviefone--

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.510
sorry, "Entertainment Weekly"
as well as AOL and Moviefone.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.870
She's now an angel investor--
so switching into the tech

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:21.800
industry--

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.900
who largely invests
in female founders,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.500
and named one of Refinery29's
six most powerful women in New

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.980
York City's tech scene and one
of Business Insider's 30 women

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.190
in venture capital
to watch in 2018.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.520
She's been featured on
CNBC, Forbes, Vogue.com, Ad

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.720
Age, and more.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.499
Please welcome Fran Hauser.

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.998
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:40.998 --> 00:01:42.402
FRAN HAUSER: Thank you.

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:43.338
Thank you.

00:01:43.338 --> 00:01:44.274
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:01:44.274 --> 00:01:45.817
FRAN HAUSER: What
an amazing turnout.

00:01:45.817 --> 00:01:46.400
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.090
FRAN HAUSER: This is incredible.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.940
SPEAKER: It's really amazing.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.815
FRAN HAUSER: So good.

00:01:48.815 --> 00:01:49.990
SPEAKER: And I think the--

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.020
like I said, I think the topic
really just impacts so many

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.310
of us.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.830
Just to quickly
kick off, I think

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.650
when I read the book
it felt like a letter

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.650
to my younger self, but still
so many things that I struggle

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.472
with day to day.

00:02:03.472 --> 00:02:04.930
And I think it's
one of those books

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.180
that if you have
it on hand there

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.645
will be chapters that will
be more relevant to you

00:02:09.645 --> 00:02:11.590
throughout certain
parts of your career

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.247
and give really practical
tips and really key takeaways.

00:02:14.247 --> 00:02:16.330
Just to keep those things
in the back of your mind

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.219
as you're going
through the situations.

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:18.760
So thank you.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.170
I can barely look
at my book anymore

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.794
because, like, all
highlighted, and dog

00:02:21.794 --> 00:02:23.110
eared, and notes on the side.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.300
Fran went to sign my book.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.300
And she was like, where?

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.430
FRAN HAUSER: Oh my god.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.950
I love it.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.360
SPEAKER: So maybe I'll
take a clean copy.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.500
FRAN HAUSER: Which, by
the way, let me just

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.840
add one thing about that.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.700
That was really my goal
with the book is I really

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.380
wanted it to be actionable.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.640
[INAUDIBLE] I worked with
at Time Inc. for years.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.290
And I think you
can vouch for this.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.160
I am an operator at heart.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.770
I execute.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.600
And it was really
important to me

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.330
that there are tips and
techniques and strategies

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.630
and things that you can actually
do, that you can incorporate

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.790
into your everyday work life.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.910
So that's the best
compliment that I can get

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.382
is that you have all of that--

00:02:59.382 --> 00:03:00.590
SPEAKER: All the notes, yeah.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.940
And just the little
catch phrases

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.574
or the little descriptors
that just stick in your mind.

00:03:06.574 --> 00:03:08.740
Even if you don't realize
it when you're reading it,

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.110
you'll catch yourself in
that moment doing the things.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.060
So we'll talk about a
few of those today that

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.920
really stuck out for me.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.020
But first, obviously,
who here has

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.630
felt like they've
either gotten feedback

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.570
or they've recounted a situation
in the back of their mind

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.880
where they felt
like being too nice

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.690
has kept them out of
an opportunity at work?

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.700
And we're all in this
room for a reason, right?

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.920
It's really something
where I think

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.050
our culture here
at Google really

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.330
wants everyone to
bring your full self

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.970
and to have the psychological
safety to share your opinions.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.997
And so with that, you
think it's kindness.

00:03:42.997 --> 00:03:44.830
But the truth is in
business, sometimes, you

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.120
feel like that could
be a liability.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.910
So in your book
you talk about how

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.660
the word nice is emotionally
loaded, particularly for women.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.140
I would love to hear how
you define being nice.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.370
FRAN HAUSER: So specifically
when it comes to work,

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.780
when I think about
a woman or a man,

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.860
actually, who's in a
professional environment,

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.970
and they're nice, I think about
somebody who is empathetic,

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.890
who's collaborative,
and who's confident

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.040
that there are enough
opportunities to go around.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.140
And I think that last
part is really important,

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.070
because that's really more of
an abundance mentality, where

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.270
it's not like, if you win,
it means that I have to lose.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.100
There's a real generosity
that comes with that.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.060
And the premise of
the book is actually

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.480
really simple, in
that if you're nice,

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.490
if you do all those
things, you're empathetic,

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.280
you're collaborative,
you're generous,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.640
what that does is
it engenders trust.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.890
And when you have
trust, that allows

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.640
you to build a relationship.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.240
And at the end of the day,
being successful in business

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.190
is all about relationships.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.440
It all comes back
to relationships.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.780
And the other big
message in the book

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.680
is that you don't have to choose
between being nice and being

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.820
tough.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.050
You can be both.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.990
And there's that duality
that I think really

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.300
runs throughout the whole book.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.090
So when I'm talking about
communication it's-- you can be

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.740
kind and direct.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.620
When you're negotiating, you
can be empathetic and strategic.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.610
So these things aren't
mutually exclusive.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.181
SPEAKER: It's a very
important point.

00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:25.180
FRAN HAUSER: Are you OK?

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.480
It's the almonds that we ate.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.320
We were so hungry.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.028
SPEAKER: We were eating
nuts before this.

00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:30.539
Everything is fine.

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.830
Well, it's interesting when
you talk about the duality.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.380
Because I did a program
in Oxford last year

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.640
where we kind of walked
around an imaginary forest.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.650
And you were holding
an imaginary stick

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.850
in this imaginary forest.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.370
And that imaginary stick
was your greatest strength.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.870
And so you walked
around the forest.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.730
You were talking with other
people in the program.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:52.940
You had your stick with you.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.439
So you're really
thinking about what

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:56.260
this greatest strength was.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.110
And then they asked you
to think about a time

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.510
when that stick had become
your greatest weakness.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.040
And how do you set that down?

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.400
So it's a really
interesting exercise.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.670
But in the book Fran
talked about empathy

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.480
being your Achilles heel.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.140
And I would love to
hear more about that.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.810
FRAN HAUSER: Well, I
over-index on empathy.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.290
And while empathy is
an incredible, I think,

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.840
trait, where it has
hurt me in the past

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.780
is when I care so much about
what other people are feeling

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.900
and thinking that it
makes it difficult

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.484
for me to make a decision.

00:06:33.484 --> 00:06:34.900
Because when you
care so much, you

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.040
want to make everybody happy.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.123
And you're getting buy-in.

00:06:37.123 --> 00:06:39.110
And you're checking
in with everyone.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.710
And that slows down the
decision making process.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:46.150
And especially working in
technology or working in media,

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.710
you need to move quickly.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.239
Time to market is everything.

00:06:50.239 --> 00:06:52.030
Whether it's-- you're
working on a product,

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.321
and you're trying to figure
out which features to leave

00:06:54.321 --> 00:06:58.320
in and which features
get scoped out.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.117
It's really important to
keep the momentum going

00:07:01.117 --> 00:07:01.950
and to move quickly.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.530
So that's where it's
actually hurt me.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.720
And I've had to make sure
that I pull back on that.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.934
And that I really be aware of
that and be cognizant of it.

00:07:12.934 --> 00:07:13.850
SPEAKER: Amen on that.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.350
Because it is-- and I think
the nuance and the line

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.557
that you're drawing here is
collaboration to a degree.

00:07:21.557 --> 00:07:23.890
At some point you've just got
to make a decision instead

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.309
of waiting for a decision
to be made for you.

00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:27.850
But it's really
challenging, I think,

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:28.980
when you're so empathetic.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.480
And you want to make sure that
everyone is feeling included,

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.470
and everyone is
along for the ride.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.470
At some point,
particularly as you

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.037
grow into leadership
positions in your career,

00:07:38.037 --> 00:07:40.120
people are looking to you
to make those decisions.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.453
And people are looking to you
to be that decisive voice.

00:07:42.453 --> 00:07:44.880
So it's been a very relevant
lesson for me recently.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.671
FRAN HAUSER: Right?

00:07:45.671 --> 00:07:47.770
And I think you definitely
want to show people

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.550
that you're listening to them,
and that you respect them,

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.050
and that you're
getting their input,

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.012
and that you're
considering their input.

00:07:55.012 --> 00:07:56.470
But then at the
end of the day, you

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:57.970
have to stand in
your own two shoes.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.900
And you have to make
that tough call.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.542
And when you inform the team
that you've made the decision,

00:08:04.542 --> 00:08:06.250
I think it's great to
say, look, I really

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.249
respect what every single
one of you had to say.

00:08:08.249 --> 00:08:10.262
And I took it into
consideration.

00:08:10.262 --> 00:08:12.470
But at the same time, we
really need to move forward.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.700
And I had to make a decision.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.616
Some of you are not going
to be happy with it.

00:08:15.616 --> 00:08:17.215
But we have to move forward.

00:08:17.215 --> 00:08:17.860
SPEAKER: And I think
what I've found--

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:18.850
FRAN HAUSER: So there is a
way-- there's a way to do it.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.425
SPEAKER: There's a
way, because actually--

00:08:20.425 --> 00:08:20.930
FRAN HAUSER: It took me
a while to figure it out.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.240
SPEAKER: --it provides relief.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.030
Even if they disagree
with the decision

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.022
or feel like it's not going
in a direction they love,

00:08:28.022 --> 00:08:29.980
there's a relief that a
decision has been made.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.990
Anyway, I literally ran
out of highlighter ink

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.890
in this chapter.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.540
Because this was, like I said,
just very relevant for me

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.039
right now.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.809
And that's kind of
what I'm talking about.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.000
There are stages of your career
were different parts of this

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.708
will be relevant.

00:08:40.708 --> 00:08:43.440
And you'll remember
them to go back to.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.250
So one of my favorite
Maya Angelou quotes

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.026
is the one where--

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:48.400
and I'm going to
slaughter this--

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.980
but when a woman stands up for
herself, unbeknownst to her

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.290
she stands up for all women.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.410
You had a great anecdote
during your time

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.089
at Moviefone when you were
the only woman in the room.

00:08:58.089 --> 00:09:00.130
And I think we can all
relate to certain meetings

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.080
where we've been the
only women in the room.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.851
Can you share that
anecdote with the room?

00:09:03.851 --> 00:09:04.600
FRAN HAUSER: Yeah.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.510
So this was probably 15
years ago at this point.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:09.440
So I was the only
woman in the room.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.980
And I was a lot younger.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.620
And we flew out.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.500
I was the general manager
of Moviefone at the time.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.350
And my team and I flew
out to LA to meet with one

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:22.090
of the big movie studios.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:24.340
And we were ushered into
this conference room.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:28.180
And we were waiting for the CEO
of the movie studio to come in.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.830
His team was there.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.050
We were just kind
of waiting for him.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.640
And he walks in.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.170
And he says hello to everybody.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.880
And then he turned to me and
asked me to get him coffee.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.670
Because he just assumed
that I was the assistant.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.639
And I just shook his hand.

00:09:44.639 --> 00:09:45.930
And I said, oh, we haven't met.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:46.820
I'm Fran Hauser.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.390
I'm the general
manager of Moviefone.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.760
And he was a personality.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.470
I mean, he really
was larger than life.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.630
And he's like, oh my
god, I'm so sorry.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.116
He just kind of used
humor to deflect it.

00:09:58.116 --> 00:09:59.740
And then he called
out to his assistant

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.840
and asked her to get him coffee.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.270
But I think it really
was an important moment.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.630
Because, look, if I was just
out of college and someone

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.887
asked me to get coffee,
I'd get the coffee.

00:10:09.887 --> 00:10:10.970
Would I be happy about it?

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:11.469
No.

00:10:11.469 --> 00:10:12.786
But I would still do it.

00:10:12.786 --> 00:10:14.410
Because you want to
be helpful, and you

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:15.880
want to show that you
have a great attitude

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.170
and you have great energy
and all that good stuff.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.700
But at that point in my career
I was running Moviefone.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:26.170
So I'm not going to go get
coffee for-- like, it's just--

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:30.010
and I think the way that I
said it, too, it was very--

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:31.557
it wasn't emotional.

00:10:31.557 --> 00:10:32.890
It was just very matter of fact.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.960
Like, oh, we haven't met.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.890
And it was fine.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.400
And I think I set a really
good example for everyone

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.300
on my team, too.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.320
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.390
So when I read this
part of the book,

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.000
what stood out to me
what you described

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.927
in writing was really--

00:10:47.927 --> 00:10:50.510
we all have those moments when
you walk away from a situation.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.240
You're like, oh, I
should have said that.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.250
I had the best comeback
or the best way

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.359
to handle that like
10 minutes later.

00:10:56.359 --> 00:10:58.150
And so you described
a little bit of that--

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.010
just like taking a
beat in that moment.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:01.510
So when there's
times where you feel

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.700
like you're being
undermined or assumptions

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.260
are being made about you--

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.350
is taking that beat about how
you present yourself versus

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:09.670
how people are perceiving you.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:11.980
And I think that really
came across to me

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.310
as something that was probably
wise beyond your years

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.070
at that stage to
have that moment.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.820
But also setting that
example for the rest

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:19.903
of the people in the room.

00:11:19.903 --> 00:11:22.360
Like, wow, that guy just
made a fool out of himself.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.710
And at least he recognized it.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:24.550
And she called him out.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.716
But I'm probably not going
to make that mistake now.

00:11:26.716 --> 00:11:30.250
So that's kind of the
paying it forward aspect.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.620
So actually speaking about
speaking up in meetings,

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:36.521
I think one thing that I
notice here at Google--

00:11:36.521 --> 00:11:38.770
and for those of you that
know me it's not a surprise.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:43.186
I'm pretty outspoken, maybe
to a fault. Too candid.

00:11:43.186 --> 00:11:44.810
But I do speak up in
a lot of meetings.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.640
And I'm always fine to
ask a question and say,

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.348
I'm not sure if you
covered this already.

00:11:48.348 --> 00:11:49.996
We're all multitasking
all the time.

00:11:49.996 --> 00:11:52.620
I'm not sure if you covered this
already, or maybe I missed it,

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.980
or there's-- and asking
questions I think a lot

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:59.030
of other people in the room
have but are worried to ask.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.940
So I know that this is a
common thing with women

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:02.990
in terms of speaking up.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:05.156
And you have a great story
early on in your career--

00:12:05.156 --> 00:12:07.190
I think it was at
Ernst &amp; Young--

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:10.022
where you kept saying,
that's interesting.

00:12:10.022 --> 00:12:12.230
Can you share a little bit
about the learnings there?

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:13.979
FRAN HAUSER: Yeah, I
mean, I was so young.

00:12:13.979 --> 00:12:15.200
I was probably 23.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.740
And Coca-Cola Enterprises
was our client.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:22.970
And we were in that office,
in the Coca-Cola offices

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.970
for months at a time, working
until 2 o'clock in the morning.

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:30.920
And there was this imposing
older man who was a VP at Coke.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.390
And I was just so
intimidated by him.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.930
And every time he
was in the room all

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:38.150
that I could muster to say
was, that's interesting.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.320
No matter what he said.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.510
I was always like,
that's interesting.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.880
Literally for probably a month.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.300
And finally, a mentor of
mine, Lou [INAUDIBLE],,

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.780
called me out after one of
the meetings and just said,

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:51.900
you have to stop this.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.450
Do you realize
what you're doing?

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:55.160
You literally just keep
saying, that's interesting.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.217
It's so not interesting
for you to be saying,

00:12:57.217 --> 00:12:58.031
that's interesting.

00:12:58.031 --> 00:12:59.930
Just say anything else.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.324
And I needed somebody--

00:13:02.324 --> 00:13:03.740
I don't know if
you guys have ever

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.200
had a moment where you
just needed somebody

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.320
to call you out on something.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.490
And when he did that, I really
made a commitment to myself.

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.110
OK, the next meeting I'm
going to say something,

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.720
even if it's short, other
than, that's interesting.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.630
And I did.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:19.610
And it was really hard.

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.140
And I was really nervous.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.550
But I did it.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:25.130
And it just made me
more comfortable.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:28.147
I felt like every time I
was in a meeting with him,

00:13:28.147 --> 00:13:29.230
I would say more and more.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:32.126
And I would start sharing my
opinions and point of view.

00:13:32.126 --> 00:13:34.250
And I ended up developing
such a great relationship

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.510
with this guy.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:39.740
And he would come by my cube and
ask for my opinion on things.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.780
And eventually, he
ended up hiring me.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:46.790
I left Ernst &amp; Young to go to
work at Coca-Cola Enterprises.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:48.120
So that was a moment.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.120
But I do see--

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.860
honestly, it's
2018, and I'm still

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:57.420
seeing in meetings that there
are a lot of women who--

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.250
they have so much to
say, but they're not

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.780
speaking up in meetings.

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.070
They're still quiet.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.010
And I see it at universities.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:07.730
I was at--

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.800
I was speaking six
months ago at a college

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.000
here in New York City,
where it was probably

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.050
150 people in the
room, mostly women.

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:18.470
And when it came time for Q&amp;A,
all the men raise their hands.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.990
And one woman raised her hand.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:22.280
They came up to me afterwards.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.497
They lined up one on
one to talk to me.

00:14:24.497 --> 00:14:26.330
And I asked the dean
of the business school,

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:27.710
is this common?

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:29.010
And he said, every single time.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.385
It doesn't matter
who's speaking.

00:14:30.385 --> 00:14:32.390
Doesn't matter if it's
a man, if it's a woman.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.640
It's always the guys
that raise their hands.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.410
And it just-- it's
shocking to me

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:40.670
that even that generation
of college students--

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.047
we're still seeing this.

00:14:43.047 --> 00:14:45.130
And by the way, there are
a lot of women that have

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:46.610
no problem at all, like you.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:47.810
Which is incredible.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:50.060
So what I say to
women like you is,

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.310
be aware of other women
that may be struggling.

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.710
And is there a way that
you can be helpful to them.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.194
I know I've been in
meetings where I will say,

00:14:57.194 --> 00:14:58.610
Sarah, you and I
were just talking

00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:59.651
about this the other day.

00:14:59.651 --> 00:15:02.690
You had such-- you had a really
great point of view on this.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:05.660
Can you share it with the group?

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.706
And if you are somebody who
struggles with it, preparing,

00:15:08.706 --> 00:15:09.830
I think, is really helpful.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.260
If you're going into a meeting,
and you have the agenda,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.960
make a commitment that you're
going to pick one thing.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.070
And you're going to talk.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:20.250
You're going to say something,
I think is really super helpful.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:24.020
I share soundbites
and stock phrases

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.450
that you can use if you're
having a hard time inserting

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.610
yourself into a conversation.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.430
Just knowing-- whether
it's building on that,

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.240
or I love that
perspective, and--

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.660
whatever that stock
phrase is for you.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.830
Sometimes the hardest
part is getting started.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.370
SPEAKER: Yeah, opening
your mouth and speaking up.

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:39.670
FRAN HAUSER: It's just
opening your mouth.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:41.625
So having that stock phrase.

00:15:41.625 --> 00:15:43.250
And then the other
thing I always say--

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.570
go back to what you
said about pausing--

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.950
is your voice needs air
to work, which means

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.660
you really have to breathe.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.240
You really have to
stop and breathe.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.910
Whether you're in a meeting,
whether you're in a one-on-one,

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.250
or whether you're
public speaking.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.780
Making sure that you're
taking the time to breathe

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.230
is a big part of it, too.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.646
SPEAKER: So one thing that
Fran is saying that I just want

00:16:05.646 --> 00:16:07.834
to make sure is coming across--

00:16:07.834 --> 00:16:09.750
throughout the book,
throughout each chapter--

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.620
so whichever chapter is
speaking to you at that project

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.410
or whatever you're doing,
is these five quick tips.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:16.910
So what she's
saying-- like, the way

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.500
to interject into
a conversation,

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.380
give yourself that
moment to get the floor

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.540
and get the attention
before you share the content

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.650
of what you're saying.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:29.072
Those types of tips
are really helpful.

00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:30.780
And they're quick
things to keep in mind.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:37.220
And I think the other thing that
should give anyone confidence

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.410
that is worried
about speaking up

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.425
is ask yourself if you've
ever been in a meeting

00:16:41.425 --> 00:16:42.800
where somebody
has said something

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.530
that you were just about to
say and didn't raise your hand.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:45.910
FRAN HAUSER: Right.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:46.190
SPEAKER: You're like--

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:46.940
FRAN HAUSER: All the time.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.530
SPEAKER: Damn, that was just
what I was going to say.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.060
So your ideas are valid.

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.839
Your contributions are needed.

00:16:51.839 --> 00:16:53.630
There's no reason that
somebody else should

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:54.880
have to validate that for you.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.900
But give yourself
that confidence.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.570
Use these tips to get the floor.

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:01.310
And then if you're
in a meeting where

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:02.851
you notice you're
trying to speak up,

00:17:02.851 --> 00:17:05.450
and you don't have the space
to do that, find an ally.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:07.430
Find somebody that can help you
to speak up in that next space.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:08.930
FRAN HAUSER: And take up space.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.390
I share a story in the book
where I was at a board meeting.

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:12.859
I was at a nonprofit
board meeting.

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:16.630
And this guy who I have
so much respect for,

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.290
he has a very loud voice.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:19.640
He's very boisterous.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.752
And he had the floor.

00:17:20.752 --> 00:17:22.460
And I literally just
felt like I couldn't

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.780
get a word in edgewise.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:27.349
And I just decided that I was
going to stand in that moment.

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:28.920
And I just walked
behind the chair

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:32.720
and just draped my
arms over the chair.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.450
And it forced everybody
to look at me.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.100
And it gave me the floor.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.350
So I think the other thing
is, you guys may have heard

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.540
there's that stat that's--

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:45.830
when you're communicating,
that 7% of the effectiveness

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:49.460
is verbal and 93% is nonverbal.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.030
Really think about that.

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.780
7% is the words that
you're using, the content.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.600
93% is everything else.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.830
It's your eye contact.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:59.260
It's, are you smiling?

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.950
Are you taking up space?

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:02.390
Or are you closed up?

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.400
It's all of that.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.420
So that's another thing to keep
in mind, too, the nonverbal.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.503
SPEAKER: And when we think
about-- here at Google,

00:18:09.503 --> 00:18:11.974
we've just gone through
our annual review cycle.

00:18:11.974 --> 00:18:14.390
Just to switch gears here,
because you give a lovely shout

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.160
out-- and I don't know if
anybody in the room worked

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.030
on this--

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:21.260
to a Gmail plug-in
of Just Not Sorry.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.200
So it's basically a plug-in
that will scan your emails

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.120
to find out if there's
times that you're

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.347
apologizing excessively
that you shouldn't be.

00:18:28.347 --> 00:18:29.430
FRAN HAUSER: It's amazing.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.150
SPEAKER: And I can't tell you
how many times I want to share

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.710
with people--

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:37.550
I had a woman email me from
the West Coast two weeks ago.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:40.520
And I had emailed her
something at 10:00 AM.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.560
And she wrote back to me and
said, sorry for the delay.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.510
It's 7:00 AM her time.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.469
I'm like, there
is no delay here.

00:18:46.469 --> 00:18:48.260
You should be brushing
your teeth right now

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.580
instead of answering my email.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.380
So those little things.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.690
Can you share-- you
had some specific tips

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:55.917
about how you trained
yourself to stop saying sorry.

00:18:55.917 --> 00:18:57.500
FRAN HAUSER: Well,
so a friend of mine

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.680
actually called me out on
this at work years ago.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.072
And she said, you
apologize all the time.

00:19:03.072 --> 00:19:04.780
And I didn't realize
that I was doing it.

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:05.821
And I didn't believe her.

00:19:05.821 --> 00:19:08.180
So I actually went
into my inbox.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:11.110
And I typed the word sorry
into the search field.

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:14.420
And literally hundreds
of emails returned.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.250
And I started reading them.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:19.160
And what I found was
exactly what you just said.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:23.180
Literally, it took me four
hours to respond to someone.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:26.120
And my response was
so sorry it took me

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.420
so long to get back to you.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.240
It had been four hours.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.960
And when you apologize
for such trivial things,

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.630
it puts you in a weak position.

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:37.100
There's no reason to apologize.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.654
If you hurt somebody, of
course you should apologize.

00:19:39.654 --> 00:19:41.570
If you do something that
really hurts someone.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:42.500
But for something like that--

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.170
SPEAKER: If you ignore the email
for five days, fair enough.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.000
FRAN HAUSER: Right.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.090
I mean, but so
that's what I found.

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:50.870
So that's when I downloaded
the Gmail plug-in.

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:55.172
And it's brilliant, because
it basically scans your email.

00:19:55.172 --> 00:19:56.630
And if you're using
the word sorry,

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.014
it just flags it for you.

00:19:58.014 --> 00:19:59.680
I don't have to do
it anymore, because I

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.500
feel like now I'm pretty good.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.340
SPEAKER: You've trained, yeah.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.300
FRAN HAUSER: I've
trained myself.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.133
But in the beginning,
it was really helpful.

00:20:04.133 --> 00:20:07.380
And just rereading your emails,
I think really important.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:12.480
I also found that if I replaced
I'm sorry with thank you,

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.480
that that typically works.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.540
So it's more like, thank
you for the opportunity,

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.227
as opposed to, I'm so
sorry that I can't do it.

00:20:20.227 --> 00:20:21.060
SPEAKER: Oh, got it.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.230
So when people are
asking you things--

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:24.730
FRAN HAUSER: It's
just reframing it.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:28.370
It's like being thankful
as opposed to leading with,

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.080
I'm sorry.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.970
So I think that's really helped.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:33.620
Having an accountability buddy.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.775
Having somebody like my friend
who called me out on this.

00:20:36.775 --> 00:20:38.900
I basically just asked her,
if you see me doing it,

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:39.980
just let me know.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.120
So that's always helpful.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.280
But so much research
has been done

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:48.534
on this, that women do
apologize a lot more than men.

00:20:48.534 --> 00:20:50.450
Probably has to have
something to do with when

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:53.349
we were younger, I'm thinking.

00:20:53.349 --> 00:20:54.890
But it is something
that we just have

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:56.720
to be really, really aware of.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:00.680
SPEAKER: So we're going to
open it up to some questions.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.180
If anybody has any
questions, please

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.180
feel free to walk up to the mic.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:08.330
In the meantime, I will continue
to ask you another question

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:09.930
while folks are coming up.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:11.920
It can't be just the
men, just so you know.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.787
So I loved-- and this
is actually, again,

00:21:16.787 --> 00:21:19.370
pretty pertinent to now, given
we're going through performance

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:20.750
review cycles.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:24.230
But you talk about the anecdotes
around difficult conversations

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.930
and how you respond
assertively yet nicely.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:28.490
Can you share some
of your strategies

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:29.920
to deliver tough messages?

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.565
FRAN HAUSER: Yeah, so one of
the pieces of research that we

00:21:33.565 --> 00:21:34.940
did when we were
writing the book

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:40.350
was around the amygdala in
your brain and how it works.

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:42.470
And the fact that
it basically-- it's

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:48.410
looking for threats, physical
threats, psychological threats.

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:50.090
And what happens is
when you're feeling

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:53.930
threatened you go into either
fight, flight, or freeze, which

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:55.740
is very unproductive.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.430
So that was really important
to me when I read that.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:00.410
Because what that
made me realize

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:03.200
is when you're giving a
performance review, if you

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.780
start the review
with, look, we have

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.700
some stuff we need
to talk about,

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:11.060
that automatically is a
threat to the other person.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.550
And you're going to have a
very unproductive conversation.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:18.110
Versus starting it out with, I'm
your biggest fan and champion.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:19.860
And I want to see you succeed.

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.782
I'm here with you.

00:22:21.782 --> 00:22:23.990
And I have some things that
I want to share with you.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.750
It's all about how you start
the conversation, I think,

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:28.260
is so important.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.720
The other thing I would say--

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.370
and I wrote a blog post for
Forbes about this like 2

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:36.200
and 1/2 years ago-- is the
power of questioning, asking

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.060
questions.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.070
And having the
person sort of come

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:42.620
to the conclusion on their own
in terms of what they really

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:43.970
need to work on.

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:47.150
And here is a very
specific example.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:49.820
If you ask, what do you
think could have been done

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.290
differently, as
opposed to, what do

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:53.930
you think you could
have done differently,

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.520
it makes it so much
more objective.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.700
It's not like a personal attack.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:02.180
But when something goes wrong, a
product doesn't launch on time,

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.182
it goes over budget,
whatever it is,

00:23:04.182 --> 00:23:06.140
I think framing it that
way-- what do you think

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.970
could have been
done differently?

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:12.530
Again, it puts the
person in a safe place.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:15.090
So I think that's
always helpful, too.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:17.159
And sharing larger context.

00:23:17.159 --> 00:23:18.950
If you're giving somebody
advice about what

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:22.370
they need to work
on, in the context

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:27.569
of the company's mission or
goals, how does that fit in?

00:23:27.569 --> 00:23:29.360
Because I do think
that's really important.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.115
Aligning it and
tying it back to what

00:23:31.115 --> 00:23:34.502
the larger mission of your
department or the company is

00:23:34.502 --> 00:23:35.460
is also really helpful.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.180
SPEAKER: Just takes that
personal attack feeling out

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:38.680
of it.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.388
FRAN HAUSER: But really
making the person

00:23:40.388 --> 00:23:43.060
feel like, I really
want you to succeed.

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:47.390
I'm here for you,
goes such a long way.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:48.439
But then being direct.

00:23:48.439 --> 00:23:50.980
SPEAKER: I'm like, I'll take
any feedback you have right now.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:51.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:53.080
How am I doing in this Q and A?

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.496
FRAN HAUSER: You're
doing amazing.

00:23:54.496 --> 00:23:56.180
You really are.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.190
But at the same time
also, when you do

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:02.330
have to give that feedback,
being clear and specific

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:04.070
about what the person
needs to work on.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:07.430
Because I have had
managers who are

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:10.520
a little bit more kind of
touchy feely, warm and fuzzy,

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.350
who were trying to
give me feedback.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:13.820
But I'm not really
understanding--

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:14.390
SPEAKER: What
they're saying, yes.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:15.806
FRAN HAUSER: What
do I need to do?

00:24:15.806 --> 00:24:17.360
Be really constructive.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.080
So it's sort of--
again, it's that dance.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.110
It's that balance
of being really kind

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:24.940
and caring but being
specific and direct.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.570
SPEAKER: Yeah, and if you feel
like you're not getting that,

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:28.320
ask for it.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.570
FRAN HAUSER: Yeah, definitely.

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:30.189
Definitely.

00:24:30.189 --> 00:24:32.230
SPEAKER: Let's take a
question from the audience.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:33.189
Thanks for stepping up.

00:24:33.189 --> 00:24:34.021
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:34.021 --> 00:24:35.302
Thank you for being here.

00:24:35.302 --> 00:24:37.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.410
So I'm actually an
executive assistant here.

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:41.270
And something we deal
with all the time

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.850
is something that you mentioned.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:47.180
People having the
connotation that when they're

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.431
assumed they're an admin,
it's a negative thing, which

00:24:49.431 --> 00:24:50.638
is really frustrating for us.

00:24:50.638 --> 00:24:52.250
And there's a lot
of admins in here.

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:53.210
I see you all.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.565
And I'm sure you agree with
me, especially since it's

00:24:55.565 --> 00:24:57.260
a very gendered role.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.180
It's mostly women,
especially at Google.

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:03.830
And we hear all the time, they
thought I was the assistant.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:07.350
And that's insulting to
us, as you can imagine.

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:11.610
And then a question kind of
based on that is, in my role,

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:12.110
especially--

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:13.460
I'll only speak for myself--

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.670
I feel like I'm often having
to be on the defensive.

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.500
Because since I'm
not an executive

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:23.820
like Bethany or my VP, people
try and take advantage of me.

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:27.740
And when I do push back,
the feedback I always get

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.570
is to be nicer.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:30.357
But it's hard.

00:25:30.357 --> 00:25:31.940
And so I'm just
curious your thoughts.

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:34.087
I mean, you weren't always
an executive, obviously.

00:25:34.087 --> 00:25:35.170
Neither were you, Bethany.

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:39.350
And so how do women,
especially in roles

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:45.260
that are deemed unworthy,
as I dare say, be nice

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.670
but still push back?

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:48.680
Because it's frustrating
how it's like--

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.316
have a voice.

00:25:49.316 --> 00:25:50.690
And then we're
like, but be nice.

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:51.898
You're supposed to be cheery.

00:25:51.898 --> 00:25:52.740
Blah, blah, blah.

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.309
FRAN HAUSER: Well,
I have to say I--

00:25:54.309 --> 00:25:55.100
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:58.920
FRAN HAUSER: Thank you,
that's such a great question.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.600
I always give advice to
women, especially if they're

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.300
coming out of college when
they're a little confused

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:06.530
about what they want to do.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.405
They feel like they want
to work in business,

00:26:08.405 --> 00:26:11.180
but they don't know exactly
what function or department.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.890
I always say being an
assistant is amazing.

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:17.330
It's such an
incredible way to get

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:21.050
to know all the different
aspects of a company.

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:24.200
I mean, I think about when I was
at Time Inc. Sonam, you know.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.750
With my assistants, they usually
worked with me for a year.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:30.170
And it was my goal for
them that they got exposure

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:32.930
and that they would figure
out what they wanted to do.

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:38.840
So for me, I think
it's an incredible--

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:43.084
I think it's an incredible
opportunity, truthfully.

00:26:43.084 --> 00:26:44.750
Because I think about
how I started out.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.220
I started out in finance.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.830
And I felt like I was so--

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:50.990
it was so narrow.

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.957
I couldn't move.

00:26:51.957 --> 00:26:53.415
If I wanted to move
into marketing,

00:26:53.415 --> 00:26:55.236
like when I was at Coca-Cola--

00:26:55.236 --> 00:26:56.360
that's not going to happen.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.130
I was in finance.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:57.797
I couldn't move.

00:26:57.797 --> 00:26:59.338
I feel like when
you're an assistant,

00:26:59.338 --> 00:27:00.620
you have so much opportunity.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.540
You could go wherever
you want to go.

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:06.320
So I think it's
an amazing thing.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:10.520
I do hear you in terms of
the tension between pushing

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.720
back and being nice.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:17.000
And I think that when you
are an assistant, especially

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.680
for your boss, for your
manager, you are there in a way

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.440
to make their lives easier.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:29.367
So that is sort of-- that
kind of comes with the job.

00:27:29.367 --> 00:27:31.700
But at the same time, I feel
like you should be helpful,

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.320
but you should never
be subservient.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.240
If you feel like
you're being asked

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.900
to do something that
truly is subservient,

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.374
I think you do have
to bring it up.

00:27:40.374 --> 00:27:42.290
I think you do have to
have that conversation.

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:43.910
I talk about in the book--

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:44.910
there was a young woman.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:46.100
She was a graphic designer.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.334
And she was really--

00:27:47.334 --> 00:27:49.250
she felt like she was
being asked to do things

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:50.800
that she shouldn't be doing.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:51.800
And I sat down with her.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.810
We went through the
whole list of everything

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:55.082
that she was annoyed about.

00:27:55.082 --> 00:27:56.540
And there were
certain things where

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:57.410
I felt like, you know what?

00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:58.701
You kind of do have to do that.

00:27:58.701 --> 00:27:59.720
She was making copies.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.820
This was 15 years ago.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.570
She was making copies
for the design team.

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:04.778
I'm like, you are the most
junior person on the team.

00:28:04.778 --> 00:28:07.530
I had to do that when I was the
most junior person on the team.

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:10.340
But then she was being asked
to get coffee and snacks

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:12.950
for the whole team
every single afternoon.

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:14.280
That's not appropriate.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.470
To me, that's not--

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:18.020
that falls into the
subservient category.

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:19.250
And I think there's a way--

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:22.190
I encouraged her to have the
conversation with her boss

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:24.950
which was, this is really
distracting for me.

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:26.395
I'm trying to get my work done.

00:28:26.395 --> 00:28:27.770
And then I have
to stop because I

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:29.870
have to get everybody's order.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:33.110
Could we create a sign-up
sheet and different people

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:35.990
can volunteer to do
it on different days?

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:39.140
What I like about that
is she's actually--

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.530
she recommended a
solution to it as

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:46.250
opposed to just going and
saying, this is bothering me.

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:48.140
It's like, it's
bothering me because it's

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.910
making me really unproductive.

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:52.020
And here's what I think
we should do about it.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:55.640
But I do think you have to
bring things up like that.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.884
My first year out of college
I probably got coffee

00:28:58.884 --> 00:29:00.050
every single day for people.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:01.342
And I didn't know.

00:29:01.342 --> 00:29:02.050
I didn't mind it.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:04.250
Because I felt like I was--

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.530
at that point, I was so new.

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:07.572
I was just learning.

00:29:07.572 --> 00:29:09.780
And I just wanted to build
relationships with people.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.990
And I did feel like
anything that I

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:15.150
could do to be hopeful
would be a good thing,

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:18.922
especially at that moment
in my career and my life.

00:29:18.922 --> 00:29:20.630
And it goes back to
what you were saying.

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:23.264
You go through these
transitions in your career.

00:29:23.264 --> 00:29:25.430
And you just kind of have
to know what's appropriate

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:26.555
and what's not appropriate.

00:29:26.555 --> 00:29:27.470
Where do I push back?

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.642
Where do I kind of just do it?

00:29:30.642 --> 00:29:32.850
SPEAKER: And I think there's
some helpful tips that--

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:34.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
thank you so much.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:35.028
FRAN HAUSER: Thank you.

00:29:35.028 --> 00:29:36.926
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:29:36.926 --> 00:29:39.920
AUDIENCE: Thanks so
much for being here.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.260
So you talked about getting
the floor in a meeting.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.134
You talked about how
you stood behind a chair

00:29:44.134 --> 00:29:45.380
and people had the attention.

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.150
But I find at Google
the hard thing

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:51.230
is keeping the floor, especially
in an engineering space.

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:52.590
People are very task-oriented.

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:54.970
They're very decision forward.

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:56.250
And it can be hard.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:58.160
I find women in
particular get cut off

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.005
a lot if they're kind of taking
their time like you suggested.

00:30:01.005 --> 00:30:03.130
Breathing and thinking
through what they're saying.

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:03.920
They're just going
to get cut off,

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.880
because they're not getting
their point fast enough.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.789
And someone else will
just make it for them.

00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:09.330
And I find myself
doing this as well.

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:13.320
So how do you keep the floor
in an engineering meeting?

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.684
FRAN HAUSER: Oh, gosh.

00:30:14.684 --> 00:30:15.608
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:15.608 --> 00:30:17.450
That's a great question.

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:20.810
I think that-- so I
can tell you when--

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:23.450
in my career when
I've gotten cut off.

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:26.790
And there have been
many, many, many moments.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:29.150
I will usually say, excuse
me, I'm not finished.

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:30.170
And I do.

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:32.065
I mean, again, you could
say-- you don't have

00:30:32.065 --> 00:30:33.350
to come across like a jerk.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:35.266
But you just say, excuse
me, I'm not finished.

00:30:35.266 --> 00:30:37.520
And keep talking.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.190
And sometimes that works.

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:41.840
I feel like if
you have something

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.400
really important to say
then you should say it.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:50.320
And you shouldn't be afraid to
cut that person off and just

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.910
say, excuse me, I'm
not done, and continue.

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:54.740
I also wonder going
into these meetings

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:57.680
if you have a
sense of what it is

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.390
that you want to communicate.

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:01.730
If there is a way to even
practice ahead of time

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:06.290
and get a little bit more sound
bitey, if that makes sense,

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:09.290
if you know that that's the
culture and that's the dynamic,

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:11.540
that things are
moving really fast.

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.040
If there is an
opportunity for you

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.482
to prepare what you want to
say and to do it in a way

00:31:16.482 --> 00:31:18.440
where you get your point
across really quickly,

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.760
that's another thought.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.205
It's just practice.

00:31:22.205 --> 00:31:23.080
Practice and prepare.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:28.080
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.090
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:30.640
Huge fan of your VC portfolio.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.522
I was just at the [INAUDIBLE]
this past weekend actually.

00:31:34.522 --> 00:31:35.480
FRAN HAUSER: Thank you.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.170
AUDIENCE: So you talk
about being nice.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:42.210
And I share the same values in
terms of empathy, especially

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:47.497
engendering that within female
peers, peer groups and whatnot.

00:31:47.497 --> 00:31:49.330
Before coming to Google,
I worked in finance

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:51.850
for a number of years as well
as tech, which are quite male

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:53.050
dominated industries.

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:55.150
And not everyone
valued being nice,

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:58.660
rather expediency
and effectiveness.

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.350
And nice was kind of
an ancillary term.

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:03.760
And so I was wondering what
your experiences were when

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.720
not everyone valued being nice.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.220
And it wasn't
quite so important.

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.800
And how you sort of combated
that being someone who

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.070
has a bit of a bleeding
heart and is more empathetic.

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:17.080
FRAN HAUSER: Yeah,
I think-- so for me,

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.170
it's really been always
about over delivering.

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:24.790
And whatever our goals were,
whatever our metrics were,

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:27.010
whether it was a revenue
number that we needed to hit

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:31.630
or monthly unique visitors,
I think the culture

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:34.510
that I always try to
establish with my team is

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:36.140
that we're going to deliver.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:39.400
But we're going to do it in a
way that we feel good about.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.850
So I never really--

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:45.430
it's not that I was
leading with the nice.

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:47.370
I was leading with,
we're going to deliver.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:50.110
We're going to have some really
great results for the company.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:52.404
But we are going to feel
great about the way we do it.

00:32:52.404 --> 00:32:53.570
It's not just about winning.

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:55.580
It's about how you win.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:58.660
And I think that when you
do both of those things

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:01.930
that you establish your
reputation for yourself

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:06.280
as somebody who can lead a
team to deliver great results,

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:08.020
but can also do
it in a way where

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:11.000
she's building relationships.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.240
So I think it's a nuance.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.854
But I do think it's
really important.

00:33:14.854 --> 00:33:16.270
Because at the end
of the day, you

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:17.729
do have to deliver
for the company.

00:33:17.729 --> 00:33:18.228
Right?

00:33:18.228 --> 00:33:18.940
Like, that's--

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:24.610
AUDIENCE: If I may, so when your
teams would come into contact

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:28.060
with, say, other
senior managers who

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:31.540
didn't have the same
exact approach or finesse,

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:34.870
would you broach that topic in
terms of what kind of culture

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:37.180
we're breeding here
in this organization?

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:38.530
Or is that something that--

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:40.510
you're like, I'm doing
this within my team.

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:41.260
FRAN HAUSER: Yeah.

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.040
AUDIENCE: And I'm
sort of preaching

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.060
these values to the folks
that I'm working with.

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.464
So I'm going to let it
go with these other folks

00:33:46.464 --> 00:33:47.380
that I'm not managing.

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:48.760
FRAN HAUSER: Well,
it's so funny.

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.514
I was just with a
woman who I used

00:33:51.514 --> 00:33:53.930
to work with at Time Inc. who
I hadn't seen in five years.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:55.860
I had lunch with her yesterday.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.510
And she brought
up a story of when

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:05.290
we got this incredible-- when
we were at People magazine.

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:07.810
We were being compared a
lot to Sports Illustrated.

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:11.409
Because they were really the
first brand at Time Inc. to go

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:12.678
digital in a big way.

00:34:12.678 --> 00:34:14.469
So we were constantly
being compared to SI.

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:15.750
SPEAKER: That's when we
were working together.

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:18.125
FRAN HAUSER: That's when we
were working together, right.

00:34:18.125 --> 00:34:20.811
And they had their way
of doing-- that team

00:34:20.811 --> 00:34:22.060
had their way of doing things.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.980
And we had our way
of doing things.

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:28.210
And there was a big
meeting that we were going

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:30.639
to be having with the CEO.

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:32.650
Because there was
some pressure for us

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:35.350
to be doing things the way
that they were doing it.

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:38.080
And Karen, who I had
lunch with yesterday,

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.110
she recalled how much time,
and effort, and energy we

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:43.100
put into preparing
for that meeting.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.880
But we went into it not from
a place of defensiveness,

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.800
but from a place of--

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.690
we feel really great
about our approach.

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:53.590
And there was no emotion.

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:54.940
But we were just--

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:55.960
it was our way.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.810
And we ended up
convincing the CEO

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:04.090
that it was a good approach.

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:05.680
And I'm like, that
was so interesting.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.510
Because I'd totally
forgot about that.

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:11.920
But it was one of many examples
where departments, teams

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.660
can have different approaches.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.780
But for us, I always
instilled that.

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:18.256
I always instilled
that in my team.

00:35:18.256 --> 00:35:19.130
That was the culture.

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:21.370
Sonam knows, because she
was part of the team.

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:23.590
It was just really
important to me.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:27.340
And I tried as much as
possible with my peers

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.650
to have that kind
of culture permeate

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:31.699
into other parts of the company.

00:35:31.699 --> 00:35:34.240
And I would say Time Inc. was
a pretty great culture overall.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.150
Five minutes.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:36.494
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:35:36.494 --> 00:35:38.410
SPEAKER: One other thing
that I will say, too,

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:40.750
that is shared in this book and
also a different book that I

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:41.250
read.

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:43.720
But if you're struggling
with things, too, sometimes

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.300
just approaching somebody that
is that friction point for you

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:48.940
and just saying, hey, I'm
really struggling with this.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:51.829
And then helps you
launch into that.

00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:53.370
It doesn't get them
on the defensive.

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:55.270
It's about kind of
providing that feedback.

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:56.769
FRAN HAUSER: Harvard
Business Review

00:35:56.769 --> 00:36:02.360
did this great piece of research
around warmth and confidence,

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:02.930
which is--

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:05.620
you guys should look it up
if you're not aware of it.

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.900
Because basically
what it concluded

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:12.640
is that you are going to
evaluate someone first

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.100
based on warmth, and
second based on confidence.

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:18.420
And that actually goes
exactly to what you're saying

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.920
and to what you're saying.

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.600
So is this person-- can
I trust this person?

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.910
It's first, can I trust them?

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:26.650
And then, can I respect them?

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:29.820
But the first part is
the warmth and the trust.

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:32.408
And it's the way
that you project.

00:36:32.408 --> 00:36:34.366
AUDIENCE: Project that
into meetings and stuff.

00:36:34.366 --> 00:36:35.220
FRAN HAUSER: Yeah.

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.261
AUDIENCE: Thank you guys.

00:36:36.261 --> 00:36:38.620
AUDIENCE: So I'm working
on warmth and confidence.

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:39.120
SPEAKER: OK.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.720
This will be the last question.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:41.267
OK.

00:36:41.267 --> 00:36:42.350
AUDIENCE: What can men do?

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:45.860
So I just want to lead with
a little bit of a concern

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:46.615
that I have.

00:36:46.615 --> 00:36:49.270
I think men sometimes want to
help or often want to help.

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:51.100
And they're confused
about what to do.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.600
And one example I've seen of
something that's not productive

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:57.680
is mutual public shaming,
where, at least man to man,

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:01.360
there is a certain amount of
unjustified public shaming.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.940
And then that can, I think--

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:05.800
I've thought, like, OK, if I
was a woman, how would I feel?

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.190
And I think sometimes it could
feel like fake chivalry almost,

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:10.150
where--

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:12.620
not the thing, like, hey,
let this person finish.

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:15.340
But cases where they're--

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:18.580
it basically can amount to
sort of muted public shaming

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:19.540
between men.

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.340
It doesn't feel
productive to me.

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.780
So what can men do?

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:23.530
FRAN HAUSER: Yeah.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:26.830
I think one thing
that I really believe

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:30.370
in is I would love
for men to have

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:33.160
an appreciation for
different leadership styles

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:38.380
and just really
understanding that women may

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.570
bring different traits to work.

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:42.070
Because that's one
of the things I'm

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:44.320
encouraging is bring
your whole self to work.

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.510
Don't check qualities
like kindness and empathy

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:48.610
at the door when you go to work.

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:50.930
And I've just had way too
many women in my life--

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:52.390
especially younger women--

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:54.280
say to me that
they work for men.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:57.610
And that their male manager has
said to them, you're too nice.

00:37:57.610 --> 00:38:00.130
You need to be tougher.

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:02.830
So there's nothing
constructive in that.

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:06.099
It's like, if you want to give
constructive feedback, great.

00:38:06.099 --> 00:38:08.140
If you want to say, you're
spending too much time

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.710
getting buy-in, and you need
to get to decisions quicker,

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:12.210
I can do something with that.

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:16.330
But saying, you're too nice,
is not really constructive.

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:18.160
So I think just
having an appreciation

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:22.570
that there are different
types of leadership styles

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:23.680
that can work.

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.720
I think just being
really open to that,

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.437
is something that I'm asking men
to do as a result of this book.

00:38:29.437 --> 00:38:31.270
SPEAKER: And I think
one thing that you just

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:34.120
said is exactly what
you should be doing.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.850
If I was a woman, how
would this make me feel?

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:39.160
And that awareness
and your willingness

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.130
to come to a place
like this, and listen

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:45.580
to what's being told, and
ask a question like that--

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:46.450
you're aware.

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:47.920
And so the more
you're in meetings,

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.140
and you see these types of
activities or the things

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.514
that you've heard
your peers tell

00:38:51.514 --> 00:38:53.770
you is really frustrating
to them, the more you're

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:57.940
able to identify your own
behaviors that may be seen

00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:01.540
as this odd chivalry, or one
upmanship, or whatever it is

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:03.319
and kind of catch
yourselves of--

00:39:03.319 --> 00:39:04.360
guys, is this productive?

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.430
Or is this just the way we've
been talking to each other?

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:09.100
And could this be a really
toxic environment for somebody

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:10.750
to come in and try
to contribute ideas,

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:12.875
because they feel like
they're going to be berated?

00:39:12.875 --> 00:39:15.070
Maybe that's comfortable
for us one-on-one,

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:18.650
but in a group environment that
could be a lot of toxicity.

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:21.490
So having that conversation
with your peers

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:22.635
or when you see that--

00:39:22.635 --> 00:39:24.760
is there a more constructive
way we could be having

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.320
this conversation right now?

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.230
And being aware.

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:30.610
But I think you're already
sounds like 80% of the way

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:33.280
there in that you're
internalizing some of this as,

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.280
how would this feel to me if
I were in different shoes?

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.430
I think that's really
the crux of inclusion.

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:41.290
So thank you.

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:43.690
So one last question
before we let Fran go.

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:45.520
Or really a comment.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.550
Fran is a phenomenal networker.

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:50.620
And I know that
that is something

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:53.470
that for-- when I say
the word, I'm like, ugh,

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:56.410
I hate networking.

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:58.480
And we were just having
this conversation.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.480
It's really just talking to
people, which I actually love.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:04.870
So I feel like it's
one of those things

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:07.450
that your network becomes
so valuable to you.

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:09.305
And she's got some
great tips in the book.

00:40:09.305 --> 00:40:10.180
So please do read it.

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:11.638
It's the final
chapter in the book.

00:40:11.638 --> 00:40:14.291
But can you share some quick
takeaways on your views?

00:40:14.291 --> 00:40:15.790
FRAN HAUSER: Well,
I think it's just

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:18.250
really being intentional about
it, making it a priority,

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:20.860
making sure that you set
time on your calendar,

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:22.240
whether it's once
or twice a week

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.540
to meet with somebody either
in a different department

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:27.430
or outside of Google.

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:30.040
I know that if I hadn't built
the network that I built,

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.860
I wouldn't have been able to
make this transition from media

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:35.110
to investing.

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:38.890
And I also feel like not being
parasitic, but being helpful

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:40.910
to the other person
when you're networking.

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:44.530
This young woman sent me a
note totally cold on LinkedIn

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:45.490
that I loved.

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:49.240
She said I'd love to get
30 minutes of your time

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.620
over coffee.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:53.740
And I see that there are two
companies in your portfolio

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:57.430
that I think I can give you some
social media strategies for.

00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:59.290
And to me, that was amazing.

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.251
OK, she's going to be
helpful to me, too.

00:41:01.251 --> 00:41:01.750
Right?

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:05.604
It's not that she's just
asking for me to pick my brain.

00:41:05.604 --> 00:41:07.020
SPEAKER: You
highlight that, yeah.

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:08.200
FRAN HAUSER: But
it's, how can you

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.460
be helpful to the other person?

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:10.959
SPEAKER: And it's
that quid pro quo.

00:41:10.959 --> 00:41:14.870
And it's not that you're sitting
there talking to somebody

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:16.120
like, what can I get from you?

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.950
And what do I have to
give you to get it?

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:19.990
That's not what
this is all about.

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:22.715
But if we're not out
there to help one another,

00:41:22.715 --> 00:41:23.590
we're all in trouble.

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:25.912
So with that, thank you
so much, Fran, for coming.

00:41:25.912 --> 00:41:26.870
FRAN HAUSER: Thank you.

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:28.070
It was amazing, thank you.

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:34.420
[APPLAUSE]
