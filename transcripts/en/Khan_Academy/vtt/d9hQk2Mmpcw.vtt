00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.223
- [Voiceover] This is Sal
here, and I'm with Kim Kutz,

00:00:02.223 --> 00:00:05.079
who is Khan Academy's American
History Content Fellow,

00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:07.273
and what I'm curious about is...

00:00:08.555 --> 00:00:10.900
In school, you learn about the Civil War,

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.969
you learn about slavery, that slavery was

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.712
a cause of the Civil War,
but at least for myself,

00:00:17.712 --> 00:00:19.732
I never got a full context of what were

00:00:19.732 --> 00:00:21.854
all the dynamics that
led to the Civil War?

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:23.990
Was it just something
that happened overnight?

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.137
- [Kim] Oh, defnitely not.

00:00:25.137 --> 00:00:27.876
You know, I think the
seeds of the Civil War

00:00:27.876 --> 00:00:31.786
were really with the United
States at its creation.

00:00:31.786 --> 00:00:34.967
I think there's sort of
an essential contradiction

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:36.987
in the United States as it's born.

00:00:36.987 --> 00:00:40.284
We're this country where
all men are created equal,

00:00:40.284 --> 00:00:42.978
except that most of
the states in the South

00:00:42.978 --> 00:00:44.765
have slavery, where people are clearly

00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:48.132
not created equal, so they couldn't win

00:00:48.132 --> 00:00:51.940
the Revolutionary War without
including those states

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.635
and kind of giving them what they wanted

00:00:53.635 --> 00:00:57.772
in retaining slavery,
but it means that the US

00:00:57.772 --> 00:01:02.345
is born with both free
states and slave states,

00:01:02.345 --> 00:01:06.292
and they're gonna continue
to try to figure out

00:01:06.292 --> 00:01:09.125
how to balance those for
the rest of the 1800s.

00:01:09.125 --> 00:01:10.348
- [Sal] We have this map here.

00:01:10.348 --> 00:01:13.635
This map is a later
period, but it shows...

00:01:14.477 --> 00:01:16.481
This is actually closer to the Civil War,

00:01:16.481 --> 00:01:18.674
but if we even look at
the original 13 colonies,

00:01:18.674 --> 00:01:20.276
you can see which ones were free states

00:01:20.276 --> 00:01:23.178
and which ones were slave states,

00:01:23.178 --> 00:01:24.622
and then you obviously
have these other states

00:01:24.622 --> 00:01:26.788
that come in later,
which we'll talk about.

00:01:26.788 --> 00:01:29.497
What you're saying is, at
the founding of the country,

00:01:29.497 --> 00:01:31.337
this was already an issue.

00:01:31.337 --> 00:01:33.044
There were people in the
North who weren't fans

00:01:33.044 --> 00:01:35.807
of slavery, and people
knew that at some point

00:01:35.807 --> 00:01:38.067
this would be irreconcilable,
or maybe they hoped

00:01:38.067 --> 00:01:40.951
that it would be a (laughs)
reconcilable difference.

00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:43.157
They said, "No, we gotta
unify against Great Britain."

00:01:43.157 --> 00:01:44.318
- [Kim] Exactly.
- [Sal] So they said,

00:01:44.318 --> 00:01:45.580
"Let's just become a country and do it."

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.717
- [Kim] You know, even Thomas Jefferson,

00:01:47.717 --> 00:01:49.690
the author of the
Declaration of Independence,

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.780
he knew that slavery was a contradiction.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.123
He called the issue of having slavery

00:01:55.123 --> 00:01:57.012
"like holding a wolf by the ears."

00:01:57.012 --> 00:01:59.671
You can't hold onto it,
but you can't let it go

00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:02.457
because so many of the wealthy elites

00:02:02.457 --> 00:02:04.152
who were going to end up in Congress

00:02:04.152 --> 00:02:05.662
in the South are slaveowners--

00:02:05.662 --> 00:02:07.412
- [Sal] Including himself.
- [Kim] Exactly,

00:02:07.412 --> 00:02:09.541
so they wanna protect their interests.

00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:13.543
- [Sal] So, the issue
is there from the moment

00:02:13.543 --> 00:02:15.261
that the country is
founded, and then we get

00:02:15.261 --> 00:02:17.398
into the 1800s, which
is really the run-up.

00:02:17.398 --> 00:02:20.936
The Civil War doesn't start
until we get into 1860

00:02:20.936 --> 00:02:25.623
or shortly thereafter, or actually, 1860.

00:02:28.383 --> 00:02:32.239
What's the big picture
that really leads up to it?

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.421
- [Kim] Well, I think
what we're looking at

00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:38.517
when we get into the issues
that lead to the Civil War,

00:02:38.517 --> 00:02:42.638
it's really about how the US
handles getting new territory.

00:02:43.614 --> 00:02:45.183
- [Sal] And the US was getting
a lot of new territory.

00:02:45.183 --> 00:02:46.483
We have a map here.

00:02:46.483 --> 00:02:48.552
I guess the first really big chunk is

00:02:48.552 --> 00:02:51.223
you have the Louisiana Purchase in 1803,

00:02:51.223 --> 00:02:52.294
and so you get all of...

00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:54.188
Let me shade it in.

00:02:54.188 --> 00:02:58.010
You get roughly all of
this stuff right over here,

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.447
so that's new areas that settlers can go,

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:05.471
and it becomes officially
a part of the US,

00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:06.772
and what else happens?

00:03:06.772 --> 00:03:10.092
- [Kim] So, as we get
these new territories,

00:03:10.092 --> 00:03:12.553
out of them you're gonna get new states,

00:03:12.553 --> 00:03:14.991
and when new states come into the Union,

00:03:14.991 --> 00:03:17.267
they're going to come
in as either free states

00:03:17.267 --> 00:03:21.686
or slave states, so we've
balanced the interests

00:03:21.686 --> 00:03:24.482
of the North and South
up until this point,

00:03:24.482 --> 00:03:27.129
from the Revolutionary
War, so that there's

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.382
equal representation in Congress

00:03:29.382 --> 00:03:32.052
between free states and slave states.

00:03:32.052 --> 00:03:33.840
- [Sal] Well, why does someone care?

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.069
If I'm someone in Massachusetts,

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.855
why do I care whether
the new state of Missouri

00:03:38.855 --> 00:03:41.223
is going to be a free
state or a slave state?

00:03:41.223 --> 00:03:42.918
- [Kim] Well, I think
there are two reasons

00:03:42.918 --> 00:03:44.427
why you might care.

00:03:44.427 --> 00:03:46.424
First, if you're an abolitionist,

00:03:46.424 --> 00:03:49.094
and these are the people
who we know very well,

00:03:49.094 --> 00:03:52.624
like Frederick Douglass,
or William Lloyd Garrison,

00:03:52.624 --> 00:03:55.456
who was the editor of the
newspaper The Liberator.

00:03:55.456 --> 00:03:57.268
These are the people who feel that,

00:03:57.268 --> 00:04:00.472
correctly, slavery is morally wrong.

00:04:00.472 --> 00:04:03.414
Slavery is a corruption

00:04:03.414 --> 00:04:05.875
of the essential principles

00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:08.623
on which the country was founded.

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:13.151
It's something that destroys
lives, destroys families,

00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:15.978
but another reason if
you're, say, in Massachusetts

00:04:15.978 --> 00:04:18.904
or Pennsylvania, why
you might care whether

00:04:18.904 --> 00:04:23.153
a new state is a slave
state, is you're worried

00:04:23.153 --> 00:04:26.961
about opportunities for
yourself out in the West.

00:04:26.961 --> 00:04:29.097
We know that Horace Greeley,

00:04:29.097 --> 00:04:31.442
this famous newspaper editor, he says,

00:04:31.442 --> 00:04:34.391
"What do you do if you're
a young man in New York,

00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:37.223
a young white man, who doesn't
know how to get ahead?"

00:04:37.223 --> 00:04:39.174
He says, "Go West, young man.

00:04:39.174 --> 00:04:41.240
"You can go out there,
you can get some land,

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.166
"you can start a farm,
but if you go out there

00:04:44.166 --> 00:04:47.045
"and you find that all of
the land has been bought up

00:04:47.045 --> 00:04:50.133
"by rich slaveholders from the South,

00:04:50.133 --> 00:04:51.944
"you might not be able to get any land,

00:04:51.944 --> 00:04:53.662
"and you certainly might not be able to,

00:04:53.662 --> 00:04:57.261
"for example, sell your
corn at a rate low enough

00:04:57.261 --> 00:05:00.512
"that you could beat
somebody who has free labor."

00:05:00.512 --> 00:05:02.952
- [Sal] So, a lot of times
there's a lot of focus

00:05:02.952 --> 00:05:05.413
on the moral argument, which
is a very strong argument,

00:05:05.413 --> 00:05:07.410
but there's also this
interesting economic argument

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.757
which you just talked about,

00:05:08.757 --> 00:05:11.055
which is it's hard to
compete with slavery.

00:05:11.055 --> 00:05:12.852
I mean, you're literally
talking about labor

00:05:12.852 --> 00:05:15.197
that does not need traditional wages.

00:05:15.197 --> 00:05:16.939
- [Kim] Right.
- [Sal] That is literally

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:18.781
slave labor, and so if you were having

00:05:18.781 --> 00:05:21.428
your own farm and you don't own slaves,

00:05:21.428 --> 00:05:23.100
how are you going to compete with that?

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.152
So, that was the reason for
some folks in the North,

00:05:25.152 --> 00:05:26.684
an economic argument.

00:05:26.684 --> 00:05:28.913
Now, would these people be
considered abolitionists?

00:05:28.913 --> 00:05:31.453
- [Kim] No, the way that
we think about those,

00:05:31.453 --> 00:05:33.333
we call them "anti-slavery."

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:37.745
So, anti-slavery
advocates, they don't think

00:05:37.745 --> 00:05:40.238
that they can get rid
of slavery in the South.

00:05:40.238 --> 00:05:42.491
Even if they don't like
slavery in the South,

00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:44.627
they don't even see how
it would be possible

00:05:44.627 --> 00:05:47.622
to get rid of it, but they do
think that as these new states

00:05:47.622 --> 00:05:51.778
are coming into the Union,
they could prevent them

00:05:51.778 --> 00:05:55.447
from becoming slave states,
so that it's possible

00:05:55.447 --> 00:05:58.422
for the Western lands to remain free.

00:05:59.914 --> 00:06:01.214
Abraham Lincoln, I think,

00:06:01.214 --> 00:06:03.939
is a really good poster child for this.

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:06.633
I think we'll talk about
him a little bit more later,

00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:09.233
but Lincoln is born in Kentucky,

00:06:09.233 --> 00:06:11.532
one of these new, Western states.

00:06:11.532 --> 00:06:14.922
His father is a small, white farmer,

00:06:14.922 --> 00:06:17.662
and slaveowners move into Kentucky.

00:06:17.662 --> 00:06:20.123
Later it becomes a slave state,

00:06:20.123 --> 00:06:21.888
and his father can't find work,

00:06:21.888 --> 00:06:24.395
his father can't find land, so he ends up

00:06:24.395 --> 00:06:26.508
first having to move to Indiana,

00:06:26.508 --> 00:06:29.875
then moving to Illinois,
so this is literally a case

00:06:29.875 --> 00:06:31.895
of one of these poor,
white farmers who just

00:06:31.895 --> 00:06:34.078
can't compete with slavery,
which is one reason

00:06:34.078 --> 00:06:36.841
why Lincoln himself is
later gonna come out

00:06:36.841 --> 00:06:39.093
so strongly in favor of making sure

00:06:39.093 --> 00:06:40.672
there's no slavery in the West.

00:06:40.672 --> 00:06:45.185
- [Sal] So, abolitionists:
slavery is amoral,

00:06:45.185 --> 00:06:48.134
it needs to be removed from,
definitely the United States,

00:06:48.134 --> 00:06:49.759
possibly the world.
- [Kim] Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:52.429
- [Sal] Anti-slavery: they
also think slavery is bad,

00:06:52.429 --> 00:06:54.690
they don't like it, but they think it's,

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.113
"Well, but I'm not gonna
fight that fight to remove it.

00:06:57.113 --> 00:06:59.180
"Maybe that's hard to do, or impossible,

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.619
"but it shouldn't spread.

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:02.129
"It's not fair.

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:03.382
"It's the reason my dad wasn't able

00:07:03.382 --> 00:07:05.751
"to be able to run his farm."

00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:07.245
- [Kim] Absolutely.

00:07:07.245 --> 00:07:10.124
- [Sal] So, you have
the Louisiana Purchase,

00:07:10.124 --> 00:07:12.013
and in other videos we
talk about that famously

00:07:12.013 --> 00:07:13.514
Napoleon sold it for quite cheap,

00:07:13.514 --> 00:07:14.744
because frankly, he couldn't defend it

00:07:14.744 --> 00:07:16.223
(Kim laughs)
because he was fighting

00:07:16.223 --> 00:07:17.386
these wars in Europe.

00:07:17.386 --> 00:07:19.151
That's the first chunk of land,

00:07:19.151 --> 00:07:20.242
so you have all of these states,

00:07:20.242 --> 00:07:21.542
and they need to figure out whether

00:07:21.542 --> 00:07:23.191
they're slave states or free states,

00:07:23.191 --> 00:07:24.198
but why would...

00:07:24.198 --> 00:07:26.018
I mean, I talked about why
would a Northerner care

00:07:26.018 --> 00:07:27.318
whether a slave or a free state.

00:07:27.318 --> 00:07:28.549
Why would a Southerner care?

00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:31.219
If I'm a slaveowner, I own a plantation

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:33.842
in South Carolina or
Georgia, why do I care

00:07:33.842 --> 00:07:36.698
if Missouri is a slave
state or a free state?

00:07:36.698 --> 00:07:38.370
- [Kim] Well I think, just as their

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.971
political interests
are tied up in slavery,

00:07:40.971 --> 00:07:43.432
all of their money is tied up in slavery.

00:07:43.432 --> 00:07:47.625
In 1860, the most valuable thing

00:07:47.625 --> 00:07:52.482
that anyone owns in the
United States is slaves.

00:07:52.482 --> 00:07:55.985
You can't compete with that kind of money,

00:07:55.985 --> 00:07:59.561
so they wanna make sure
that if a new state comes

00:07:59.561 --> 00:08:03.253
into the Union, that
state isn't a free state

00:08:03.253 --> 00:08:05.552
because then the free states might have

00:08:05.552 --> 00:08:07.827
more representation in Congress,

00:08:07.827 --> 00:08:10.219
and then they can vote to outlaw slavery.

00:08:10.219 --> 00:08:13.051
So, if your whole fortune
is built on slavery,

00:08:13.051 --> 00:08:16.302
if you're a white
slaveowner, they outlaw that,

00:08:16.302 --> 00:08:17.858
then you're left with nothing.

00:08:17.858 --> 00:08:20.458
- [Sal] I see, so the North,
there's the moral argument,

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:21.851
there's the economic argument,

00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:23.593
slavery is hard to compete with,

00:08:23.593 --> 00:08:25.891
and in the South, "Hey,
if we have too many

00:08:25.891 --> 00:08:27.982
"of these free states, at
some point they're gonna have

00:08:27.982 --> 00:08:31.008
"enough of a voting
power in the government

00:08:31.008 --> 00:08:34.909
"to maybe abolish slavery one day,"

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:36.644
which would completely undermine,

00:08:36.644 --> 00:08:38.039
if I'm a slaveowner,

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:42.172
my economics of my reality.

00:08:42.172 --> 00:08:45.445
- [Kim] Right, and they are
sort of essentially amoral.

00:08:45.445 --> 00:08:47.953
Even someone like Jefferson who knows

00:08:47.953 --> 00:08:50.345
that slavery is wrong, his whole wealth,

00:08:50.345 --> 00:08:53.456
his whole fortune, his
whole political dynasty

00:08:53.456 --> 00:08:56.323
is built on the fortune of owning slaves.

00:08:57.306 --> 00:09:00.191
- [Sal] You know, one of the first points

00:09:00.191 --> 00:09:02.885
where this really gets
balanced, this issue,

00:09:02.885 --> 00:09:05.392
is we have the Louisiana Purchase in 1803,

00:09:05.392 --> 00:09:07.337
then starting to carve out
the Louisiana Purchase,

00:09:07.337 --> 00:09:08.962
you have states like Missouri.

00:09:08.962 --> 00:09:10.913
They get to their critical mass of people,

00:09:10.913 --> 00:09:13.211
of population, so that
they can become a state,

00:09:13.211 --> 00:09:14.651
and so what was the Missouri Compromise

00:09:14.651 --> 00:09:16.160
all about in 1820?

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.832
- [Kim] So, the Missouri Compromise

00:09:17.832 --> 00:09:21.315
is when we have enough
people living in Missouri.

00:09:21.315 --> 00:09:24.158
These are white people, generally,

00:09:24.158 --> 00:09:27.082
who have come from the Eastern states,

00:09:27.082 --> 00:09:28.986
and they apply for statehood.

00:09:28.986 --> 00:09:31.493
You've got an equal number of slave states

00:09:31.493 --> 00:09:33.815
and free states already in Congress,

00:09:33.815 --> 00:09:37.205
so if Missouri comes in and
they wanna be a slave state,

00:09:37.205 --> 00:09:38.831
they're going to upset the apple cart.

00:09:38.831 --> 00:09:40.084
They're gonna upset the balance,

00:09:40.084 --> 00:09:42.221
so there will be more representatives

00:09:42.221 --> 00:09:44.705
for the South than
there will be for North,

00:09:44.705 --> 00:09:46.493
and everything they've done so far

00:09:46.493 --> 00:09:49.418
has been predicated on
this tenuous balance

00:09:49.418 --> 00:09:52.971
between free states and slave states.

00:09:52.971 --> 00:09:57.971
So, they debate this
in Congress for months,

00:09:57.994 --> 00:10:00.139
and eventually what they do is say,

00:10:00.139 --> 00:10:01.881
"All right, well, we can't decide,

00:10:01.881 --> 00:10:04.110
"so what we're going to do is admit

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.291
"the state of Maine at the same time."

00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:09.706
- [Sal] And Maine, the territory of Maine

00:10:09.706 --> 00:10:11.907
was already part of the United States.

00:10:11.907 --> 00:10:14.358
How was it not already a state?

00:10:14.358 --> 00:10:16.216
- [Kim] It was part of Massachusetts,

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:19.350
but as you can see, it's
really only tenuously

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.461
connected to Massachusetts, so they divide

00:10:22.461 --> 00:10:24.296
this territory up so that it can have

00:10:24.296 --> 00:10:27.314
its own representation
in Congress, so they say,

00:10:27.314 --> 00:10:29.752
"All right, well, we
can't solve this problem

00:10:29.752 --> 00:10:31.981
"of the balance of power
between free states

00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:34.489
"and slave states right
now, so what we're gonna do

00:10:34.489 --> 00:10:36.416
"is just kind of extend our balance.

00:10:36.416 --> 00:10:38.599
"We're gonna keep this compromise going

00:10:38.599 --> 00:10:40.456
"to make sure that there
are the same number

00:10:40.456 --> 00:10:44.615
"of free and slave states,
so we'll let Missouri in

00:10:44.615 --> 00:10:46.479
"as a slave state at the same time

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:49.219
"we let Maine in as a free state."

00:10:49.219 --> 00:10:50.303
- [Sal] Fascinating.

00:10:51.313 --> 00:10:52.983
I see where this is
going, that you have these

00:10:52.983 --> 00:10:55.130
very tenuous compromises while more

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.066
and more territories are being added.

00:10:57.066 --> 00:10:59.127
It's exciting to see
where all of this goes.
