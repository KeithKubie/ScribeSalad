00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.330
And the answer is no, it's not
a y-intercept because this first value

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.160
is 9 not zero and y-intercepts
are always zero comma something.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.710
So that means we can't use this
point in y equals an mx plus b.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:15.670
We need a new equation.
