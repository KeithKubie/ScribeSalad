00:00:00.607 --> 00:00:02.229
- [Tutor] Pause this video
and see if you can find

00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:04.633
the area of this triangle,

00:00:04.633 --> 00:00:06.583
and I'll give you two hints.

00:00:06.583 --> 00:00:09.375
Recognize, this is an isosceles triangle,

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:12.033
and another hint is that
the Pythagorean Theorem

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:13.366
might be useful.

00:00:14.254 --> 00:00:16.762
Alright, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:16.762 --> 00:00:20.042
So, we might all remember
that the area of a triangle

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:24.701
is equal to one half times
our base times our height.

00:00:24.701 --> 00:00:25.945
They give us our base.

00:00:25.945 --> 00:00:28.430
Our base right over here is,

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.680
our base is 10.

00:00:31.207 --> 00:00:32.859
But what is our height?

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:34.200
Our height would be,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.901
let me do this in another color,

00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:40.011
our height would be the length
of this line right over here.

00:00:40.011 --> 00:00:41.715
So, if we can figure that out,

00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:44.858
then we can calculate what
one half times the base 10

00:00:44.858 --> 00:00:46.498
times the height is.

00:00:46.498 --> 00:00:49.154
But how do we figure out this height?

00:00:49.154 --> 00:00:51.484
Well, this is where
it's useful to recognize

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:53.995
that this is an isosceles triangle.

00:00:53.995 --> 00:00:57.521
An isosceles triangle has
two sides that are the same.

00:00:57.521 --> 00:01:01.688
And so, these base angles are
also going to be congruent.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:06.174
And so, and if we drop an
altitude right over here

00:01:06.174 --> 00:01:08.197
which is the whole
point, that's the height,

00:01:08.197 --> 00:01:12.090
we know that this is, these
are going to be right angles.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.134
And so, if we have two triangles

00:01:14.134 --> 00:01:15.808
where two of the angles are the same,

00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:18.173
we know that the third angle
is going to be the same.

00:01:18.173 --> 00:01:21.196
So, that is going to be congruent to that.

00:01:21.196 --> 00:01:23.660
And so, if you have two triangles,

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.620
and this might be obvious
already to you intuitively,

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.006
where look, I have two angles in common

00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:31.566
and the side in between them is common,

00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:33.697
it's the same length,

00:01:33.697 --> 00:01:35.730
well that means that these are going to be

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.829
congruent triangles.

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.672
Now, what's useful about
that is if we recognize

00:01:39.672 --> 00:01:41.543
that these are congruent triangles,

00:01:41.543 --> 00:01:43.635
notice that they both have a side 13,

00:01:43.635 --> 00:01:46.397
they both have a side, whatever
this length in blue is.

00:01:46.397 --> 00:01:49.234
And then, they're both
going to have a side length

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:51.151
that's half of this 10.

00:01:52.571 --> 00:01:55.383
So, this is going to be five,
and this is going to be five.

00:01:55.383 --> 00:01:57.112
How was I able to deduce that?

00:01:57.112 --> 00:01:59.293
You might just say, oh that
feels intuitively right.

00:01:59.293 --> 00:02:00.650
I was a little bit more rigorous here,

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.420
where I said these are
two congruent triangles,

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.143
then we're going to split this 10 in half

00:02:06.143 --> 00:02:07.736
because this is going to be equal to that

00:02:07.736 --> 00:02:09.515
and they add up to 10.

00:02:09.515 --> 00:02:12.283
Alright, now we can use
the Pythagorean Theorem

00:02:12.283 --> 00:02:16.072
to figure out the length of
this blue side or the height.

00:02:16.072 --> 00:02:19.658
If we call this h, the
Pythagorean Theorem tells us

00:02:19.658 --> 00:02:23.221
that h squared plus five
squared is equal to 13 squared.

00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:25.554
H squared plus five squared,

00:02:27.131 --> 00:02:31.589
plus five squared is going
to be equal to 13 squared,

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:33.191
is going to be equal to our longest side,

00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:35.472
our hypotenuse squared.

00:02:35.472 --> 00:02:36.387
And so, let's see.

00:02:36.387 --> 00:02:37.970
Five squared is 25.

00:02:40.444 --> 00:02:41.944
13 squared is 169.

00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:47.808
We can subtract 25 from both sides

00:02:47.808 --> 00:02:49.949
to isolate the h squared.

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:51.599
So, let's do that.

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.728
And what are we left with?

00:02:53.728 --> 00:02:57.420
We are left with h squared is equal to

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.753
these canceled out, 169 minus 25 is 144.

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:04.843
Now, if you're doing it
purely mathematically,

00:03:04.843 --> 00:03:07.017
you say, oh h could be plus or minus 12,

00:03:07.017 --> 00:03:08.322
but we're dealing with the distance,

00:03:08.322 --> 00:03:10.598
so we'll focus on the positive.

00:03:10.598 --> 00:03:15.298
So, h is going to be equal
to the principal root of 144.

00:03:15.298 --> 00:03:17.084
So, h is equal to 12.

00:03:17.084 --> 00:03:18.043
Now, we aren't done.

00:03:18.043 --> 00:03:19.149
Remember, they don't want us to just

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:20.307
figure out the height here,

00:03:20.307 --> 00:03:22.472
they want us to figure out the area.

00:03:22.472 --> 00:03:25.389
Area is one half base times height.

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:27.430
Well, we already figured out

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.052
that our base is this 10 right over here,

00:03:31.052 --> 00:03:32.809
let me do this in another color.

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:36.309
So, our base is that distance which is 10,

00:03:37.443 --> 00:03:39.533
and now we know our height.

00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:40.950
Our height is 12.

00:03:42.328 --> 00:03:45.925
So, now we just have to compute
one half times 10 times 12.

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:47.875
Well, that's just going to be equal to

00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:50.096
one half times 10 is five,

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:52.072
times 12 is 60,

00:03:52.072 --> 00:03:55.947
60 square units, whatever
our units happen to be.

00:03:55.947 --> 00:03:57.364
That is our area.
