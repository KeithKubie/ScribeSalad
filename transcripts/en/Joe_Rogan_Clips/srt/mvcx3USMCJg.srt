1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,080
Yeah. What's the benefit of
grass fed beef over regular beef?

2
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:07,980
I know there is a benefit but I don't,
I don't, I never can recall correctly.

3
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:12,090
It's something to do with the small
central fatty acid ratios. Yeah,

4
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:13,090
cause grain you're gonna,

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,400
you're gonna have more of the omega six
fatty acids which have been unfairly

6
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:22,200
vilified meaning that a lot of people
are just like don't eat any Omega sixes.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,150
Don't have any arachidonic acid. Like
don't, don't overdo your seeds or nuts.

8
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:31,380
Your nut butter. Kind of like the the
orthorexic health world as a whole.

9
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:33,750
You know like when you read
nutrition magazines and stuff,

10
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:36,450
they're like do your Omega
threes but be careful.

11
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:40,830
Americans have a 20 to one
omega six to Omega three ratio,

12
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:42,780
but the problem is that Omega six is,

13
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:46,770
that's a lot of those are derived from
what are called parent essential oils.

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,820
And your cell membranes need a certain
amount of omega six fatty acids from

15
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:55,260
seeds and nuts and plants and
even to a certain extent grains.

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,670
And when you have an excess of
Omega threes and not enough,

17
00:00:59,671 --> 00:01:04,470
we'll mega six is because you're going
so far into the fish oil category than it

18
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:06,340
actually damages is a component of your,

19
00:01:06,341 --> 00:01:08,880
your mitochondrial membrane
called Cardio Liben.

20
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,560
You actually make less of that
interfere with normal cellular activity.

21
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,670
What seeds are most beneficial? Uh, uh,

22
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,610
I would imagine the most
nutrient dense ones,

23
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,870
so specific Wiseman's Macadamia.
I mean what I is like almonds,

24
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:26,850
macadamia nuts,
Brazil nuts.

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,230
I just don't eat the quasi nuts
like peanuts, which are, you know,

26
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:36,060
they're not as high in nutrient density.
They're more of a legume than a nut. Um,

27
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,180
I, a lot of my nuts either
raw or lightly roasted,

28
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:42,180
you always look at the label to make sure
they didn't put a lot of vegetable oil.

29
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,000
And Canola oil in them a little,
you know,

30
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:47,760
I'm a fan of nuts in in moderate my nuts.

31
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:51,250
Like you're nuts if you are going
to have to shell them. Right?

32
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,640
Like if you've ever had to shell a walnut,

33
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:56,910
you're not going to eat 30 walnuts
cause that'd be exhausting, right?

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,740
[inaudible] like yeah.
[inaudible] shell.

35
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,990
It's annoying as hell but keeps
you from eating too many of them.

36
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,110
I buy them shelled and I
eat fistfuls of them. Yeah.

37
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,170
Like last night I like a half a bag of
pistachios are great for your microbiome

38
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:12,990
to,
yeah.

39
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,230
I actually had a couple of research
studies on that last year that showed an

40
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:20,730
improvement in the diversity of the
bacteria in your gut with pistachios.

41
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,850
That's one of the nuts as good for your
by probably because of the fiber content

42
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,810
in pistachios,

43
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:29,811
but grass fed versus grain
fed is primarily the omega
three fatty acids may have

44
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:32,010
less of the arachidonic acid,

45
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,280
less of the potentially
inflammatory omega six fatty acids.

46
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,570
There's probably part of it being
that grass fed grass finished beef is

47
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:43,170
generally raised on a farm that's
using less herbicides, less pesticides,

48
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:46,260
raising their meat and more
sustainable fashion. You know,

49
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:48,540
giving it less hormones,
giving less antibiotics.

50
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,300
That's painting with a broad brush.
But generally grass fed,

51
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,330
there's more to it than just
the fatty acid composition.

52
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:57,390
It's just a better meat overall.
In my,

53
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,910
well better health wise grain fed beef,

54
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:02,470
I will not lie like you can,

55
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:06,760
you can have a pretty damn tasty fatty
cut of grain fed beef. Certainly can.

56
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,350
But I honestly prefer the taste of
grass fed. I liked the denser meet,

57
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:14,500
the darker meat, I liked it
better. It's just, to me it just,

58
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,430
it just tastes healthier. I just,
my, I crave it more, you know?

59
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:22,100
And when I go back and forth between
the two of them, when I eat grain fed,

60
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,190
it feels like, like a lazy cow. Like
it's mushy and it's got like, it's good,

61
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,800
it's delicious. Don't get me
wrong, but there's a difference.

62
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,970
It's kind of funny cause I,

63
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,560
I've gone over to Dubai a few times and
tall like fitness conferences over there

64
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,220
and they advertise grain fed
like they want everybody to,

65
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:40,330
like when you go to
the restaurant is like,

66
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:45,220
this beef is the finest grain fed beef,
fat Peter Luger's,

67
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:48,580
which a lot of grain pretty
widely recognized as the
greatest steakhouse in the

68
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:51,540
world that places all graces that trip.
I actually,

69
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,590
I didn't like my steak is how fucking
dare you. I know you're going to get,

70
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,210
I'm going to get killed.
Some rude Brooklyn waiter's
going to take me out. But uh,

71
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,830
I didn't like it. What would you
like it just something about like,

72
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:09,610
the meat just tasted, it tasted like
it was drenched in vegetable oil.

73
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,390
Like something about it just didn't
taste right and maybe I had a poor Peter

74
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,870
Luger's experience that doesn't even
make sense. I did not enjoy it that much.

75
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:19,750
Food. I ate there and afterwards I'm
like, I don't think it gets better,

76
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,900
I don't think.
Yeah.
