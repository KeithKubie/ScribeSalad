00:00:00.284 --> 00:00:01.950
Let's think about
different ways that we

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:10.080
can represent the number 675.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.930
So the most obvious
way is to just look

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.980
at the different place values.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.079
So the 6 is in the
hundreds place.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.800
It literally represents 600.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.480
So that's 600.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.860
I'm going to do that
in the red color-- 600.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.210
The 7 is in the tens place.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.930
It represents 7 tens, or 70.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.930
And then the 5 in
the ones place.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.067
It represents 5.

00:00:33.067 --> 00:00:34.900
So let me copy and paste
this and then think

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.170
about how we can regroup the
value in the different places

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.423
to represent this
in different ways.

00:00:40.423 --> 00:00:42.720
So let me copy and
let me paste it,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.730
and maybe I'll do
it three times.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.950
So let me do it once, and
let me do it one more time.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.660
So one thing that we could do is
we could regroup from one place

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.610
to the next.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.660
So, for example,
we could take if we

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.940
wanted to-- we could take
1 from the hundreds place.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.870
Taking 1 from the hundreds
place will make this a 5.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.080
That's essentially
taking 100 away.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.130
So this is really
making this a 500.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.880
And we could give
that 100 to-- well,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.629
we could actually give
it to either place,

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:16.590
but let's give it
to the tens place.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.867
So we're going to give
100 to the tens place.

00:01:22.867 --> 00:01:24.450
Now, if you give 100
to the tens place

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.340
and you already had 70 there,
what's it going to be equal to?

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.560
Well, it's going
to be equal to 170.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.430
Well, how would we
represent that is tens?

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.010
Well, 170 is 17 tens.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.570
So we could just say
that 7 becomes 17.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.080
Now, we could keep doing that.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.990
We could regroup some of
this value in the tens place

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.360
to the ones place.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.940
So, for example, we could
give 10 from the tens place

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.190
and give it to the ones place.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.910
Let's do that.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.910
So let's take 10 away from here.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.510
So that becomes 160.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.750
This becomes 16.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.510
And let's give that
10 to the ones place.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.660
Well, what does the
ones place now become?

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.979
Well, 10 plus 5 is 15.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.750
So this 5 is now a 15.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.220
Let's do another scenario.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.380
Let's do something nutty.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.170
Let's take 200 from
the hundreds place.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.390
So this is going to now 4, and
this is going to become 400.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.420
That's what this
4 now represents.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.660
And let's give 100
to the tens place.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.000
And let's give another
100 to the ones place.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.600
So in other words, I'm
just regrouping that 200.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.140
Those 200's, I've taken
from the hundreds place,

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.680
and I'm going to give it
to these other places.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.370
So now the tens place
is going to be 170.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.340
We're going to have 170
here, which is 17 tens.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.690
So you could say that
the tens place is now 17.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.920
And now the ones
place, well, I had 5,

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.760
and now I'm going
to add 100 to it.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.676
So it's going to be 105.

00:03:09.676 --> 00:03:13.080
And 105 ones is literally 105.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.260
And notice, this is 400 plus
17 tens, which is 170 plus 105.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.130
You add these together,
you're still going to get 675.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.850
Let's do that again.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.750
So let's take, I don't know.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.751
Let's take all of
the hundreds away.

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:31.250
Let's take all of
the hundreds away.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.920
So that goes zero.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.090
That goes zero.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.070
And let's give 400
to the tens place.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.480
So let's give 400
to the tens place.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.630
Well, that'll make that 470.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.520
Let me do that in
that green color.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.710
That will make that 470, which
is the same thing as 47 tens.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.881
And then I still have 200
to give to the ones place.

00:03:56.881 --> 00:03:57.630
So let me do that.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.240
So I still have 200 to
give to the ones place.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:09.140
And so that's going
to go from 5 to 205.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.880
Once again, all
I've done is I've

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.990
regrouped the value
in the number 675.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.334
Any of these still
represent 675.

00:04:17.334 --> 00:04:18.959
You can add these
numbers on the right.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.600
They all add up to 675.
