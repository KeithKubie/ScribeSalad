00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.303
- [Voiceover] We're in our quest

00:00:01.303 --> 00:00:02.790
to give ourselves a little bit

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.668
of a mathematical underpinning
of definite integrals

00:00:05.668 --> 00:00:08.157
of various combinations of trig functions.

00:00:08.157 --> 00:00:10.104
So, it'll be hopefully straightforward

00:00:10.104 --> 00:00:12.354
for us to actually find the coefficients,

00:00:12.354 --> 00:00:14.187
our Fourier coefficients,
which we're going to do

00:00:14.187 --> 00:00:15.653
a few videos from now.

00:00:15.653 --> 00:00:17.690
And we've already started
going down this path.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.012
We've established that
the definite integral

00:00:20.012 --> 00:00:23.169
from zero to two pi of sine
of mt dt is equal to zero,

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.599
and that the definite
integral of cosine mt dt

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.543
is equal to zero for
any non-zero integer m.

00:00:30.543 --> 00:00:32.617
And actually, we can
generalize that a little bit.

00:00:32.617 --> 00:00:36.477
For sine of mt, it could
be for any m actually.

00:00:36.477 --> 00:00:38.594
And if you don't believe
me, I encourage you,

00:00:38.594 --> 00:00:39.427
so let me write this,

00:00:39.427 --> 00:00:43.762
for any, for any integer
m, this top interval's

00:00:43.762 --> 00:00:46.211
going to be zero and this second interval

00:00:46.211 --> 00:00:50.378
for any for non-zero,
non-zero integer, integer m.

00:00:55.615 --> 00:00:58.283
And you can see, if you had
zero in this second case,

00:00:58.283 --> 00:00:59.908
it would be cosine of zero t,

00:00:59.908 --> 00:01:01.701
so this would just evaluate to one,

00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:03.435
so you'd just be integrating

00:01:03.435 --> 00:01:05.846
the value one from zero to two pi,

00:01:05.846 --> 00:01:08.690
and so that's going to
have a non-zero value.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.949
So, with those two out of the way,

00:01:09.949 --> 00:01:11.492
let's go a little bit deeper,

00:01:11.492 --> 00:01:13.444
get a little bit more foundations.

00:01:13.444 --> 00:01:16.294
So, I now want to establish

00:01:16.294 --> 00:01:19.873
that the definite integral
from zero to two pi

00:01:19.873 --> 00:01:22.873
of sine of mt times cosine of nt dt,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.727
that this equals zero for any
integers, integers m and n.

00:01:42.014 --> 00:01:43.668
And they could even be the same.

00:01:43.668 --> 00:01:45.129
They don't have to
necessarily be different,

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:46.715
but they could be different.

00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:48.424
How do we do this?

00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:53.061
Well, let's just rewrite
this part right over here,

00:01:53.061 --> 00:01:55.786
leveraging some trig identities.

00:01:55.786 --> 00:01:57.737
And if this is completely
unfamiliar to you,

00:01:57.737 --> 00:01:59.581
I encourage you to review
your trig identities

00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:00.827
on Khan Academy.

00:02:00.827 --> 00:02:01.725
So, this is the same thing,

00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:04.492
has a definite integral
from zero to two pi.

00:02:04.492 --> 00:02:07.748
This sine of mt times cosine nt,

00:02:07.748 --> 00:02:11.770
we can rewrite it using the
product to sum formulas.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.215
So, that is, let me use
a different color here.

00:02:14.215 --> 00:02:15.842
So, this thing right over here

00:02:15.842 --> 00:02:17.631
that I've underlined in magenta,

00:02:17.631 --> 00:02:19.905
or that I'm squaring off in magenta,

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:22.426
that can be rewritten as

00:02:22.426 --> 00:02:25.259
one half times sine of m plus n t,

00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:31.598
sine of m plus n t,

00:02:34.902 --> 00:02:38.402
plus sine, sine of m minus n, m minus n t.

00:02:44.867 --> 00:02:48.700
And then let me just
close that with a dt, dt.

00:02:50.483 --> 00:02:51.728
Now, if we were to just rewrite this

00:02:51.728 --> 00:02:53.354
using some of our integral properties,

00:02:53.354 --> 00:02:55.348
we could rewrite it as,

00:02:55.348 --> 00:02:58.098
so this part over here, we could,

00:02:59.572 --> 00:03:02.585
and let's assume we
distribute the one half,

00:03:02.585 --> 00:03:04.576
so we're gonna distribute the one half

00:03:04.576 --> 00:03:06.611
and use some of our integral properties.

00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:08.849
And so what are we going to get?

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.655
So, this part roughly, right over here,

00:03:11.655 --> 00:03:15.586
we could rewrite as one half
times the definite integral

00:03:15.586 --> 00:03:19.253
from zero to two pi of
sine of m plus n t dt

00:03:25.926 --> 00:03:28.982
and then this part, once
you distribute the one half

00:03:28.982 --> 00:03:31.016
and you use some integration properties,

00:03:31.016 --> 00:03:34.358
this could be plus one half
times the definite integral

00:03:34.358 --> 00:03:38.525
from zero to two pi of sine
of m minus n, m minus n t dt.

00:03:44.732 --> 00:03:47.989
Now, what are each of these
things going to be equal to?

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.072
Well, isn't this right over here,

00:03:50.072 --> 00:03:52.210
isn't that just some integer?

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.490
If I have to take the sum
of two arbitrary integers,

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.173
that's going to be some integer.

00:03:56.173 --> 00:03:58.313
So, that's going to be some integer.

00:03:58.313 --> 00:04:03.042
And this, too, is going to be
some integer right over here.

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:04.876
And we've already established
that the definite integral

00:04:04.876 --> 00:04:08.585
of sine of some integer
times t dt is zero.

00:04:08.585 --> 00:04:11.189
So, by this first thing
that we already showed,

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:13.344
this is going to be equal to zero,

00:04:13.344 --> 00:04:14.400
that's going to be equal to zero.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.193
It doesn't matter that you're
multiplying by one half.

00:04:16.193 --> 00:04:17.700
One half times zero is zero.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.082
One half times zero is zero.

00:04:19.082 --> 00:04:23.431
This whole thing is going
to evaluate to zero.

00:04:23.431 --> 00:04:26.862
So, there you go; we've
proven that as well.
