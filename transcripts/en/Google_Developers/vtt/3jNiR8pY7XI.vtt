JAREK WILKIEWICZ: API.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.340
JJ BEHRENS: This is Jarek
Wilkiewicz with me and I've

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.600
introduced him many
times before.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.680
And Jarek, I heard
that you went on

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.030
vacation for a week recently.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.470
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yes.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.870
I was off in Montreal,
Canada, enjoying the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.910
warm weather up there.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.740
JJ BEHRENS: So I heard
that you were

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.050
actually completely offline.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.540
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I switched
off my phone

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.720
for about five days.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.450
I went native, yes.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.810
JJ BEHRENS: I find this hard to
believe considering I know

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.820
that you've replied to me while
on a plane and at any

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.800
time of the day or night.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.980
Did you have some kind
of withdrawal?

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:42.320
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yes.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.930
I am still recovering from it.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.400
My email priority inbox thread
count is very high and is

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.900
actually growing as we speak.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.380
So if I seem a little stressed
during this Hangout, it's

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.220
purely because I know
my email pile is

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.760
accumulating every minute.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.920
JJ BEHRENS: I know that when I
try to do something like that

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.040
I start getting jittery.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.805
Did you get a little
bit jittery?

00:01:00.805 --> 00:01:02.940
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: No, I'm a
pretty mellow guy, I think.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.180
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, well
that's good.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.920
And so we're missing Jeffrey
Posnick today.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.760
Apparently there's this X
Project team at Google and we

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.410
had this wormhole so that
Jeffrey was generally able to

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.810
reply to emails before they
were actually sent.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.210
But in this case I heard that
that was down and so Jeffrey's

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.320
in front of a computer
responding to email right at

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.730
this moment, I think.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.490
Kind of a downer, really.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.630
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, we're
going to miss Jeff today,

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.370
unfortunately.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.010
Hopefully he'll be
back next time.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.870
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, it's
kind of a bummer.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.820
So today we have two guests.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.750
We have Guy Zisman from
Groovideo in green.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.520
Wave.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.310
Hi, Guy.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.970
And we have Tony Jacobs
from Gloto.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.730
And so each of those two guys
are going to give us a nice

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.330
overview of their cool new
startup involving YouTube

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.650
APIs, and then we're going to
give a recap of Google I/O,

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.970
all of our sessions.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.990
And if any of you are watching
the streaming session, go

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.660
ahead and post questions to the
Hangout and we'll answer

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.170
them on air as best we
can without Jeffrey.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.430
I mean, it's tough,
Jeffrey could

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.979
answer anything, I think.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.750
But why don't we get
started, Guy.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.774
Tell us about Groovideo.

00:02:13.774 --> 00:02:21.670
GUY ZISMAN: So Groovideo is the
new awesome thing around.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.850
It's a startup.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.160
We're a team of five, like this
for about a year now.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.200
We launched our beta
about a month ago.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.450
And Groovideo is basically the
new way to allow people to

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.360
make group videos together.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.180
Basically, we are starting
off with birthday videos.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.310
Allowing, let's say Jarek has
a birthday and you want to

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.020
invite all your friends to join
in and make a cool video

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.052
to bring to him on
his birthday.

00:02:59.052 --> 00:03:03.720
So you invite them, currently
via Facebook,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.620
real soon via Google+.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.720
And you invite the friends,
they chip in with a bit of

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.420
dancing, a bit of reading
segments that we direct the

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.430
users what to do with accordance
to specific music.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.550
All segments are brought
together to our servers in the

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.220
cloud and we magically,
automatically mesh them

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.800
together into an
awesome video.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.070
So the whole process for each
participant takes about two

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.300
minutes, that's it.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.290
A no-brainer.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.830
We now are working on two
clients, the web and the

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.080
iPhone, and real soon
also the Android.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:56.190
So that way we are getting the
majority of mobile devices.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.430
And that's where we're at.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.070
JJ BEHRENS: Awesome.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.690
So I checked out your website
and I was super psyched.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.070
I wanted to send my wife a
birthday message but my wife

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.010
has never actually told
me her birthday.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.280
She keeps it as a closely
guarded secret so that I can't

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.530
figure out her age.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.839
And she won't friend
me on Facebook so I

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:19.930
can't find it there.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.140
So I don't know.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.350
But I was super psyched
about your software.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.580
Before you demo it, can you
tell me a little bit more

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.350
about how you stitch the
videos together?

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.710
Because it seems pretty
ingenious.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.940
GUY ZISMAN: Yeah, so we have a
combination of, let's say,

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.780
assumptions and computer vision
used in the background.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.382
Assumptions would be things
like we now to tell you to

00:04:47.382 --> 00:04:48.790
greet the birthday kid.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.360
So it's something we can assume
with accordance to a

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.300
bit of speech analysis
that we put in.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.880
And together with that we also
can sync your dancing with

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.000
accordance to the soundtrack
you hear while you dance.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.180
JJ BEHRENS: Wow.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.930
GUY ZISMAN: So these
are assumptions.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:18.150
And as to the more, let's say,
computer vision interesting

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.810
stuff we have things like
detecting movement, detecting

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:30.510
the best sequences to get and to
use for the final mash-up.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.360
By the way, if it doesn't fit
your needs, at the end you can

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.530
also always refresh and
get a new result.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.740
That way we learn what works
best and we improve our

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.000
algorithms.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.690
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, I'm amazed by
the idea that you've taken

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.780
kind of a simple idea but
you're doing something

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.200
algorithmically that would've
been really, really hard

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.810
before and you're doing it
using brilliant computer

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.610
science and software
engineering.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.470
I mean I can't do that.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.650
GUY ZISMAN: Yeah, that's
something we enjoy as, let's

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.045
say, a very strongly technical
team that we are.

00:06:09.045 --> 00:06:12.160
We're trying to bring it
in into the product,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.230
not leaving it here.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.020
So that's it.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.210
JJ BEHRENS: I assume you guys
have different specialists,

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.240
the guy who knows how to build
the website and the guy who

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.500
knows the computer vision, maybe
a machine learning guy.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.740
Do have separate
teams or what?

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.070
GUY ZISMAN: So, as I
said, we're a team

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.860
of five as a whole.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.395
So a team, in the sense you
were mentioning, is a

00:06:37.395 --> 00:06:39.150
one-person team.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.400
So yeah.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.880
We have someone that is
dedicated for the server side,

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.270
actually two guys.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.920
Let me pay my respect.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.320
It's a guy and a girl
on our team.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.220
JJ BEHRENS: Wow.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.700
GUY ZISMAN: And a front-end
also, a front-end developer.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.070
Me, kind of chipping
in, both sides.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:10.190
But yeah, it's quite
the system to

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.440
operate with the design.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.650
JJ BEHRENS: Pretty cool.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.310
You want to show us a demo?

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.250
Maybe screen share with it?

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:17.750
GUY ZISMAN: Yeah.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.930
So let me just turn
it on here.

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:39.540
So you should be able to
see my desktop, right?

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.710
JJ BEHRENS: Not quite yet.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.850
GUY ZISMAN: The browser?

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:44.956
JJ BEHRENS: You're frozen.

00:07:44.956 --> 00:07:46.206
Uh-oh.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.150
GUY ZISMAN: Are we good now?

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.640
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: We can hear
you but we can't see you.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.600
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah we can hear
you but we can't see you.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.330
GUY ZISMAN: OK.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.140
JJ BEHRENS: So while you're
working on that, if you could

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:07.110
multitask, can you tell me what
programming language your

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.180
computer vision software
is written in?

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:18.330
GUY ZISMAN: So we are actually
using OpenCV library for the

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:23.960
more heavy side algorithm
work we're doing.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.315
So that's a bit of
C, C++ there.

00:08:27.315 --> 00:08:28.520
JJ BEHRENS: OK.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:33.880
GUY ZISMAN: Also we have
server Ruby on Rails.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.929
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, I could tell
the Ruby on Rails just looking

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:37.619
at the URLs.

00:08:37.619 --> 00:08:38.929
GUY ZISMAN: Yeah.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:40.380
All restful and stuff.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.970
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:46.470
GUY ZISMAN: Yeah so we really
love the idea of keeping it

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:50.190
restful for the entire system.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.750
And also we have--

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.370
just a second, sorry I had
a bit of an interruption.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.140
JJ BEHRENS: Just a what?

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.225
GUY ZISMAN: Sorry, I had a
bit of an interruption.

00:09:01.225 --> 00:09:02.010
JJ BEHRENS: Oh, sorry,
go ahead.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.360
We can still hear you.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:11.030
GUY ZISMAN: Yeah, so we have
also a bit of Java making the

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:15.880
more heavy lifting, logistics
side of the videos,

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.460
transcoding them, converting
them, and stitching them

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.210
together finally.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:27.770
And we're trying to be
very responsive on

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.040
the front-end side.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:41.670
So a lot of JavaScript going
on the front-end, looking

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:46.960
really into keeping the user
experience dynamic and live

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.900
and responsive.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.730
JJ BEHRENS: I love any startup
that can combine hardcore C++

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.360
algorithms with a funky-looking
font.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.162
Let me just say that.

00:09:57.162 --> 00:09:57.530
GUY ZISMAN: Thank you.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.150
JJ BEHRENS: So we're
having a hard time

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.610
with your screen sharing.

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:02.740
Why don't we switch to--

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.380
GUY ZISMAN: Let me
just, hold on.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.130
I can also test another
screen here.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.040
JJ BEHRENS: I'm going to switch
to Gloto and why don't

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.380
you drop out of the Hangout
and come back in again and

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.840
we'll talk to Gloto
for a few minutes.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.880
So we have Tony Jacobs
from Gloto.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.636
You want to wave, Tony?

00:10:19.636 --> 00:10:20.740
TONY JACOBS: Hi.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.290
JJ BEHRENS: Senior VP of
Technology and Operations.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.510
Tell us about Gloto.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:31.890
TONY JACOBS: Gloto
is a startup.

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.260
We build consumer engagement.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.620
So that's the big thing
we're doing.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.310
Our major customers these days
tend to be media and

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:41.310
entertainment.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:46.780
So we're spending a lot of
energy trying to make really

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.420
exciting and fun things.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:55.800
Some of the experiences I'll
talk about today are stuff for

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.830
mobile devices, apps
basically.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.380
We also have a bunch of
fun web experiences.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.970
The common thread that we're
finding these days is a lot of

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:11.890
the apps that we tend
to be building are

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:17.680
more heavy for video.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.070
We started out doing a
lot of photo stuff.

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:25.690
In fact, our name is kind
of a riff off of photos.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:30.235
But as we've been playing in the
space more and more we're

00:11:30.235 --> 00:11:34.180
finding uploading videos,
playing with YouTube, building

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:39.280
photo mosaics with integrated
videos, little fun puzzles.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.626
That's kind of the stuff we're
finding ourselves doing a lot

00:11:42.626 --> 00:11:43.560
more these days.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.120
JJ BEHRENS: Great.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:50.655
So you were talking about
coding for mobile.

00:11:50.655 --> 00:11:52.070
Which platforms do
you support?

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.120
TONY JACOBS: The stuff that
sells well is iOS and Android.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.990
And then there's also HTML5
mobile web, tends to

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:05.290
come up a lot too.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:10.080
But as you explore those three
platforms-- obviously there's

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.360
the other games out there, but
as you explore those three

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:17.260
platforms in a more serious way
we're finding HTML5 mobile

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:23.380
web is great for displaying
videos, displaying stuff.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.540
But it's not really great for
getting users to participate.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:27.980
JJ BEHRENS: I see.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:28.740
TONY JACOBS: And then--

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.040
yeah?

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.978
JJ BEHRENS: Go ahead, sorry.

00:12:30.978 --> 00:12:35.655
TONY JACOBS: Then the apps
tend to be better at, hey

00:12:35.655 --> 00:12:40.330
let's upload video, let's do
really clever things, and

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.160
playing videos and interactions
with them, maybe

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:51.670
doing just fun visual effects
is a little better in apps.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.330
JJ BEHRENS: I'm always curious
with native apps.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:59.150
What percentage of your app is
pure native code versus maybe

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.400
using WebViews?

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.160
TONY JACOBS: I don't want to
say 100% native because

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.045
WebViews do come up
from time to time.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.010
In apps that we work on for
our major media and

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:19.150
entertainment customers where
they really care about

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.910
experience at every single
pixel, we find that those tend

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:27.230
to be native pretty much
across the board.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:31.870
And the WebViews tend to really
be things like about

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:35.890
this show or copyright
terms and conditions.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:40.440
Stuff that basically is a blip
on the functionality radar.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.020
JJ BEHRENS: I see.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:41.770
Very good.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:48.340
Now at Google I/O we announced
a new Android player API for

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.920
smoother-playing YouTube
videos inside

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.540
your Android app.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:56.600
Are you guys looking at
switching to that?

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:01.950
TONY JACOBS: We helped give
the presentation at I/O.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.630
JJ BEHRENS: My goodness,
that's so embarrassing.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.640
Jarek, you got to tell
me these things.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.640
I watched that video
but I forgot!

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.780
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Tony looks
a little different.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.070
I think he's more relaxed today
than he was on stage

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:13.140
with Google I/O.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.690
JJ BEHRENS: That's true, and
that whole Google I/O

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.870
business, it's a little
bit of a blur for me.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.425
I mean there was a
lack of sleep.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:22.990
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:26.060
JJ BEHRENS: There was like this
big rotating black ball.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.880
I remember something
about that.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.700
I don't know, the queue
or something.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.090
TONY JACOBS: But at I/O we went
ahead and built a Android

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:37.530
version using the pre-release
of the API.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.910
And I'll go ahead and show a
couple toys on that in a few

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:42.240
minutes when we do the
screen share part.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.510
JJ BEHRENS: So you want to go
ahead and take a stab at the

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.170
screen share and let's see if
we're doing better the second

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:49.710
time around.

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:52.380
TONY JACOBS: Let's
see what happens.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.160
OK.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.543
I'm clicking a button and I'm
clicking another button and

00:14:56.543 --> 00:14:57.710
I'm saying share.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:58.850
JJ BEHRENS: Oh, we can see it.

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:01.200
That's great.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.280
TONY JACOBS: Can you
see a mouse?

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.767
JJ BEHRENS: Yep.

00:15:03.767 --> 00:15:07.181
TONY JACOBS: Ooh-ooh-ooh,
time to log in.

00:15:07.181 --> 00:15:09.946
OK, let's see what
happens here.

00:15:09.946 --> 00:15:11.400
OK, there's motion.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.140
OK, so what I've done in the
screen share window, other

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.780
than typing my password wrong,
is I'm attempting to log into

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:26.160
the Gloto designer, which is our
web interface to building

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:32.350
apps, building photo mosaics or
other fun puzzles and toys.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:37.290
Basically any experience we
build on any platform, this

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:41.130
Gloto designer product is
really our entry point.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:46.080
And from a consumer point of
view, as in end-consumers,

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.760
they won't really play
with this much.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.660
But content creators and
people who want to put

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:56.080
experiences in front of people,
this is kind of the

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.440
target audience for this tool
we're building here.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.300
JJ BEHRENS: OK so let's imagine
I'm Acme Cola and I

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:05.540
want to have an immersive
experience for my users, maybe

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.780
I want to do some kind
of promo thing.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.630
I would use your software to
create some kind of experience

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.430
and have that work on
web and mobile?

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.060
TONY JACOBS: Exactly.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:16.680
Exactly.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.790
In fact, I have a saved one,
I'll go ahead and run through

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:19.760
the actual example.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.730
And instead of calling you Acme
I'm going to call you

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:22.800
Brand X.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.780
JJ BEHRENS: OK.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.310
That's probably sexier,
anyway.

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:26.710
TONY JACOBS: Let's do
this metal one.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.660
So I have a little uploader
here, it's metal.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.500
This is kind of cool.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.160
So we actually dreamed up in
our-- can you see me at all?

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.100
JJ BEHRENS: Yup.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.010
TONY JACOBS: Oh, good.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:41.440
We actually dreamed up a nice
little set of brand identities

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.300
for this company we're calling
Brand X. And so we've built

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.750
through all of the various
phases and we've built these

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:51.650
screens to kind of highlight
that experience.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.650
And I'm just plugging through
a concrete example here.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:56.410
I could build one from
scratch in a moment.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:00.210
It obviously takes a little bit
of time, like 20 minutes,

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:03.060
but that's still trying
to hurry here.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:07.190
So it's a completely drag and
drop experience where we can

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:10.859
actually plug in all of the
various bits and details.

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:13.210
And as you can see I have click
states I have roll-over

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:15.359
states, and this [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:18.170
moves across the entire app.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.569
For example in here I have a
YouTube video that we're

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:24.099
actually going to play
in our mobile app.

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:27.920
In this case it was some extreme
sports, I think is the

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.630
concrete example I've
built here.

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:32.620
And then it's got the ability
to do uploads and galleries.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.180
Actually, let me take
a step back.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:38.570
What the purpose of this app
that I'm designing is to build

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:39.570
a campaign--

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:42.000
in this case on behalf
of Brand X--

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.710
to upload videos into a
contest of some kind.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:50.920
And then share those videos
with basically anybody and

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.040
maybe give a prize, maybe
even a really cool

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.450
prize, and just do stuff.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:18:01.790
And build this app experience
on iOS, build it on Android,

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:07.080
maybe have a PC web version,
maybe have a YouTube brand

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:11.200
channel gadget, maybe
plug into Google+,

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.880
maybe plug into Facebook.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.720
Basically all of the big places
where consumers go to

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.740
get stuff, these apps
and experiences

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.440
are designed to target.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.030
JJ BEHRENS: So you're building
some sort of app using this UI

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:27.720
and then you're going to have
some sort of intermediate app

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.500
representation that could be
perhaps interpreted by each of

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.290
the different platforms?

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:34.460
TONY JACOBS: Absolutely.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:38.180
And because I clicked the wrong
screen share button you

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:41.610
didn't get to see
what happened.

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:46.250
OK so you should now see
my entire desktop here.

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.160
We'll do that again.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.130
So as we go through and we build
out everything we want

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.980
to see, and you smash preview
that up here.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:19:00.950
We actually run on the web a
simulation of the experience.

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:05.450
And if you're using the test app
it actually runs on your

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:09.560
iOS phone or your Android phone
or your Nexus 7 tablet

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:14.600
or your 10-inch tablet or
your iPad or whatever.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:19.350
These very different client
libraries are all built up to

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:22.486
basically run these exact
same experiences.

00:19:22.486 --> 00:19:22.980
JJ BEHRENS: Cool!

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.265
TONY JACOBS: So yeah.

00:19:24.265 --> 00:19:26.290
And with the simulator we built
here you can probably

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.700
see the my button got tiny.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.420
It's going to play the video
actually in here so that's

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.040
somewhat distracting
for the Hangout.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.110
But everything just works
in real time.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:43.090
And the other really neat
thing, and this isn't

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:48.000
necessarily so obvious for
developers but for content

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.830
creators, the biggest step in
the entire process is getting

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:56.680
your end brand, in this case
Brand X, getting the guy in

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.600
charge of marketing at Brand X
to say, yes I approve this

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.620
visual look and feel.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.020
So one of the really big
features we've built into the

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.830
system is the cops.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.580
What's it going to look like?

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.540
So if Mr. Important over at
Brand X says, I love it, ship

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.725
it, then a few moments later we
have apps and we can submit

00:20:16.725 --> 00:20:21.530
to Apple and Google Play and
everywhere else who requires

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.040
such things.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:23.840
JJ BEHRENS: That's
pretty cool.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.920
Now I'm going to overlook the
fact that you have a beautiful

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:32.820
UI, an extremely interesting
software stack, and ask the

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.450
real question that every
developer out there

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:37.170
is wanting to think.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:40.300
Not whether you use Emacs or
vi, but rather what's the

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.880
intermediary format?

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.140
What is the file format that
you use to save information

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.060
about the app that's being
developed and then interpret

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.270
that later?

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.000
TONY JACOBS: Well I'll go ahead
and I'll rattle through

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:51.740
the whole list.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:56.010
Personally I debug in vi
and I code in Emacs.

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:58.020
Other folks use Eclipse here.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:02.550
So we go both ways.

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:07.910
As far as how the app stack
is built, it's a web app.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:11.320
It's actually using all
the modern stuff.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.970
The back end is all JSON.

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:15.480
JJ BEHRENS: JSON, OK.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.580
TONY JACOBS: Yeah, so
there's the super

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:20.580
secret mode where, if--

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.370
JJ BEHRENS: We lost
the Hangout.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.520
Let's go ahead and
rejoin that.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.650
Sorry guys.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:35.230
TONY JACOBS: --a whole shooting
match just as a

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.860
simulation on any of the devices
and that's how we get

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.040
everything in common
between everything.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.430
JJ BEHRENS: Now we lost you very
briefly and it was right

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:46.480
when you said something
about super secret.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:53.980
And I'm wondering, I'm just
wondering what happened there.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.650
TONY JACOBS: Well I have
one of my senior

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:58.730
developers in the room.

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.460
Maybe he waved some
magic wands.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:06.340
But what I did was,
I did this.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:09.190
And you can see me now, right?

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:12.410
But I was somewhat trying
to type in magic words.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.360
JJ BEHRENS: I see.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:20.280
TONY JACOBS: And then, kind of
looking at the back end, and

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:25.700
this is the actual description
of how everything's working in

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.210
the system, complete with such
such greatest hits as widths

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:31.500
and heights and image asset
IDs and all that jazz.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:32.300
JJ BEHRENS: OK, great.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.720
And you're storing this JSON
in a data store such as

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.150
MongoDB or CouchDB or
something like that?

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.570
TONY JACOBS: Last I looked
it was MySQL but--

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:43.150
JJ BEHRENS: MySQL, wow.

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:44.690
TONY JACOBS: --I think that
was just the one that was

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:47.080
picked at the arbitrary
time it was picked.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.666
But it's all generated
in real time.

00:22:49.666 --> 00:22:53.006
Like you use the visual
tools in your editing.

00:22:53.006 --> 00:22:55.660
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Hey Tony
I have one question.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.560
You mentioned and you showed
that playback is supported.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.100
What other YouTube actions are
supported by the builder and

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.740
by the app?

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:08.630
TONY JACOBS: So in the version
we've published today online--

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:10.050
and anyone can go to
it by going to

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:11.300
designer.gloto.com of course--

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:17.340
that supports, let's
have a look.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.170
Using YouTube it's doing
keywords so it uploads to your

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:21.680
personal account.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.160
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So you can
add an upload widget to the

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.775
app and when someone hits a
button it will actually pop up

00:23:27.775 --> 00:23:31.400
a window for camera
and metadata?

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:31.680
TONY JACOBS: Exactly.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:37.940
And that I'm calling a form
screen in the tool here.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:42.410
This is where on our terms and
condition URLs we let you type

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:46.000
in metadata such as name,
email address,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.620
et cetera, et cetera.

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:53.580
Now if you're doing a campaign
with YouTube you have to

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.860
actually read and understand
the YouTube terms and

00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:00.780
conditions and they place a fair
amount of requirements

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.110
about not being creepy and
stealing people's data and

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:04.150
that kind of stuff.

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:07.980
So these forms are going
to actually honor that.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:11.200
So as long as you're not hacking
too badly in the

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:16.330
secret mode you should be able
to basically pass muster with

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.350
YouTube legal as a result
of doing this.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:20.310
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool, so the
idea is if you want to run a

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:23.790
UGC campaign of some sort, and
still have brand elements of

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:26.380
your brand, and you don't want
to spend a lot of time

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.500
building the app, you could just
use the tool and generate

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.250
the app effectively, right?

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:32.500
TONY JACOBS: Yeah.

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:38.060
If your creative guys have done
their work right and they

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:41.990
hand you a nice, layered
Photoshop file, we're talking

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.610
about a 30 minute exercise,
and you have an app.

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:47.080
JJ BEHRENS: That's
pretty awesome.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.940
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right,
that's very interesting.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.200
Any other features you
wanted to show us?

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.060
I know you have something that
is quite visual and I'm dying

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:54.910
to see it again.

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:58.400
TONY JACOBS: So I have another
totally different thing where,

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.370
instead of being designed for
an app this is actually much

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:04.630
more of a web experience,
although it works fine in

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:06.670
HTML5 on your mobile
devices as well.

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:08.360
And I'm just going to ahead
and pull up one

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.000
of these photo mosaics.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.190
This concrete example
I've built here--

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:18.010
I probably shouldn't
use that one.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:19.660
I'll just go ahead load
a [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:20.910
one.

00:25:27.412 --> 00:25:28.768
You've gotta be kidding me.

00:25:28.768 --> 00:25:32.170
OK, Mosaic X, not the best.

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:33.520
Wow, this is hard.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.470
I'll just do that other one.

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:38.780
So in this example, what it's
doing is it's actually

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:43.600
ingesting photos that
people upload.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.920
But in addition it's
incorporating YouTube videos

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:55.170
and basically any other visual
data sources that we can find

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.970
and it's building, basically,
an on-the-fly, real-time

00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:01.320
mosaic built out of this where
I can go and click and get

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.940
more information about all
the individual scenes

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:05.590
that are going on.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:12.070
And this applies to videos, it
does pictures, I'm trying to

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.350
find one that actually
has a video built in.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:17.030
In this case, we're literally
playing videos

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.430
directly in the app.

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:24.920
We support in the designer
part of this, as you're

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.620
building a individual mosaic and
you're going through the

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.450
various controls, we're actually
providing very

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:37.480
fine-grained detail about how
the YouTube integration is

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.030
plugged in.

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:41.920
And let me just pull up that
specific concrete example.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.870
So whenever you're plugging in
a web version of the YouTube

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:48.330
player you have things like
autoplay or whether you're

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:49.490
showing related.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:55.860
And that's obviously a very big
deal for a brand campaign

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.250
where you may not want to show
related videos, you may want

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:01.400
to get YouTube video views so
you don't want to autoplay, or

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.990
you may not care depending
on if it's a call

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:04.150
to action or not.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:06.450
So that kind of fine-grained
functionally

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:08.080
was just built in.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.530
So if you want to make, let's
say you want to do a full

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:14.570
campaign where you have users
upload video using their

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:19.950
mobile devices, PC web
experiences to do call to

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:22.430
actions, and then when
everything's all said and done

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:26.470
a mosaic of everybody's
submissions across the board

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:28.720
and share that and
try and be viral.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.630
All the various pieces of that
puzzle are built right here.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:33.510
JJ BEHRENS: That's
pretty cool.

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:34.940
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.500
JJ BEHRENS: So I want to give
Guy from Groovideo a chance to

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:42.820
talk before we have to
start winding down.

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.940
Thanks a lot, Tony.

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.800
Guy, you're back online?

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.870
GUY ZISMAN: Yeah.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:48.770
Yeah, yeah.

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:49.520
Can you hear me?

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.120
JJ BEHRENS: Yup, yup.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:51.680
GUY ZISMAN: OK, great.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:57.640
So I'll have another try here
with showing you my desktop.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.547
Hope it will go well.

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:04.600
So you have--

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.930
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah I can see
myself and that might have

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:09.410
been what broke it.

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:11.735
GUY ZISMAN: No actually a
different [INAUDIBLE] this

00:28:11.735 --> 00:28:14.275
time so that's great.

00:28:14.275 --> 00:28:21.070
OK, so here we are on
Groovideo's homepage.

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:26.530
As I said, we're kind of
concentrating now on allowing

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:28.160
people to make birthday
videos.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:32.430
So that's the whole thing that
you get from the entire site.

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:38.280
Real soon you'll be able to do
any other type of videos.

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:44.540
Things like graduation videos
or any freestyle, let's say.

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:48.570
We don't know how to guess
what's your next event.

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.700
I would like to let
you decide that.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.340
So that's another thing
that we will have.

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:58.710
So let's start with
making a video.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.230
Just a second.

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:13.870
Here in development mode.

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:18.390
So as you can see, we are
starting off with

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.485
choosing the recipient.

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:27.810
By the way, I'm already signed
in via Facebook so I have here

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:32.050
the information of friends that
have birthdays real soon

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:37.520
as of today or a few
couple weeks.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:42.930
So let's start with a friend,
a colleague from my

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:46.910
startup named Roi.

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:52.910
So Roi, here we are.

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:58.260
So as opposed to your wife
situation, I do have his

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:02.910
birthday here filled in.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:07.020
I'll go ahead and choose other
participants to take part in

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:07.840
this video.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.660
So I'll have another colleague
from my startup

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:14.570
join in named Ron.

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:18.970
Excellent.

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:22.880
And another member
would be Karen.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:27.940
By the way you'll see me here
getting two participants, but

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:32.020
as we see for the past month
from videos being created you

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:37.160
see people inviting 60, 70,
even 80 participants.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.320
Yeah, that's amazing.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:45.010
And the participation ratio
is also quite amazing.

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:48.620
It can get to about half of
the people joining in.

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:49.993
JJ BEHRENS: That's
pretty good.

00:30:49.993 --> 00:30:53.810
GUY ZISMAN: Yeah for the amounts
I've just mentioned.

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:57.220
Kind of breaking the assumptions
we had in the

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.300
first place.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.730
And makes the whole experience
from our side really exciting

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:08.410
because that means we just
have to see how we can

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:13.090
generate such a video with let's
say 30 participants.

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:13.760
So yeah.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.710
Quite a challenge for
us but we enjoy it.

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:24.710
Moving forward, I have a small
selection of sound clips here,

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:27.020
mostly pop.

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:30.710
Things from The Beatles
to Stevie Wonder.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:35.785
So let's have Stevie Wonder
accompanying our video.

00:31:35.785 --> 00:31:40.080
We can hear him here, you won't
be able to because I

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.450
have it on my earphones.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:54.080
Keeping it on, actually due to
technicality issues of me

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:57.950
making the Hangout right
now with you, the

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:00.660
camera is quite occupied.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.566
So I won't be able to record but
do believe me as I click

00:32:03.566 --> 00:32:09.200
here, record, being
brought here our

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.490
recorder and with tips.

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:15.770
And I'm asked to add a greeting,
I have about 15

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:21.330
seconds as you can see right
here, to say whatever I want.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:26.120
Afterwards as I said our
algorithm will be able to

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:30.450
extract a bit of speech, text,
and a bit of machine learning

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:35.190
going there and to get the
essence and detect the

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:38.910
preferrable readings that we'd
like to have because as I

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:43.100
mentioned we have to decide
this stuff with 30

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.650
participants.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:48.740
No room for everyone.

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.330
So that's that.

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:55.260
So let's assume I've just
recorded a segment here.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:33:01.950
Moving on, it detected that
I didn't record anything

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:03.200
so just skip it.

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.770
And that's it.

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:13.090
That's the whole process
of creating a video.

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:16.350
I'm here writing a message to
display the invitation that

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:21.960
our invitees will get here,
Karen and Ron, via Facebook

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.090
and via email.

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:27.480
And also if they have our
Groovideo iPhone app they'll

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.860
also get a notification.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:31.890
And that's it.

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:33.880
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Can they
record on the iPhone as well

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:36.442
or is it web based only?

00:33:36.442 --> 00:33:40.200
GUY ZISMAN: They can record
on the iPhone as well.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:44.360
And real soon they will also be
able to create the same way

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.630
I'm creating it here,
a whole new video.

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:51.100
They'll be able to do so in
about a week from now.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:55.660
So we're really excited with all
functionality being equal

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.610
with two clients.

00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:59.450
That's that.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:01.430
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: You mean the
actual scheduling of the

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:05.210
creation of the invite will be
possible on the mobile client

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:06.910
as well as the web client?

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:07.394
GUY ZISMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:34:07.394 --> 00:34:08.846
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Oh,
that's really cool.

00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:12.469
GUY ZISMAN: Yeah, with the
current version, you mentioned

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:20.800
the HTML and native hybrid
with the iPhone apps.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:25.210
Actually the current version
we have is hybrid.

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:29.989
We have the ability to join into
existing videos through

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:37.179
the iPhone app and to create
new ones via an HTML file.

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:42.909
After a period we spent with
that we got the sense that

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:46.449
this kind of operation would
be preferable to do on a

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:47.540
native version.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.630
So that's the update I'm talking
about that will come

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:56.330
in a week, 100% native app that
allows you to create a

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:59.420
new Groovideo or participate
in an existing one.

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:02.310
So moving on, that's it,
I'm finished here.

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:09.450
And let's just jump ahead
to such a video.

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:14.340
I have here a video that was
released about four days ago,

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:18.120
as you see, for a
girl named Maya.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:26.850
We can see here that we have 23
participants and 21 others

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:30.880
than didn't have the chance
to join in yet.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:36.270
But just understand this kind
of video is being mixed

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:41.570
together and being made in
about, let's say, half a day.

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:45.420
Half a day, talking about from
the moment that the video

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:49.750
started and created to the
moment that every participant

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:52.780
you see here joined in.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:54.290
JJ BEHRENS: That's pretty
impressive because it

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:56.690
generally takes my friends
about half a day just to

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:59.370
figure out where to
go to for lunch.

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:04.100
GUY ZISMAN: Right so that's a
record we have here and we're

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.870
really excited about that.

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:11.520
Also, if I didn't mention it
before, the coolest thing here

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:16.210
is that from the moment you
record yourself as initiator

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:19.730
to the moment the last
participant joins in, at each

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:22.760
and every given moment we
have the most updated

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.430
version of the video.

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:27.840
That is, two participants join
in, we already have a video

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.290
mixed in with them.

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:32.420
Five participants, we already
have them in.

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:36.720
That way we allow new
participants, invitees, to

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.800
enjoy the current state of the
video and to see what happens

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.350
after they join.

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:44.040
GUY ZISMAN: That's got
to be a lot of fun

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:44.450
GUY ZISMAN: Yeah.

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:46.240
So let's see a final
version here.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:51.860
I hope it will go well here
on our screen sharing.

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:05.920
So we have all sorts of places,
locations, and things

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.460
that the people are
doing here.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:14.540
From a muppet show to dancing
in the middle of the street

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:20.180
and their houses and the park.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:21.990
Really exciting.

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:23.550
JJ BEHRENS: Nothing says
happy birthday more

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:24.850
than a muppet show.

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:26.640
I definitely think that.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:27.340
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
This is pretty

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.160
groovy, everybody's dancing.

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.220
JJ BEHRENS: I know, it's
pretty awesome.

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:32.310
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So this is
a dancing app, basically.

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:35.630
GUY ZISMAN: And what actually
you have been missing out here

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:42.736
that I've now turned off my
headphones and you'll be able

00:37:42.736 --> 00:37:48.305
also to hear it I hope.

00:37:48.305 --> 00:37:50.230
JJ BEHRENS: Yup.

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:54.310
GUY ZISMAN: So here we have
the people greet in

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:57.270
Hebrew in this case.

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:59.970
But you have to believe
me that they do

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:03.280
greet the girl here.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.565
And that's that.

00:38:06.565 --> 00:38:10.010
That's a bit of an
example for that.

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:10.480
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.871
JJ BEHRENS: That's
pretty awesome.

00:38:12.871 --> 00:38:14.155
GUY ZISMAN: Yeah.

00:38:14.155 --> 00:38:18.440
And we also get responses
from the

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:21.550
recipients of these videos.

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:24.000
People are super excited.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.340
Super excited, thrilled, and
about to burst in tears as

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:29.920
they get this.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.960
Mostly the girls,
I have to say.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.610
But yeah.

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:36.716
Super cool gift to give.

00:38:36.716 --> 00:38:37.470
JJ BEHRENS: That's
pretty awesome.

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:39.050
TONY JACOBS: Now as
I move forward--

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:40.035
Sorry?

00:38:40.035 --> 00:38:41.280
JJ BEHRENS: Go ahead.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:45.180
GUY ZISMAN: Yeah, so as I move
forward we have this little

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:51.660
friend here called YouTube that
allows us lots of videos

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:56.950
published, to export it
to your own channel if

00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:58.420
you wish to do so.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:04.640
And don't direct the traffic
or let's say the visitors,

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.690
your friends, to this
page, specifically.

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:11.620
You are able to go ahead and
export to your own channel.

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:12.000
JJ BEHRENS: Excellent.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:12.740
We like to see that.

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:13.556
Don't we, Jarek?

00:39:13.556 --> 00:39:15.070
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah,
that's pretty awesome.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.536
JJ BEHRENS: So, Guy.

00:39:19.536 --> 00:39:20.410
GUY ZISMAN: Here we have--

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:21.570
Sorry?

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:24.280
JJ BEHRENS: I'm super excited
about this but I think we have

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:27.300
13 minutes left and Jarek has
pointed out that we actually

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:28.680
have questions.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.000
So why don't we try to take
those and why don't you guys

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.870
stay online just in case any
of these questions are

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:36.490
directed at you guys.

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:38.130
Jarek, I can't read those
from here but maybe

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:38.810
you could read them.

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:40.360
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool,
so let's just go

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.340
right through it.

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:43.926
JJ BEHRENS: Do you want
to screen share?

00:39:43.926 --> 00:39:44.800
I don't know.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.880
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I'm in the
moderator, let's see.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.665
Maybe I will be able to
find it in the stream.

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:07.110
JJ BEHRENS: OK.

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:10.190
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So the first
one is about adding endSeconds

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:13.800
support to the YouTube
player API.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:21.380
We recently added an and equals
parameter to the player

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:25.920
ParamSet, which allows one to
basically stop playback.

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.620
Starting playback at a specific
point was available

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:31.800
for quite some time.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.350
I would recommend for this use
case though to just use the

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:34.980
player API.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:39.130
So if you're using the player
API already then you can set

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:44.580
up a JavaScript timer and have
it fire at a specific time.

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:49.060
We don't currently have an
endSeconds support added and I

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:52.100
would say it's probably not
going to happen anytime soon

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:56.070
since there's infrastructure
in place to achieve that

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:57.570
programatically.

00:40:57.570 --> 00:41:00.780
But again if you guys feel very
strongly about this I

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:03.360
would encourage you to
maybe file a feature

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.270
request in our tracker.

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:10.460
If enough folks star that then
we'll definitely follow up and

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:11.570
see if this is something
we could add.

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:14.450
But the good news is it is
actually possible to do this

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:16.010
already with the API.

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:17.550
JJ BEHRENS: I think they might
have to be a little bit more

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:20.920
careful rather than just using
a JavaScript timer.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:24.020
Because if someone hits stop in
then video, they'll have to

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:24.900
take account of that.

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:28.040
So maybe set up a timer and
then when the timer hits,

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.850
check if the video is that
far along and then pause

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:31.930
if it's, you know.

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:32.150
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Good point.

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:34.370
So it is a little tricky.

00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:35.290
But it is possible.

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:36.800
JJ BEHRENS: Definitely doable.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.270
It is Turing complete.

00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:41.120
I've checked myself.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.530
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: The second
question is about using

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:46.440
YouTube iFrame API in
Chrome extensions.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:50.580
And I looked at the Stack
Overflow question in some more

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:53.540
detail while we were talking
but I don't really have an

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:55.160
answer right now.

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:58.415
So I think we're going to have
to follow up off the air with

00:41:58.415 --> 00:42:03.320
our Chrome folks to see what
the actual issue is.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.100
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah.

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:08.120
Maybe you could perhaps
post this to the

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.370
users' group, the forum.

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:13.720
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: This
one is repeated.

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:17.500
So the following question
is for Gloto.

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.850
And Tony, I'm not sure if
you can see it but I can

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:21.120
just read it to you.

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.970
"Does Gloto create content in
some standard format for

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:26.570
playback so it can be integrated
into other content

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:30.040
presentation systems?"

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.646
TONY JACOBS: Well,
can you hear me?

00:42:32.646 --> 00:42:33.558
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah.

00:42:33.558 --> 00:42:34.470
TONY JACOBS: OK.

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:35.160
Yeah.

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:42.540
It is in JSON and the internal
representation is designed to

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:44.200
be machine-readable.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:50.950
So it's a combination of the
actions to be taken and the

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:53.800
presentation of it, which of
course makes a lot of sense

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.495
for building a web and--

00:42:55.495 --> 00:42:57.190
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: But that
someone would have to

00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:58.850
implement the runtime, right?

00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:02.740
What about if they just want
to reshare the presentation

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:03.570
layer only?

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:06.520
Like is there a Gloto embed
for the web so I

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:09.010
can just embed it?

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:11.180
How would I use the mosaic,
for example?

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:13.140
TONY JACOBS: Yeah, well we're
doing-- that is our own

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:16.520
simulation so that we
can walk through it.

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.480
Like that's basically a minimum

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.790
implementation of that runtime.

00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:27.320
As I said, the structure itself
is well formed and a

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:31.360
content management system could
present it in a more

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:32.820
web-y kind of way.

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:36.090
But in the end, the purpose of
these experiences for the

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:41.390
uploader is really to make an
app to send content into some

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:43.660
other CMS like YouTube.

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:47.050
So it doesn't necessarily make
sense that you'd want to take

00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:51.490
the mobile uploader intermediate
language and

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:56.050
present that in a new way, as
much as actually look at the

00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:59.350
YouTube playlists that are
generated through moderation

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:00.130
and all that jazz.

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:00.820
Or look at the--

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.150
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: But if the
final results, say the mosaic,

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:09.680
if I want to include it into
some CMS that publishes to the

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.920
web, I could do that, right?

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.670
I mean is there web embed
or something?

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:14.592
JJ BEHRENS: So like an iFrame?

00:44:14.592 --> 00:44:15.950
TONY JACOBS: [INAUDIBLE]
iFramed.

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:16.320
JJ BEHRENS: OK.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.650
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Oh, great.

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:18.830
JJ BEHRENS: We love iFrames.

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:20.200
I love iFrames.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.690
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: iFrames
are handy.

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:22.550
Thanks, Tony.

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:26.200
Let's look at what other
questions we have.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.950
So there's a question about
synchronizing YouTube comments

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:34.220
and G+ comments.

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:37.130
JJ, you want to address
this one?

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:41.780
JJ BEHRENS: Sure, well,
stay tuned.

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:46.700
I think YouTube and Google+ are
part of the same company,

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:48.540
and I think that we're going
to see more and more

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:52.170
integration going forward, and
we'd like to see one smooth

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:57.040
user experience across all of
our different products.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.470
So that's all I can
say I think.

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:01.390
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:03.120
All right, so I think
we have covered

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:04.800
the moderator questions.

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:11.940
If anything else comes up please
let us know over G+ or

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:18.060
join us for the next question
session online.

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.160
Actually, there's one more than

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:22.510
just came in for Groovideo.

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:24.760
So Guy, while we have
you online.

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:26.180
"How is the video remixed?

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:29.290
Does it happen manually by the
creator?" And I think you

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:31.950
talked a little bit about it
during the presentation, maybe

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:34.640
you could just recap it.

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:38.510
GUY ZISMAN: Yeah, so
just a couple more

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:40.890
sentences about that.

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:46.210
The things we realized is that
people would like to avoid the

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:51.070
headache of handling an editing
system, understanding

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:55.900
these timelines, and how to put
and align everything, and

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:56.920
blah, blah, blah.

00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:01.005
Make it look adorable, make it
look like something that you

00:46:01.005 --> 00:46:04.250
would like to show to your
friends or enjoy yourself.

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:10.480
So our idea is to take it out
of the way and make it all

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:18.920
magically and automatically
without any human touch.

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:20.650
That's the way we
do it right now.

00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:28.390
But we will let our people to
make more accurate decisions

00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:32.590
in the future for, let's say,
those advanced users, those

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:35.080
that do know how to
handle video.

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:39.180
So that's us in the future.

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:41.800
JJ BEHRENS: It's definitely
pretty Google-y to take a

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:45.390
hard, computational task and
just automate it with smarter

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:45.910
algorithms.

00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:49.620
So thumbs up for that one.

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:50.440
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Two thumbs up.

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.810
JJ BEHRENS: So I know that
we're running out of time

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:56.900
pretty quickly and so we might
have to punt on the Google I/O

00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:59.840
recap but I just wanted
to give you guys--

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:03.080
do either of you have any final
closing comments before

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:04.330
we wrap it up?

00:47:06.846 --> 00:47:09.630
GUY ZISMAN: I do have one.

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:17.020
I like the idea that you, JJ,
lead the Ruby community from

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:19.545
inside of YouTube and Google.

00:47:19.545 --> 00:47:21.290
Keep up the good work.

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:23.380
JJ BEHRENS: Thank
you, thank you.

00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:28.440
GUY ZISMAN: I hope to
see a solid Ruby

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:34.220
client for version 3.

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.830
JJ BEHRENS: That story is about
to get a lot better.

00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:38.285
GUY ZISMAN: Excellent.

00:47:38.285 --> 00:47:40.430
JJ BEHRENS: Awesome.

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:42.750
Yeah, there are definitely a
lot of Ruby programmers out

00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:46.000
there who like that video.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.420
TONY JACOBS: From Gloto, we are
really happy with where

00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:57.870
things are going with the
Android player API and we're

00:47:57.870 --> 00:48:01.500
extremely pleased with
that process.

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:04.790
So overall we're pretty stoked
to be working on these

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:06.190
projects right now.

00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:06.570
GUY ZISMAN: OK.

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:09.870
I will be sure to give you your
free Google lunch later

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:11.120
for making that statement.

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:17.001
Jarek, anything else?

00:48:17.001 --> 00:48:17.400
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: No.

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:20.170
I think, as you mentioned, we
ran out of time so we'll

00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:23.410
probably do the Google
I/O recap next time.

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:27.640
Just, in a nutshell, I think we
had a very good I/O. A lot

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:30.820
of interesting sessions and they
are all available online

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.850
if you would like to
check them out.

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:36.570
And if you missed Google I/O, in
fact the two sessions that

00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:39.840
our guests alluded to today
are both available online.

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:45.180
So the Ruby on Rails and YouTube
API video is the first

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:47.070
video in the playlist that
we have embedded on

00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:50.820
youtube.com/dev and where JJ
gives an overview of how you

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:53.170
use YouTube APIs with Ruby.

00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:56.400
And he also mentioned we're
actually making some

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:59.670
improvements to our platform
that will make it even more

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:02.840
easy to use various client
libraries with

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:05.270
our APIs, Ruby included.

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:09.890
And then the sessions that Tony
mentioned, new YouTube

00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:14.340
Android player API tools was
a very interesting session.

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:16.110
In fact, I would highly
encourage you

00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:17.580
to watch the demo.

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:21.680
There's an interesting workout
app and if you can actually

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:28.130
repeat what was done live on
stage in that session then I

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:30.070
would like to invite
you to lunch.

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:32.440
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, I tried that,
Buddy, and my back's

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:33.810
been hurting ever since.

00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:34.120
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.770
So it's a very entertaining
session.

00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:37.250
It has received many views.

00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:39.300
I think last time I checked,
about 13,000 views.

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:44.790
So obviously that feature is
widely anticipated and we are

00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:46.050
very excited about it as well.

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:48.150
And we'll talk about
in more detail,

00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:49.660
maybe at our next Hangout.

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:52.090
In the meantime, check
out the videos.

00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:53.530
I think they are quite
fun to watch.

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:56.160
JJ BEHRENS: And I really say
that if anyone out there

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:59.940
hasn't seen the Google I/O
keynote with the whole

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.840
business of jumping out of
blimps and landing on Moscone

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:04.970
Center, you must watch
that video.

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:09.450
It is like the awesome-est
thing ever.

00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:10.020
Pretty sweet.

00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:10.900
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yup.

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:13.920
JJ BEHRENS: So thank you guys
for all of your time.

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.730
That was a fantastic session.

00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:18.630
And thank you guys for all
of your questions.

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:22.571
We will see you next time
in two weeks or so, huh?

00:50:22.571 --> 00:50:23.030
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yup.

00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:25.445
JJ BEHRENS: So take care guys.

00:50:25.445 --> 00:50:26.160
GUY ZISMAN: Thank you.

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.410
Bye.
