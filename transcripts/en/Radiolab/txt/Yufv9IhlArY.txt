Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and we're back. Now I'm going to take you back live on stage at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. And this next story you'll hear some references to some pictures, which obviously you won't be able to see, but we've got them for you@radiolab.org um, so we wanna finish the night with a salute to a guy who's been on our program and part of our family pretty much from the beginning. I have known him for more than 35 years. Early on when radio lab started, I asked him if he'd help us out and send us a few story ideas. He didn't send us a few. He sent us bushels, tales of chemistry and medicine, hallucinations, music people, so many extraordinary people that he knew or found or help cause the guy just doesn't run out. Dr. Oliver Sacks,

Speaker 2:          00:45          your honor, [inaudible] is a guy who noticed it.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Everything is deeply interested in everything that happens around him and to him. And tonight we're bringing them back on tape for what lasts may be his final offering for us. As many of you know, Dr Sachs recently was diagnosed with liver cancer and he wrote about this in the New York Times. He said he plans to spend the time that he has a left writing, being with friends, not doing interviews, but he did agree to share his thoughts exclusively with, with us tonight for you gathered here. Um, cause he's one of our family. So as I've done for decades now, I went over to his house in Manhattan with my mic and I said to him, I just need to know what, what just happened a month and a half ago. You were fine. And then what? Um, at the beginning of the year I was fine. On the 3rd of January I felt a little queer and I pass some dark urine. I thought I had a little gallbladder attack and um, didn't pay that much attention,

Speaker 3:          01:53          but thought I better get things checked. And um, the extra which was expected. Ou need to show a couple of gallstones, showed hundreds of cysts in my liver. Uh, although my doctor said he didn't know what the, here's one, I would need further tests. I, I knew what they were. I said it's happened.

Speaker 1:          02:20          And he was right. The doctors eventually confirmed that a cancer that had been found in his eye nine years ago had spread to his liver. Where you

Speaker 3:          02:29          frightened or relieved or console or what, what? No, I am,

Speaker 3:          02:38          I think my first feeling was one of, of overwhelming sadness. Um, now all sorts of things I won't see. Um, and I won't do one or two people have written to me in the, you know, consoling me and said, well, you know, we all die, but fuck it. It's not like we all die. It's like you have four months. Has that, has your PR, what is your prognosis at this moment? Cause I know you had an [inaudible] well, it, it gets revised. It depends of course, on how the cancer responds to treatments and or how quickly it spreads so far. Um, the metasticies from my eye, only in my liver, I'm told they love liver. Actually, I love liver as well. And one of the magical things I did was to go and, and have lived one Allianz sued after the doctors and thinking that liberal looks better than mine.

Speaker 3:          03:37          He, this is what he's like, instead of being frightened by the thing that's trying to kill him, he's thinking about loving liver and liver lovers and looking for connections and wondering if he doesn't stop. He, he just notices that the case in point a few months ago, his doctor said to him, we're going to run a line up your liver and in effect we're going to try to shave off or starve some of the cancer cells first on one side, then on the other to see if we can give you a little more time. But they weren't him as the metasticies die. They put out various unpleasant chemicals that may exhaust you, tax your system badly. And um, at one point, shortly after the procedures, I started talking a little strangely and um, as I was talking, I was also writing, um, you will be the first person to see this.

Speaker 3:          04:24          So he showed me a notebook and were showing it to you in just a moment. You can see they're sort of writing there on the left. It's all he's writing a book, actually a children's book about the elementary table, but as he was writing, if you, if you look to the next page, if you can see that it gets a little bit wobbly, the letters and then, and then there was some crossing out there. Yes, I see it. And then rather dramatically the lighting changes it actually there's, there's a large slash across it and then you, it seems a little incoherent and the partners, okay. And then it turns to pure scribble that has delirium and crept up on me. All this happened over the course of 10 minutes and I see what he's doing here. He's figuring, okay, I'm writing at a constant speed.

Speaker 3:          05:14          I know pretty much how fast I, right. And so I can time this out. I can figure out exactly how long it took me to slip into delirium and then out of this delirium and he's doing this very, very sick man. It's science to write it out in a more medical way. I think this would form a lovely illustration. You put in a timeline of delirium just coming like that. Why aren't you more frantic? Unusual for any doctor and a man of science. You don't seem to worry at all when things become incoherent or strange. You're now showing it to me as if like, Ooh how interesting. I was crazy here for a little bit. Um, the truth is Oliver is fascinated by what goes on in the human mind no matter how strange he gets up there

Speaker 1:          05:58          at one time when he was a young resident in California driving his bike. And by the way, I should show you what he looked like back then when he was driving his bike. This I think is him in New York. Uh, Kinda, you know, in the 60s he was also a champion weightlifter. They called him Dr Squat. And in this picture that you show you here, that's him raising 600 pounds in order to win a trophy. Like, this is a, the, he was a champ and, and you can see more pictures like these cause we have signed copies of Oliver's new memoir out for sale in the lobby. It's pretty good book too by the way. So in any case at this time, and then 1960s, in addition to being all muscled out, Oliver was a serious recreational drug taker. And because he's Oliver, he was extremely curious about his highs no matter how weird they were. One time for example, he took 20 pills that he shouldn't have. And then

Speaker 3:          06:53          to my surprise, um, uh, there was a spider on the wall which said hello. It had a voice like and famous mathematician and it, um, it asked me a lot of the technical question as to where the Russell had exploded for egos paradox. And, um, we had this conversation answered the spider, I'm sure I onto the spine discussed fragrance paradox with this minor. I didn't deed Chris, you, you trust your perceptions. Okay. Many years later when I mentioned this to an entomologist friend of Cornell and the philosophical spider, he said, yes. He said, I know the species.

Speaker 1:          07:36          So thinking Oliver's way, taking it all in, talking spiders, whatever. The generosity of his curiosity becomes profound. The moving and transformative when he's treating his patients. I want to tell one story here really quickly to, to demonstrate what I mean. Oliver once had a patient whom he called Mrs o c she was an old woman. She was 88 years old, living in a nursing home and one night she was awakened, jarred awake by a loud sound.

Speaker 2:          08:08          Um,

Speaker 1:          08:10          it was a song

Speaker 2:          08:13          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          08:14          and she thought, well, somebody's left the radio on, but when she looked, the media in the room was off, her roommate sound asleep, which was odd because the song was really loud. Good. Doris. After that, there was another song.

Speaker 2:          08:31          Ah,

Speaker 1:          08:31          and then another song is a home. Great. Mrs [inaudible] thought, well, maybe my roommate can't hear the songs because the songs are, are coming through the fillings in my teeth. I've heard that's possible. But no, her doctors told her, this is something in your head. You need to see a neurologist, which led her to Dr Sachs.

Speaker 1:          08:52          Now. When he met Mrs Ossi, he, she could barely hear the song sung by the female voice were coming and coming. She was frightened and justifiably worried that she was going crazy, but Oliver said, no, no, no, I'm going to do some tests. And when he was done, he said he'd found a slight stroke or condition that had triggered musical epilepsy. These sudden production of music in her brain. Now a normal doctor might say, okay, we've got the diagnosis, and he thought that the songs would probably fade and it will pass, so they would be done. But Oliver did not stop. He doesn't stop

Speaker 3:          09:25          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          09:25          he kept talking to her. She told him she was born in Ireland in the 1890s her father died before she was born. Her mother, when she was only five

Speaker 3:          09:35          often alone, she was sent to America to live for the welder for beating maiden. She had no conscious memory as the first five years of her life, no memory of her mother of Ireland. She had always felt this as a key in and painful sadness, this lack or forgetting of the earliest, most precious years of her life.

Speaker 1:          09:57          So we asked her about the songs, what are they like? And Mrs [inaudible] said, well, I think they're lullabies. Can you sing them for me? She did. And then after checking with, I'm not sure who Oliver figured out that these songs were happened to be popular Irish ballads from the 1890s when Mrs OSI was a little baby. And that gave him an idea. Now what he does next isn't science. It isn't in any traditional way medicine. He just told her a story and it goes like this. You know how nobody remembers anything that happens to you when you're one or two or three? Well, there was a theory once, not honored much today, but it's sad that those earliest memories get locked away, deepen our brains in a special safe that we can never open. So let's suppose Mrs o c your stroke by some crazy chance open the lock that none of us can break and release those first memories in you just for a little while. So that the voice you're listening to,

Speaker 4:          10:54          there's at home by grade a, then Mo,

Speaker 1:          10:59          maybe that isn't a radio voice. Let's say that it's your mother's voice. That's your missing mother. And so at the ripe old age of 88 you finally get to be back in your mother's arms. You get to be a baby again. And Mrs [inaudible] thought about that and said, okay,

Speaker 3:          11:16          it sort of fits. I'm an old woman with a stroke in an old people's home, but I feel I'm a child to Kyle on the gate. I feel my mother's arms. I see her, I hear her voice soon,

Speaker 4:          11:30          the green, it clean.

Speaker 2:          11:32          Who's around run, sweetie.

Speaker 1:          11:38          Shortly thereafter, the songs began to fade. The pauses widened. Mrs OSI had been so frightened by this music in her head was now sorry to see the songs go. But it was Oliver who noticed how those songs had touched her, who noticed that the songs might become a comfort to her because that's what he does. He listens closely. He can hear another person's heart. And this is really the profound puzzle for me of Oliver because reading the new autobiography, you see that while he was so full of heart as a doctor in his own life and in the relationships that really mattered, it turns out he didn't get a whole lot of affection. He was for a long time, a lonely guy. I'd say he was very lonely and he's talking about that now for the first time. Let me, let me talk about love for a minute. Um, in this book you tell the story of your, of your very first love a fellow by the name of Richard Selleck. Can you just tell me that

Speaker 3:          12:34          what happened with him? Um, yeah. Um, he was a road scholar at Oxford and I'm a poet and handsome and beautiful beyond belief and I sort of fell for him. Um, although I didn't say anything because I was um, uh, very haunted by my mother's accusations. What did your mother, um, well to go a couple of years back then my father had opened a conversation, I was about to go to Oxford and have sort of father son conversation. And he said, um, we don't seem to have many girlfriends. And I said, no, wishing the conversation would stop. He said, um, something wrong with girls. And I said, no, that they're fine. Perhaps you prefer boys. And I said, well, yes I do. I said, I've never done anything, but I do. And then you knew that then I knew that. Then I'd known it for six years, probably since I was 12.

Speaker 3:          13:41          Um, and I said, don't tell mom she will be able to take it. But my father did tell my mother and the night and the next morning she came down with them. I somehow want to say a face of funder and raged at me. And among other things said, you're an abomination. I wish you had never been born. And then she suddenly shut up and said nothing for three days. And, um, uh, the matter was never mentioned again in her lifetime. And then two years later I found myself for the first time in my life falling in love.

Speaker 1:          14:24          This was the gun guy, Richard Oliver at the time was in college.

Speaker 3:          14:28          It was a very positive feeling though. I didn't know whether it was one, which I did express, but I did say, so with my heart and my mouth to Richard, what did you, you remember what you said? Uh, I said, I'm in love with you, Huh. And, uh, Richard gripped me by the shoulders and he said, I know he said, but I'm not that way, but I love you in my own. And um, I was glad I had said that I'm glad that it had been received in such a warm, friendly way. I thought we might be friends for the rest of our lives, but then one day he came into me, he said he'd been bothered by finding a lump in his groin and he was worried could I have a look at it? And I looked at it and I felt it and it was hard and tethered, uh, turned out to be a, a particularly malignant form of lymphoid to my, what was called the lympho sarcoma. And, um, he never spoke to me again after that. I don't know whether since I'd been the first to recognize the ominous import, I don't know whether he saw me as a harbinger of death or messenger of death, whatever. But you were left with the, with that silence. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:42          A few years later, Oliver met and man named Mel, he was young, he was a sailor. He like Oliver, he was into weightlifting, they became close friends and they began living together.

Speaker 3:          15:52          I adored him and was in love with him and loved physical contact with him

Speaker 1:          15:58          and they'd work out and they'd wrestle and ride motorcycles kind of tightly. And they never talked about what might or might not be happening between them. But one day they were together and Oliver was giving mil a back massage, which mill often asked him to do.

Speaker 3:          16:11          And uh, I love doing that. And Oliver says sometimes he'd get a little, you know, excited. And so long as I gave no explicit indication it was okay but, but, but one day things went a bit too far and I got sort of um, I went over the bridge instead of just before the big metal immediately sort of got up and had a shower and said, I, I can't stay with you anymore. And um, I found that very cruel and upsetting and heartbreaking and it made me feel I don't want to have anything to do with people. I must have fallen in love. I cannot share life's with anyone again.

Speaker 1:          16:55          And he didn't share his life with anyone for a long, long. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          17:00          In fact, he told me a story about something that happened to him maybe eight years ago. I was just joining the faculty at Columbia and I was having this interview and at one point the interviewer said to me, she said, I have something whether private to our school, we do like Ms Edgar, your system to leave. And I said, no, she's privy to all my affairs. And I then sent thinking she was going to ask me about six. I said, I haven't had any sex for 35 years. I bet in fact what she was going to ask me, my social security

Speaker 2:          17:40          and she burst into laughter. She said, Oh, you poor with this. She said, we must do something about it.

Speaker 1:          17:47          Well, the truth is Oliver, I didn't do about it because he didn't think he could. I mean he chosen, Richard Lost, Richard Chosen, Mel lost. Now it wasn't the point he was thinking. And then finally, and who knows when or why these things happen to people. But a man came along who for the first time chose Oliver.

Speaker 3:          18:06          I have met Billy is I meet a number of people because I'd been sent a manuscript or proof for book and um, intimacy grew between us. I don't think I quite realized how deep it was. But then there was a particular episode in Christmas of Oh nine when he came up and in a sort of serious way, he has a serious careful way. He said, I, I have conceived a deep love for you. I have conceived a deep love for you. Yeah. Um, there is a trait that's like, got a few extra words I have concealed. Okay. Was He scared to say I love you or um, no, he likes the English language.

Speaker 1:          18:56          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          18:56          I think it, I think it couldn't have been put, um, more cautiously and yet more strongly. I think it was a beautiful way of putting it. And then I realized at that moment with his saying that, that I had conceived a deep love for him and I am among other things. I thought, good God, it's happened again.

Speaker 2:          19:24          Two

Speaker 3:          19:25          and I'm in my 77th year and um, and, and what next

Speaker 5:          19:33          and the things, um, basically have gone happily ever since

Speaker 2:          19:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          19:44          and surprisingly look loosely. Um, because then again, I'm not dealing with, oh, what I'm dealing with or who I'm dealing with an individual. I'm not dealing with a, um, uh,

Speaker 3:          20:03          a condition defined by medicine or law.

Speaker 1:          20:07          So Oliver's still doesn't know how much time he has left. But for the moment, as you can hear, his mind is totally intact. He's still writing. He has two books in addition to the one you'll find in the lobby B that he's writing. Then the children's book, bunch of New Yorkers stories in the last few months and in New York review of books story, he's got energy to spare. So I want to do one last thing before we close and this comes from yet. Another conversation I had with him, and it's a story I know Oliver would hate because he's not a capital r religious kind of guy, but he is somebody who definitely embraces mystery and for a long time he's been mystified by a color called indigo, indigo, which hadn't suited

Speaker 3:          20:48          between blue and violet and no, no two people seem to agree as to what indigo was like. And so I built up a sort of chemical launchpad, meaning he took a lot of base of amphetamine from general a while, so then some assets and a little cannabis, and when I was sufficiently stoned I said I want to see

Speaker 1:          21:14          the indigo now

Speaker 2:          21:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          21:20          as if it were reply and does it phone by giant paintbrush. That appeared a huge trembling, pear shaped blob of what I instantly realized was pure indigo on the white wall in front of me. It had had a wonderful luminosity, and in particular I am, although I am not a religious person, I thought this is the color of heaven. And I lit towards it in a sort of ecstasy

Speaker 1:          21:53          and then suddenly disappeared. And he says he had one more moment like that. This time, no drugs. He was in a museum staring at an Egyptian artifact. He sees this re and color back again just for a beat.

Speaker 3:          22:05          I was given five tantalizing seconds of, of, of radiant, ineffable

Speaker 1:          22:11          beauty. And then again, it vanished. And that was in 1965 and I've never seen indigo since. But who knows? You know, someday I like to think Dr Sachs may get to see that color again.

Speaker 2:          22:48          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]
