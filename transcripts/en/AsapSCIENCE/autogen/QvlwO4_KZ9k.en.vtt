00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.080
 Meet a new person for a relationship, and once you shake it and know for yourself, 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.790
 So suddenly realize "a moment ... I forgot his name." Why does this always happen? 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.889
 And what is this forgetting about your brain? 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.359
 The possibilities are that you will remember the person's face more than his name - our brain is designed 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:21.140
 To know the details of the face. Brain scans show that brain cells are activated 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.430
 Responding to see someone's face. But if we come to forget the name, it may come back 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.710
 For what is known as the influence / factor of the baker. If I tell you that I am a baker, I give you 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.980
 I know what I'm doing, how I spend my time, but if I tell you my name, Baker 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.390
 Does not contain any useful mental link and the possibility of forgetting large. In the end random names 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.610
 Do not carry specific information. And if your brain can not build a link 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.960
 Between multiple pieces of information, especially things you already know or familiar with, 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.219
 The probability of forgetting information is very large 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.050
 It also will not help you think and concentrate in presenting yourself. This 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.329
 It is known as the following Affinity Factor / Effect. Instead of following and listening to the person 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.700
 The other one, your brain begins to focus on its routine or role (what you will say, how 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.340
 Etc.) and we are simply not good at disseminating information at the same time we are trying to save new information 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.220
 Our brain contains both long and short-term memory 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.600
 But short-term memory, sometimes called "working memory," can not tolerate much 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.369
 Of information, if not focused, they fade quickly 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.560
 Finally, there is research suggesting that "drum beats" ... may simply be uninterested. Let's be frank - you may be at a party or gathering 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.079
 You know you will not meet this person anywhere else, or in general you are not interested in forming 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.360
 New relationships. Simply put, every Mazda interested in something is more likely 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.130
 That your brain build new links. As a result people who like to build new relationships find them 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.930
 They are interested and interested in Nadir who feel that they are using their memory and testing it. 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.869
