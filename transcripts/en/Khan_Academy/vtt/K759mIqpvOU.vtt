00:00:00.232 --> 00:00:01.370
- [Voiceover] What I
hope to do in this video

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.855
is get a little bit more practice

00:00:02.855 --> 00:00:05.874
thinking about absolute value
of the difference of numbers

00:00:05.874 --> 00:00:08.561
as the distance between those two numbers.

00:00:09.328 --> 00:00:11.489
So in this first question, we are asked

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:13.114
which of the following expressions

00:00:13.114 --> 00:00:15.900
are equivalent to the absolute value of

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.222
A minus B.

00:00:18.222 --> 00:00:19.639
And just as a reminder, the absolute value

00:00:19.639 --> 00:00:23.074
of A minus B, this expression,

00:00:23.074 --> 00:00:24.933
this is going to give us the distance

00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:27.185
between A and B.

00:00:27.185 --> 00:00:30.018
So it's going to give us this
distance right over here.

00:00:30.018 --> 00:00:32.013
It's going to give us this
distance right over here.

00:00:32.013 --> 00:00:34.660
That is the absolute value of A minus B,

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.962
which is of course the same thing

00:00:35.962 --> 00:00:38.422
as the absolute value of B minus A.

00:00:38.422 --> 00:00:40.860
So which of these
expressions are equivalent?

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.761
So this first one has
the absolute value of A

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:47.432
minus the absolute value of B.

00:00:47.432 --> 00:00:49.382
Well what is the absolute value of A?

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:52.145
Well that's the distance
that A is from zero.

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:54.235
So that's going to be this distance.

00:00:54.235 --> 00:00:58.878
This distance right over here
is the absolute value of A.

00:00:58.878 --> 00:01:01.247
That's the absolute value
of A right over there

00:01:01.247 --> 00:01:03.591
and then the absolute value of B is

00:01:03.591 --> 00:01:05.426
going to be this distance.

00:01:05.426 --> 00:01:07.841
That's the distance that B is from zero.

00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:09.141
So that right over there is going to be

00:01:09.141 --> 00:01:11.719
the absolute value of B.

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:12.949
That's the absolute value of B.

00:01:12.949 --> 00:01:15.852
So if you take, if you say
the absolute value of A

00:01:15.852 --> 00:01:17.616
minus the absolute value of B,

00:01:17.616 --> 00:01:19.451
what are you going to be left with?

00:01:19.451 --> 00:01:21.309
Well, you're going to be left with,

00:01:21.309 --> 00:01:24.002
you're going to be left
with this distance.

00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:27.275
You're going to be left with
this distance right over here.

00:01:27.275 --> 00:01:29.900
This distance is the absolute value of A

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.199
minus the absolute value of B.

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:34.776
Absolute value of A minus this distance

00:01:34.776 --> 00:01:37.121
is gonna give you this green distance.

00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:38.816
Well that's exactly what we have up here.

00:01:38.816 --> 00:01:40.581
The absolute value of A minus B

00:01:40.581 --> 00:01:42.392
is the distance between A and B

00:01:42.392 --> 00:01:44.899
and that's what this
green distance is as well.

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:45.868
So,

00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:48.888
this is going to be equivalent

00:01:48.888 --> 00:01:51.066
to the absolute value of A minus B.

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:52.251
And if you wanna really verify it,

00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:53.667
you could try it with some numbers.

00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:55.176
I mean what they tell us about A and B

00:01:55.176 --> 00:01:56.986
is that both of them are
going to be negative.

00:01:56.986 --> 00:01:58.798
They're both to the left of zero.

00:01:58.798 --> 00:02:01.863
And we also see that B is greater than A,

00:02:01.863 --> 00:02:03.396
or it's less negative than A.

00:02:03.396 --> 00:02:05.067
So you could even try
it with some numbers.

00:02:05.067 --> 00:02:06.762
You could say well maybe B is negative one

00:02:06.762 --> 00:02:10.083
and A is negative five and then verify

00:02:10.083 --> 00:02:11.893
that this would be true.

00:02:11.893 --> 00:02:13.960
Now what about the absolute value of A

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.515
plus the absolute value of B?

00:02:16.515 --> 00:02:19.092
Well that would be taking this distance,

00:02:19.092 --> 00:02:21.484
this magenta distance,
absolute value of A,

00:02:21.484 --> 00:02:24.478
and then adding it to this blue distance,

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:26.336
that absolute value of B.

00:02:26.336 --> 00:02:28.774
So this would give you a larger distance

00:02:28.774 --> 00:02:32.512
than the distance
between those two points.

00:02:32.512 --> 00:02:33.999
Or, you could try it with numbers.

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:36.134
I mean, imagine a world, just like I said,

00:02:36.134 --> 00:02:40.547
imagine a world where A
is equal to negative five

00:02:40.547 --> 00:02:43.588
and B is equal to negative one.

00:02:43.588 --> 00:02:46.282
Well in this world, the
distance between the two,

00:02:46.282 --> 00:02:48.672
the absolute value of A minus B

00:02:48.672 --> 00:02:51.854
would be equal to the absolute
value of negative five.

00:02:51.854 --> 00:02:55.964
Negative five minus negative one.

00:02:55.964 --> 00:02:57.613
Minus negative one.

00:02:57.613 --> 00:02:59.533
Which is the same thing as

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.384
the absolute value of
negative five plus one.

00:03:03.384 --> 00:03:05.729
Which is equal to the absolute
value of negative four.

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:07.099
Which is equal to four.

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.399
So for these particular numbers,

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:09.699
and I just picked them, I just picked two

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:12.579
negative numbers where A
is more negative than B,

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:13.924
the way it's drawn,

00:03:13.924 --> 00:03:15.457
this distance in green,

00:03:15.457 --> 00:03:16.851
or this distance right over here,

00:03:16.851 --> 00:03:18.012
would be four.

00:03:18.012 --> 00:03:19.869
Now the absolute value of A,

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:23.167
absolute value of A plus
the absolute value of B,

00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:25.998
in this circumstance,
is going to be equal to

00:03:25.998 --> 00:03:26.882
five.

00:03:26.882 --> 00:03:28.554
It's going to be the absolute
value of negative five,

00:03:28.554 --> 00:03:30.201
which would just be five

00:03:30.201 --> 00:03:31.920
plus the absolute value of negative one,

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.058
which would be one.

00:03:33.058 --> 00:03:34.428
This would be equal to six.

00:03:34.428 --> 00:03:36.007
So for these numbers,
once again I just picked

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:37.724
two random numbers that
met the constraints

00:03:37.724 --> 00:03:39.233
that both are negative and that A

00:03:39.233 --> 00:03:41.881
is more negative than B is,

00:03:41.881 --> 00:03:43.204
it didn't hold up.

00:03:43.204 --> 00:03:44.923
So this is not going to be the case.

00:03:44.923 --> 00:03:46.154
And I'm not going to
select none of the above,

00:03:46.154 --> 00:03:47.941
because I found a choice that I know

00:03:47.941 --> 00:03:50.217
is going to be true.

00:03:50.217 --> 00:03:51.703
Let's do another one of these.

00:03:51.703 --> 00:03:53.955
Let's do several more of these.

00:03:53.955 --> 00:03:55.208
Which of the following expressions

00:03:55.208 --> 00:03:58.691
are equivalent to the
absolute value of A minus B?

00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:01.269
Once again, absolute value of A minus B,

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.591
that is the distance between A and B.

00:04:03.591 --> 00:04:07.051
That is this distance that
I'm drawing right now.

00:04:07.051 --> 00:04:09.279
That is this distance right over here.

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:12.686
That is the absolute value of A minus B.

00:04:13.825 --> 00:04:15.311
Well what is this first choice?

00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:18.655
Just A minus B without the absolute value.

00:04:18.655 --> 00:04:21.441
Well we see that A is less than B,

00:04:21.441 --> 00:04:22.231
it's more to the left.

00:04:22.231 --> 00:04:24.669
In fact, A is negative and B is positive.

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:25.852
So if you take a negative number

00:04:25.852 --> 00:04:27.988
and then you subtract a
positive number from it,

00:04:27.988 --> 00:04:29.661
you're going to get a negative number.

00:04:29.661 --> 00:04:31.975
This thing right over here
is going to be negative.

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:36.110
Or if you subtract a larger
number from a smaller number,

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.572
you're going to get a negative value.

00:04:38.572 --> 00:04:40.450
But the distance between
these two numbers,

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.886
we took the absolute value,
this is a positive value.

00:04:42.886 --> 00:04:44.348
This is just a distance.

00:04:44.348 --> 00:04:46.462
So this isn't going to be the case.

00:04:46.462 --> 00:04:47.879
Now let's look at this choice.

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:50.635
The negative of B minus A.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.957
Well B minus A is going to be positive.

00:04:53.957 --> 00:04:55.304
How do we know that?

00:04:55.304 --> 00:04:57.185
Well B is larger than A.

00:04:57.185 --> 00:04:58.206
B is greater than A.

00:04:58.206 --> 00:05:00.086
So if B is greater than A, B minus A

00:05:00.086 --> 00:05:01.619
is going to be positive.

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:03.175
But then we're taking the negative of it,

00:05:03.175 --> 00:05:06.287
so this whole expression
is going to be negative.

00:05:06.287 --> 00:05:08.400
It is going to be negative again.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.955
Another way to think about it,

00:05:09.955 --> 00:05:11.464
B is a positive number,

00:05:11.464 --> 00:05:13.345
you subtract a negative number from it,

00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:14.576
that's the same thing as adding

00:05:14.576 --> 00:05:16.016
the absolute value of
that negative number.

00:05:16.016 --> 00:05:17.594
This part is going to be positive.

00:05:17.594 --> 00:05:19.406
But then you have this
negative out front of it,

00:05:19.406 --> 00:05:21.495
it is going to be negative.

00:05:21.495 --> 00:05:22.842
And, like in the last example,

00:05:22.842 --> 00:05:24.699
you could try out numbers
that meet these constraints.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.669
Maybe B is positive three
and A is negative two.

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.364
And I encourage you, try this out.

00:05:30.364 --> 00:05:32.941
Figure out what the absolute
value of A minus B is,

00:05:32.941 --> 00:05:34.102
it'll be five.

00:05:34.102 --> 00:05:35.311
And figure out which of these

00:05:35.311 --> 00:05:36.379
give you that same result.

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:38.120
And neither of them will.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.557
So the answer here is none of the above.

00:05:41.557 --> 00:05:43.338
Let's keep going, this is a lot of fun.

00:05:44.175 --> 00:05:46.869
Alright, select the best interpretation

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:48.820
of the following equation.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.327
So we have the absolute
value of 11 minus X.

00:05:51.327 --> 00:05:53.741
So this is the distance between 11 and X

00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:56.783
equals the absolute
value of Y minus three.

00:05:56.783 --> 00:05:58.594
So this is the distance
between Y and three.

00:05:58.594 --> 00:05:59.894
So this is telling us
that the distance between

00:05:59.894 --> 00:06:04.493
11 and X is the same as the
distance between Y and three.

00:06:04.493 --> 00:06:06.303
So they say the distance between 11 and X

00:06:06.303 --> 00:06:08.462
is equal to the distance
between Y and three.

00:06:08.462 --> 00:06:11.249
Yeah, that's exactly, that's
exactly what I just said.

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:12.293
So I would select that.

00:06:12.293 --> 00:06:13.850
But let's look at the other choices.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.055
The distance between 11 and a negative x

00:06:16.055 --> 00:06:20.095
is qual to the distance
between Y and negative three.

00:06:20.095 --> 00:06:21.322
Well the distance between,

00:06:21.322 --> 00:06:23.203
let me underline this,

00:06:23.203 --> 00:06:26.198
the distance between 11 and negative X,

00:06:26.198 --> 00:06:27.653
let me just in a different color.

00:06:28.886 --> 00:06:30.431
The distance,

00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:32.849
I'm having trouble changing colors.

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:37.238
So, the distance between
11 and negative X,

00:06:37.238 --> 00:06:38.609
that's not going to be this over here,

00:06:38.609 --> 00:06:40.024
that's going to be, you could take

00:06:40.024 --> 00:06:42.300
the absolute value of
11 and then from that

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.156
you would subtract negative X.

00:06:45.156 --> 00:06:47.711
That's this thing right over here.

00:06:47.711 --> 00:06:50.333
So this would actually simplify
to the absolute value of 11

00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:54.212
plus X, which is not
what we have over here.

00:06:54.212 --> 00:06:57.322
And then the distance
between Y and negative three,

00:06:57.322 --> 00:06:58.205
same idea.

00:06:58.205 --> 00:07:02.175
That's gonna be Y minus negative three.

00:07:02.175 --> 00:07:03.825
Which is not what we have over here.

00:07:03.825 --> 00:07:05.241
So this is not,

00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:08.718
this is not what this equation represents.

00:07:09.578 --> 00:07:11.847
The distance between 11 and Y,

00:07:12.504 --> 00:07:13.660
okay so now they're really mixing.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.399
They're saying 11 and Y
is equal to the distance

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:17.885
between negative X and negative three.

00:07:17.885 --> 00:07:20.022
So now they've just completely
mixed everything up.

00:07:20.022 --> 00:07:21.809
So that's not gonna be the case.

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:23.335
Let's do one more of these.

00:07:24.358 --> 00:07:26.031
Let's do one more.

00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:29.512
So we are asked, which of
the following expressions

00:07:29.512 --> 00:07:32.268
is equal to the rectangle's area?

00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:34.401
Alright, so if we want to figure out

00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:35.679
the area of a rectangle,

00:07:35.679 --> 00:07:39.277
just multiply the width times the height.

00:07:39.277 --> 00:07:42.319
Or you could say the
length times the height.

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:44.333
So let's see which of
these represent that.

00:07:44.986 --> 00:07:47.765
So the absolute value of J minus L.

00:07:48.625 --> 00:07:51.273
So, let me get a color here.

00:07:51.273 --> 00:07:53.176
So J

00:07:53.176 --> 00:07:55.731
minus L.

00:07:55.731 --> 00:07:59.655
The absolute value of J minus L.

00:07:59.655 --> 00:08:01.002
So J minus L,

00:08:01.002 --> 00:08:03.021
so J is this X coordinate,

00:08:03.021 --> 00:08:04.833
it's gonna be negative six,

00:08:04.833 --> 00:08:07.340
and L is this X coordinate,

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.665
it's going to be,

00:08:08.665 --> 00:08:10.894
it's going to be positive six.

00:08:10.894 --> 00:08:12.774
So the absolute value of J minus L

00:08:12.774 --> 00:08:14.701
is going to be our,

00:08:14.701 --> 00:08:17.465
is going to the the difference
in the horizontal axis,

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.638
or it's going to be the
distance on the horizontal axis

00:08:21.638 --> 00:08:23.217
between this point and that point.

00:08:23.217 --> 00:08:27.047
Or you say the horizontal
distance between those two points.

00:08:27.047 --> 00:08:30.391
So it would be the length
of this line segment.

00:08:30.391 --> 00:08:35.128
So that is the absolute
value of J minus L.

00:08:35.128 --> 00:08:37.496
Once again, the X coordinate
here is negative six,

00:08:37.496 --> 00:08:39.866
the X coordinate here is positive six,

00:08:39.866 --> 00:08:40.770
and you can even figure it out.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.279
It's going to be negative six minus six,

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:45.461
which would be negative 12,

00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:47.551
and then you take the
absolute value of that,

00:08:47.551 --> 00:08:48.851
this is going to be 12.

00:08:48.851 --> 00:08:49.849
And you don't even have
to figure that out here,

00:08:49.849 --> 00:08:51.986
we just know that the length of this line

00:08:51.986 --> 00:08:55.580
is the absolute value of J minus L.

00:08:56.646 --> 00:08:57.739
So that's that.

00:08:57.739 --> 00:09:01.128
And then they have the
absolute value of M minus Q.

00:09:01.128 --> 00:09:03.474
So the absolute value,

00:09:03.474 --> 00:09:05.980
the absolute value of M minus Q.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.161
So they have M over here,
that's the Y coordinate here,

00:09:09.161 --> 00:09:11.902
and Q is the Y coordinate down here.

00:09:11.902 --> 00:09:14.014
So the absolute value of M minus Q

00:09:14.014 --> 00:09:15.687
is going to be the distance,

00:09:15.687 --> 00:09:18.263
the vertical distance
between these two points,

00:09:18.263 --> 00:09:19.471
which is really just,

00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:21.422
'cause the X value isn't changing,

00:09:21.422 --> 00:09:23.466
this is actually going to be the length.

00:09:23.466 --> 00:09:26.716
This is going to be the
length of that side.

00:09:26.716 --> 00:09:31.360
That's going to be the
absolute value of M minus Q.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.611
So yeah, if you multiply this
length times this length,

00:09:34.611 --> 00:09:37.188
you're going to get the
area of the rectangle.

00:09:37.188 --> 00:09:39.099
So I didn't even have to
look at the other choices,

00:09:39.099 --> 00:09:41.143
I would definitely go with this one.

00:09:41.143 --> 00:09:42.652
But let's see where the other ones

00:09:42.652 --> 00:09:44.347
probably aren't correct.

00:09:44.347 --> 00:09:47.226
So this is the absolute
value of J minus M.

00:09:47.226 --> 00:09:48.689
So here you're taking the difference of

00:09:48.689 --> 00:09:52.821
the X coordinate here and
the Y coordinate over there.

00:09:52.821 --> 00:09:54.494
So that's kind of bizarre.

00:09:54.494 --> 00:09:57.465
This this already looks suspicious.

00:09:57.465 --> 00:10:00.159
Here you're saying the
absolute value of J minus N.

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:02.458
Absolute value of J,

00:10:02.458 --> 00:10:04.826
absolute value of J minus N.

00:10:04.826 --> 00:10:07.356
Well, their X coordinates are the same,

00:10:07.356 --> 00:10:08.890
so this is actually going to be,

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.467
this we actually know is going to be zero.

00:10:10.467 --> 00:10:13.975
J is equal to N, they're
both equal to negative six.

00:10:13.975 --> 00:10:15.971
That's not gonna give you
the length of this line,

00:10:15.971 --> 00:10:19.060
because we have no change along X here.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.987
All the change is along Y.

00:10:20.987 --> 00:10:22.324
If we wanted to figure out the length

00:10:22.324 --> 00:10:24.112
of this line right over here

00:10:24.112 --> 00:10:29.112
we would have to find
the absolute value of K,

00:10:29.777 --> 00:10:32.842
of the change in our Y coordinates.

00:10:32.842 --> 00:10:35.048
So absolute value of K minus O

00:10:35.048 --> 00:10:36.929
would give you the length of this line.

00:10:36.929 --> 00:10:38.740
And if you wanted the length
of this right over here,

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.458
you'd want your change in X,

00:10:40.458 --> 00:10:44.336
so that would be the
absolute value of N minus P,

00:10:44.336 --> 00:10:48.770
or you could say the
absolute value of P minus N.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:49.978
But they didn't use those choices.

00:10:49.978 --> 00:10:51.918
So yeah, we feel good about that.
