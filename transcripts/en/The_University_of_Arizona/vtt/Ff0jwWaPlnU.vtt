00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.870
Welcome to the 7th in this
series of evolution lectures.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.740
I'm Mike Cusanovich, director of
Arizona Research Laboratories.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.030
And I'm standing in for our
Dean of Science, Joaquin Ruiz,

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.530
tonight.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.550
He's at another event.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.430
And it's a real pleasure for me
to introduce tonight's speaker,

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.560
Dr. Michael Hammer.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.580
Mike is a small college guy
from Lake Forest College.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.780
Did his PhD At the University
of California, Berkeley,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.820
went on to post-doc
at Princeton,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.090
and another post-doc at
Harvard, and then, fortunately,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.360
came to Arizona,
in 1991, to work

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.650
in Arizona Research Laboratories
as a research scientist.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.260
During his stay here,
he's evolved his research

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.740
to the point that he's now one
of the world's leading experts

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.519
on human origins,
traced with DNA,

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.740
and has made tremendous
contributions.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.050
One way to look at this,
he has appointments

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.760
in Arizona Research Laboratories
in ecology and evolutionary

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.309
biology.

00:01:14.309 --> 00:01:16.100
But he also-- and I
don't know why it's not

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.266
on this slide-- has an
appointment in the Department

00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.640
of Anthropology.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.930
And that ties together his work,
and the impact of his work,

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.550
very nicely.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.870
I won't read you the title.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:27.980
You can read it.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.830
And ask Dr. Hammer to step
up, here, and give his talk.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.830
Thank you.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.340
Well, it's really a
pleasure to be here,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.670
and to have the
opportunity to address

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.960
our campus, and our community,
on this topic of human origins,

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.440
using DNA to trace our origins.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.900
I've chosen to highlight
three different themes

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.610
in my talk, tonight.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.110
The first one is
our place in nature,

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.660
and the second one
is the evolution

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.729
of the traits that
make us human--

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.740
trying to track both of
those, not only genealogically

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.660
but in history, as well.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.250
These are issues that
Darwin addressed directly.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.670
And then, the
third theme will be

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.160
something that's related but
something that Darwin didn't

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.660
address, because
this is something

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.170
that has been debated most
intensely in the last couple

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.970
of decades.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.020
It's a topic that deals
with the origin, how

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.500
our species originated--
the modern human species.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.210
In order to do the work that I
do, and to address this issue,

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.550
in general, genetics
isn't enough.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.790
It can't stand up on its own.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.000
We need many
different disciplines

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.250
to work on this together,
to give us the full picture.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.920
Paleontologists are involved
in this topic as well.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.670
They study fossils to infer
the morphological changes that

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.550
have occurred over
evolutionary time.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.290
Archaeologists who study
material culture-- stones,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.430
stone tool kits-- to trace
the history of our species,

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.140
to infer the
behavioral changes that

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.474
have occurred through time.

00:03:20.474 --> 00:03:22.140
And then, of course,
genetics-- the area

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.640
that I'm involved in-- using
both protein work and DNA

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.732
work to tune infer our
genealogical history.

00:03:29.732 --> 00:03:32.190
And one of the points I'm going
to make in the talk tonight

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.220
is that the genealogical
history for different parts

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.050
of our genome can tell
us different things

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.964
about our history.

00:03:37.964 --> 00:03:39.630
And that's one of the
challenges that we

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.760
face in trying to put
together a story--

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.520
a full story--
about our history.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.510
The history of the
field of genetics,

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.730
as applied to
anthropology, goes back

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.960
to the early 1900s in work that
was done at the protein level,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.100
and up through the 1960s.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.880
And I'll talk a little bit
about some of the work that's

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.830
been done with protein.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.860
And then, the transition
into DNA work, in the 70s

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.656
through the 90s, and
studying individual genes

00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:12.030
and the sequences
of those genes.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.090
And then, in the last few
years, having entire genome

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.950
sequenced that we
have at our disposal

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.959
to make inferences about.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.820
Now, I'm going to try and
limit the technical information

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.510
as much as possible, which
is a challenge in itself.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.530
But I will probably convey
a lot of the ideas to you

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.430
through this drawing--
these tree drawings.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.190
So on the left,
you can see a tree

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.320
that may be a tree
that was developed

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.440
by anatomists, comparing
the anatomy of humans

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.030
and great apes and
inferring the relationships.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.420
That's the species tree.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.190
In the middle, I'm
trying to convey to you

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.740
this timeline of
fossils as they've

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.980
been discovered and dated.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.900
Paleontologists will
infer the taxonomic status

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.490
of a particular
fossil by comparing it

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.060
with other fossils, its time
depth in the fossil record,

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.080
and make inferences that
almost look like a tree.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.820
You can see these
branches that I've

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.960
shattered underneath these
timelines of fossils.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.320
And then, on the right, is
a tree that is a gene tree.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.540
It's not a species
tree, but it's

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.640
a tree that reflects
the genealogical history

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.160
of a particular
region of the genome.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.310
And the time frame for
that genealogical history

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.050
can come from the
number of mutations

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.140
that we see in the DNA, using
some kind of a molecular clock

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.230
approach to infer the
time depth of the tree.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.650
Now, let's turn to what Darwin
said about human evolution.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.460
We can summarize
it in one sentence.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.670
In his Origin of
Species, from 1859,

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.410
"Light will be thrown on the
origin of man and his history."

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.620
That's all he said in
The Origin of Species.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.830
And if we look a little
further in the literature,

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.950
we find that he wrote to
his friend Alfred Russell

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.440
Wallace, a couple of
years before he published

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.110
The Origin of Species,
in 1857, when asked,

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.320
would he address this
issue of human evolution?

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.430
And what he said was, "I think
I shall avoid the whole subject,

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.760
as so surrounded
with prejudices,

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.210
though I fully admit that
it is the highest and most

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.230
interesting problem
for the naturalist."

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.320
But his ally and bulldog, Thomas
H. Huxley, just four years

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.050
after the publication of
The Origin of Species,

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.410
published his own book called
evidence as to man's place

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.760
in nature.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.290
And he wasn't shy about tackling
this issue about human origins

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.440
and applying evolutionary
theory to human origins.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.470
What he did was, he did an
extensive comparative analysis

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.410
of human and ape
anatomy, embryology,

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.020
and ethology--
behavior-- as well as

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.910
looked at the very,
very few fossils that

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.450
were known at the
time, and concluded

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.120
that humans have a close
evolutionary relationship

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.130
with the great apes, in
particular the African apes.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.500
So this was striking
for many reasons.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.734
At the time, there
were many out there

00:07:10.734 --> 00:07:13.150
who didn't believe that humans
had any relationship at all

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.670
to the rest of the
biological world, number one.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.060
But then, to claim that humans
were related to African apes,

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.060
as opposed to the
orangutan Asian ape,

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.590
was quite a striking
statement, a bold statement.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.670
But perhaps the
biggest impact would

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.500
be in a philosophical sense.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.800
Humans now were seen as
part of nature and not apart

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.940
from nature.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.820
In fact, the
Darwinian revolution

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.710
followed, by a
couple of centuries,

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.590
another revolution
in Western philosophy

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.710
stirred up by
Copernicus, who gave us

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.969
the heliocentric
universe, disposing

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.760
of the geocentric
universe where everything

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.080
circled around the earth.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.630
Earth now circled
around the sun,

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:59.680
and was just one planet
of many in the universe.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.170
It was no longer the
center of universe.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:07.360
And similarly,
Darwinian revolution

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.880
took man up from
position out of nature

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.790
into a position in nature,
and made the naturalistic view

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:13.870
of man.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.450
But still, , the
human, in either case,

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.430
still remained at the
pinnacle of God's works.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.390
And so, these revolutions
are in the context

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.420
of these other kinds
of thought processes

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.930
of natural philosophers
at the time.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:33.820
Still, Huxley made
a statement that

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.919
gives us a picture of
the kind of tension

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:39.159
that existed between the
continuity of placing

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:42.070
man in nature and the
discontinuity of man

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:43.450
from the rest of nature.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.910
In this quote, "No one is
more strongly convinced

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:49.060
than I am of the vastness
of the gulf between man

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.360
and the brutes, for he alone
possesses the marvelous

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.970
endowment of intelligible
and rational speech,

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.580
and stands raised upon
it as on a mountain top,

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.950
far above the level
of his humble fellows,

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:02.020
and transfigured from
his grosser nature

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.690
by reflecting, here
in there, a ray

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:08.710
from the infinite
source of truth."

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:12.400
So what I'd like to
talk about tonight

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.220
is a bit about the tension
that's shown in the statement.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.200
What is the
relationship between man

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.170
and the rest of the
biological reality,

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.360
and follow the history
of that, and see

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.310
what DNA and
molecular approaches

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:28.540
have done to help us
understand that relationship.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.130
And in the first two themes
that I'm going to be developing,

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.560
the first is what
is the relationship

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.350
of man to the great apes?

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:41.634
And I use the word "man" in the
18th- and 19th-century sense.

00:09:44.651 --> 00:09:46.150
Another way of
putting that question

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.390
is, how far back in time
did humans and great apes

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:50.860
share a common ancestor?

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.080
That's them number one.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.190
Theme number two is also
something that has been debated

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.430
greatly in the last century,
and that is the question

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.040
of "human-ness."

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.990
The traits that
make us so special,

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:10.690
and so different from the animal
world, when did those evolve?

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.510
And when we answer
that kind of question,

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.400
we think about all
the changes that

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.100
occurred on the lineage
leading specifically

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.260
to modern humans--
this lineage, here.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.080
And I've shown some
fossils that represent

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.500
extinct forms of
humans, or pre-humans,

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.200
on the lineage leading
to modern forms.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.240
And I will refer to
all of the creatures

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.965
on this branch as hominins.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.410
Now, these two
themes, in practice,

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.420
are deeply intertwined.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.690
Because, in order determine
what makes us special,

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:47.160
we need to know who to
compare ourselves with.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.830
So what is the
history of this idea

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.040
of establishing the link between
humans and the great apes?

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.840
As I just mentioned,
Darwin and Huxley

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.810
both, through their
analysis, reasoned

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:02.130
that humans were closely
related to the African apes.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.880
Whereas the view seemed to
shift, after 1920 or so,

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.920
up until 1960.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.320
The view shifted
back to one where

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.380
humans were much more distantly
related to the great apes.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.130
In fact, it was seen that
great apes-- the African apes

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:21.060
and the orangutan-- were closely
related, and either of those

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.910
being more related to each
other than any to humans--

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.830
humans being very distinct.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.050
And one version of
that, this is work

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:31.680
that was written in the
1920s, as representative

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.510
of the kind of things
that were being

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:37.220
said in those days--
worked by Sir Arthur Keith.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:41.520
He showed this family tree,
here, of the great ape lineage,

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.470
here, the human
lineage, and seeing

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.020
how far back in time
they coalesced back

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.790
to a common ancestor
in the Oligocene--

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.820
which, today, we know to be
about 30 million years back

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.050
in time.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:55.830
Along with this view of the
ancient split between humans

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:59.880
and the great apes, was the
view that human populations,

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.490
themselves, traced
back very far in time,

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:06.300
so that the different
racial groups were very old.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.240
And these were very consistent
with the racial views

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.330
of the time-- that
the white race

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:17.970
had reached ascendancy more
recently than these other races

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.050
around the world.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.690
This was a common
view at the time.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.950
So perhaps the most
important fossil support

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.980
for this ancient
divergent hypothesis

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.110
was not that old in time.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.470
It was a fossil
called Ramapithecus,

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.610
that had been
discovered in the 1920s,

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.465
and rediscovered
by Elwyn Simons.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.020
Ramapithecus is an
ape-like creature

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.260
that lived in Eurasia
about 15 million years ago,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.700
and appeared to be anatomically
related to the hominid lineage,

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.530
according to Simons.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.290
And based on these
similarities, he

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:59.310
suggested that this lineage had
the Ramapithecus, right here,

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:00.900
on the lineage,
which would support

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.660
this very ancient
divergence between humans

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:04.613
and the great apes.

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.940
Well, let's now look at
what the molecular field has

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:16.110
done for us in 1962 the
term molecular anthropology

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:20.640
was termed coined by Emile
Zuckerkandl and Linus

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.630
Pauling, who were
the first to suggest

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.785
that one could use molecular
approaches to infer

00:13:26.785 --> 00:13:27.660
evolutionary history.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.990
By comparing the sequences
of proteins extracted

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.090
from different
organisms, one could then

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.520
infer the evolutionary
relationships

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.440
of those organisms.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.410
This launched a new field called
molecular anthropology, which

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:47.230
was really christened by
Morris Goodman in 1963,

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.890
and then Sarich and
Wilson, in 1967, who

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:53.130
made immunological
comparisons among the proteins

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.830
of African apes,
orangutans, and humans,

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.890
and showed that, yes, humans
were more like African apes

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:02.340
than either was to orangutans.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.530
Goodman's analysis
was qualitative.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:09.030
Sarich and Wilson's
analysis was quantitative.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.880
And this shows you the
result. Darwin was right.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.500
Huxley was right.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.050
According to the
molecular approach,

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:19.920
humans share a relationship
with African apes that

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.210
only goes back 5 million years.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:23.900
And this was the
Sarich and Wilson

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.550
result-- the quantitative
result-- suggesting

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:29.730
an incredibly recent
divergence between humans

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.350
and the great apes.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.840
In fact, this
conclusion was heretical

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.850
for a number of years,
and wasn't fully

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.830
accepted by the
anthropological community,

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.550
until additional
fossils had been found,

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:44.160
which gave us a better view
of where Ramapithecus fit

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.160
onto the tree of the hominoids.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.330
In fact, Ramapithecus now is
classified as a fossil ancestor

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:52.710
of the orangutan.

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:54.730
And so, all of the
picture makes sense.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:56.430
And in this case,
the molecular studies

00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:00.420
led the way in seeing
the right answer,

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.360
if we ignore what had been
said by Huxley and Darwin 100

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.582
some years before that.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.400
But notice, on this
tree on the right,

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.600
that we have basically
a three-way split,

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.130
or a trichotomy.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:20.190
How can we resolve
this trichotomy?

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:23.420
There are a number of possible
ways it could be resolved.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.050
It could be a true trichotomy.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.180
It could be that these
three species actually

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:31.050
diverged so close in time
that, essentially, they are all

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:33.180
equally related to one another.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:36.000
Or you could have any of these
other permutations, where

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.640
gorillas and chimps are more
closely related to each other,

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.540
or one of them related
to humans more so.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.270
In order to resolve
this, a great deal

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:47.340
of genetic information
was necessary.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:51.270
Because it is, actually, a very
small period of time in which

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:54.280
these three species
separated from one another.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.830
And in order to
solve this problem,

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:59.940
we require the new
technology of DNA.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:03.640
And there were two early
pioneers in this regard.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.080
Sibley and Ahlquist, who
explored DNA kinetics

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.780
and how, by hybridizing the
genomes of different species,

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.820
one could determine
their relationships.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.090
And then, there was the
work by Morris Goodman,

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:17.730
by looking directly at
the DNA sequence level.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:21.660
Looking at enough genes,
enough sequence, lined up

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.550
from chimps,
gorillas, and humans,

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:28.230
one could infer who was more
closely related to the other.

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:31.020
In fact, when this
work was applied,

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.900
the answer came out in
both cases-- for Goodman

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.940
and for Sibley and
Ahlquist-- to show

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.490
that humans were more closely
related to chimpanzees

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:41.100
than either was to gorilla.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.010
In fact, these studies
were right on the mark

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:47.670
in showing that humans and
chimps share about 98.8%

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.890
percent of their DNA sequences.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.100
So that's fairly striking.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:56.340
So if we kind of, now,
look back at the history

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.350
of the idea of man's
place in nature,

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:01.800
we can see that it's
really characterized

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.380
by a series of
demotions, starting

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:10.500
with humans beings having
a special creation,

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.400
to humans having a special
branch on the tree of primates,

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.770
to humans being one
of many branches

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:19.890
on the tree of primates,
to humans and chimps being

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:22.800
part of the same genus, almost.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.160
So this is striking
information, and had

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.360
striking consequences
for how we view ourselves

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.770
and our place in nature.

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:35.760
In fact, because now we
can look in the genome

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.160
to see what makes us special,
we have a special trick

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:39.660
we can use.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.610
We can look at the
chimp genome to see

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:44.940
where the differences are,
and what differences may have

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.608
arisen that do make us special.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.830
Now, if we move to
theme number two,

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.090
trying to track how
far back in time

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:57.598
these special traits may have
evolved that make us human.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.670
Darwin had a view
about this as well.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:09.450
Basically, Darwin figured
the first steps on the way

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:12.870
to the human lineage,
when apes first budded off

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:16.090
into this group that
eventually became humans,

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:17.550
that brains led the way.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.800
He reasoned that
a smarter ape was

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.760
the thing that would eventually
get us to being humans.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.070
The other view was that
walking led the way--

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.130
that standing upright
would be the first step

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.156
in the early process
of becoming human.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:43.740
In fact, Darwin had a good
reason to put forward his idea.

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:49.170
He reasoned that, in The Descent
of Man, those characters that

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:53.610
make us human he identified as
intelligence, manual dexterity,

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.250
technology, and uprightness.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.350
And he argued that
an ape endowed

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.330
with minor amounts
of intelligence,

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.880
or any of these other
characteristics,

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.170
would surely give that ape
an advantage over other apes.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.200
And a forebear endowed
with these qualities, then,

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.630
would just inevitably
become human

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.280
through the power of
natural selection.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.360
In other words Darwin
thought that hominin origins

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.939
equaled human origins.

00:19:19.939 --> 00:19:21.480
For those of you
who don't recognize,

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:27.360
this is the monolith in 2001.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.960
Well, Darwin didn't have
fossils at his disposal

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.480
to test his hypothesis.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.270
So it wasn't until
many years later,

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:38.610
in the 1940s, '50s,
and '60s, when

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:41.160
we had a huge number of
fossil discoveries, that

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:45.540
allowed us to piece together
the history of the origin

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.970
of these different forms
that eventually became

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.080
modern humans.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.860
And so, this slide
shows you a summary

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.920
of the current view from
the fossil evidence,

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.530
with some of the key
players on the side.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.830
You have Homo erectus, Homo
ergaster, and Homo habilis,

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.250
shown here.

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:06.570
These are all part of the genus
Homo, which is shown in blue.

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.510
And then you have
Paranthropus boisei, robustus,

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:11.760
and aethiopicus, which
are shown over here.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.040
They're later bipedal apes.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:17.010
And the reason I contrast
them is because, you can see,

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:20.220
they lived, actually,
at the same time.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.960
Darwin also had the
idea that humans

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.060
evolved along a single lineage.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.190
Well, with this number of
new fossil discoveries,

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:30.300
it became apparent that there
were multiple species that

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.080
co-existed at the same time.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.070
And you can see
that, boisei, here,

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:38.640
with the large sagittal ridge
on his head, and you can see,

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.190
over here, erectus, could
not be characterized

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:42.570
as the same species.

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:44.280
But more importantly,
what we can

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.730
see from this ordering
of characteristics

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:52.590
is that the earliest
hominids, leading up

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.110
to the australopithecines--
Lucy is the most famous

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:57.870
of the australopithecines--
essentially,

00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:01.620
were small-brained
creatures with large teeth,

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:05.670
and clearly proved
Darwin to be wrong.

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:09.990
These earliest members
of the hominid lineage,

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:12.766
in fact, could be seen
as bipedal "apes"--

00:21:12.766 --> 00:21:14.390
with the quotation
marks around "apes,"

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.306
since we're talking about
the hominid lineage,

00:21:16.306 --> 00:21:17.460
we're no longer apes.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:21.990
But they looked a lot like apes,
but they were able to walk.

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:26.340
These early bipedal
apes eventually

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.340
gave rise to more
robust forms, called

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:34.590
Paranthropus, and more
gracile forms, the genus Homo.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:38.400
Eventually, the genus
Homo led to Homo sapiens,

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.150
here at the top.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:43.140
And you can see how recent in
time our species, Homo sapiens,

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.768
emerges in the scheme
of hominid evolution.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:54.600
So we can say, by looking
at the fossil record,

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.550
that we no longer
would consider Darwin

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:58.140
to be right in this count.

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:01.770
Hominid origins are not
equivalent to human origins.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:05.610
And we must think, now,
of the early evolution

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:10.680
of our specialness being one of
being upright, where the larger

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.890
brains came later.

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:16.590
Most of us, I think,
would say that part

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:19.290
of what makes us special are
the cognitive abilities that

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:22.410
must relate somehow
to our larger brains.

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:26.250
But we're not quite there
yet, because this slide

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:29.130
is showing you the
encephalization quotient, which

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:31.170
is a way of giving
you the relative brain

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:34.530
size to body weight
on the y-axis,

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:37.170
and the time scale
on the x-axis.

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:40.710
You can see that, if we
compare ourselves to chimps,

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:43.830
we have a larger brain relative
to body weight, at the top,

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.800
and then, the various
fossil species

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.850
that I talked about
earlier in the middle.

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:52.050
And you can see that the
so-called bipedal apes have

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:56.100
a slight increased brain
size over that in chimps,

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.600
intelligent omnivores.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.000
Those early members
of the genus Homo

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.970
had a slightly larger
brain size, again.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:06.390
But neither reaches the brain
sizes that we have at the top.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:10.080
So in order to get to the
characteristics that really

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.320
make us human, we have to go on
to the next stage of evolution

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:19.020
and talk about the transition
to anatomically modern forms.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:23.760
Also the tool kits of
the various species

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.801
that I'm talking about.

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:33.870
It turns out that all of
the species I've discussed

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:37.410
have been using basically
the same set of tools.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:41.220
About 2.5 million years
ago, the first stone tools

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.880
are found in the archaeological
record, known as Oldowan tools,

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.310
which eventually, about
1.7 million years ago,

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:50.100
become a slightly more
complex grade of tools

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.840
called Acheulean tools.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.611
Here you have
Acheulean tool kits.

00:23:54.611 --> 00:23:56.610
And you can see, basically,
what they look like.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:24:00.930
It's hard to tell a hammer
from a crescent wrench.

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:03.450
So we're not there
yet, archaeologically,

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:06.150
which is a reflection of
where we are cognitively,

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:08.500
at some level.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.150
So in order to get into
that, and understand

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:14.820
how we made the final
transition to the Homo

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:18.240
sapiens-- the species
that we are-- I

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:22.050
would like to bring up through
theme three of my talk tonight.

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:24.880
How did we make the
transition to modern form?

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.630
Homo sapien showing up
again, on the upper left.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:29.720
And now, it got some
different players, here,

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.290
all in the genus Homo.

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:34.170
And you can see, Homo
sapiens, or anatomically

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:38.010
modern humans, shown
in the upper left,

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:39.750
has a much larger
cranial capacity.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.390
It's pretty obvious when you
compare the relative sizes

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:45.253
of the cranium versus the upper
and lower part of the cranium.

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:52.690
I also want to point
out, again, that there

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:55.990
are multiple species,
or taxonomic groups,

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:57.790
living before Homo sapiens.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:00.610
And even after Homo
sapiens emerges,

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:03.730
there are others that
coexist with Homo sapiens.

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:07.050
Homo neanderthalensis,
which lived in Europe.

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:10.510
Homo heidelbergensis, which
also lived in Africa and Europe.

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:12.580
Homo erectus, which
lived in Asia.

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:14.770
Homo erectus is thought
to have originated

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:20.950
in Africa from a precursor that
may have been very similar.

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.110
There's debate as to whether
there is Homo erectus

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:24.310
in Africa, or Homo ergaster.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:27.070
I'm going to go with the
terminology of Homo ergaster

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.860
giving rise to Homo
erectus in Asia.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.320
And then, this new find,
here, Homo floresiensis, which

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.930
I'll point out in a minute.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:37.510
Now, this slide is
supposed to represent

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.910
the very recent origin
of Homo sapiens,

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:43.250
showing you the
geographical context.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.840
Notice, after Homo
sapiens originated,

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.970
Homo sapiens rapidly
colonized the globe

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:52.540
in the last 100,000 years.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:56.710
But Homo sapiens was
not the first species

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:58.110
to migrate out of Africa.

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:01.240
You can see that Homo erectus,
shortly after it emerged

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:05.650
in Africa, migrated out and
colonized parts of Southeast

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:06.937
Asia and East Asia.

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:12.430
Now, this map shows
you the distribution

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:15.820
of some of these fossil finds,
for Homo erectus in green,

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.070
and the Neanderthal
range in blue.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:19.690
And what I wanted
to point out is,

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:22.060
you have some of the earliest
Homo erectus or ergaster

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:25.480
fossils in Africa, about
1.8 million years ago.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:30.650
And then, out here
in China, 1.2.

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:34.150
Dmanisi, Georgia, 1.7
million years ago.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:36.160
And here, in Java,
1.7 million years ago.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:41.050
So shortly after the first
Homo erectus is known to exist,

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:45.670
we find fossils widely dispersed
across the globe, at least

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.950
the old world.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:51.100
And I also wanted to point
out that Neanderthals

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.490
may have been around until
about 28,000 years ago,

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:58.420
certainly coexisting with
modern humans in Europe.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:02.150
And in Asia, we have
erectus existing

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:06.910
on Java till 25,000 years ago,
again, coexisting with moderns.

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:10.840
And then this find of the
island of Flores in Indonesia,

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.310
is quite interesting.

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:15.850
These are people who
were no more than 3 feet

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:20.620
tall, sometimes called
hobbits, that were probably

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.110
related to Homo erectus--
descended from Homo erectus,

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:27.640
and then underwent what
we call island dwarfism.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.880
And they look like
they have lived up

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.940
until as recently
as 13,000 years ago.

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:37.720
So one of the questions that's
so staring us in the face

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.810
is, we are alone
as a species today,

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:42.920
and yet, just as recently
as 10,000, 20,000,

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.560
30,000 years ago,
we shared the planet

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.780
with other forms of humans.

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:48.580
Why did this happen?

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:49.780
Why are we alone today?

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.830
That's an open
question, and a mystery,

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:53.950
that I will try and
address, a little bit,

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:56.860
through the rest of the talk.

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.830
Now, I want to talk about a
couple of different models

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:02.040
for the formation
of our species.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.750
There are two models that
have been hotly debated

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:06.640
in the literature for
the last 20 years,

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.910
both of them based strictly
on fossil evidence.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:12.040
The one here, on
the left, that is

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.800
called multiregional
evolution suggests

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.700
that, when Homo erectus
dispersed out of Africa,

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:24.550
colonized Asia, from that
population, which remained

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:27.580
fairly continuous across
that geographic space,

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:31.090
gave rise to Homo sapiens
pretty much everywhere

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:32.740
that it occurred.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.760
In this model,
there's no speciation.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.700
There's some local
differentiation

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:40.820
among Homo erectus populations,
but when a novelty would arise,

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:44.860
such as a gene that might
encode a larger brain,

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:47.350
this gene would then
be free to migrate

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:49.240
from one population
to the other,

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.940
and perhaps with the advantage
of natural selection,

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.490
spread throughout the
range of Homo erectus,

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:58.870
so that Homo erectus made this
transition to the modern form,

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:01.730
in concert, across the globe.

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:04.660
This idea has its roots
going back to Darwin,

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:06.700
in a sense, who believed
in gradual evolution

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.050
of a single lineage.

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:12.880
This model sees
Homo as one species.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.830
It makes the
predictions-- well, I'll

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:16.790
talk about the
predictions in a minute.

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:19.370
The other model is the
recent African origin model,

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:22.420
which says that modern
humans originated

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:26.140
in a single place in the
world, very recently-- Africa--

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:29.680
and from that African
place, came out of Africa,

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:33.010
replacing all the other
non-modern forms that

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:36.040
existed in Europe and in Asia.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:40.120
This model suggests that all
the genes that make us modern

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:44.200
evolved in one geographic
location, somewhere in Africa.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.240
The model also specifies
the population was

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.750
relatively small and isolated.

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:53.830
And this model has its roots
in a different philosophy

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:57.280
in evolutionary
genetics, that of one

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.590
where you have
lots of speciation,

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:03.100
the boundaries between
populations are hardening up,

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:06.640
so to speak, genes are not as
permeable across populations

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.930
because they're
beginning to speciate.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:11.350
It's a model of cladogenesis.

00:30:14.354 --> 00:30:16.520
Now, what are the predictions
these different models

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.895
might make that
we could actually

00:30:17.895 --> 00:30:20.510
test using genetic data?

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:22.910
Well, the multiregional
model, as I said,

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:27.105
makes two predictions-- one
about place, one about time.

00:30:27.105 --> 00:30:30.140
I'm going to try and keep
it as simple as I can.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:33.140
In this model, you can see
multiregional evolution.

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:37.190
These lineages all descend
back to Homo erectus time,

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:38.840
and the transition
to modern is shown

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:42.380
by this change from red
lineages to yellow lineages.

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.630
But if you look at
the lineages today,

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:47.930
we should be able to trace
them back very far in the past,

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:51.300
and they should be able to trace
deep in Europe, deep in Africa,

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.010
and deep in Asia.

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:53.660
So we might say,
the lineage will

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.130
trace many parts of the world.

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:56.260
That's the place.

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:59.240
The time-- they could be
going back, many of them,

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.960
over 2 million years.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.670
For the recent African
replacement model,

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:08.330
we have an African
population that

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:10.430
contains all the
genetic variation

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:12.566
of subsequent
descended populations.

00:31:12.566 --> 00:31:13.940
So all of the
lineages that we're

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:16.880
going to trace that are
yellow, the modern lineages,

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.390
are going to really trace
back to one place-- Africa.

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:23.900
And they're going to trace back
to Africa much more recently

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.610
than the lineages
would trace back

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:28.940
to a common ancestor in the
multiregional evolution model.

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.310
So we'd say, the
lineages trace to Africa

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:33.060
in the more recent past.

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.680
So now, I want to use these
predictions, time and place,

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.590
the geological depth at
different parts of the genome,

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:42.410
and ask, do the lineages
of different parts

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:45.950
of the genome trace to one
place, and how far back in time

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:49.970
do they trace, to see if we can
answer this question about how

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:53.140
we emerged as our species.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.890
In order to do so, I
just need to tell you

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:56.480
a couple of things
about the genome

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.896
that we're going
to be looking at.

00:31:57.896 --> 00:32:00.927
There are essentially two
genomes in every cell.

00:32:00.927 --> 00:32:03.260
In almost every cell-- blood
cells don't have a nucleus.

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.990
But most cells have a
nucleus and a cytoplasm.

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:07.975
Inside the cytoplasm
of a cell, there's

00:32:07.975 --> 00:32:10.070
an organelle called
the mitochondria,

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:12.990
which has to do with
producing energy for the cell.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:16.040
And it contains its own,
small circular genome.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.230
It's only 16,569 bases long.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.550
It's just over 16 kb in length.

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:26.620
And it's inherited strictly
from mother to children.

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:28.610
In the nucleus is the
rest of our genome.

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:30.470
It's 3 billion base pairs.

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:32.640
There's 23 different
pairs of chromosomes.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.820
The first 22 are
called autosomes.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:37.890
We get one autosome
from mom, one from dad.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:41.210
And then, the 23rd pair
is called sex chromosomes.

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:44.390
You have an X chromosome and a
Y chromosome, if you're a male.

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:48.320
And you have two X chromosomes
if you're a female.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.300
Now, this slide's a
bit tricky to see,

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:54.320
but I've got four generations--
great-grandparents,

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.080
grandparents, father and
mother, and a son at the bottom.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.510
And what I've shown here
is his mitochondrial DNA,

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:03.320
this small, circular molecule,
here, his Y chromosome.

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:07.340
And you can see that his Y
chromosome traces back to one

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:11.020
male each generation-- to his
father, to this grandfather,

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:14.300
and to this great-grandfather,
where his mitochondrial DNA

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:16.940
traces back to his mother,
to this grandmother,

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.890
and to this particular
great-grandmother.

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:20.780
So none of the other
great-grandparents

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.150
in this generation have
contributed their Y chromosome,

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:26.840
or their mitochondrial
DNA, to this boy, here.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.270
However, if you look at an
autosomal pair-- I've just

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:33.140
chosen a single pair for
the sake of simplicity--

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:36.140
you can see that this
patchwork of different colors

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:40.970
and patterns represents
pieces of all autosomes that

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:44.300
came from different
ancestors in the past.

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:48.080
So you can see that this
piece of his autosome traces

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:52.850
back to this grandmother, and
this piece to this grandfather,

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:54.074
and so on.

00:33:54.074 --> 00:33:55.490
So what I'm trying
to say here is,

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:57.980
because of the process
of recombination,

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.860
pieces of the genome are
shuffled between chromosomes

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.230
that are inherited
from father and mother.

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.720
Each piece of the
autosome may trace back

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:09.350
to a different ancestor, whereas
the Y traces back to one,

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:11.780
the mitochondrial traces
back to one female ancestor

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:14.900
in the past, all the way back
to a single common female

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.510
ancestor-- that is,
the lucky mother of all

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:19.730
of our mitochondrial
DNA, or the lucky father

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:21.469
of all of our Y chromosomes.

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:23.449
The same is not true
for the autosomes.

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:25.670
And that's a point that
I can't emphasize enough,

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:27.380
and I will try
and bring up again

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:32.690
to tell you what this means
for our evolutionary past.

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:36.167
So for technical reasons,
the first part of our genome

00:34:36.167 --> 00:34:38.000
that was studied, and
addressed the question

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.916
of human evolution, was
the mitochondrial DNA,

00:34:39.916 --> 00:34:42.770
because it was isolated, it was
small, it was in the cytoplasm,

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:46.520
we could isolate it
experimentally, and study it,

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.020
back in the 1980s.

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.929
And we were able to get
DNA sequence information.

00:34:50.929 --> 00:34:53.929
There was a landmark
study by Rebecca Cann

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:57.290
and Alan Wilson at
Berkeley, in 1987,

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.930
where they surveyed
mitochondrial DNA variation

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.320
in many people from
Africa, Asia, and Europe.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.800
And what they inferred was
that all the mitochondrial DNA

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.110
in these people they
looked at today traced back

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:11.810
to a single woman
who lived in Africa.

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:14.540
And I think it was the press,
and not the scientists,

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:17.590
who dubbed that person
mitochondrial Eve.

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:20.360
It gives us that strong
metaphor of tracing back

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.430
to a single woman, in the
Garden of Eden-- which

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:24.980
is a rather unfortunate
metaphor, in some regards,

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.290
because the work did
not imply that there

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:30.200
was only a single woman
living at the time.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.150
But there was just
one woman who was

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:36.650
the ancestor of all
mitochondrial DNAs today.

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:38.960
This work was
reproduced, in a sense,

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.710
in the year 2000
by Ulf Gyllensten

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:45.510
and Max Ingman in
Sweden, and colleagues.

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.500
They looked at the entire
mitochondrial DNA genome.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.320
They sequenced the entire genome
in 53 different individuals,

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.266
also from Africa,
Asia, and Europe.

00:35:53.266 --> 00:35:54.890
And I'm showing the
tree that they were

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:58.270
able to infer from the data.

00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:00.350
And what you can see,
here, is that you

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:03.250
have African lineages
on the bottom,

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:06.140
and Eurasian
lineages on the top.

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:09.020
And you can see that the
African lineages on the bottom

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.880
are longer, deeper.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.850
And so, this reflects
part of the inference

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:18.440
that they made that the
ancestor was in Africa.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.040
They found greater
African diversity,

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:24.020
they found that the place
of the ancestor was Africa,

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:26.540
and that they found the
time of the ancestor

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:31.130
was recent-- only going
back about 170,000 years.

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:33.830
So those are the
predictions of which model?

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:37.790
The recent Africa
replacement model.

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:40.040
Another very intriguing
piece of evidence

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.890
comes from Svante Paabo
and his collaborators,

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:45.650
their work on ancient DNA.

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:48.680
They were able to
isolate a small amount

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:52.484
of mitochondrial DNA
from Neanderthal fossils.

00:36:52.484 --> 00:36:54.650
And as you can imagine,
this is a tricky enterprise.

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:57.040
Not only does the DNA
degrade over time,

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.330
but all the people
who've handled the bones,

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:01.960
or all the DNA that's floating
around in the laboratory,

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:05.030
is just as easily studied
as this tiny, tiny amount

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:06.950
of Neanderthal DNA,
unless you're very

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:09.290
careful not to contaminate it.

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:11.390
But they we're able
to show, conclusively,

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:14.090
that the mitochondrial
DNA from their extractions

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:18.765
of this Neanderthal bone were,
in fact, Neanderthal DNA.

00:37:18.765 --> 00:37:20.390
They did the experiment
multiple times,

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:22.670
for multiple
Neanderthal individuals.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:25.040
And they showed in
this tree, over here,

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.260
that the Neanderthals were
all very closely related

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:31.400
to each other, and yet very
different from the huge number

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.800
of sequences that had
been examined in humans

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.200
at that point,
suggesting that there

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:40.340
was no Neanderthal mitochondrial
contribution to the human gene

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:41.930
pool.

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:45.230
Again, this is a prediction of
the recent African replacement

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:51.590
model, whereby African
ancestors make the transition

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:54.800
to modern form, and then
spread out, replacing

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.430
all the archaic forms.

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:01.520
This is what I'm calling
the mitochondrial paradigm,

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.830
because this work
was so powerful.

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:05.570
It came at a time
before we had studied

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:07.260
much the rest of the genome.

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.320
It came at a time
when archaeologists

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.792
and paleontologists were
making these debates based

00:38:11.792 --> 00:38:14.000
on fossil evidence, and they
weren't getting anywhere

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.410
with their arguments.

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:17.930
And this seemed to be the
first genetic evidence that

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:20.540
came down, very
strongly, on the side

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:23.210
of the recent African
replacement model.

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:28.150
This is an image from the
cover of Newsweek, in 1988.

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:32.270
They're flirting with this
idea, again, of African Eve--

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:37.040
mitochondrial Eve-- and the
search for Y chromosome Adam.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.070
And this diagram, on the
left, shows you, also taken

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:43.220
from nature magazine, a
summary of the results

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:49.070
that were published
by Cann et al in 1987.

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:52.040
Now, it was clear to
many of us working

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.650
in the field of genetics that
mitochondrial DNA is just

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:56.690
one little tiny
part of the genome,

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:58.619
and that we really
need to investigate

00:38:58.619 --> 00:39:00.410
many other parts of
the genome to see if we

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:02.580
would find similar patterns.

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:05.720
The most obvious next place
to look was the Y chromosome.

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.880
And this reflects work
that my lab has done,

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.820
and another lab at Stanford,
over the last decade

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:14.870
or so, where we were pioneers in
looking for variation on the Y

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:17.750
chromosome and
tracing variation,

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:20.210
creating these genealogical
trees to see what it told us

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:22.190
about human evolution.

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:23.900
And what I'm going
to say is-- it's

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:25.700
very simple-- the
pattern is almost

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.910
identical to what had been
found for mitochondrial DNA.

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:31.040
Number one, you can
see the tree has

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.810
the African lineages
that are longer

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:34.730
than the non-African lineages.

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:38.440
You can see that African
diversity is greater.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.310
The place of origin is Africa.

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:43.020
And the time to the most recent
common ancestor, for the Y,

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.520
is even more recent than
for the mitochondrial DNA--

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.680
only going back, roughly,
about 100,000 years.

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:52.460
Remember, the mitochondrial DNA
trace back about 170,000 years.

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:55.640
So both systems are telling
us pretty much the same thing.

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:58.520
But the fact that they traced
back to different times

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.040
is quite interesting.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:04.670
It just highlights that each
part of the genome traces

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:06.837
back to a different
ancestor, and that ancestor

00:40:06.837 --> 00:40:09.170
may have lived at a different
time or a different place.

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:11.504
In this case, the place happens
to be the same-- Africa.

00:40:11.504 --> 00:40:13.211
And what we want to
know is, if we looked

00:40:13.211 --> 00:40:15.020
at many parts of the
genome, would they all

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:18.620
trace back to ancestors
that live in Africa,

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:22.600
consistent with this recent
African replacement model?

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.990
Well, that work was done in the
middle '90s and the late '90s.

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:29.460
And by this time,
new technology had

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.850
emerged that allowed us to
examine greater portions

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:34.640
of the genome more efficiently.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.820
And we started to
build up a lot of data

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:39.720
on the autosomes and
the X chromosome.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.550
So the rest of the talk-- the
rest next section of the talk--

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:46.480
will be telling you something
about this huge body of work.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:50.060
So I'm going to try and
summarize it very briefly.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:53.050
First of all, if we look
at genetic diversity

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:55.220
on the X and the
autosomes, compare

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:58.600
that the level of diversity
between Africans non-Africans,

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.580
you can see something
that's familiar to you.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:03.260
There's greater diversity
in African populations

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.870
than in non-African
populations, for both autosomal

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:07.450
and X-chromosomal data.

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:09.380
There's about a 30%
or 40% reduction

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.180
in non-African
diversity, perhaps

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:14.430
hinting, again, at this
older population in Africa.

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:16.300
Maybe our autosomal
and X diversity

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:20.350
is reinforcing this
idea an African origin.

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:23.390
Then there was a fellow
named Naoyuki Takahata,

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:26.770
a Japanese fellow,
who wanted to do

00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:29.270
his own analysis of the nuclear
genome, which is much more

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:31.780
difficult to do because of
the recombination obscuring

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:34.300
the history of these
lineages over time.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.550
But what he was
able to do was find

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:38.890
a number of studies
of the autosomes

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:41.660
and the X chromosome--
independent regions,

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.020
different gene
regions, that are shown

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.120
in the column on the left.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.370
In the top two columns are
the Y and the mitochondria.

00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:51.490
It's just review for you to see
that they also trace to Africa.

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:54.100
But many of the regions
on the X and the autosomes

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.600
also traced to Africa.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.612
But notice that
not all of them do.

00:41:57.612 --> 00:41:59.320
Here is a region that
seems to trace back

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.616
to an African ancestor.

00:42:00.616 --> 00:42:01.990
Here's another
region that traces

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:03.890
back to an Asian ancestor.

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:06.071
Here's one of the traces
to a European ancestor.

00:42:06.071 --> 00:42:06.570
I'm sorry.

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:08.350
There are two
tracing back to Asia,

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:10.960
and the rest are
tracing back to Africa.

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.720
And there's one tracing
to Europe or Africa.

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:16.930
So the general pattern is,
yes, a lot of variation

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:19.409
in the nuclear genome
is tracing to Africa,

00:42:19.409 --> 00:42:20.450
but there are exceptions.

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:23.200
And I don't want those
exceptions to get lost.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.850
I will talk about them,
explicitly, in a minute.

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:28.810
But let me talk a little
bit now about some

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:31.810
of the differences between
the mitochondrial and the Y

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:35.090
chromosome results, and the
autosome and the X chromosome

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:36.200
results.

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:40.700
I've shown, again, this fossil
timeline of our ancestry,

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:41.580
on the right.

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:44.050
And on this side,
I'm showing you

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:46.960
the time at which these
different parts of the genome

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.575
traced to an ancestor.

00:42:48.575 --> 00:42:50.950
So I've already mentioned that
the Y and the mitochondria

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:53.230
trace back to an
ancestor very recently,

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:54.970
within the last 200,000 years.

00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:56.350
And I'm showing that here.

00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:58.850
Notice, for the X and
for the autosomes,

00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:01.810
the mean time for
many different studies

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:05.620
traces these parts of the genome
back almost 1 million years

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:06.890
or more.

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:07.980
Sorry.

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:11.180
Lost the slide for a second.

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:14.190
So this is the average time
back to an ancestor on the X

00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:16.450
and the autosome--
almost a million years.

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:18.550
And the bar-- the
vertical bar-- shows

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:22.000
some of the range of estimates,
back to the ancestor, some

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.530
of them going back to
almost 3 million years ago

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:26.080
on the autosomes.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:29.410
So this is going back to time
when australopithecines were

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:31.330
still walking around in Africa.

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:34.910
But even the means are telling
us something much deeper

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:37.700
in time than these
haploid-- or Y

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:41.620
chromosome in mitochondrial--
regions are telling us.

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:45.350
Just to highlight what some
of these patterns look like,

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:47.140
this is works that's
been done in my lab

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:48.820
in the last few
years, where we looked

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:51.315
at a bunch of different
regions on the X chromosome.

00:43:51.315 --> 00:43:53.600
I'm showing the X chromosome
lying on its side,

00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:57.640
down here on the x-axis-- 16
different regions of the X

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:58.634
chromosome.

00:43:58.634 --> 00:44:00.550
And I want to emphasize
that these regions are

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:02.180
unrelated to each other.

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.100
They are
independently-evolving regions

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:06.300
because the process
of recombination.

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:08.680
And so, when we
looked and estimated

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.775
the time of the ancestor for
these 16 independent regions,

00:44:11.775 --> 00:44:13.907
and plotted them out
along chromosome,

00:44:13.907 --> 00:44:15.490
you could see they
varied quite a bit,

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:18.140
from pieces of the
DNA that traced back

00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:20.680
to an ancestor
400,000 years ago,

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.620
to some that traced as far
back as 2 million years ago.

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:26.230
There's no particular
pattern when

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:28.510
we look at them, as spread
out on the X chromosome

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:32.840
as they are, but you
see this variability.

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:39.700
If we plot those times, now,
not plotting them against the X

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:43.200
chromosome, and plotting them
against just an axis of time--

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.530
going from 200,000 years
back to three million years--

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:49.850
you can see that the observed
values, that I just showed you

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:53.530
on the previous slide, give you
a bimodal distribution of times

00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:55.060
back to the ancestor.

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:59.860
This group here, and
this outlier group here.

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:02.840
And these are the observed
times the common ancestor

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.330
that I just described.

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:07.410
This curve, here, represents
the expected time back

00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:10.570
to the common ancestor under
a recent African replacement

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:11.570
model.

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:14.770
So if we were able to simulate
a recent African replacement

00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:19.480
model, and you do this from
many different regions of the X

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:22.910
chromosome, we'd expect most of
the regions on the X chromosome

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:25.946
to trace back to an ancestor
about 600,000 years ago.

00:45:25.946 --> 00:45:27.320
But then, there's
this tail where

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.350
we might expect some
to trace back further

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:32.019
in time, under the same model.

00:45:32.019 --> 00:45:34.060
But if you notice, here,
this second little group

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:39.080
in this bimodal distribution,
on the tail of this expected

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:40.640
curve, they're outliers.

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.250
And they're not fitting
the model, exactly.

00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:46.160
So if we were to summarize
what this data were telling us,

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.780
would be that, most
of the data are

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:50.750
consistent with
this expected curve,

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:52.940
the model of the recent
Africa replacement.

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:54.770
But the recent African
replacement model

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:56.570
can't explain all of the data.

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:58.160
There are some outliers.

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.290
And so, we wanted know
what these outliers were--

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:02.330
what was going on with them.

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:06.620
And so, one of them--
I'm going to tell you

00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:10.700
one of the stories of
one of these outliers.

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.520
This is a region on
the X chromosome,

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.070
way out near the tip.

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:17.210
It's a region of DNA that has no
particular function right now.

00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:18.080
It's a pseudogene.

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:20.870
It once functioned as a
gene, but it experienced

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:21.950
some knockout mutations.

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:22.910
It no longer functions.

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:24.840
So it's evolving in
a very neutral way.

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:28.210
We don't expect it to be
affected by natural selection.

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:32.370
And Dan Garrigan, in my lab,
was heading up this study.

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:33.010
And here's Dan.

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:35.385
I couldn't find another picture
of him other than the one

00:46:35.385 --> 00:46:37.740
riding his dog.

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:42.740
But the pattern we saw,
on this particular region

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:45.410
of the genome, was completely
different than what

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:47.720
I was showing you for the
mitochondrial DNA and the Y

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:49.334
chromosome.

00:46:49.334 --> 00:46:50.750
If you noticed,
before, there were

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:53.330
Africans on one side of
the root of the tree,

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:55.220
and everybody else on the right.

00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:58.580
Here, you see Asians on one
side, and Asians and everybody

00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:00.560
on the other side.

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.410
There was greater diversity
in Asia, as opposed to Africa.

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:05.360
The place of origin is Asia.

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:09.440
And the time of the ancestor
is almost 2 million years ago.

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:12.260
So we wanted to know
what this meant.

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:16.250
Here's a way of portraying
that genealogy for that gene,

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:18.650
right here, on the right,
against the fossil record

00:47:18.650 --> 00:47:19.290
again.

00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:21.890
And you can see that
time of the ancestor,

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:23.840
back here at the
root of this tree,

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:27.320
corresponds very
nicely to the time when

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:30.680
Asian erectus and African
ergaster were splitting,

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.060
diverging.

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:34.580
And so, we think that
part of the genealogy

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:36.770
of this particular
locus in the genome

00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:39.740
is reflecting erectus ancestry.

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:44.480
So how would we have some
erectus ancestry in our genome?

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:48.860
Well, this is a slide I've taken
from a paper first reporting

00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:50.720
the floresiensis finds.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.720
I thought it was very fitting,
because what they did was

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:57.470
they showed how the finger
leading from Homo erectus

00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:59.690
to floresiensis,
bringing it right up,

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:01.910
overlapping in time
with Homo sapiens.

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:06.710
If we just imagine that as a
potential for interbreeding,

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:09.140
then we could imagine
a scenario where,

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:11.390
as modern humans
came out of Africa

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:15.140
and colonized Asia-- Southeast
Asia-- found themselves face

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:16.940
to face with these
archaic forms,

00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:18.620
there may have been
some interbreeding.

00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:21.760
And this, depending on
what level this occurred,

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:25.010
could have allowed
certain of erectus genes

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:28.700
to filter into the
human gene pool.

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:31.250
So this was probably
the first evidence

00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:33.090
we had of something like this.

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:36.362
There's more evidence
accruing as we speak.

00:48:36.362 --> 00:48:38.570
There are other studies
shown in the literature where

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:40.970
we have these ancient
diverged lineages that

00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:43.430
don't fit the recent
Africa replacement model.

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:45.560
They certainly don't
outnumber the number

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:48.290
of loci that do fit the
model, but they are certainly

00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:50.990
something we need to pay
attention to in understanding

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:53.000
what's going on.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.584
So because we have these
different patterns,

00:48:55.584 --> 00:48:58.250
and each region of the genome is
telling us a slightly different

00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:00.590
story, I like to think of
the genome as a mosaic--

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:03.050
as an evolutionary mosaic.

00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:05.030
If you look at one
region of the chromosome,

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:07.370
it'll have a certain
genealogical pattern.

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:09.320
Maybe it's tracing,
deep in time,

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:10.612
to a certain part of the world.

00:49:10.612 --> 00:49:13.278
If you look at another region it
may have a completely different

00:49:13.278 --> 00:49:13.790
pattern.

00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:15.170
It may be tracing,
more recently,

00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:16.544
to a different
part of the world.

00:49:16.544 --> 00:49:19.460
Or it may be that that
particular region has undergone

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:22.790
adaptive change-- it's
reflecting the process

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:25.070
of natural selection.

00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:27.560
In any case, we can't
think of the genome

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:30.510
strictly in terms of tracing
back to a single ancestor.

00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:33.410
We have to think of it
in this more complex way.

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:35.360
It makes our analyses
more difficult,

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:36.860
but I think it's
shedding some light

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:40.810
on some very complex processes
that were going on at the time

00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:44.090
that Homo sapiens emerged.

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:47.000
So how would I go
back, and say, what's

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.060
the best model to explain what
we've observed with the data?

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:53.810
I would say that neither of
the extreme models I presented

00:49:53.810 --> 00:49:55.710
can explain all of the data.

00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:58.220
But if we come up with some
kind of intermediate model,

00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:00.500
borrowing aspects of
those two extreme models,

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:04.010
we might very well be able to
explain the patterns we see.

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:07.400
So if we borrow the part of
the recent African replacement

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:10.199
model, where populations
are isolated and tending

00:50:10.199 --> 00:50:11.990
to speciate, tending
to be different enough

00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:13.880
so they no longer
interbreed, but able

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:17.360
to exchange some
genetic material-- gene

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.310
flow between populations,
which we borrow

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:23.360
from the multiregional
model-- we could explain,

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:26.480
perhaps, the bulk of our
genome coming from one

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:30.980
place-- Africa-- more
recently, with some leakage

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:35.330
of these more divergent lineages
penetrating into our genome.

00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:37.730
And so, that is the
current view that, I think,

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:43.120
explains all of the data best.

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:46.700
So what it means is that for
the bulk of our genome tracing

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.840
to Africa, recently,
we're mostly

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:51.760
modern Africans,
wherever you live--

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.490
whether you live in Africa now,
or whether you've been in exile

00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:56.230
from Africa for a while.

00:50:56.230 --> 00:51:01.150
We are essentially modern
Africans, all of us.

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:03.040
Except, there is some
part of our genome

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.290
that may reflect something else.

00:51:05.290 --> 00:51:06.920
And I don't know
exactly what that is,

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:12.497
but if it's a problem for
you, there's a solution.

00:51:12.497 --> 00:51:14.080
Maybe that's not so
surprising to some

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:17.200
of the women in the
room who wondered

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:21.310
why their husbands
were the way they were.

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:24.680
And just to summarize,
we started out asking,

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:28.430
how far back in time
did our special features

00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:31.730
as human evolve on the lineage?

00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:33.950
It's clear that
we've experienced

00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:37.300
a stepwise evolution
of our specialness.

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:39.880
We started out as bipedal apes.

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.350
We eventually got bigger brains.

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:44.130
And we eventually became
modern, got bigger brains yet,

00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:47.500
and acquired the cognitive
abilities that we have.

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:50.020
We don't see the appearance
of things like cave art

00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:52.620
until 35,000, 40,000 years ago.

00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:56.470
But we do see, in Africa,
the very early underpinnings

00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:59.270
of art, of culture, in
the archaeological record.

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:01.380
And this is not a
very pretty slide.

00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:04.470
I just grabbed it off the
internet about two hours ago.

00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:06.430
I didn't have a chance
to make it look pretty.

00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:09.520
But we're tracing
some of the earliest,

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:11.410
through the
archaeological record,

00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:15.340
things that you might qualify
as art-- painted beads,

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:20.650
and things like that, that
trace back, in Africa, further

00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:23.560
than they trace back anywhere
else on any other continent.

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.570
So just like the
genome-- the bulk

00:52:25.570 --> 00:52:27.430
of our genome--
tracing to Africa,

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:30.880
it seems that the majority
of our cultural heritage

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:34.300
also traces back to
Africa, but only going back

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:37.460
on the order of 100,000
or 200,000 years.

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:39.790
So the qualities
that make us special

00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:41.980
are very new in evolution.

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:44.550
And I think we can
meditate on that,

00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:47.280
and I'll thank you,
take questions.

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:23.050
Thank you, Dr. Hammer.

00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:26.270
In a book I recently read,
called The Journey of Man,

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:29.170
the author uses what
are called DNA markers

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:32.270
to trace the geographical
migration of man.

00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:35.080
Can you explain to me,
please, what a marker is?

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:36.520
Sorry.

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:38.926
I'm losing your question.

00:53:38.926 --> 00:53:40.870
The Journey of Man.

00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:43.770
Using DNA markers to
trace the journey of man.

00:53:43.770 --> 00:53:45.615
Can you explain that?

00:53:45.615 --> 00:53:46.540
Can I explain that?

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:55.960
The journey of man,
and the markers

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:58.310
that are used to study
that, essentially,

00:53:58.310 --> 00:54:00.346
are the Y chromosome and
the mitochondrial DNA--

00:54:00.346 --> 00:54:01.720
those two markers
that I told you

00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:04.990
about first, that trace back
about 170,000 years ago,

00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:08.830
or 100,000 years
ago-- and reflect,

00:54:08.830 --> 00:54:13.870
very nicely, the colonization
of the world that

00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:16.450
occurred after modern
Homo sapiens emerged,

00:54:16.450 --> 00:54:19.310
about 200,000 years ago.

00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:23.540
So that part of our
journey is something only

00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:26.380
going back 100,000 years or so.

00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:29.230
And the mitochondrial
DNA and the Y chromosome

00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:32.000
are very well suited for
tracing that journey.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.750
But for tracing the journey
that was before that preceded

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:37.160
that-- this entire
history that lies below

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.061
that-- we must look
to the nuclear genome.

00:54:39.061 --> 00:54:40.810
Because that's the
only place we where not

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:43.520
have the genealogical
depth to make inferences

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:44.709
about ancient history.

00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:56.920
Doctor, I read a review
recently of a book

00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:59.990
called Demonic Males by
a professor at Berkeley.

00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:02.620
And he was highly
dismissive of the idea

00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:06.110
that we share 98% of our
genes with chimpanzees.

00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:08.260
Was he just being
a crank, or what?

00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:12.810
Demonic Males?

00:55:14.769 --> 00:55:16.060
Was that the title of the book?

00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:17.830
I highly recommend the book.

00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:18.430
I'm sorry.

00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:21.220
So the question was that
there's a book written

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:22.180
called Demonic Males.

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:23.180
Yes, but I'm concerned--

00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:25.670
The author questioned the
relationship with chimpanzees?

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:26.710
Yes.

00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:28.770
And he's a professor
at Berkeley.

00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:30.820
Well.

00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:34.460
He says that Sibley and
Ahlquist got it wrong.

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:37.670
Well, I think that there's
too much evidence, now,

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:39.170
from the whole genome.

00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:41.410
We've now sequenced the
entire chimpanzee genome,

00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:43.139
the entire human genome.

00:55:43.139 --> 00:55:44.680
So if he had any
problems with Sibley

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:48.020
and Ahlquist's
experiments in 1984,

00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:50.960
or whatever, I think
that everything that's

00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:53.830
happened since then it has
verified their results.

00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:58.444
And I personally can speak
to aligning sequences

00:55:58.444 --> 00:56:00.610
from humans and chimps, and
counting the differences

00:56:00.610 --> 00:56:01.120
myself.

00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:03.560
So the data from
my lab don't lie.

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:06.612
I don't know about
anybody else's.

00:56:06.612 --> 00:56:07.578
[INAUDIBLE]

00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:14.120
Back on the slide
that had the map,

00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.160
and where each of
the fossils are from,

00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.920
and it said that,
over in Indonesia,

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:21.630
there were species
that might have existed

00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:24.320
as recently as
13,000 years ago, it

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:30.770
showed in green and purple
the different locations

00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:32.180
of the fossils.

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:34.210
And there was a
little bit of green up

00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:36.560
on the bottom of
the British Isles.

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:38.736
What is that representative of?

00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:45.650
Yeah.

00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:48.510
Well, I don't know.

00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:52.760
What's that green doing
in the British Isles?

00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:56.390
There is some speculation
that Homo erectus got back

00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:58.400
into Africa and up into
Europe, and made it

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.560
up as far as the British Isles.

00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:03.650
But there are also
other fossils that I

00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:07.460
haven't put on here--
Boxgrove, Homo antecessor, Homo

00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:11.270
heidelbergensis-- that
found their way into Spain

00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:12.650
and Western Europe.

00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:14.357
And they were transitional.

00:57:14.357 --> 00:57:15.190
They weren't modern.

00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:17.150
So I think maybe that
little patch of green

00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:22.240
might be the Brit's
version of archaic.

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:25.520
[INAUDIBLE]

00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:27.590
We shouldn't debate
how far that green goes

00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:29.920
up the British Isles, though.

00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:34.190
I have a couple of
questions about taxonomy.

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:36.530
When you say we're
modern Africans,

00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:40.815
no matter where we live, and no
matter the color of our skin,

00:57:40.815 --> 00:57:42.440
on the one hand.

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:46.700
And yet, on the other hand, when
you are tracing the development

00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:54.890
from apes down to our line, you
had apes in quotation marks.

00:57:54.890 --> 00:58:00.230
And Sibley and Ahlquist didn't
just compare humans and chimps,

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:02.180
but they compared
humans and gorillas,

00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:04.610
and gorillas and chimps.

00:58:04.610 --> 00:58:08.540
And of all the relationships,
the humans and chimps

00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:12.710
were the closest-- closer
than gorillas and chimps,

00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:17.150
or any other great apes--
which puts us squarely

00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:19.790
in the great ape group.

00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:24.330
So I'm curious why you
have the quotation marks.

00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:26.810
I didn't want to imply
that the hominid lineage

00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:29.150
itself was still an ape.

00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:31.130
We come from an ape stock.

00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:38.400
Well, but we still have 98%
plus agreement in the DNA.

00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:42.200
The taxonomic debate about
how you classify humans,

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.660
now that we know that
we're so close to chimps,

00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:46.110
is not resolved.

00:58:46.110 --> 00:58:48.140
There are some
authors who would say

00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:50.930
that chimps should
be Homo troglodytes,

00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:52.810
or we should be Pan sapiens.

00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:56.000
And this was suggested by Jared
Diamond in his book called

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.280
The Third Chimpanzee.

00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:58.535
That was my second question.

00:58:58.535 --> 00:58:59.360
Yeah.

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:03.170
So I don't mean to be able to
resolve the taxonomic debate.

00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:05.120
I think the problem
is when you start

00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:07.490
looking at these different
regions of the genome,

00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:10.120
and each of them is telling us
something slightly different.

00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:13.670
I mean, on average, yes, we're
98.8% identical to chimp.

00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:16.040
So we should take that
for what it's worth,

00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:20.015
and the taxonomy will
eventually be sorted out.

00:59:20.015 --> 00:59:22.860
But it's not completely
sorted out right now.

00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:28.760
But you said that we're almost
in the same genus as chimps.

00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:34.740
Again, a taxonomic problem
that is complicated.

00:59:37.930 --> 00:59:43.440
I have a basic question
about the-- is the DNA

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:48.150
that you're tracing coming
all from modern people?

00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:49.610
That's a very good question.

00:59:49.610 --> 00:59:53.100
Is the DNA that we're tracing
all from modern people?

00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:55.410
All of the work that I
reported to you tonight

00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:57.810
comes from
contemporary sampling,

00:59:57.810 --> 01:00:00.825
except the Neanderthal
bone mitochondrial DNA.

01:00:04.819 --> 01:00:06.360
There's very little
hope for us to be

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:10.260
able to recover autosomal,
X chromosomal, Y chromosomal

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:15.720
DNA from specimens that are
20,000 or 30,000 years old.

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:18.030
So we're really
probably going to have

01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:21.510
to live with looking at
contemporary variation

01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:24.930
and tracing it back, rather than
looking directly at the past.

01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:27.380
For that, we've
got paleontologists

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:30.260
and archaeologists who
look directly at the past.

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:33.450
Their challenge is to know
who left descendants and who

01:00:33.450 --> 01:00:33.950
didn't.

01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:34.810
OK.

01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:40.440
Well then, going back in
time to the common ancestor,

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.270
and looking forward,
what happened

01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:47.490
to all of the other DNA
that was in other people

01:00:47.490 --> 01:00:48.759
at that point in time?

01:00:48.759 --> 01:00:50.550
Well, that's an excellent
question as well.

01:00:50.550 --> 01:00:52.570
What happened to
the DNA lineages

01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:55.610
of all of the other ancestors?

01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:57.620
Well, you can think
of it like this.

01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:01.790
If we're tracking a
surname, for example,

01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:04.050
and there are 10
different people with 10

01:01:04.050 --> 01:01:06.690
different surnames, and
they have children--

01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:08.460
they have just two
children each--

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:11.070
they have a certain probability
of not having a son.

01:01:11.070 --> 01:01:12.750
And in those families
that don't have

01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:14.249
a son, one quarter
of the time they

01:01:14.249 --> 01:01:16.290
won't have a son, if
they're having two children.

01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:17.914
They will not have
their surname passed

01:01:17.914 --> 01:01:19.640
on to the next generation.

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.180
And so, that surname
goes extinct.

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:26.550
So it's a process of
extinction through a random

01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:29.070
who manages to get
their offspring

01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:30.090
in the next generation.

01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:32.329
For unilineal markers.

01:01:32.329 --> 01:01:33.870
Like the Y and the
mitochondria, it's

01:01:33.870 --> 01:01:36.930
a pretty simple story
of lineage extinction

01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:39.090
due to the lack of sons
or lack of daughters.

01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:41.310
The same thing can
be applied to others,

01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:43.800
it just takes a lot
longer when the lineages

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.110
are jumping between different
ancestors in the past.

01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:51.538
Over here.

01:01:51.538 --> 01:01:52.530
Oh, hi.

01:01:52.530 --> 01:01:55.680
From your long look at
the journey up to now--

01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:00.300
which, by the way, I thought
was very well summarized.

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.970
Do you have any
speculative thoughts

01:02:02.970 --> 01:02:08.770
about the future evolution
of humans, generally?

01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:10.650
In brief, I understand.

01:02:10.650 --> 01:02:13.830
And specifically, I'm
interested in whether you

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:18.240
see any indication
of, I don't know

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.500
if you'd call it
sub-speciation the possibility

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:31.620
of modern humans separating into
two or more different species.

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:35.230
Well, that's a very
tempting question to answer.

01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:36.720
I sometimes look
around and wonder

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.230
if we aren't already speciated.

01:02:46.410 --> 01:02:48.240
We say we should
learn from our past

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:50.160
so we don't make the
same mistakes again.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.440
All we can do is try
and understand the past.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:57.040
And I don't know how predictive
that is in the future.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.230
There are a couple of
things that come to mind.

01:02:59.230 --> 01:03:03.110
One is that humans
are still evolving.

01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:05.100
There is some work
that's just been reported

01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:08.220
showing that effects of
natural selection on the genome

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:09.490
are ongoing.

01:03:09.490 --> 01:03:14.670
So you might hear that, because
of medicine and other things,

01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:18.300
we've reduced the selective
pressure on humans

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:19.620
that we're no longer evolving.

01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:20.545
But we are.

01:03:20.545 --> 01:03:21.930
And there are
enough changes that

01:03:21.930 --> 01:03:24.336
have gone on in the last
10,000 years that show

01:03:24.336 --> 01:03:25.461
that we are still evolving.

01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:31.770
I guess the other
thing to think about

01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:38.010
would be how humans
have become somewhat

01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:40.980
decoupled from our environment
because of our technology.

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:47.280
[? I was ?] trying to trace the
origin, the ancientness, or how

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.265
recent our specialness evolved.

01:03:49.265 --> 01:03:51.390
And I think one of the
things that makes us special

01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:52.200
is our technology.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:56.050
And for probably a fairly
long period of time,

01:03:56.050 --> 01:03:59.010
going back a few hundred
years, anyway-- a short time

01:03:59.010 --> 01:04:01.080
in evolutionary
sense, but-- we've

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.550
develop technology
that essentially

01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:06.520
decouples our evolution
from our environment.

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:09.390
However, I think with
next year's lecture series

01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:13.380
on climate change, we're going
to find out that we've probably

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:17.580
created a new environment that
we may not be able to decouple

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:18.460
ourselves from.

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:21.690
So I think that's probably
something to think more about.

01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:23.405
How about round of
applause to Mike

01:04:23.405 --> 01:04:24.613
for an extraordinary lecture?

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:41.750
Before you all leave, just
quickly, that next Tuesday,

01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:45.040
which will be the final lecture
of the lecture series, which

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:48.370
will be on evolution of
disease, the HIV example,

01:04:48.370 --> 01:04:50.740
that lecture will be
at Centennial Hall.

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:52.570
And all the lecturers
from the series

01:04:52.570 --> 01:04:56.410
will be there at the
end for a small panel

01:04:56.410 --> 01:04:58.870
discussion of the whole series.

01:04:58.870 --> 01:05:00.840
Thank you for coming.
