00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.080
Hey,
what's up guys?
All right,

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.330
I like to start these things kind of slow as we let,
uh,

3
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.030
the video populate and get into people's feeds and let you guys jump in over

4
00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:12.690
here.

5
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.690
Obviously for all of these live streams that I've done for Patrion,

6
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:20.820
we usually we're doing them or for the years that we've been doing them,

7
00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:23.690
we were doing them,
uh,
behind the Patriot wall.

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.000
So the link was only going out to patrons and patrons were asking me questions

9
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:30.870
and we weren't making these public to everybody last month we decided to make

10
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:35.820
them public to everybody but only patrons,
uh,
could ask me questions.
Um,

11
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.140
so this obviously is going out to my,
my full feed.
So a,

12
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:44.080
actually we're about to cross 900,000 subscribers I think today,
probably a,

13
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.390
so I'm psyched about that.
I,

14
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:50.100
there's a ton of stuff I'm super psyched about at the moment.
That being said,

15
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.420
we've got a lot to talk about related to the,

16
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.060
the Sargon of a cod patrion situation and uh,

17
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.470
sort of the subsequent fallout from that and where that leaves a whole bunch of

18
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:02.430
us business wise,

19
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:06.150
where it leaves what I'm doing with you guys and everything else.
Um,

20
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.770
so I'm going to take plenty of questions here and I'm going to be as open and

21
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:14.850
honest with you about what I'm going through right now and what I think this

22
00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:19.851
Sargon vanning needs in the wider world of platforming and D platforming and the

23
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:22.014
rest of it.

24
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.770
And sort of what I'm thinking my future should be related to all of this and how

25
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:30.270
we can keep doing these things and keep them,
hopefully fan funded,

26
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:33.660
but that there's a lot of other options and that generally just what the hell is

27
00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:35.460
going on right now.
So,
okay,

28
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.450
so let me just start slowly with what happened.

29
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:42.900
If you don't know what happened here,
let me tell you what's going on.

30
00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:46.530
If you've been under an Internet rock for a couple of days,
uh,

31
00:01:46.531 --> 00:01:50.730
about five or six days ago,
Sargon of a cod who's a big youtuber,

32
00:01:50.731 --> 00:01:54.300
has about 800,000 subscribers.
He's been doing it for a long time,
uh,

33
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.090
was banned on Patriot.
Now quickly,

34
00:01:57.091 --> 00:01:59.760
for those of you that don't know Sargon at all,

35
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.350
Sargon uh,
when I started years ago,

36
00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:07.530
let's say five years ago when I started really realizing that something was

37
00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:11.250
rotten on the left and I saw how that was so connected to free speech and then I

38
00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:16.251
saw the rise of these social justice warriors who were hysterical and wanting to

39
00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:18.450
silence everybody.
And then when I started,

40
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.750
all of this was leaking into what I saw was happening with the progressive

41
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:25.020
movement.
When I started talking about that on youtube,

42
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.880
everybody was saying,
you've got to go talk to Sargon of Akkad.

43
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.230
You've got to talk to it.
Him,

44
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.840
he is the guy that has been sounding the alarms on this thing.

45
00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:37.560
You got to talk to them.
Anyway,
I did end up talking to him on his channel.
Uh,

46
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.870
and I tell you that because he was sort of the first one of the liberals that

47
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:46.260
was like,
guys,
what's going on with us?

48
00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:48.990
We're not acting liberal anymore.
And then of course,

49
00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:51.750
that leads to everything that I've talked about over these couple of years,

50
00:02:51.751 --> 00:02:56.040
right?
Like the left is no longer liberal.
The progressive's have purged,

51
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:57.000
they're free thinkers.

52
00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:00.970
And it's becoming an authoritarian movement that is against liberalism,

53
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:05.140
which is rooted in the individual and,
and live and let live acting.
Okay.

54
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.560
So because our God is not a nobody,
he's not just some random youtuber.

55
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.860
He's actually been in the studio.
I've interviewed him.
His name is Carl Benjamin.

56
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:13.270
You might be interested in finding it out.

57
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.840
Eric Weinstein had an interesting comment on Carl,
uh,

58
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.110
that he's told me the other day.
He said,
you sort of a blue collar intellect,

59
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:22.360
which I think is actually a great compliment.
It's like he doesn't,

60
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:25.600
he's not a pure intellectual like,
you know,
that is,

61
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.150
that is studied at all of these universities for years and years.

62
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:30.990
Am I not to become a professor?
And the rest of it and the published off there,

63
00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:34.140
et cetera.
Uh,
but he knows these ideas in and out.
Uh,

64
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.790
but he's blue collar and that he's a regular guy.
He's,

65
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.690
he's a bit of a admitted troll.
He likes fighting with people online.

66
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.640
He loves me makers.
He was sort of born out of Gamergate,
all of those things.

67
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:46.474
Okay.

68
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.960
The point is the guy is not a racist and here is what happened or as far as I

69
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:55.030
know,
the guy is not a racist,
but let me tell you why he got bad.

70
00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.360
He was banned because patrion found a video a few days ago from 10 months ago,

71
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:05.890
from February of this year on another channel,
not even his channel,

72
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.860
uh,
where he was being interviewed over audio with someone and the guy's not a

73
00:04:09.861 --> 00:04:10.671
native English speaker,

74
00:04:10.671 --> 00:04:15.580
so there's a little bit of a stilted conversation and Sargon says the n word,

75
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.400
I think he says it at least twice now.

76
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.480
He was saying it because he was trying to use the language of the alt right

77
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:25.270
against them.
He was mocking their use and their,

78
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:29.590
the way they think about certain people based on the color of their skin.
Okay.

79
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.530
So I even said,
so now let me back up for a second.

80
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.930
So when I found out that Sargon got banned,

81
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.410
I immediately texted Jack Conti,

82
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:43.180
who is the CEO of Patriot and I've had jack in this studio.

83
00:04:43.181 --> 00:04:45.670
Okay.
Right across from me where this computer is.
Basically,

84
00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:50.060
he sat there and that was when Lauren southern was banned and,

85
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.250
and Jack Con d said that we do not ban people over speech.

86
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:59.251
We ban people over manifest observable behavior mob mob.

87
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.880
You can't make that up.
People mob.
Okay.

88
00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:08.390
That's what they ban people over mob behavior.
Irony is,
that's not even,

89
00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:11.230
I already,
it's so ridiculous.
It's not even already.
Anyway,

90
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.900
he used my platform to say what his company's policy were and they were not

91
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:20.320
about banning people over speech.
Also,
he had made a point of saying,

92
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:21.670
and it is in their terms of service,

93
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.750
that it has to be an infraction that occurs on their platform.

94
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.250
So in this case,

95
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:31.600
not only did Sargon not say the word on their platform,

96
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.070
it wasn't even on his youtube channel that he's promoting them for patron

97
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.620
Patrion,
right?
It was on someone else's channel,

98
00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:41.380
a small channel with like 4,000 subscribers in this case.

99
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.470
So this went against all the terms of service.
They,

100
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:48.610
they booted him without any warning and no chance of appeal or anything like

101
00:05:48.611 --> 00:05:52.660
that.
And people are seriously pissed right now and I get why they're pissed.

102
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.860
I'm pissed.
And on all the last three days,
I mean,
this basically,

103
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.840
I've met a lot going on these last couple of days as I finally ended the tour

104
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:03.050
with Peterson,
although we're,
we're continuing again in the new year.
Uh,

105
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.080
but we taped like five shows in the last two days were,

106
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:09.440
were finishing seriously strong for the,
for the end of the year.

107
00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:12.080
We got some great stuff coming.
Um,

108
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.650
but this has taken every other moment of my life because this is a direct,

109
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.000
not only is it related completely to free speech and everything that I talk

110
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:24.020
about constantly and what's going on with these platforms in these companies.
Um,

111
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.330
but it's also directly related to my business.

112
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.330
So just Fyi at the moment we've lost about 500 patrons and that's been,

113
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.270
I think it's around five or 6,000 bucks a month that we've lost.

114
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:38.510
Now most of the people have messaged me and said,
I'm really sorry Dave.

115
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.910
I love what you're doing.
This has nothing to do with you.

116
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.920
This is a stand against patriot.

117
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.280
Now the funny thing here is that I'm actually at one level,

118
00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:50.270
I'm very inspired that these people are you guys,
right?
You guys are just like,

119
00:06:50.271 --> 00:06:53.420
you know what?
Fuck this.
I can't take this shit anymore.
We have,

120
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.730
we have known this is coming,
these,

121
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.640
these lines of what is acceptable and what's not acceptable.

122
00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:01.370
Keep moving and moving and moving and Sargon.

123
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.840
I don't know everything about the guy,

124
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.620
but if this guy is the type of person that cannot be on a platform,

125
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:09.860
then half the people I know probably can't be on a platform and that may include

126
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:14.180
me and that probably includes you.
So we keep letting these things move.
Again,

127
00:07:14.181 --> 00:07:16.940
it doesn't matter what you think about Alex Jones,
but you take out one.

128
00:07:16.941 --> 00:07:20.840
It's not like when they take out one person,
they're like,
ah,
we got one person,

129
00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:24.110
we're good to go.
Let's pack it in guys.
Let's find a new hobby.
It's like,
oh,

130
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.170
well who can we keep moving?
Who can we keep moving?
Can we keep moving?

131
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.610
And the thing is,
when I started,
uh,
my Patrion hangouts today,
so this is,

132
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.550
this is the day that we do the rewards where I do these small Google hangouts

133
00:07:34.551 --> 00:07:37.550
with people.
Um,
right before I started,

134
00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:40.670
you can look at my last tweet or two tweets ago,
vox,

135
00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:45.050
that awful steaming pile of poop that is vox,

136
00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:48.260
which is funded to hundreds of millions of dollars a year yet is obsessed with a

137
00:07:48.261 --> 00:07:50.210
couple of Youtube burrs.
Um,

138
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.510
wrote a piece where they're calling a whole bunch of us once again of usual

139
00:07:53.511 --> 00:07:57.020
suspects.
They're calling a whole bunch of us all right and reactionary,
right?

140
00:07:57.021 --> 00:08:01.580
And the rest of it.
And it's like,
man,
will you keep doing that?

141
00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:04.320
And then eventually,
why wouldn't these platforms,
Buddhas?

142
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.150
So I have a vested interest in having this thing stopped because eventually it's

143
00:08:08.151 --> 00:08:09.590
going to come from me.
And by the way,

144
00:08:09.591 --> 00:08:11.030
if you're like the things I'm talking about,

145
00:08:11.031 --> 00:08:13.090
it's probably going to come for you too.
So I'm,

146
00:08:13.091 --> 00:08:16.370
I'm oddly inspired on some level that people are kind of standing up and they're

147
00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:19.650
saying we're not going to put our money,
uh,
to companies that aren't,

148
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:23.600
don't support what we believe in or at least respect free speech and whatever

149
00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:26.820
else.
And then at the same time,
I'm taking a business hits,

150
00:08:26.821 --> 00:08:27.561
so I'm not sure what to do.

151
00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:32.330
So let me just throw out just one quick little promo thing here.

152
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.210
Um,
if you can go to Dave Rubin,
not if you can,

153
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.620
if you'd like to go to Dave rubin.com/donate,

154
00:08:39.621 --> 00:08:43.430
you can donate there.
Uh,
and keep the show independent.

155
00:08:43.431 --> 00:08:48.350
We are a hundred percent independent.
I am my boss.
I am the CEO of this company.

156
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.280
We are a,
we have several employees now.
The morning that this all went down.

157
00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:57.030
We just actually flipped one of our part timers to a full or,
um,
I'm the,

158
00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.680
I'm super proud of what we've built here.

159
00:08:58.681 --> 00:09:01.410
We built a great community beyond just the conversations we're having,

160
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:02.070
all of that.

161
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:05.100
I've traveled the world this year and met thousands and thousands of you guys.

162
00:09:05.101 --> 00:09:07.740
It's,
it's all good.
It's all good.
Um,

163
00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:11.310
and if you want to help us keep it independent and you're not happy with what's

164
00:09:11.311 --> 00:09:14.400
going on,
on Patrion on,
you can go to Dave rubin.com/donate.

165
00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:17.910
You can do a one time donation or a monthly donation.
Paypal credit card.

166
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:19.020
Doesn't matter.
Okay,
so that,

167
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:22.680
I just wanted to say that because a lot of you guys are asking me,
um,

168
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.830
I spent the last couple of days really,
really,

169
00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:28.350
really trying to figure out what to do about this.

170
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:33.380
I wrote a statement that I almost published where I was going to announce that I

171
00:09:33.811 --> 00:09:37.140
was leaving patrion on.
I was going to do something nuts.
I mean a normal person,

172
00:09:37.141 --> 00:09:42.141
a normal person in business doesn't voluntarily kiss 65 or 70% of their monthly

173
00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:46.350
revenue.
Goodbye,
but I was going to do it because I really thought like,

174
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.950
we're not going to get many more of these moments.
You know what I mean?

175
00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:52.410
It's a little bit like you don't want to swing too early when something's

176
00:09:52.411 --> 00:09:53.670
happened and you don't want to swing too late.

177
00:09:53.671 --> 00:09:55.020
You want to swing right at the right moment,

178
00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:57.810
but we don't know when that right moment is anymore.
These,

179
00:09:57.811 --> 00:10:02.811
these bands and these shadow bands and algorithmic nonsense,

180
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:07.230
it all seems so arbitrary and ridiculous that we don't know when it is going to

181
00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:08.490
happen.
You know what I mean?

182
00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:11.490
Like it's very possible that ever that right now there's a Google engineer

183
00:10:11.491 --> 00:10:13.410
watching this right now going,
Oh man,

184
00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:15.750
I hope you will just slip up and say something.

185
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.750
Say the word that Sargon said so I can give him the boot to,

186
00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:20.910
I mean we just don't know what the hell is going on here.

187
00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:25.911
But I do know that the CEO Patrion sat in my studio and said this is about

188
00:10:26.131 --> 00:10:29.840
behavior and these are about things that happen on the platform.
And,

189
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.850
and either he changed or he lied to me or he doesn't know what he's talking

190
00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:33.450
about.

191
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.290
And I'm not even making this up to throw Jack Conte under the bus being like

192
00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:39.180
seal or one of these companies probably sucks.

193
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:42.930
And every day you're just under assault from social justice warriors who want to

194
00:10:42.931 --> 00:10:45.120
destroy another human being.
And by the way,

195
00:10:45.121 --> 00:10:47.730
this is permeating society at every level right now.

196
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.630
The Oscars can't even find a freaking host because they had Kevin Hart and then

197
00:10:51.631 --> 00:10:56.070
apparently he said faggot and now he can't host the Oscars.
I mean everything is,

198
00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.760
is just nonsense and drivel and we must stand up against it.

199
00:10:59.761 --> 00:11:02.690
And I think you guys are getting a little bolder in standing up against it.

200
00:11:02.691 --> 00:11:05.280
I meet people who are starting to get more engaged.

201
00:11:05.281 --> 00:11:08.460
I think people are realizing it's coming to all of our doorsteps.

202
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:12.900
If we don't do it,
and again,
as I say every freaking week,

203
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.760
I'm just some guy,
I don't know why I'm doing this.
I'm not a superhero,

204
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.330
but we've got to get better at this.

205
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.420
We've got to get better at organizing and fighting this.
Anyway,

206
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:26.720
what I've realized is it would not be wise or make any business sense to just

207
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:31.100
kiss 70% of my revenue goodbye and hope that a whole bunch of people are going

208
00:11:31.101 --> 00:11:32.940
to go and donate on my site.
I do.

209
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.640
There's a lot of things I want to do on that and to fix things.

210
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.320
But what I would say is at the moment,

211
00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:42.620
if we can migrate as much as many people from patrion and new people over today,

212
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.450
ruby.com/donate it will give me the leverage I need to do what I think is right.

213
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:54.220
That being said,
what you can do it or not do it.
It's all good.
Either way,

214
00:11:54.221 --> 00:11:56.770
we'll figure it out and I'm not sitting here like cry me a river.

215
00:11:56.771 --> 00:11:58.840
I want to solve this problem.
And I,

216
00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:01.450
and I can't get into all the conversations I've had about this,
but I,

217
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:05.530
but many of the people that,
um,
that you know and admire who are,

218
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.470
who are friends of mine that have been on the show and all that,
um,

219
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.070
they're thinking about what to do too.
Like everybody is,
I,

220
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.610
I think I can say that much.

221
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:17.410
Everybody is realizing this is a escalation of this,

222
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:21.520
that if we let this guy go down and we don't make anything of it,

223
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.290
it's not about him specifically,

224
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:28.420
but if we let another person go down who doesn't deserve to go down,

225
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.430
it's coming.
It's coming.

226
00:12:30.431 --> 00:12:33.580
And it's getting bolder every time because nobody stands up to it.

227
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:35.620
So we got to stock start standing up more.

228
00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:37.720
So I'm happy to take any of your questions on that.

229
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.830
I'm happy to take a whole bunch of questions on,
on a series of things.
Um,

230
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.250
and we'll,
we'll figure it out.
I mean,
look,
there's lots of options.

231
00:12:45.251 --> 00:12:48.580
I've had ad agencies reach out to me in the last couple of days and they're

232
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:52.230
asking me if I want to start reading ads on the youtube show.
You know,

233
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.540
I don't really want to do that.
I don't really want to do that,

234
00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:59.740
but maybe that is a safer financial route than going fully fan funded.

235
00:12:59.741 --> 00:13:03.910
But I love being fan funded.
Like I'm free.
I'm truly free.
You know,
we were,

236
00:13:03.911 --> 00:13:06.760
we get,
I mean,
I'll just tell you guys like we'd get,

237
00:13:06.761 --> 00:13:09.130
Patriot is our number one read source.
We get youtube red,

238
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.480
which is obviously all over the place.

239
00:13:10.481 --> 00:13:12.950
And then we do have ads on our audio podcasts.

240
00:13:12.951 --> 00:13:15.250
The only other thing that we've ever had in terms of revenue,
you know,

241
00:13:15.251 --> 00:13:17.290
a little bit on merge,
whatever.
Um,

242
00:13:17.291 --> 00:13:20.500
the only other thing we ever had was we had that partnership with learn liberty

243
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:26.320
for two years,
which we ended in June.
They wanted to continue it actually.

244
00:13:26.321 --> 00:13:28.420
And I just felt like we could try some new things.

245
00:13:28.421 --> 00:13:31.330
So I am talking to some other nonprofits about maybe doing some other things on

246
00:13:31.331 --> 00:13:35.350
the side.
Um,
but you know that that's what our revenue streams are.

247
00:13:35.351 --> 00:13:38.140
So maybe there are some other ways we can,
we can do some other things.

248
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.540
One of the silly thing on revenue,
uh,

249
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.900
just cause I think this will help frame a little bit of this for you guys.
So,

250
00:13:43.901 --> 00:13:47.080
you know,
we had Shapiro and Peterson in here on,
uh,

251
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:50.440
last Friday and um,

252
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:55.090
the video as a last I saw has around 1.1 million views.

253
00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:56.430
It's a two hour video.
It's,

254
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.840
I think it's one of the best things we've ever done in the studio.

255
00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:01.240
I think we got the best that have been the best out of Jordan.

256
00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:04.180
I think we covered new ground.
We went deep on religion,
um,

257
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:08.230
talked about differences and similarities and I thought it was really excellent.

258
00:14:08.231 --> 00:14:10.300
It operated.
It's sort of a very high bar.

259
00:14:10.301 --> 00:14:13.180
There were moments where I had to sort of dumb it down because I want,
I want,

260
00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:18.610
I want regular people to be able to understand these things too.
Um,

261
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.350
anyway,
two hour video,
uh,
over 1 million views.

262
00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:28.150
Um,
the average watch time on it.
Last I saw it was about 40 minutes,

263
00:14:28.151 --> 00:14:31.360
which is obscene.
Leila.
Hi for Youtube,
right?

264
00:14:31.361 --> 00:14:33.850
Like think about the last time you watch a 40 minute video on youtube,
right?

265
00:14:33.851 --> 00:14:37.510
What do you do?
You watch a kid fall down,
you watch somebody get hit in the nuts,

266
00:14:37.511 --> 00:14:41.350
you watch a cat and then you watch a 10 minute chat and then whatever else you

267
00:14:41.351 --> 00:14:44.560
watch,
any little little basketball,
whatever,
somebody playing video games.
Okay,

268
00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.220
so that's an incredible amount of content that people are watching.

269
00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:52.430
For a long time,
that video last I saw,
I had generated I around 5,000 bucks.

270
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.030
Um,
so now think about that.

271
00:14:56.031 --> 00:14:58.700
If that had been on CNN or just anything on prime time,

272
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.730
two hours of where a million people were watching.

273
00:15:01.731 --> 00:15:06.080
Now to give that a little context and NBC nightly news,
they tell you,

274
00:15:06.081 --> 00:15:10.070
I think average is around 1.4 million views and night.

275
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.790
So basically that video got roughly,
or by the end of this week,

276
00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:16.970
let's say we'll have the same amount that NBC news gets on any given night.

277
00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:21.110
Think about the revenue that NBC news generates from all the advertisers that

278
00:15:21.111 --> 00:15:23.540
are,
they probably are making millions of dollars that night.

279
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.700
That video made us 5,000 bucks.

280
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.790
So the economics of this whole thing are all at a whack too.

281
00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:32.780
And I think that that's also causing some of potential.
Uh,
anyway,
that's why we,

282
00:15:32.781 --> 00:15:34.430
we obviously are on Patrion on,
and again,

283
00:15:34.431 --> 00:15:35.900
I'm not saying any of this to cry me a river.

284
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.830
I'm just saying it because I'm trying to be as transparent as I possibly can be

285
00:15:39.831 --> 00:15:43.820
with you guys as we're at a strange crossroads,
which is also sort of

286
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.620
funny or odd for me because this has been such an incredible year.
I mean,

287
00:15:48.621 --> 00:15:51.620
I did about a hundred stops with Peterson.
I started doing standup again.

288
00:15:51.621 --> 00:15:53.930
We're selling out all these clubs.
Um,

289
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:58.670
I just got back from a Gig at University of Wyoming,
300 great young people,

290
00:15:58.671 --> 00:16:03.230
conservatives who are happy to,
um,
talk about ideas.
And when we did the Q and a,

291
00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:06.620
we had people come up first who disagreed with me.
Um,

292
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.890
so I'm feeling so great about everything and the show has grown.

293
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:13.080
We're going to cross 900,000 subscribers today or tomorrow.
Um,
there,

294
00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.260
there's so many good things happening that it's just great.

295
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.080
So it's kind of funny now that we're,

296
00:16:17.081 --> 00:16:20.360
we're ending the year on this odd note relative to the business,

297
00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:22.940
which is so relative to the core issues that we're talking about,

298
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:25.940
about platforming and free speech and everything else.
So anyway,

299
00:16:25.941 --> 00:16:28.490
that's all that I have a feeling I'm going to have about a gazillion questions

300
00:16:28.491 --> 00:16:31.640
about all of this stuff.
So let's see.
Um,

301
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.580
when is must going to kick off his version of Youtube?

302
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.890
It could it be called dark tube.
I Dunno.
You know,

303
00:16:36.891 --> 00:16:39.440
I've never been connected with Alon.
Obviously we're a,

304
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.930
we have a couple of connections in,
in,
uh,
in our worlds.
Um,

305
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.400
but we need somebody to get on,
get in on this.
You know,

306
00:16:46.401 --> 00:16:49.220
I think there's been some chatter from the billionaire class,
but it's like,

307
00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:50.450
we need you guys,

308
00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.510
if you happen to be a billionaire and you're watching this right now,
uh,
hello.

309
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.860
Uh,
you can email me right at Dave Ruben dotcom contact.
You'll find it.

310
00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.440
Um,
okay.

311
00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.370
I will follow you to paypal or anywhere else other than Patrion just announced

312
00:17:04.371 --> 00:17:06.800
where to go and I'll follow you.
You do good work.
Well,
thank you very much.

313
00:17:06.801 --> 00:17:11.240
It's just Dave rubin.com/donate and you can do monthly.
You can do one time,

314
00:17:11.241 --> 00:17:12.980
whatever it is.
Um,

315
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:17.690
what are the IDW members willing to do about solving the issue versus hoping

316
00:17:17.691 --> 00:17:21.700
someone else will do it instead,
fans leaving?
Patrion uh,

317
00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.440
me too before the end of the year are taking action.

318
00:17:24.441 --> 00:17:27.050
Where's the action from our thought leaders?
What a great question,
right?

319
00:17:27.051 --> 00:17:27.980
This is what it's all about.

320
00:17:27.981 --> 00:17:32.510
Like one of the things that I've said repeatedly over the last year is that I

321
00:17:32.511 --> 00:17:36.440
don't want these conversations just to remain conversations.

322
00:17:36.441 --> 00:17:40.810
I want to figure out how to put these ideas into action.
How do we get,
um,

323
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.020
politicians elected that,
that may be believe in some of these things?

324
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:49.100
How do we get the Democrats to return to liberalism,
let's say,
um,

325
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:53.190
which by in turn would then maybe a moderate,
moderate,

326
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.700
make the Republican's a little more moderate,
something like that.
Um,

327
00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.690
we're all talking about it.
I can't,
I can't,
I mean I just can't,

328
00:18:00.691 --> 00:18:03.630
I can't tell you the nature of all of the private conversations.

329
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.810
But what I can tell you is that everyone that you think might be thinking about

330
00:18:06.811 --> 00:18:09.510
this is thinking about it and trying to figure out what to do.

331
00:18:09.511 --> 00:18:12.300
And it's like we all have different considerations,
right?

332
00:18:12.301 --> 00:18:16.080
We all have different businesses.
Some of us are professors and authors,

333
00:18:16.081 --> 00:18:18.090
some of us are on speaking tours.

334
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:20.640
Some of us are generating more rev through youtube.
I mean,

335
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:24.060
we're all trying to figure out,
some of them aren't even on Patrion at all,
but,

336
00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:26.310
but understand the gravity of the situation.

337
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.240
So everyone's trying to figure it out.
Just try to be patient with us.

338
00:18:30.241 --> 00:18:34.380
Which sucks too because it's like,
man,
the more patient we are,

339
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.090
we're just giving room,
right?

340
00:18:36.091 --> 00:18:40.500
We're just giving room for these guys to come in and swoop down and knock out

341
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:44.070
the next one.
And it's like the more hysterical these,
these,

342
00:18:44.071 --> 00:18:47.210
what's acceptable to be said is so like,
you know,

343
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.490
if you miss gender or dead name,
I'd never heard this phrase deadnamed Cornell.

344
00:18:50.491 --> 00:18:55.130
If you dead name someone.
Meaning,
if,
if a trans person goes by,
um,

345
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.800
Alison,
but their old name was Andy,
if you call them handy,

346
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.370
you could be banned on Twitter.
I mean,
these really,
really,

347
00:19:02.371 --> 00:19:06.090
really Orwellian speech codes.
They could come to get anybody.

348
00:19:06.091 --> 00:19:10.920
I either because someone's making a joke or you know,
in a case of,
uh,

349
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:13.320
let's say Shapiro,
it's like facts don't care about your feelings.

350
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.650
I'm going to say what I think I've related to how many genders there are or

351
00:19:16.651 --> 00:19:21.360
whatever else it is.
So it's a mess.
And I,
and trust me,
we're,

352
00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:26.580
we're trying,
we're trying to figure it out.
Okay.
Um,

353
00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:27.900
let's see.

354
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:33.580
Plans for John mcwhorter to come on the show also where you were.
Chapstick.

355
00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.030
I ship you some.
My Lips are always dry.
That those,

356
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.940
can I get some chap stick in here?
I'm going to put on some chap stick right now.

357
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.400
Little Chap stick would be nice.
Um,

358
00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:45.930
they're a little dry.
A little dry.
All right,
good.

359
00:19:45.931 --> 00:19:49.350
So we'll get a little chapstick in here.
Um,
hey,

360
00:19:49.351 --> 00:19:52.260
Dave just subscribes your website.
Thanks for the critical work that you do.

361
00:19:52.261 --> 00:19:54.270
Thank you very much.
A chapstick.

362
00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.080
Apparently this livestream is brought to you buy Burt's bees.

363
00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.740
So there you go.
Alright.

364
00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:04.590
And I've got no got moist lips.
Okay,
there we go.

365
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.100
Let's see.
Here we go.
Um,

366
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:12.210
I feel like there's group think in television.

367
00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:16.080
I hear the pundits United in one agenda and saying practically the same thing.

368
00:20:16.081 --> 00:20:20.610
So are the heads of studios in charge and the people on television,
um,

369
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.360
and thus the people on television willing to say what they are told in exchange

370
00:20:24.361 --> 00:20:29.010
for money,
status,
fame.
Um,
oh,
I see.
Are The people,

371
00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:34.140
look,
I try not to judge people's motives,
so I don't know when you,
you know,

372
00:20:34.141 --> 00:20:36.570
it's funny,
I was in the gym the other day.
I'd never watched CNN anymore.

373
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:40.200
It's just painful.
It's just dribble endless Trump,

374
00:20:40.201 --> 00:20:44.880
Russia dribble you will not get smarter.
You will get dumber watching this.
Um,

375
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.860
but every now and again in the gym it's on,
and I'll flip the,
and I'm like,

376
00:20:47.861 --> 00:20:50.770
all right,
let me just pause and watch this.
I don't know,
like,

377
00:20:50.771 --> 00:20:53.470
do these people intentionally ask the stupid questions?

378
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:57.940
Did they intentionally conflate and confuse the issues?
I don't know.

379
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:03.040
Are some people more opportunistic than others and just one fame and fortune or

380
00:21:03.041 --> 00:21:04.960
I guess that's probably true.

381
00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:09.190
Or some people probably not that bright and maybe that helps them succeed in a

382
00:21:09.191 --> 00:21:13.940
talking head world.
That's probably true too.
Um,
so yeah,

383
00:21:13.941 --> 00:21:15.770
it's why people are tuning out of these things.

384
00:21:15.771 --> 00:21:19.430
No one's paying attention to these things and in a way that's why they're,

385
00:21:19.431 --> 00:21:21.920
they're cracking down on so many of us.
I mean,
think about it.

386
00:21:21.921 --> 00:21:26.210
Why is vox again today and it's not the first time they've done it writing an

387
00:21:26.211 --> 00:21:31.211
article that basically is trying to link me in Shapiro and Lacy Green and a and

388
00:21:32.451 --> 00:21:36.080
a couple others.
Um,
to the alt right.
It's like,

389
00:21:36.081 --> 00:21:38.660
you know why they're doing it because they're threatened by this.
So vox,

390
00:21:38.661 --> 00:21:39.930
which is tuned to,
you know,

391
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:44.950
like $200 million worth of VC money is worried about what a bunch of of upstart

392
00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:48.830
youtubers are doing because you can see we're getting all the clicks,

393
00:21:48.831 --> 00:21:52.070
we're getting all the views,
we're getting all the retweets and it's like,

394
00:21:52.071 --> 00:21:56.060
go look at,
go right now.
Go look at,
um,
I just pick,

395
00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:57.860
let me pick something that's hot,
like do,
do,

396
00:21:57.861 --> 00:22:01.370
do this test for me and someone can comment on it and I'll,
and I'll read it,

397
00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:06.640
look at buzzfeed or Huffington Post's last 10 tweets and then look at my last 10

398
00:22:07.401 --> 00:22:09.230
tweets and tell me which one has more traction.

399
00:22:09.231 --> 00:22:12.080
And there is no doubt that mind doing a couple of minor just promotions of this,

400
00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.060
which isn't the type of thing that gets a lot of traction,

401
00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:18.500
but I guarantee you if you were add all those up.
Mine we way,
way,
way,
way,
way,

402
00:22:18.501 --> 00:22:20.320
way bigger.
Um,
so they,

403
00:22:20.321 --> 00:22:24.860
they've had it with other interesting people who don't think like they do

404
00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:28.740
getting clicks and views and making people have conversation and,

405
00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.880
and having people be enlightened instead of,
um,

406
00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:33.030
<v 1>okay.</v>

407
00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:37.950
<v 0>Drill down to the point of stupidity.
So yeah,
it's a mess.
Um,</v>

408
00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:41.700
admittedly you have learned and grown from speaking to a variety of people.

409
00:22:41.701 --> 00:22:44.730
You said that your interview with Larry Elder Change Your viewpoint about

410
00:22:44.731 --> 00:22:49.140
systemic racism.
Has another guest fundamentally changed another point of view.

411
00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:54.400
Um,
that's a really good question.
You know,
you know,

412
00:22:54.401 --> 00:22:58.830
when I came back last year,
last September,
when I did that off the grid thing,
uh,

413
00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.880
not this past summer,
but the summer before,

414
00:23:00.881 --> 00:23:03.490
that was the first time where I did the August completely off the grid.

415
00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:08.180
And when I came back,
um,
I had said that although I had always sort,

416
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:09.280
or at least for the last couple of years,

417
00:23:09.281 --> 00:23:13.360
I thought of myself as an atheist that I didn't really like the term.

418
00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:15.070
I didn't like the word.
For me,

419
00:23:15.071 --> 00:23:18.270
it doesn't really capture a what I am because it's not,

420
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.350
I don't have a sort of lack of belief,
but I,

421
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:24.670
I do believe in something that I can't quite explain exactly what it is.

422
00:23:24.671 --> 00:23:27.370
So I just didn't want to use the term atheist who explain it anymore.

423
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:32.740
I can tell you that in the last year I'm having these conversations,
uh,

424
00:23:32.741 --> 00:23:36.160
with Shapiro and Peterson and I just had a great conversation yesterday.

425
00:23:36.161 --> 00:23:40.490
It will be up next week.
Excuse me with Bishop Barron,

426
00:23:40.491 --> 00:23:43.010
who's been on the show,
who's from the archdiocese here in la,

427
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:47.120
and with Rabbi Wolpe,
who is the rabbi at Temple Sinai in Beverly Hills.

428
00:23:47.121 --> 00:23:48.290
We had a great conversation,

429
00:23:48.291 --> 00:23:51.190
which I thought would be perfect to do right between Hanukkah and Christmas.
Oh,

430
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:53.900
by the way,
I also had,
yesterday,
I had a mom too.
Weedy on,

431
00:23:53.901 --> 00:23:57.650
that'll be up next week.
So my last three interviews with a rabbi,
a rabbi,

432
00:23:57.651 --> 00:24:01.310
a priest,
and any mom walk into a gay podcast.
There's garage,

433
00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:03.830
there's an old joke.
Um,

434
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:09.980
but I would say I've been moved on
the,

435
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:14.540
look,
this is a whole,
like,
we,
I could end up doing three hours on this thing.
Um,

436
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:18.290
but I've been moved on on a certain value of religion.

437
00:24:18.291 --> 00:24:20.930
It doesn't mean everyone has to be religious.
I'm not religious,

438
00:24:20.931 --> 00:24:25.640
but a certain value in belief of sort of an unmoved mover kind of thing.

439
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:26.960
Um,
you know,

440
00:24:26.961 --> 00:24:31.070
I've seen Jordan in these hundred or so shows that we've done together really

441
00:24:31.071 --> 00:24:35.540
stretches knowledge on this and really explain the value of these stories and

442
00:24:35.541 --> 00:24:39.650
that there are certain ancient truths that can't be,
um,

443
00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:44.090
that not every truth that exists can be empirically proven or that science and

444
00:24:44.091 --> 00:24:48.170
logic alone aren't enough to explain all of the driving forces that make us

445
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.980
human and make us love and hate and all of those other things.
Um,

446
00:24:51.981 --> 00:24:54.320
so I would say that's one that I'm,
I'm sort of evolving on,

447
00:24:54.321 --> 00:24:56.830
which is actually kind of cool.
Um,
and it's,

448
00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:00.050
and it's also like a very much an affirmation of,
you know,

449
00:25:00.051 --> 00:25:05.051
that I'm doing something good for a living because I don't mean this to be sappy

450
00:25:05.481 --> 00:25:06.590
or sarcastic even.

451
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:11.480
But like I sit across from people every day that I can learn something from and

452
00:25:11.481 --> 00:25:14.570
if I can just keep my mind open enough to learn something,
um,

453
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.870
or even here something that I disagree with and then that makes my belief

454
00:25:17.871 --> 00:25:22.580
reinforce,
uh,
afterwards,
uh,
that's pretty cool too.
So,

455
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.970
um,
I would say I'm,
I would,
I'm evolving on some of that stuff.

456
00:25:25.971 --> 00:25:27.440
I think it's a great conversation.

457
00:25:27.441 --> 00:25:30.050
I think the fact that so many people are thinking about it,

458
00:25:30.051 --> 00:25:33.760
that we can do videos on the nature of reality and,

459
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.990
and the nature of truth.

460
00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:40.310
And can you get value out of faculty on the p the fact that people care about

461
00:25:40.311 --> 00:25:41.660
this and not just a couple people,

462
00:25:41.661 --> 00:25:43.880
but millions and millions of people care about it.
I mean,
that's,

463
00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.780
that's pretty awesome.
Um,
do you ever get confused with David Ruben,

464
00:25:47.781 --> 00:25:51.110
the author also?
Do you have a book in you?
So first off,
that's hilarious.

465
00:25:51.111 --> 00:25:56.111
I was on Tucker Carlson last night and are before me was David Ruben,

466
00:25:56.871 --> 00:25:59.630
who is a mayor,
a former mayor in Israel.

467
00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:01.850
So a lot of people were confused because I was like,

468
00:26:01.851 --> 00:26:04.550
I'll be on Tucker Carlson tonight.
And then they tune in and there's a guy,

469
00:26:04.551 --> 00:26:09.440
David Rubin,
older guy,
white hair,
uh,
in Israel.
That was not me.
Um,

470
00:26:09.441 --> 00:26:12.860
also,
do you have a book in you?
So,
yeah.
Um,
Eh,
you know what,

471
00:26:12.861 --> 00:26:16.220
I'm just going to do it.
Uh,
we signed my book deal finally.
Uh,

472
00:26:16.221 --> 00:26:18.140
it's with a big publisher.
I'm super psyched.
I can't,

473
00:26:18.141 --> 00:26:22.930
I don't know that I can fully say everything.
Um,
but I'm writing it right now.
Um,

474
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:26.720
it is going to be the most difficult thing that I've ever done.

475
00:26:26.721 --> 00:26:30.170
That is very obvious.
Uh,
I'm trying to get seriously,

476
00:26:30.171 --> 00:26:34.760
deeply personal and not just political.
Um,
but the deal is done,

477
00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:39.200
the advances has hit the checking account.
Um,
and uh,

478
00:26:39.201 --> 00:26:42.290
and I'm psyched to do something that I think we'll be,

479
00:26:42.291 --> 00:26:44.880
we'll be real and relevant and it'll be out,
uh,

480
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:48.390
months before the 2020 election.
I want to get,
you know,

481
00:26:48.391 --> 00:26:50.760
cause then it's like they're just going to put our political book after

482
00:26:50.761 --> 00:26:53.160
political book and it's just going to be awful.
Um,

483
00:26:53.161 --> 00:26:57.480
so I think it's going to be out in September.
I'm sorry,
in the spring.

484
00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:01.500
Probably March or April of 2020.
I know that seems like a long time from now.

485
00:27:01.501 --> 00:27:05.250
I have to have the manuscript in by August 1st and it just takes time.

486
00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:09.510
It seems weird in this world of like such quick stuff happening all the time and

487
00:27:09.511 --> 00:27:13.240
live streams and all this other stuff.
But yeah,
it'll,
it'll be,
uh,

488
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:16.590
out then and I'm psyched and it's going to be a lot of work.
But you know,

489
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.300
what else am I doing?
Um,

490
00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.540
are you ever worried that your platform on youtube can be completely taken away?

491
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:27.000
Yeah.
I mean,
yeah.
Like how can I watch the tea leaves change?

492
00:27:27.001 --> 00:27:31.680
How can I watch Sargon be booted from Patrion and other people be booted from

493
00:27:31.681 --> 00:27:35.250
Twitter and people be kicked off Youtube and some people get reinstated.

494
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:39.900
And how can I watch all of these things happen and not think,
oh man,

495
00:27:39.901 --> 00:27:43.020
it could come for me.
Maybe not even cause it's saying,
I said,

496
00:27:43.021 --> 00:27:47.370
what if I had a guest on who went on a crazy racist tirade?
Well,

497
00:27:47.371 --> 00:27:48.690
we know what box would write about it.

498
00:27:48.691 --> 00:27:50.250
We know what buzzfeed would write about it.

499
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:54.510
And then eventually we know what the trolls would do and they'd be flagging,

500
00:27:54.511 --> 00:27:57.960
flagging,
flagging,
flagging,
and then eventually a youtube may be like,

501
00:27:57.961 --> 00:27:59.010
you know what?
Enough of this headache.

502
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.920
So that's why there is a technological answer to this.

503
00:28:01.921 --> 00:28:05.040
Maybe there's a block chain based video site coming up.

504
00:28:05.041 --> 00:28:08.940
Maybe people need to use more crypto to support the creators that they like.
Um,

505
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.460
but I think whatever you guys can do in your life to fight back,

506
00:28:14.461 --> 00:28:18.660
whether that's talking about these ideas or protesting,

507
00:28:18.661 --> 00:28:23.661
if you do it within the confines of the law or going to or not using services if

508
00:28:24.091 --> 00:28:26.040
you don't like them,
which is why as I said earlier,

509
00:28:26.041 --> 00:28:29.610
I'm watching my patrion money drop and I'm kind of inspired by it because it's

510
00:28:29.611 --> 00:28:32.820
like at least you guys are doing something.
Um,
and by the way,

511
00:28:32.821 --> 00:28:35.970
some people are going to my site,
they're not just abandoning me all together,

512
00:28:35.971 --> 00:28:38.070
but you're going to lose,
you know,
you know how it is online.

513
00:28:38.071 --> 00:28:40.440
It's like you're doing one thing and next thing you knew in 10 other things or

514
00:28:40.441 --> 00:28:43.080
looking at another video and like you just forget.
So you're like,
oh,

515
00:28:43.081 --> 00:28:45.360
I cancel this.
I let me go over to Dave rubin.com.

516
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.620
But then by the time you get there,

517
00:28:46.621 --> 00:28:48.720
you're already playing video games or something.
And you just forget it.

518
00:28:48.721 --> 00:28:52.770
It's just,
it's just how it is.
So it's Dave ruben.com/donate um,

519
00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.740
but I'm of course I'm worried about all of those things.

520
00:28:55.741 --> 00:28:59.640
I think we don't have an organized voice.

521
00:28:59.641 --> 00:29:02.100
We don't have a sensible plan fully yet.
I mean,

522
00:29:02.101 --> 00:29:03.710
I think there's a lot of discussion about what,

523
00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.700
what should happen and how do we fight this thing.

524
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.210
But I don't think we've solved it yet and we got a lot of work to do.
Um,

525
00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.830
do you get criticized by the LGBT community for associating with or interviewing

526
00:29:13.831 --> 00:29:18.120
those of faith that disagree with homosexuality?
So,
yeah.

527
00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.970
Um,
I don't know what the LGBT community is.

528
00:29:20.971 --> 00:29:23.760
It's funny when people talk about the black community or the LGBT community.

529
00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:27.720
I mean,
that's the type of collectivism that I don't like because within those

530
00:29:27.721 --> 00:29:30.810
communities,
of course,
you're going to have a truly diverse group of people,

531
00:29:30.811 --> 00:29:33.150
meaning all sorts of people think differently.
You're not going to believe this,

532
00:29:33.151 --> 00:29:36.000
but black people often have different thoughts that have nothing to do with the

533
00:29:36.001 --> 00:29:36.691
color of their skin.

534
00:29:36.691 --> 00:29:39.360
And Gay people often have different thoughts that have nothing to do with their

535
00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:40.230
sexuality.
I'm not,

536
00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:43.900
I'm not commenting on you specifically person who asked me this question,
but uh,

537
00:29:43.901 --> 00:29:46.480
but I do it too.
Sometimes I'll say the community,
then I'm like,
what?

538
00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:49.390
What does that really mean?
You know,
you can get general trends,

539
00:29:49.391 --> 00:29:52.810
let's say out of the community.
Um,
yeah,
I get shit from,
you know,

540
00:29:52.811 --> 00:29:56.650
did you see this article and dead spin the other day?
There was a title.

541
00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:01.740
The title of the article was gay conservatives should shut the fuck up.

542
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:06.670
Think about that for a second.

543
00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:11.470
The title of the piece that was tweeted out,

544
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:14.020
gay conservatives should shut the fuck up.

545
00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:19.240
These are a supposedly the tolerant people,
and B,

546
00:30:19.241 --> 00:30:22.900
these are supposedly the pro gay people,
right?
These are the lefties were,

547
00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.890
we're tolerant and we love gays.
You know,
we love minorities,

548
00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:32.560
but they don't,
and you really need to understand that they love you.
If you bow,

549
00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:36.490
that's it.
They don't love you because you're gay.

550
00:30:36.491 --> 00:30:38.350
They love you as long as you'll behave.

551
00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:43.030
They're not for women to say you're four women.
Everyone's for women.

552
00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.700
It's meaningless to say you're for women.
I'm,

553
00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:50.850
I want everyone on this earth to be treated equally under the law and live with

554
00:30:50.921 --> 00:30:53.860
a sense of dignity and hopefully find something that they're passionate about

555
00:30:53.861 --> 00:30:57.460
and live the best life they can live.
I'm for women in that.

556
00:30:57.461 --> 00:30:59.170
I want women to be part of that.

557
00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:03.100
But to say you're four women are the women who run the women's March,

558
00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:06.580
are they for Nikki Haley,
who I think is a spectacular woman,

559
00:31:06.581 --> 00:31:10.630
she's the former governor of South Carolina who was the US representative at the

560
00:31:10.631 --> 00:31:11.920
UN for the last two years.

561
00:31:11.921 --> 00:31:14.020
And maybe one day she'll be president of the United States.

562
00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:18.150
She happens to be a brown woman and that she's Indian,
but she's a Republican.

563
00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.740
Are you for Nikki Haley?
You're not for Nikki Haley.

564
00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.340
You're not for Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
You're not for women who disagree.

565
00:31:24.341 --> 00:31:28.510
So to say your four groups is actually ridiculous related to the gay thing.

566
00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.440
Um,
well it's interesting because it's like I never get,

567
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:35.620
not that anyone cares about the gay press or the advocate or out or any of those

568
00:31:35.621 --> 00:31:37.180
things anywhere.
Nobody reads them anymore.

569
00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.480
But it's like you'd think that maybe they'd write an article about me because I

570
00:31:40.481 --> 00:31:44.110
am openly gay and I'm doing this and people seem to care about it.
Right.

571
00:31:44.111 --> 00:31:48.190
Daily wire just did really cool interview with me that I was,
I was really,
uh,

572
00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.040
happy to do.
Um,

573
00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.660
so it's not for lack that I wouldn't want to talk to these people,

574
00:31:52.661 --> 00:31:55.360
but I'm out or advocate.
I forget which one,

575
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.390
about two or three years ago wrote a piece that Peter Teal,

576
00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:59.950
who's also openly gay,

577
00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.670
who spoke at the Republican national convention before Trump accepted the

578
00:32:03.671 --> 00:32:05.470
nomination.
He went up there,
he said,

579
00:32:05.471 --> 00:32:09.580
I'm a proud gay man and got a standing ovation at the Republican National

580
00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:12.600
Convention that was very under reported by the way.
You can't imagine why.
Um,

581
00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:15.280
but outer advocate wrote an article saying,

582
00:32:15.281 --> 00:32:19.690
Peter teals not gay because they've decided that your sexuality is in your

583
00:32:19.691 --> 00:32:22.240
sexuality.
It's how you behave out.

584
00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:25.660
If you were in the line with their political views,
then you can be gay.

585
00:32:25.661 --> 00:32:30.190
But he's not gay because he,
he votes for people that we don't like.
I mean,

586
00:32:30.191 --> 00:32:33.340
think how that's actually offensive.
Like,
it's hard to offend me,

587
00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:36.820
but that's actually events.
It.
Um,
what I can tell you is this,

588
00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:40.610
which is much more inspiring than what I've just said is that,
um,

589
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:43.880
on the last year or so where I've done a hundred stops and we were in probably

590
00:32:43.881 --> 00:32:46.730
15 different countries.
And why don't,
you know,

591
00:32:46.731 --> 00:32:50.840
people coming up to me in Helsinki and Stockholm on the street and Amsterdam at

592
00:32:50.841 --> 00:32:55.841
a store and where and everywhere in Kansas City and in Orlando and in San Diego,

593
00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:02.120
um,
that gay people come up to me all the time and they'll be like,

594
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.170
what happened to the gate?
We used to be fun.
We used to be edgy.

595
00:33:06.171 --> 00:33:09.830
We used to care about music and dance and being the other and it win for the

596
00:33:09.831 --> 00:33:11.690
pain,
for a pain.
Right.

597
00:33:11.691 --> 00:33:14.960
It was pain that brought that because a community that wasn't treated equally

598
00:33:14.961 --> 00:33:17.660
because these people could not get married often.
That,

599
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.630
that internal,
whatever,

600
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:24.950
that internal pain caused,
great art caused great humor,

601
00:33:24.951 --> 00:33:26.900
all of those things in music and all of that,

602
00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:31.280
well now we're equal and maybe some of that pain is gone,

603
00:33:31.281 --> 00:33:34.340
which I think is actually good because now we can be treated as shittily as

604
00:33:34.341 --> 00:33:37.040
everybody else.
But when you're not equal under the law,

605
00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:39.830
then you do deserve to be equal under the law.
Um,

606
00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.360
and you might act out differently.

607
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:45.170
So I think people are now seeing that as the progressive's have sort of

608
00:33:45.171 --> 00:33:49.280
infiltrated the gay community,
that gays aren't that fun anymore.

609
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:50.930
So I think a lot of gays are breaking.

610
00:33:50.931 --> 00:33:54.200
I think it's a little bit also of what Candice Owens has done with the black

611
00:33:54.201 --> 00:33:57.980
community,
so to speak.
Uh,
so there's interesting things happening right now.

612
00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:02.000
Um,
I'd like to pose the same question that you pose to Bridgette Gabriel.

613
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.290
What has been the personal costs for what you do?
Um,

614
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:11.810
well first let me just say that mostly this is great.
It's mostly great.

615
00:34:11.811 --> 00:34:14.320
This was the most rewarding year of my life for sure.
Uh,

616
00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:17.300
being part of the Peterson tour,
getting back into standup,
as I said,

617
00:34:17.301 --> 00:34:20.270
meeting so many people,
you know,
after the,
um,

618
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:22.190
after the show is we do a meet and greet.

619
00:34:23.390 --> 00:34:26.090
So Jordan doesn't meet and greet and I do a separate meet and greet and

620
00:34:26.091 --> 00:34:27.140
sometimes people go to both.

621
00:34:27.410 --> 00:34:30.710
And usually about 50 people or so come to my meet and greet and we get in a

622
00:34:30.711 --> 00:34:34.400
small room and it's about a half hour and I get to shoot the shit and meet you

623
00:34:34.401 --> 00:34:37.190
guys that people give me gifts and hugged me.
Well,
first off,

624
00:34:37.191 --> 00:34:39.650
no one can ever believe on real,
cause you guys only see me on youtube,

625
00:34:39.651 --> 00:34:41.840
but they want to poke me often.
Um,

626
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:44.960
but people say all these great things and it's so nice.
It's so validating.

627
00:34:44.961 --> 00:34:48.170
Know that you guys are out there and it's all kinds of people from all walks of

628
00:34:48.171 --> 00:34:50.880
life and all that.
Um,
and it's really fun.

629
00:34:50.881 --> 00:34:53.630
And I also do those meet and greets after my standup shows and it's totally fun.

630
00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:57.530
Um,
so that's all validating and great and good.
And you know,

631
00:34:57.531 --> 00:35:00.020
we've built a great business here.
And,
um,
you know,

632
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:03.020
ironically the day that we found out this stupid patrion on thing was happening,

633
00:35:03.021 --> 00:35:06.010
we had just flipped one of our part timers to a fulltime or,
um,

634
00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.250
so there's a lot of good things happening.

635
00:35:07.251 --> 00:35:10.100
We've got a lot of plans for next year.
There's going to be a lot more travel.

636
00:35:10.101 --> 00:35:12.140
I think we're gonna do more shows on the road,
whole bunch of stuff.

637
00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:17.120
I would say the cost part,
well,
it's not fun reading these articles,
right?
Like,

638
00:35:17.121 --> 00:35:20.300
so if Fox is like Reuben's part of the alt right and then,
and then,
uh,
you know,

639
00:35:20.301 --> 00:35:25.040
20 blue check,
you know,
3000 follower,
a verified Twitter,

640
00:35:25.041 --> 00:35:28.130
people tweet it out.
It's like,
it's not fun seeing that,
but it's like,

641
00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.920
you guys are desperate and kinetic are saying.

642
00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.050
So I don't really care about that that much anymore.

643
00:35:33.051 --> 00:35:35.480
But I do think about it sometimes it's like,
you know,

644
00:35:35.481 --> 00:35:38.550
I get recognized places and I could be at a restaurant where someone has read

645
00:35:38.551 --> 00:35:42.410
one of those articles about me and they could be looking at me like Reuben's you

646
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.260
see that guy over there?

647
00:35:43.261 --> 00:35:47.520
Like he's a white supremacist or some just completely bananas,
something like,

648
00:35:47.521 --> 00:35:51.750
so that part's not fun.
Um,
and I think there's probably been costs.

649
00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:55.170
There's probably been some business or professional costs,

650
00:35:55.171 --> 00:35:58.860
but I'm very happy with what I'm doing.
I think we're building something so cool.

651
00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:03.090
And even for the patrion part of this,
that is now a problem,

652
00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:07.920
um,
we'll figure it out.
We'll figure it out.
Like you didn't beat me yet.
You know,

653
00:36:07.921 --> 00:36:11.570
I've taken big risks in the past when we got on patron in the first place,
uh,

654
00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:15.600
me and David and America,
uh,
we all quit.
Our jobs left our health insurance,

655
00:36:15.601 --> 00:36:18.600
the whole thing to join on Patriot just to see if it would work.

656
00:36:18.601 --> 00:36:21.900
And nobody really was on Patrion in the political space.
Now,
everyone's on there,

657
00:36:21.901 --> 00:36:25.200
but at time it was mostly video gamers and I was like,
let's try it.

658
00:36:25.201 --> 00:36:26.580
And we did try it and it worked.

659
00:36:26.581 --> 00:36:29.820
And it has basically been the engine of the show for the last uh,

660
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:33.600
three years or so.
So this time around when this thing happened,

661
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:35.870
I really was like,
like there,

662
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.220
there was a part of me that wanted to do something crazy.

663
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.680
Like I still have that in me.
I'm 42,

664
00:36:40.681 --> 00:36:44.940
but I guess I still got a little bit of like a crazy 21 year old in me and I was

665
00:36:44.941 --> 00:36:48.090
like,
I should just cancel patrion on,
we'll figure it out,
you know,

666
00:36:48.091 --> 00:36:51.660
like it's nuts,
but like I want to stand up for something and blah,
blah blah.

667
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.570
And then like,
you know,
then I realized I've got employees now,

668
00:36:54.571 --> 00:36:57.300
I've got different businesses,
different expenses and things like that.

669
00:36:57.301 --> 00:37:00.540
You just can't nobody,
and nobody in their right mind just gives up all that red.

670
00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.280
But we will figure it out.
And as I said,

671
00:37:02.281 --> 00:37:07.281
if I can migrate enough people from Patrion or we can get enough people off our

672
00:37:07.891 --> 00:37:10.350
new people to donate at the site.
Again,

673
00:37:10.351 --> 00:37:14.880
it's Dave rubin.com/donate I'm sorry for being at a tele evangelist here.

674
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:19.350
Um,
we'll,
we'll do it.
We'll do what?
I want to send them a message.
Um,

675
00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.540
and I want to coordinate some of this by the way with some of the other IDW
crew.

676
00:37:22.541 --> 00:37:24.960
So hang tight on some of that stuff.
Um,

677
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:28.920
is there anything you'd like to refute that has been said about you by your

678
00:37:28.921 --> 00:37:33.000
critics?
Um,
refute.
I mean,

679
00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:35.550
yeah.
Well I guess I'm not,
you know,

680
00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.610
one of the things that I see from a lot of these,
uh,

681
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:42.810
whatever these critics that's even that's being giving them a nice term,
um,

682
00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.740
was that I was funded by the Koch brothers.
I am not funded by the Koch brothers.

683
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:51.840
Uh,
what these wizards are just trying to say is that learn liberty was fun,

684
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:54.000
learn liberty that we had the partnership with,
which by the way,

685
00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.220
every episode of every show that we ever did with them,
I said,

686
00:37:56.221 --> 00:38:00.750
this episode is a part what I say in a partnership with our friends at learn

687
00:38:00.751 --> 00:38:03.390
liberty.
So it wasn't something that I was hiding years ago.

688
00:38:03.391 --> 00:38:06.690
I think one of the Koch brothers gave some money to learn liberty through George

689
00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:07.700
Mason University through a new,

690
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:13.230
a a organization called the Institute for humane studies or something.
Anyway,

691
00:38:13.231 --> 00:38:15.240
none of that even matters.
It all sorts of people.

692
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:18.900
You out there person right now you probably donate to um,

693
00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:22.140
to nonprofits to right people donate to nonprofits.

694
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:26.790
Thousands and thousands of people donate to institute for humane studies and

695
00:38:26.791 --> 00:38:30.240
learn.
Liberty was just one of their projects.
Um,
but anyway,

696
00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:32.220
that was in like 2012 or something.

697
00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:35.260
I didn't start working with them until 2016 anyways.

698
00:38:35.261 --> 00:38:38.860
When people say he's funded by the Koch brothers and it's like,
oh,

699
00:38:38.861 --> 00:38:40.060
I'm not funded by the Koch brothers.

700
00:38:40.061 --> 00:38:42.940
Actually the person who funded our our year or sponsorship,

701
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:45.430
which I said we're not even working with them anymore.
Um,

702
00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.950
and it was a wonderful partnership and that is no way throwing them under the

703
00:38:47.951 --> 00:38:51.610
bus.
I love to everybody learn liberty.
They let us do whatever we want.
I never,

704
00:38:51.611 --> 00:38:55.060
nobody ever said say this,
talk about this,
think about this,
anything like that.

705
00:38:55.061 --> 00:38:57.340
They gave us great professors,
we had great shows.

706
00:38:57.341 --> 00:39:00.550
We did that president's week a thing last year with them.
So it was,

707
00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:01.720
it was a wonderful partnership.

708
00:39:01.721 --> 00:39:03.790
I just wanted to kind of think about some other things.
As I said,

709
00:39:03.791 --> 00:39:05.200
they wanted to continue it.
I was like,

710
00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.600
let me see if I can figure out some other interesting things.

711
00:39:07.601 --> 00:39:08.530
We've had a nice run with it.

712
00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:09.993
<v 2>MMM.</v>

713
00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:12.900
<v 0>But people that you're funded by,
the Koch rise and it's like,</v>

714
00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:15.720
actually the person who funded us is an anonymous woman.

715
00:39:15.721 --> 00:39:17.910
I only know it's a woman because they told me it's a woman.

716
00:39:17.911 --> 00:39:20.820
So if you want to write her a handwritten note,
you could.
Right,
ma'am.

717
00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:22.280
So I did write,
ma'am,
you know,

718
00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:25.710
on a note to an anonymous person who happened to give the funds that funded us

719
00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:29.880
anyway,
whatever.
You know what I don't need,
I don't mind critics.
If you're look,

720
00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:34.020
when people say,
well Ruben,
um,
you know,
it's funny,
people will say,
ah,

721
00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:36.550
Rubens too much.
Like Larry King.
Well,

722
00:39:36.551 --> 00:39:38.190
I've had Larry King on here just a couple of weeks ago.

723
00:39:38.191 --> 00:39:41.340
He is a friend and a mentor and the fact that he even thinks I'm halfway decent

724
00:39:41.341 --> 00:39:45.490
at this is the greatest compliment ever.
So I would say the Larry,
the,

725
00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:47.190
if you look at the breadth of his work,

726
00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:49.230
is probably the greatest interviewer of all times.

727
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:51.720
So if your criticism is I'm too much like Larry King,

728
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:55.050
that would be like criticizing Koby Bryant and saying you're too much like

729
00:39:55.051 --> 00:39:57.930
Michael Jordan.
That's pretty good.
That's pretty good.

730
00:39:57.931 --> 00:40:01.290
So I don't mind criticism if you want to criticize the way I questioned somebody

731
00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.470
or a followup that maybe I missed or some of that stuff.
It's all good.

732
00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:08.140
I'm not perfect.
And you know,
I'll always get better.
I hope I always get better.

733
00:40:08.141 --> 00:40:10.620
And I'll at least always try to get better.
Um,

734
00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:15.060
but it's when people just like lie about what I say and selectively at eclipse

735
00:40:15.061 --> 00:40:16.920
and obsess over me.
Like there's,

736
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:21.330
there's like a crew of people that are just endlessly obsessed over what I say.

737
00:40:21.331 --> 00:40:25.110
And it's like,
no,
I don't even care anymore.
It's like,
what are you doing?

738
00:40:25.111 --> 00:40:28.170
Like if you wake up and think to Abe Rubens,
the biggest problem in the world,

739
00:40:28.171 --> 00:40:32.310
Holy Shit,
the patriarchy must not be that bad because this is the worst you got.

740
00:40:32.311 --> 00:40:36.960
You got to make videos about me all day.
So Matt,
whatever.
Um,
let's see.

741
00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:38.670
All right,
so one,
this is a great one.

742
00:40:38.671 --> 00:40:40.650
What is the goal or where is the Rubin report headed?

743
00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:44.400
I'll hold that one to the end cause that's a great question.
Um,

744
00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.030
let's see here.

745
00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:48.580
<v 2>MMM.</v>

746
00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:54.340
<v 0>Just check Twitter having to post and they have one tweet with 400 retweets</v>

747
00:40:54.341 --> 00:40:56.980
today.
Everything else is significantly lower engagement.
Yeah.

748
00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.780
I assume that all of my,
I mean,

749
00:40:58.781 --> 00:41:02.500
many of my tweets and at this point get into the tens of thousands of retweets

750
00:41:02.501 --> 00:41:03.340
and favorites and all that.

751
00:41:03.341 --> 00:41:08.230
And it's like they can't have regular people getting more engagement than them,

752
00:41:08.231 --> 00:41:10.330
even though they buy all their followers and the rest of it,

753
00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:14.650
a dead spin is a sports site allegedly there a sports night.
I did not know that.

754
00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:16.930
Um,
let's see.

755
00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:20.500
When do you think that sports and entertainment sites will finally figure out

756
00:41:20.501 --> 00:41:22.390
that we don't want politics in our entertainment?

757
00:41:22.391 --> 00:41:25.240
They seem to be losing market share,
but they just seem to doubling out.

758
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:26.343
Great question.

759
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:31.470
Nobody wants to watch ESPN to hear about endless politics and this is what they

760
00:41:31.781 --> 00:41:34.940
keep giving us.
And I think,
uh,
Travis clay,

761
00:41:34.941 --> 00:41:38.990
Travis calls it woke center and it's like,
man,
that Shit's boring.

762
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:41.900
Just endlessly talking about politics everywhere.

763
00:41:41.901 --> 00:41:46.520
So we have no spaces where we can just be people who watch a game together or

764
00:41:46.521 --> 00:41:50.510
just be people who play a video game together or shoot hoops together,
whatever.

765
00:41:50.511 --> 00:41:54.560
It's like,
if we don't have those spaces,
we've got nothing left.
Which is ironic.

766
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.770
Yeah.
At a some level for where I'm at,
because I've said this before,

767
00:41:57.771 --> 00:42:02.030
but in a way I'm less interested in politics specifically than I've ever been.

768
00:42:02.031 --> 00:42:05.180
There's this cultural thing happening right now that's intertwined with

769
00:42:05.181 --> 00:42:07.100
technology and entertainment and politics.

770
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:10.670
That's what I'm interested in politics alone about what's happening in the

771
00:42:10.671 --> 00:42:11.660
Senate today or,

772
00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:16.550
or Nancy Pelosi might stay on as the leader indefinitely or Trump met with.

773
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.630
It's like that.

774
00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.720
That all just seems like theater to me at this point and there's just something

775
00:42:20.721 --> 00:42:23.080
much more important happening and that's what I want to talk about.

776
00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:27.470
But I also want to talk about the bigger ideas,
which is why I just had a rabbi,

777
00:42:27.471 --> 00:42:32.400
a priest in an email,
man.
Um,
okay.
Let's see.
Um,

778
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.360
whew.
Oh Man.
There's a lot of good stuff here.
Uh,

779
00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:41.920
will you ever invite Jack Conti back on to lie to our faces again?
Um,

780
00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:42.581
you know what,

781
00:42:42.581 --> 00:42:45.670
let me figure out what's going on here with the Patriots situation and maybe I

782
00:42:45.671 --> 00:42:49.960
would offer him the chair to sit in again at the end of the day,

783
00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:53.740
unless he truly changed,
then he lied to me.

784
00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:57.550
He said this manifested observable behavior thing he said on platform.

785
00:42:57.551 --> 00:42:59.230
Both of those things turned out to be a lie.

786
00:42:59.231 --> 00:43:02.190
So I don't need to give him a platform again.
Um,

787
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:05.260
and I'm not thrilled with what's going on with Patriot.
As I said,

788
00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.820
we can migrate enough people over,

789
00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:10.030
we will make a move and we've got some other plans by the way,

790
00:43:10.031 --> 00:43:14.020
that I just can't get into everything at the moment in front of all of you good

791
00:43:14.021 --> 00:43:18.370
people.
Um,
okay.
Um,

792
00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:19.443
let's see.

793
00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:23.170
Do you think that the left has a difficult time articulating and defending their

794
00:43:23.171 --> 00:43:26.410
views?
Many of your guests,
Peterson,
Chaperia,
Shapiro,

795
00:43:26.411 --> 00:43:29.980
Brigitte Gabriel had been able to defend their views factually.
For example,

796
00:43:29.981 --> 00:43:33.820
using Judeo Christian values.
I'm sincerely trying to find a opposing views,

797
00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:37.660
but I have yet to see a civil interviewer bet or yet,
or uh,
sorry.

798
00:43:37.661 --> 00:43:42.160
We're better yet a debate where it's explained with facts,
not feelings and uh,

799
00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:45.610
defensive.
Their position.
I don't want to say it's impossible.
And by the way,

800
00:43:45.611 --> 00:43:49.540
you know,
I still have,
I still have good friends and some of the IDW crew,

801
00:43:49.541 --> 00:43:51.460
like the Weinstein brothers and Sam,
they,

802
00:43:51.461 --> 00:43:54.610
I think they all still identify as lefty.
So I don't think it's impossible,

803
00:43:54.611 --> 00:43:58.120
but those guys really are on the outs,
right?
So it's like,
you know,
I,

804
00:43:58.210 --> 00:43:59.050
when I do stand up,

805
00:43:59.051 --> 00:44:02.560
I usually bring one of the IDW people with me and it's a surprise.

806
00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:06.110
So I've brought,
uh,
when we were in Salt Lake City,
I brought Jordan onstage,

807
00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:06.851
which was awesome.

808
00:44:06.851 --> 00:44:09.580
And we just joked around for an hour and the crowd was going bananas.
That,

809
00:44:09.581 --> 00:44:10.900
that really was an incredible show.

810
00:44:10.901 --> 00:44:15.310
If any of you are at that Salt Lake City shows amazing.
Um,
I brought Brett on.

811
00:44:15.311 --> 00:44:17.290
I brought Eric on it,
Brett,
Brett and Eric together.

812
00:44:17.291 --> 00:44:18.580
I brought Christina Hoff Summers on,

813
00:44:18.581 --> 00:44:23.500
I brought Michael Shermer two weeks ago at the Improv in San Jose.
Um,

814
00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:26.200
and look,

815
00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:31.020
I think it's getting increasingly hard to find lefties.

816
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:34.320
We'll talk honestly and look,
there are,
yes,
are there some youtube,
it's funny,

817
00:44:34.321 --> 00:44:34.981
this is where they'll go,

818
00:44:34.981 --> 00:44:38.790
but there are five youtube or to demand to debate you all the time.
Well,

819
00:44:38.791 --> 00:44:40.800
you keep talking shit about me in lying about me.

820
00:44:40.801 --> 00:44:42.840
It's like I'm not going to do it.
I'm just not gonna do it.

821
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:46.230
I'm just playing a different game than then they're playing and they can play

822
00:44:46.231 --> 00:44:48.110
whatever game they want.
That,
that's fine.

823
00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:51.990
I know that by just talking shit about me,
you get clicks.
So all right,

824
00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:53.710
enjoy your clicks.
Fine.
Um,

825
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:58.200
it's getting increasingly hard to do and the evidence for that would be,
look,

826
00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:01.920
it's when I do these stand up shows,
I mean most of my audience at this point,

827
00:45:01.921 --> 00:45:05.310
it's sort of like,
I think it's pretty split.
It's hard to say.
I,
you know,

828
00:45:05.311 --> 00:45:07.740
it's sort of,
we've got some old school liberals in the crowd.

829
00:45:07.741 --> 00:45:09.990
Let's say we've got some libertarians in the crowd.

830
00:45:09.991 --> 00:45:13.300
We've got some conservatives in the credit Kasia finally there's a couple sort

831
00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:16.590
of more lefties.
Um,
but that,
you know,
it's a pretty big split.

832
00:45:16.591 --> 00:45:19.500
Maybe if anything it leans a little bit more libertarian or Conservative,

833
00:45:19.501 --> 00:45:22.410
which would be absolutely fine with me,
by the way.
Um,

834
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:25.140
and it's like I bring on,
you know,

835
00:45:25.141 --> 00:45:28.040
let's say a Brett or an Eric and they talk about how they're Brett.

836
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:29.490
Brett's a good example.
I bring on bread.

837
00:45:29.491 --> 00:45:31.380
He talks about how he's always been a progressive.

838
00:45:31.381 --> 00:45:33.120
He still considers himself a progressive,

839
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:35.370
all the endings and the audience loves him.

840
00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.790
And he talks about reasons that the talks about differences of opinion and the

841
00:45:38.791 --> 00:45:43.170
audience still loves him.
Try to imagine that happening at another way.

842
00:45:43.171 --> 00:45:46.830
Imagine a comedian that was a big lefty,
progressive,

843
00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:50.730
bringing on a speaker,
um,

844
00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:55.800
who was a conservative to a lefty crowd.

845
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:58.440
How would they treat that conservative?

846
00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:02.340
The reason you can't think of any evidence of that is because they would treat

847
00:46:02.341 --> 00:46:04.590
them very poorly.
Um,
so look,

848
00:46:04.591 --> 00:46:08.460
this was even when I was at the University of Wyoming a couple of days ago.
Um,

849
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:11.640
and,
and I did I even say this earlier,
I've been talking to the camera all day,

850
00:46:11.641 --> 00:46:14.280
so I can't even remember I just said this or if I just said it's the people

851
00:46:14.281 --> 00:46:17.410
before me.
People before this was,
um,

852
00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:21.630
I did this great talk where I talked about the differences between liberals and

853
00:46:21.631 --> 00:46:25.260
conservatives to a group of about 300 kids at University of Wyoming would be

854
00:46:25.261 --> 00:46:28.440
sponsored by turning point USA and young college conservative group.

855
00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:30.990
And then at the end that,
well,
first off,
I,
you know,

856
00:46:30.991 --> 00:46:33.600
the kids are thrilled that I was there and great applause and everything.

857
00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:35.010
But when we do the Q and a,

858
00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:38.310
they specifically asked for people that disagree with me first.

859
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.670
I mean that there is such a richness right now happening,

860
00:46:41.671 --> 00:46:44.940
especially with young conservatives and Libertarians don't dismiss it.

861
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:48.210
It's not getting picked up anywhere in the mainstream media because they don't

862
00:46:48.211 --> 00:46:52.000
like that narrative.
They like only the woke narrative.
Those are the tolerance,

863
00:46:52.001 --> 00:46:54.810
the tolerance people who keep telling gay people to shut the fuck up and black

864
00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:59.160
people to stay in their lane.
Those are the tolerant people don't yet know.
Whoo.

865
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:04.400
Okay.
Um,
have you made plan B?
Should you find yourself off youtube?
Plenty.

866
00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:08.640
Man,
it's depressing that these questions are even coming in,
but I mean,

867
00:47:08.641 --> 00:47:11.880
this is the point.
This is the point of the,
of the Sargon situation.

868
00:47:11.881 --> 00:47:14.100
It's like we have to figure all these things out.
Yes.

869
00:47:14.101 --> 00:47:19.080
I have had a zillion meetings this week in a zillion different places.
Um,

870
00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:23.940
and the meetings will continue.
We're trying to figure out all of the firewalls.

871
00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:27.210
We're trying to figure out how to make sure funding doesn't get cut.

872
00:47:27.211 --> 00:47:30.280
We're trying to figure out all this stuff.
I can't fully get into all of it now,

873
00:47:30.281 --> 00:47:33.450
but we're trying to figure it out and I appreciate the questions.
Um,

874
00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:37.870
when's your next la show?
So Jordan and I were just at the La Orpheum downtown,

875
00:47:37.871 --> 00:47:41.140
which was awesome.
I brought Shapiro on as a surprise guest crowd went crazy.

876
00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:44.410
He gave me a cupcake on stage cause you know,
he won't bake me a gay cake.

877
00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:47.590
So he gave me a cupcake.
It was very exciting.
Um,

878
00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:51.160
which then I tweeted a picture of that out and then just the usual,

879
00:47:51.161 --> 00:47:55.150
the tolerant left these,
Oh look at this disgusting display.

880
00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:59.170
Ruben is so prophetic for even standing there was Shapiro.
And it's like,

881
00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:02.650
you know what,
I can stand there with someone I disagree with on something,

882
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:07.330
even something pretty damn fundamental and enjoy it and enjoy a moment on stage

883
00:48:07.331 --> 00:48:11.430
of laughter with 3000 people that are cheering and screaming,
uh,

884
00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:15.700
despite our differences.
But you guys are the tolerant ones.
Remind me again,

885
00:48:15.701 --> 00:48:20.700
I just tolerant.
Um,
so my next la shows,
so we've got two things.
A,

886
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:25.710
I'm at the Irvine Improv with a particularly big IDW guests that's an orange

887
00:48:26.651 --> 00:48:30.880
county on January 30th at the Irvine Improv.
You don't want to miss it.

888
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:34.510
I don't want to say who it is just yet.
Uh,
that's the Irvine Improv.

889
00:48:34.511 --> 00:48:38.860
And then on I think January 9th,
I'm at the Ontario,
California Improv.

890
00:48:38.861 --> 00:48:42.640
I'm pretty sure that's the date.
You can go to Dave rubin.com/events for that.

891
00:48:42.641 --> 00:48:47.470
Then I've got three gigs with Peterson in,
uh,
in January.
And then we head off to,

892
00:48:47.471 --> 00:48:51.100
uh,
to Australia in February.
Unfortunately,

893
00:48:51.101 --> 00:48:55.450
I'm going to miss the New Zealand events.
I got,
I do a family thing in February.

894
00:48:55.451 --> 00:48:57.220
That's an annual thing that I really don't want to miss.

895
00:48:57.221 --> 00:48:58.270
So I'm gonna Miss New Zealand's,

896
00:48:58.271 --> 00:49:00.820
which of course I would love to go to New Zealand and have some New Zealand
lamb,

897
00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:05.500
a lamb.
I'm having lamb for dinner tonight.
Um,
okay.

898
00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:06.580
Um,

899
00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:11.950
ESPN just announced that they miscalculated about being woke sports and clay

900
00:49:11.951 --> 00:49:14.860
covered.
It took ESPN about a decade to admit their mistake.

901
00:49:14.861 --> 00:49:18.240
But I would still expect SJW thought to Berkeley through,
well,

902
00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:20.140
I would love to know what that means.
They admitted it.

903
00:49:20.141 --> 00:49:24.410
Meaning did they issue a statement saying we're not going to keep doing this.
Um,

904
00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:26.950
I think they're on there.
They're crumbling no matter what.
You know,

905
00:49:26.951 --> 00:49:29.170
it's like the ship has sailed.
You,
you,

906
00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:31.810
if you're going to infect your company with social justice,

907
00:49:31.811 --> 00:49:36.250
which is not about being social norm about um,
attaining justice,
it will,

908
00:49:36.251 --> 00:49:40.020
it will cause you to have a problem and a longterm problem.
Look,
we're,

909
00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:43.000
well now I have to figure out what we're doing,
but we're hiring right now.

910
00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:48.100
And uh,
I tweeted out something that said,

911
00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:50.020
I'm hiring something to the effect of like,

912
00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:53.530
I'm hiring only on skill and expertise.

913
00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:57.970
I don't care what gender you are.
I don't care what skin color you are.

914
00:49:57.971 --> 00:50:01.840
I don't care what sexuality you are.
And obviously I'm,
I'm like,
you know,

915
00:50:01.841 --> 00:50:05.680
playing a joke on this stupidity.
But imagine if I did care about those things.

916
00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:08.830
Wouldn't that imagine.
I was looking at the resumes and I was like,
well,

917
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.740
that's a black lesbian.
We're going to put her,

918
00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:16.270
give her more of a chance than this,
this qualified other person.

919
00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:19.510
Or this is a trans whatever.

920
00:50:19.511 --> 00:50:22.090
And this poor straight white guy.
Well,
sure,

921
00:50:22.091 --> 00:50:24.870
he's been in the business for 20 years.
He's got incredible reviews and blah,

922
00:50:24.871 --> 00:50:28.340
blah,
blah.
He shouldn't get the job.
What would that make any sense?

923
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.730
These are the people that are trying to institute racism into the system.

924
00:50:31.731 --> 00:50:34.520
This system now basically work to do what you want.

925
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.540
And does that mean that there might be some HR people out there who are racist?

926
00:50:38.541 --> 00:50:39.560
Yes,
there might be.

927
00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:43.040
But is that the government's decision to figure out who should work where and

928
00:50:43.041 --> 00:50:47.990
how we,
well,
I guess that's what a lot of people seem to want these days.
Okay.
Um,

929
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:51.170
let's see.
Um,

930
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:54.620
I don't see any other classical liberal doing what you're doing,

931
00:50:54.621 --> 00:50:59.060
which is having conversation and explorative conversations with people of

932
00:50:59.061 --> 00:51:01.430
different viewpoints.
You're very successful.

933
00:51:01.431 --> 00:51:05.000
Is it indicative of a hunger in our society to have these discussions?

934
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:07.100
So why aren't more liberals following suit?

935
00:51:07.101 --> 00:51:10.130
I asked specifically about liberals because there are many conservative voices

936
00:51:10.131 --> 00:51:13.400
talking even while being centered,
you're not censored.
You know,

937
00:51:13.401 --> 00:51:14.810
that's an interesting question.
Look,
yes,

938
00:51:14.811 --> 00:51:19.811
there's a lot of conservative people doing something sort of similar to this I

939
00:51:20.721 --> 00:51:21.590
suppose.
So you know,

940
00:51:21.591 --> 00:51:25.160
Shapiro's out there with an interview show and Crowder does something and

941
00:51:25.161 --> 00:51:25.641
there's,
you know,

942
00:51:25.641 --> 00:51:29.300
more people on CRTV and back at the blaze and like that sort of thing.

943
00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:31.160
All from sort of a right perspective.

944
00:51:31.161 --> 00:51:33.860
Now maybe that's because they've all been pushed there because they don't get

945
00:51:33.861 --> 00:51:37.760
any mainstream coverage where if you turn on almost every news channel,

946
00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:40.820
not only CNN,
MSNBC obviously,
but you know,

947
00:51:40.821 --> 00:51:45.730
you watch ABC News or NBC News or CBS News,
it's all,
so these are all lefties.

948
00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:48.500
Like,
do you think any of these people vote Republican or any of these people are

949
00:51:48.501 --> 00:51:51.560
conservative?
Actually,
some of them are probably secretly conservative,

950
00:51:51.561 --> 00:51:54.360
but they never even admitted to their friends and they're getting their,
uh,

951
00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:57.500
you know,
Karma is a bitch.
But,
um,

952
00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:59.420
I think that probably has something to do with it.

953
00:51:59.421 --> 00:52:02.990
Why aren't there more liberals doing it?
I don't.

954
00:52:02.991 --> 00:52:07.130
Maybe it is the facts over feelings thing.
Um,
that people on the left,

955
00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:12.950
maybe because they go by their heart,
perhaps more than their brain.

956
00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:16.100
So you don't have to think a problem through.
You just have to feel something.

957
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:21.080
So I want to help poor people.
Let's throw money at them that,
that fuels good.

958
00:52:21.081 --> 00:52:25.670
Like,
oh,
I care about poor people.
I want to give them money,
give them things.

959
00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.590
I now I can walk away and feel good.

960
00:52:27.591 --> 00:52:29.750
I don't even have to really think about it because the government really did it.

961
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:33.140
I just took,
I just took money from other people and gave it to these people.

962
00:52:33.141 --> 00:52:36.050
I feel good about it.
I'm a nice person.
Look at me.
I'm a nice person.

963
00:52:36.051 --> 00:52:38.630
I can go to nice parties and Oh,
what did you do?
Well,

964
00:52:38.631 --> 00:52:41.700
I didn't do anything but the governor,
I supported a candidate who,
uh,

965
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:44.120
raise taxes so that they could give money to poor people.

966
00:52:44.121 --> 00:52:47.090
Now if you were to say to them,
well,
you know,
these programs often don't work.

967
00:52:47.091 --> 00:52:52.040
You keep people in sort of indentured servitude and people don't get off
welfare,

968
00:52:52.041 --> 00:52:52.874
all of these things,

969
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:55.790
they get very upset because they don't want to have to think things through

970
00:52:55.791 --> 00:52:58.910
because they like their heart more than they like their brain or that where they

971
00:52:58.911 --> 00:53:02.720
operate via the hardware in the brain.
I tried to do a little bit of both.
Um,

972
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:05.460
I would say I'm not that,
it's not them,
not emotional,

973
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:10.160
not that worked up or something like that.
I Dunno.
Um,

974
00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:14.360
I also,
I guess it has also something to do with why I do it this way.
It's like

975
00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:18.320
something happened that I didn't expect,
which was,

976
00:53:18.321 --> 00:53:21.020
I was talking about the left from a leftist perspective,

977
00:53:21.021 --> 00:53:26.021
from a progressive perspective and suddenly I was getting an endless amount of

978
00:53:26.131 --> 00:53:28.080
hate from the left,
which I guess I could have expected.

979
00:53:28.081 --> 00:53:31.440
I thought it was a little weird,
but I was like,
oh,
I'm talking about free speech.

980
00:53:31.441 --> 00:53:34.320
I'm talking about some of these issues that you guys should care about,

981
00:53:34.321 --> 00:53:35.580
but you hate me.
All right,
that's fine.

982
00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.950
That wasn't necessarily that surprising was a little odd,

983
00:53:37.951 --> 00:53:38.850
but not that surprising.

984
00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:42.690
The thing that was surprising was that suddenly all of these evil conservatives

985
00:53:42.691 --> 00:53:43.890
that the media would make you think,

986
00:53:43.891 --> 00:53:48.891
or all racists and bigots and all these libertarians were maniacs and all this

987
00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:52.980
other stuff,
they have only been welcoming.
I'm telling you,

988
00:53:52.981 --> 00:53:56.340
I am meeting the nicest people.
I get emails from the middle of the country,

989
00:53:56.341 --> 00:54:00.000
from Christian conservatives that never heard a liberal,
not talk down to them.

990
00:54:00.330 --> 00:54:05.040
Um,
that,
that it's funny,
people will say,
well,
see Ruben's enabling the far right.

991
00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:08.820
It's like actually I'm getting emails from people that are becoming often more

992
00:54:08.821 --> 00:54:12.270
liberal from listening to these conversations.
So,
you know,

993
00:54:12.271 --> 00:54:14.130
it's just a certain amount of hysteria.
It's right.
All right,

994
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:18.930
we've got four minutes to go.
Um,
let's see.
I'll do,
I'll do two more.

995
00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:24.090
Um,
oh,
I'm local and I'd love to work for you info on where to submit a resume.

996
00:54:24.091 --> 00:54:28.440
We have so many freaking resumes to go through.
But um,
you can send it to,

997
00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:32.910
um,
I think it's jobs that Ruben,
report.com and if that doesn't work,

998
00:54:32.911 --> 00:54:37.290
just go to contact@orjustgotorubenreport.com slash contact and you can submit

999
00:54:37.291 --> 00:54:41.220
their,
but I think it's John Rubin,
report.com.
Um,
let's see.
Dave,

1000
00:54:41.221 --> 00:54:44.040
when you appear on Fox News to any of the hosts such as Tucker Carlson,

1001
00:54:44.041 --> 00:54:47.200
joke off camera about you having your own show on their network.
Um,

1002
00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:49.340
well first of all I can tell you I really like Tucker.

1003
00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:52.800
The two that I know the most are the two guys that I do their shows the most.

1004
00:54:52.801 --> 00:54:56.640
Greg Gutfeld I really know the most and he's,
he's just a,
he's just a good guy.

1005
00:54:56.641 --> 00:54:58.530
We've got a couple of differences that don't matter,

1006
00:54:58.531 --> 00:55:02.180
but I've enjoyed going out drinking with them in New York City and he's just a,

1007
00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:05.030
he's a nice guy and he,
and he's funny and he's a,

1008
00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:09.000
and he loves being like sort of ancillary part of the ITW in a way.

1009
00:55:09.001 --> 00:55:12.060
Cause he's mainstream.
But they did on the five the other day.

1010
00:55:12.061 --> 00:55:14.220
They did their people over the year and he,
he was like,

1011
00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:19.140
he's like Reuben Peterson,
Shapiro,
you know,
Weinstein that Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

1012
00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:21.630
It's like,
I don't know the other hosts have any freaking clue who we are,

1013
00:55:21.631 --> 00:55:24.090
but like he just is like kind of having fun with this whole thing.

1014
00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:27.870
So I really like Greg Tucker.
Um,
I know a little bit,

1015
00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:31.050
not as well as as Greg,
but I really like Tucker.
You know,

1016
00:55:31.051 --> 00:55:32.190
usually when I do talk her,

1017
00:55:32.191 --> 00:55:35.280
I think except for once or twice we've done it like I was on top of yesterday

1018
00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:39.540
and we do it via satellite.
So I just go to a little studio here in la.

1019
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:40.650
It's like a little box.

1020
00:55:40.651 --> 00:55:43.860
It's like half the size of my studio and there's just a camera in front of you.

1021
00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.950
And actually what's weird,
this is just a little TV thing.

1022
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:50.820
They often put the monitor so you can see yourself right beneath you,

1023
00:55:50.821 --> 00:55:54.690
but it's on like a two second delay.
So the first time I ever did those things,

1024
00:55:54.691 --> 00:55:56.670
I think it was on Hln years ago.

1025
00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:59.700
It's really bizarre because you're hearing someone talk to you,

1026
00:55:59.701 --> 00:56:02.070
but you're seeing their lips move in a different way and it'd be really hard.

1027
00:56:02.071 --> 00:56:06.060
So now I always have them shut the shut the video feed.
Um,

1028
00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:09.150
nobody's really joked to me about that.
I mean I can,

1029
00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:10.950
I can't tell you every little thing that's going on,

1030
00:56:10.951 --> 00:56:13.050
but like I'm getting all sorts of crazy offers.

1031
00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:15.480
That's also why the patriotic thing is weird.
It's like,

1032
00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:18.900
why is this happening right now?
Like,
I want to stay fan funded.
I really do.

1033
00:56:18.901 --> 00:56:20.010
I want to be my own boss.

1034
00:56:20.011 --> 00:56:23.590
I don't want to have to change anything we're doing in drastic ways,

1035
00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:25.960
but we got to figure out the patriotic solution.

1036
00:56:25.961 --> 00:56:30.370
But if enough people go to Dave Rubin,
knock on slash donate,
uh,
you know,

1037
00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:34.720
we'll keep,
keep on keeping on.
Okay.
There's a zillion more questions here.

1038
00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:36.940
We'll catalog some of these,
cause I see there's a lot of,

1039
00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:40.060
a lot of good stuff here and I'm sorry I couldn't get to all of it.
Um,

1040
00:56:40.090 --> 00:56:42.740
but the last question,
which I hit on before,
uh,

1041
00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:47.650
which is what is the goal or where is the Ruben report edit?
Well,
look,

1042
00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.240
we just had a great year.
As I said,
uh,
we're,

1043
00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:54.670
we're going to crap crash 900,000 subscribers today or tomorrow.

1044
00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.600
And that's despite the fact that tons of you come up to me in real life and keep

1045
00:56:58.601 --> 00:57:00.340
telling me that you keep getting unsubscribed.

1046
00:57:00.341 --> 00:57:03.160
Youtube says you're a bot or you're rushing troll and you don't know what you're

1047
00:57:03.161 --> 00:57:06.130
doing.
But,
uh,
the growth of the channel has been great.

1048
00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.930
I think the content that we're doing,
you know,

1049
00:57:07.931 --> 00:57:11.020
one of the things that I was afraid of during the Peterson tour was I was coming

1050
00:57:11.021 --> 00:57:13.870
back,
you know,
often I'd be traveling for two or three weeks.

1051
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:17.180
I'd come back and we'd have to do three shows in a day and it's,
you know,

1052
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:21.250
at one show I'm sharp as hell to shows and pretty damn sharp.
Third show.
I,

1053
00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:23.860
I'm kind of like,
it's a lot of information to take in.

1054
00:57:23.861 --> 00:57:25.420
And especially if I was jetlagged or something,

1055
00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:28.990
I was really concerned that the quality of the interviews was going to suffer.

1056
00:57:29.350 --> 00:57:31.360
I actually think what we've done this,
uh,

1057
00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:34.750
this fall starting with when Shapiro interviewed me and then the next week we,

1058
00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:37.170
and Peter Teal a and then we did,
you know,

1059
00:57:37.171 --> 00:57:40.150
we did the obviously the Peterson Shapiro thing,
um,

1060
00:57:40.151 --> 00:57:43.520
this interview that I just did with a rabbi Wolpe and Bishop Barron,

1061
00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:45.400
that'll be up the thing with the mom to Ed.

1062
00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:48.970
This interview that we put up this week,
by the way with Kole Valerie is just,

1063
00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:52.840
is just great.
Get to know this girl if you don't know her,
what a freaking,

1064
00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:56.250
what a wonder and a and just like a little sparkle of joy and,

1065
00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:59.350
and someone who knows the ideas and isn't afraid to say what she thinks.

1066
00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:03.560
Just just spectacular.
Um,
so I was really worried though that,

1067
00:58:03.590 --> 00:58:05.650
that the show was going to suffer because of the tour,

1068
00:58:05.651 --> 00:58:07.840
but I really don't think it did.
But my one regret,

1069
00:58:07.841 --> 00:58:12.040
which I mentioned in the live stream last month is that I don't do the do the

1070
00:58:12.041 --> 00:58:15.940
direct messages as much anymore because we just,
we don't have the time.

1071
00:58:15.941 --> 00:58:19.180
And also because we're stocking episodes is sometimes I taped three in a row.

1072
00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:22.390
The d the Dms usually are about what's going on that week.

1073
00:58:22.391 --> 00:58:24.250
So it's hard to tape it three weeks in advance.

1074
00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:26.770
But I've been trying to do a few more of these live streams.
You know,

1075
00:58:26.771 --> 00:58:29.530
I did one right before the election and right after the election I think I was

1076
00:58:29.531 --> 00:58:34.000
in UK for one of the Oslo for the other.
Um,

1077
00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:35.170
and we'll keep doing those things.

1078
00:58:35.171 --> 00:58:37.750
And I think when we get back eventually to a little more of a schedule,

1079
00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:40.120
we'll get back to do,
doing more of those.

1080
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:41.920
I think what's going to happen in the next year is,
look,

1081
00:58:41.921 --> 00:58:43.750
we're going to figure out a little bit of the business stuff.

1082
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:47.350
I think that these issues that we've been tracking related to free speech and

1083
00:58:47.351 --> 00:58:49.360
tech and the rest of it,
they're going to keep ramping up.

1084
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:51.010
And who the hell knows what's coming next.

1085
00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:53.890
Like the Oregon thing is a major move of blind.

1086
00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:56.620
So I don't know what's gonna come next.
Um,

1087
00:58:56.770 --> 00:58:59.530
but we're going to keep building this thing and I feel great about,

1088
00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:01.450
I feel great about the conversations we're having.

1089
00:59:01.451 --> 00:59:03.670
I feel great about the people that I'm meeting.

1090
00:59:03.671 --> 00:59:06.920
I feel great about the business we're building.
Um,
I think it's gonna,

1091
00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:09.690
it's gonna go up on steroids.
We're going to continue the tour with Peterson.

1092
00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:11.770
I'm going to do more stand up than I did this year.

1093
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:14.500
It was like I got dragged back in.
I didn't even want to do it,

1094
00:59:14.501 --> 00:59:19.240
but now I'm having fun with it,
so that's great.
Um,
I'm going to write my book,
um,

1095
00:59:19.450 --> 00:59:21.680
or continue writing my book,
I should say.
Um,

1096
00:59:21.681 --> 00:59:24.200
and we're just going to keep going and going and going.
And then,
uh,

1097
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:27.440
I don't know when we're going to arrest,
but Emma's resting for us

1098
00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:29.053
<v 4>right now.</v>

1099
00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:33.950
<v 0>So,
uh,
so that's pretty good.
And,
uh,
yeah,
and that's it.
So anyway,</v>

1100
00:59:34.510 --> 00:59:36.700
this sort of a,
a bit of an odd,
uh,

1101
00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:39.680
live stream I suppose because there's a lot going on and all sorts of different

1102
00:59:39.681 --> 00:59:43.250
ways.
Um,
but as I try to always say on the,

1103
00:59:43.251 --> 00:59:47.440
on the Patriot and day when I talked to the small groups,
I'm,
I'm genuinely,
um,

1104
00:59:48.570 --> 00:59:52.700
I'm humbled and honored by your support and if you don't support financially

1105
00:59:52.701 --> 00:59:56.080
just sharing the videos and telling your friends about this stuff and,
you know,

1106
00:59:56.090 --> 00:59:58.250
people coming up to me and whole foods and the rest of it,

1107
00:59:58.251 --> 01:00:00.290
it's like we're doing something good.
Let's just keep doing it.

1108
01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:03.860
It can be exhausting at times.
I could probably use like a good night's sleep,

1109
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:07.130
you know,
but like,
it's all good.
It's all good.
So,
uh,

1110
01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:11.270
I think you're going to really dig a Monday show with the rabbi and the Bishop.

1111
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:12.230
Um,

1112
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:16.670
we've got him on tweety before the year's out and I know that might,

1113
01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:20.390
we might be holding that one.
I'm actually not sure.
Um,
and what else?
Oh,

1114
