00:00:00.226 --> 00:00:01.807
- [Voiceover] So, we have
a reading passage here.

00:00:01.807 --> 00:00:03.447
It says this passage is adapted

00:00:03.447 --> 00:00:06.126
from Edith Wharton, Ethan Frome,

00:00:06.126 --> 00:00:09.007
originally published in 1911.

00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:13.226
Mattie Silver is Ethan's
household employee.

00:00:13.226 --> 00:00:15.586
So, Mattie Silver, that
must be a character

00:00:15.586 --> 00:00:17.825
in this passage right over here.

00:00:17.825 --> 00:00:21.025
And before we even start to
read this passage together

00:00:21.025 --> 00:00:23.727
it's probably worthwhile to stress

00:00:23.727 --> 00:00:25.807
that we should get pumped
about reading this passage

00:00:25.807 --> 00:00:27.624
because if we're interested in it

00:00:27.624 --> 00:00:29.425
we will comprehend it better.

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:31.065
But even more importantly we're about

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:33.566
to spend a few minutes of
our life on this passage

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.865
and so if we're gonna spend a few minutes

00:00:34.865 --> 00:00:37.664
of our life on something
we might as well enjoy it.

00:00:37.664 --> 00:00:39.864
So, let's do that.

00:00:39.864 --> 00:00:41.185
All right.

00:00:41.185 --> 00:00:44.745
Mattie Silver had lived under
Ethan's roof for a year,

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:47.585
and from early morning
till they met at supper

00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:49.764
he had frequent chances of seeing her,

00:00:49.764 --> 00:00:51.401
but no moments in her company were

00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:54.143
comparable to those when, her arm in his,

00:00:54.143 --> 00:00:56.081
and her light step flying to keep

00:00:56.081 --> 00:00:58.902
time with his long stride,

00:00:58.902 --> 00:01:01.701
they walked back through
the night to the farm.

00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:03.283
So, it sounds like he likes her.

00:01:03.283 --> 00:01:06.222
He had taken to the
girl from the first day,

00:01:06.222 --> 00:01:09.181
when he had driven over
to the Flats to meet her,

00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:11.861
and she had smiled and
waved to him from the train,

00:01:11.861 --> 00:01:13.982
crying out, "You must be Ethan!"

00:01:13.982 --> 00:01:15.923
as she jumped down with her bundles,

00:01:15.923 --> 00:01:19.382
while he reflected,
looking her slight person.

00:01:19.382 --> 00:01:21.422
"She don't look much on housework,

00:01:21.422 --> 00:01:24.123
"but she ain't a fretter, anyhow."

00:01:24.123 --> 00:01:25.362
But it was not only,

00:01:25.362 --> 00:01:27.233
and I don't know quite
know what fretter means.

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:28.172
I'd have to think about that

00:01:28.172 --> 00:01:30.993
but it seems like on the context.

00:01:30.993 --> 00:01:33.334
But it was not only that the coming to his

00:01:33.334 --> 00:01:35.952
house of a bit of hopeful young life

00:01:35.952 --> 00:01:40.792
was like the lighting of
a fire on a cold hearth.

00:01:40.792 --> 00:01:42.513
The girl was more than the bright

00:01:42.513 --> 00:01:46.080
serviceable creature
that he had thought her.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.231
She had an eye to see and an ear to hear.

00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:51.893
He could show her things
and tell her things,

00:01:51.893 --> 00:01:53.991
and taste the bliss of feeling

00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:57.171
that all he imparted
left long reverberations

00:01:57.171 --> 00:02:00.050
and echoes he could wake at will.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.970
So, he felt not only was she
kind of this fun, bright,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.329
spirit that coming to the life.

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.249
He felt that she, that
there was a connection

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:10.229
that he could make with her.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.270
That she had an eye to
see and an ear to hear.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.231
That she could, that he
could show her things,

00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:18.591
and then awaken an
appreciation for things.

00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:21.289
Let's just keep reading.
This is interesting.

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:23.970
It was during their night
walks back to the farm

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.151
that he felt most intensely the
sweetness of this communion.

00:02:28.151 --> 00:02:30.191
He had always been more sensitive

00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:33.951
than the people about him to
the appeal of natural beauty.

00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:38.008
His unfinished studies had
given form to this sensibility

00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:40.538
and even in his unhappiest,

00:02:40.538 --> 00:02:42.983
in his unhappiest moments field

00:02:42.983 --> 00:02:47.784
and sky spoke to him with a
deep and powerful persuasion.

00:02:47.784 --> 00:02:50.602
But hitherto the emotion had remained

00:02:50.602 --> 00:02:52.984
in him as a silence ache,

00:02:52.984 --> 00:02:56.664
veiling with sadness the
beauty that evoked it.

00:02:56.664 --> 00:02:59.244
He did not even know whether anyone else

00:02:59.244 --> 00:03:01.183
in the world felt as he did.

00:03:01.183 --> 00:03:02.965
No, I actually feel that
when I look at nature.

00:03:02.965 --> 00:03:04.565
But anyway, that's, this isn't about me.

00:03:04.565 --> 00:03:06.303
As he did or whether he was a

00:03:06.303 --> 00:03:09.422
sole victim of this mournful privilege.

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:11.721
Then he learned that one other spirit

00:03:11.721 --> 00:03:14.823
had trembled with the
same touch of wonder.

00:03:14.823 --> 00:03:17.342
That at his side, at his side,

00:03:17.342 --> 00:03:20.165
living under his roof and eating his bread

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:22.484
was a creature to whom he could say,

00:03:22.484 --> 00:03:24.524
"That's Orion down yonder.

00:03:24.524 --> 00:03:27.521
"The big fellow to the
right is Aldebaran,"

00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:28.721
I'm not quite sure how to pronounce this.

00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:30.623
Ahl-deh-berr-een. Aldebaran.

00:03:30.623 --> 00:03:31.784
"And the bunch of little ones,

00:03:31.784 --> 00:03:34.882
like bees swarming, they're the Pleiades."

00:03:34.882 --> 00:03:36.683
Or whom he could hold entranced

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:38.923
before a ledge of granite thrusting up

00:03:38.923 --> 00:03:40.723
through the fern while be unrolled

00:03:40.723 --> 00:03:43.242
the huge panorama of the ice age,

00:03:43.242 --> 00:03:47.958
and the long dim stretches
of succeeding time.

00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:51.769
The fast that admiration for his learning

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.912
mingled with Mattie's wonder at what

00:03:53.912 --> 00:03:57.436
he taught was not the
least part of his pleasure.

00:03:57.436 --> 00:03:58.853
And there were other sensations,

00:03:58.853 --> 00:04:01.115
less definable but more exquisite,

00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:04.613
which drew them together
with a shock of silent joy.

00:04:04.613 --> 00:04:07.973
The cold red of sunset
behind winter hills,

00:04:07.973 --> 00:04:12.973
the flight of cloud-flocks
over slopes of golden stubble,

00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:19.994
or the intensely blue shadows
of hemlocks on sunlit snow.

00:04:19.994 --> 00:04:21.834
When she said to him once,

00:04:21.834 --> 00:04:23.953
"It looks just as if it was painted!"

00:04:23.953 --> 00:04:26.053
it seems to Ethan that the art

00:04:26.053 --> 00:04:28.893
of definition could go no farther,

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:30.992
and that words had at last been found

00:04:30.992 --> 00:04:33.012
to utter his secret soul.

00:04:33.012 --> 00:04:34.772
So, he clearly likes this girl.

00:04:34.772 --> 00:04:36.373
She's, she works for him so

00:04:36.373 --> 00:04:38.493
it's a bit of an awkward relationship,

00:04:38.493 --> 00:04:41.213
but he likes her not just
because she has this,

00:04:41.213 --> 00:04:43.011
I guess it sounds like positive energy,

00:04:43.011 --> 00:04:45.090
but he loves being able to teach her,

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.131
and show appreciation of nature,

00:04:47.131 --> 00:04:49.451
and it seems like some of
the science that he knows

00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:53.830
about the stars and
geology and whatever else.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.470
And so, he kind of likes being this

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.328
not only companion, this
co-appreciator of nature,

00:04:59.328 --> 00:05:01.029
but he also likes being her teacher

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:03.401
and feels that it's awakening things

00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:08.324
in appreciation for
science and nature in her.

00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:10.626
As he stood in the darkness outside

00:05:10.626 --> 00:05:12.687
the church these memories,

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:13.527
all right, so everything we just

00:05:13.527 --> 00:05:15.687
read so far these were memories.

00:05:15.687 --> 00:05:17.447
These memories came back with

00:05:17.447 --> 00:05:19.647
the poignancy of vanished things.

00:05:19.647 --> 00:05:21.207
All right, so we just read all this stuff

00:05:21.207 --> 00:05:23.986
but he is thinking about them as he stood

00:05:23.986 --> 00:05:25.644
in the darkness outside of the church

00:05:25.644 --> 00:05:28.025
as if they're gone, that
they're not there anymore,

00:05:28.025 --> 00:05:29.648
that these things are no longer there.

00:05:29.648 --> 00:05:32.405
There's a poignancy of vanished things.

00:05:32.405 --> 00:05:35.144
Watching Mattie whirl down the floor

00:05:35.144 --> 00:05:38.425
from hand to hand, whirl down
the floor from hand to hand.

00:05:38.425 --> 00:05:39.624
I wonder what she's doing.

00:05:39.624 --> 00:05:43.024
He, ah, maybe she's cleaning
or she's doing something else.

00:05:43.024 --> 00:05:44.625
I'm not sure but let's keep reading.

00:05:44.625 --> 00:05:46.784
Watching Mattie whirl down the floor

00:05:46.784 --> 00:05:50.045
from hand to hand he wondered how he

00:05:50.045 --> 00:05:54.566
could ever have thought that
his dull talk interested her.

00:05:54.566 --> 00:05:56.225
So, now he's saying before he thought

00:05:56.225 --> 00:05:58.225
that he was really charming her by telling

00:05:58.225 --> 00:06:01.683
her about geology and about the stars

00:06:01.683 --> 00:06:03.944
but now he's saying he wondered

00:06:03.944 --> 00:06:05.125
how we could ever have thought

00:06:05.125 --> 00:06:07.206
that his dull talk interested her.

00:06:07.206 --> 00:06:08.465
So, now he, it seems like he thinks

00:06:08.465 --> 00:06:11.526
that she actually wasn't as
interested as he thought.

00:06:11.526 --> 00:06:13.761
To him, who ever.

00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:17.479
To him, who was never
gay but in her presence,

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:20.737
her gaiety seems plain
proiof of indfference.

00:06:20.737 --> 00:06:22.915
All right, so he was never
really that jovial of a guy

00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:25.992
but when he was around
her by seeing her gaiety,

00:06:25.992 --> 00:06:29.552
her kind of happiness, seemed
plain proof of indifference.

00:06:29.552 --> 00:06:31.433
So, why is that?

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:34.152
The face she lifted to her dancers.

00:06:34.152 --> 00:06:36.531
All right, so he's around
some dancers now, I guess.

00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:38.490
The face she lifted to her dancers

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.551
was the same which, when she saw him,

00:06:41.551 --> 00:06:43.551
always looked like a window

00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:45.165
that has caught the sunset.

00:06:45.165 --> 00:06:46.645
Oh, okay, I see it.

00:06:46.645 --> 00:06:49.804
He thought that she was this kind of,

00:06:49.804 --> 00:06:52.466
this positivity, this
connection that he felt,

00:06:52.466 --> 00:06:53.985
was something that was
only between him and her

00:06:53.985 --> 00:06:55.287
but now he's feeling, "Well,

00:06:55.287 --> 00:06:57.526
"she does that with everybody."

00:06:57.526 --> 00:07:00.287
He even noticed two or
three gestures which,

00:07:00.287 --> 00:07:03.906
in his fatuity, so when he
was infatuated with her,

00:07:03.906 --> 00:07:06.524
he had thought she kept for him,

00:07:06.524 --> 00:07:09.586
a way of throwing her
head when she was amused,

00:07:09.586 --> 00:07:12.563
as if to taste her laugh
before she let it out,

00:07:12.563 --> 00:07:15.555
and a trick of sinking her lid slowly

00:07:15.555 --> 00:07:17.653
when anything charmed or moved her.

00:07:17.653 --> 00:07:19.894
All right, so before he
thought that they had

00:07:19.894 --> 00:07:22.033
had this very unique connection

00:07:22.033 --> 00:07:24.014
but now in hindsight he's like,

00:07:24.014 --> 00:07:25.734
"Oh, she wasn't interested in me at all.

00:07:25.734 --> 00:07:28.374
"She does that, she does
that with everyone."

00:07:28.374 --> 00:07:31.071
So, let's now read the questions.
