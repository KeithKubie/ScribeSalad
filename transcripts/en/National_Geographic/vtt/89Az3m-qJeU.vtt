00:00:01.633 --> 00:00:03.367
KATIE COURIC: Let's unpack
this whole gender conversation.

00:00:03.367 --> 00:00:06.133
You use a device,
or a character,

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.834
called the Genderbread Man.

00:00:07.834 --> 00:00:08.800
SAM KILLERMAN: Person.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.633
KATIE COURIC: Oh, sorry.

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:10.600
Oh.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.333
Sorry, sorry.

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.000
The Genderbread Person.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.700
SAM KILLERMAN: It's OK.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.467
I find it really helpful to
think about gender in a few

00:00:19.467 --> 00:00:21.934
different distinct
categories-- gender identity,

00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:24.500
how you define your gender
and how you see yourself;

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.900
gender expression, the different
ways that we present or perform

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.033
gender through our actions,
our dress, and our demeanor;

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:33.300
and biological sex
or anatomical sex--

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.100
the physical characteristics
that make up our body that,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.700
in many people's minds,
equal gender, but don't.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.367
KATIE COURIC: So gender
expression is the way you

00:00:43.367 --> 00:00:44.834
present yourself to the world.

00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:48.900
So you could be talking
about the way you dress,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.133
the way you comb your hair--

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.166
SAM KILLERMAN: Or don't.

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.600
KATIE COURIC: --or use product.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.233
So everything as it relates
to the outside world.

00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:57.467
SAM KILLERMAN: Yeah.

00:00:57.467 --> 00:00:58.667
That's a perfect way
to think about it.

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:00.967
So even just-- OK,
so this is funny.

00:01:00.967 --> 00:01:02.533
The way that I'm
sitting right now

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.967
is a very feminine expression
of sitting, because how we sit

00:01:05.967 --> 00:01:07.367
is gendered.

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:08.667
KATIE COURIC: Meanwhile,
I'm kind of man-spreading.

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:11.767
SAM KILLERMAN: Yeah,
you're man-spreading.

00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:13.834
You're not even give me
enough room to properly

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:16.300
man-spread over here.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.967
This is the man cross,
the masculine way

00:01:18.967 --> 00:01:21.000
of crossing a leg.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.734
This is just
uncomfortable for me.

00:01:22.734 --> 00:01:23.667
It feels like so much.

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:24.734
KATIE COURIC: It
feels good to me.

00:01:24.734 --> 00:01:25.700
SAM KILLERMAN: Yeah?

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.867
KATIE COURIC: Yeah,
it's like yoga.

00:01:26.867 --> 00:01:27.700
OK, now let's do the girl.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.467
SAM KILLERMAN: OK.

00:01:29.467 --> 00:01:31.166
KATIE COURIC: So
gender is different

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:32.734
than sexual orientation.

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:34.000
SAM KILLERMAN: Yeah.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.400
KATIE COURIC: But a lot of
people get them confused.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.433
SAM KILLERMAN: Yeah.

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:38.433
Gender is who you go to bed as.

00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:40.767
Sexual orientation is
who you go to bed with.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.100
KATIE COURIC: Got it.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.066
SAM KILLERMAN: So if you
haven't heard that one,

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.567
that one is important.

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:46.500
KATIE COURIC: So let's talk
about penises and vaginas,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.333
shall we?

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:48.600
SAM KILLERMAN: We might as well.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.367
SAM KILLERMAN: Let's
just go right there.

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:51.867
SAM KILLERMAN: If you haven't
already talked about penises

00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:53.834
and vaginas, we need to talk
about penises and vagina,

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:55.400
because that's what
everybody always thinks.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.367
Immediately, as soon
as you say gender,

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.166
anybody who's walking by
right now who's hearing us

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:00.667
say the word "gender,"
the first thing

00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:02.300
that's popping to their
mind is external genitalia.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.867
They're thinking about
penises and vagina.

00:02:03.867 --> 00:02:06.633
KATIE COURIC: So for the
purpose of our discussion,

00:02:06.633 --> 00:02:08.934
the bottom line is,
your external genitalia

00:02:08.934 --> 00:02:10.400
does not dictate your gender.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.667
SAM KILLERMAN: Yeah.

00:02:11.667 --> 00:02:12.734
KATIE COURIC (VOICEOVER):
Wait a second.

00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:14.867
Can you rewind that?

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:17.133
KATIE COURIC: The bottom line
is, your external genitalia

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:18.800
does not dictate your gender.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.333
SAM KILLERMAN: Yeah.

00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:21.333
I couldn't have said it better.
