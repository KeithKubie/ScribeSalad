00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.802
The Opposition 
is on high alert.

00:00:01.802 --> 00:00:06.206
I'm talking threat level red,
DEFCON one, diaper full.

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:09.109
Now, obviously, we all know why.

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:12.713
This week, one of the most
influential organizations

00:00:12.713 --> 00:00:15.048
in the world launched an attack

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:17.518
against everything
we thought we knew.

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:19.419
TV REPORTER: The International
 House of Pancakes

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.289
 is flipping it's "P" for a "B.”

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.324
 IHOP, announcing on Twitter,

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:25.959
 that it will now be called
 "IHOB"

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:27.628
 and will explain why on Monday.

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:29.329
 Some people are downright
 outraged.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.300
 Grace tweeting, "someone sue
 IHOP for changing their name.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.968
 What kind of anarchy is this?”

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:36.870
Yeah.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.939
This is anarchy!

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:40.807
I haven't been this rattled
by a threat

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:44.711
since Gloria Estefan said
"the rhythm is gonna get you.”

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:48.815
I've got to admit-- I'm still a
little skittish around congas.

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:52.920
IHOP, the letter that was broken
in your name wasn't the "P.”

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.088
It was the "I" for
"international.”

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:58.358
I hate the fact that my
create-a-face pancake is made

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:02.663
in a globalist enclave full of
espionage and French toast.

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:05.265
Opposers,
we can't wait till Monday.

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:09.002
We need to know what
in God's name IHOB is planning,

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:10.871
because the mainstream media

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:12.906
isn't going to help us
through this crisis.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.108
All their ideas are terrible.

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:16.910
TV REPORTER: The best guess
 is that it will become

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.279
 the International House
 of Breakfast.

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:21.682
TV REPORTER: No official word
 yet on what that "B"

00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:24.518
 will stand for; although, 
 it's thought to be "breakfast.”

00:01:24.518 --> 00:01:25.786
TV REPORTER:
 The most common--

00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:27.788
 and our producers think
 the most likely--

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:29.690
 is, of course, "breakfast.”

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.925
It's gonna be "breakfast,"
IHOB.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:36.196
First off, thanks, MSM
for covering this hard news.

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:38.198
(laughter)

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:40.033
But you're absolutely wrong.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.501
It can't be breakfast.

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:44.838
That's what the "B"
in Cardi B stands for...

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:46.540
Cardi Breakfast.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.709
If Wikipedia disagrees,
change it.

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:50.777
I dare you.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:54.581
Besides, breakfast would be
too simple, too obvious,

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:57.584
too undeserving
of an entire ad campaign

00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:59.886
with a full week's lead-in
to the rollout.

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:01.254
It has to be something else.

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:02.489
All hands on deck.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.091
Citizen journalist Laura Grey--

00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:07.327
IHOB, what is the "B"?

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:08.895
Easy, Jordan.

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:12.199
Say hello to the International
House of Benghazi

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:15.669
with today's special dish:

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:18.171
the rooty, tooty fresh n'
Hillary did it!

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:19.573
Right.

00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:21.842
So, you're all in on Benghazi?

00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:23.577
Aren't you, Jordan?
Aren't we all?

00:02:23.577 --> 00:02:25.379
Yes, of course, Laura.

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.748
Tim Baltz, what is the "B"?

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:30.884
Jordan, it's clear the feminists
are behind this.

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:33.286
Why else would they remove
the "P" for "penis"

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:36.023
and replace it with a "B"
for "bagina.”

00:02:36.023 --> 00:02:37.958
(laughter)

00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.993
You realize...

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:43.130
vagina starts with a "V," right?

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.664
Impossible.

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:46.800
If it's not the feminists,
then why does the "OB"

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.971
in the new IHOB logo look
exactly like the secret logo...

00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:52.973
(laughter)

00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:55.308
on the secret box that only
my mother and sister

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:57.644
were ever allowed to touch?

00:02:57.644 --> 00:02:59.780
Little did they know,
I used to steal them

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.983
and turn them into very soft
nunchucks for my G.I. Joes.

00:03:02.983 --> 00:03:04.484
No bad ideas, Tim.

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:07.154
Josh, Aaron, what is the "B"?

00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:09.723
Jordan, the "B"
is just phase one.

00:03:09.723 --> 00:03:12.726
Next, they're gonna take the "H"
and twist it around.

00:03:12.726 --> 00:03:15.462
Then turn the "O" sideways
so it becomes an "I.”

00:03:15.462 --> 00:03:18.265
And change the "B" into an "S"
just because.

00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:20.267
And, suddenly, IHOB is...

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:22.836
KLEPPER:
ISIS. ISIS.

00:03:22.836 --> 00:03:24.471
Exactly, Jordan.

00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:27.174
The terrorists are playing
a long game.

00:03:27.174 --> 00:03:29.643
They're going to slowly kill us
over the next 40 years

00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:31.711
with high-carb,
high-sugar breakfasts.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:34.147
The terrorists are gonna win
through diabetes, Jordan!

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:37.117
Oh, this is worse
than I thought.

00:03:37.117 --> 00:03:41.288
It's a full on "ihopalypse.”

00:03:41.288 --> 00:03:43.223
(cheering and applause)

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:47.360
We will be on this story
all week

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.163
because we only have five days
left to crack this code.

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:54.267
And I swear to God, it better
not be "breakfast.”

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:57.104
I'm (bleep) serious, IHOB.

00:03:57.104 --> 00:03:59.739
Sit your syrupy ass down
and hear me when I say,

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.175
if that "B" just stands for
(bleep) breakfast,

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:04.344
I'm going to come down there,
tear the blue roof right off

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:05.979
your globalist pancakery,

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:07.814
put your short stacks in
the waffle maker,

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:10.117
and send you back to whatever
hash brown hell you came from.
