00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.192
So, the way I think about
industry events are,

00:00:03.192 --> 00:00:07.365
I wanted to use these events as
an opportunity to meet potential users.

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:08.757
So when I was just starting out,

00:00:08.757 --> 00:00:11.060
I was looking to meet people
who are into sharing.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.270
So, I went to meetups that
are around recycling and sharing and

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.500
things like that.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.786
Just so I can talk to people and

00:00:16.786 --> 00:00:20.094
tell them, hey look this is what I want
to build, what do you think about it?

00:00:20.094 --> 00:00:21.858
Would you use something like that?

00:00:21.858 --> 00:00:24.790
And those have been really,
really useful.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.180
The other type of industry events
are just those events where you go

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.835
to mingle and meet other entrepreneurs
and investors, and just kind of network.

00:00:36.835 --> 00:00:38.379
I went to some of those.

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.779
I have to say that after attending a
few, I just completely stopped going and

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:45.210
realized this is not my way to network.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.340
And I should be getting work done and
getting the traction with my product,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.450
and then meet the right people
who see that this is working and

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.380
it's interesting for them.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.320
&gt;&gt; In order to get noticed, in events or
anywhere, if you're networking.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.560
You need to do something
that people care about,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.280
that people would want to interact with.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.254
So, even if it's a very serious trade
show with a lot of people with the suits

00:01:11.254 --> 00:01:13.837
that are looking for specific things.

00:01:13.837 --> 00:01:17.144
If you're going to be fun and
open and engaging,

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:19.820
people are going to notice you.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.996
I saw people walking around with
comedians that are giving them,

00:01:24.996 --> 00:01:28.207
if you talk of me,
I will tell you a joke.

00:01:28.207 --> 00:01:32.953
Or, we're doing a paintable party later.

00:01:32.953 --> 00:01:35.680
Or we're offering a yoga
class in the morning.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.990
Do you want to sign up?

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.823
Stuff like that, that people are not
expecting to get in conferences.

00:01:41.823 --> 00:01:46.430
People are not expecting to get in those
places, this can really make a change.
