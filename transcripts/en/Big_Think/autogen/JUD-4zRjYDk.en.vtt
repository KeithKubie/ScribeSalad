extraordinary patience and what keeps
you going is discovery and sometimes in

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970
you going is discovery and sometimes in
 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.570
you going is discovery and sometimes in
a lifetime you may have one outstanding

discovery Einstein used to say that that

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779
discovery Einstein used to say that that
 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.740
discovery Einstein used to say that that
he was unusual and that he had had to

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750
he was unusual and that he had had to
 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.900
he was unusual and that he had had to
but anyone would have been enough to

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910
but anyone would have been enough to
 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.010
but anyone would have been enough to
have kept him going

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020
 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.240
most scientists are not in that league

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250
most scientists are not in that league
 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.630
most scientists are not in that league
but we all have at some scale things

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640
but we all have at some scale things
 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.220
but we all have at some scale things
that were you know really very proud of

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230
that were you know really very proud of
 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.479
that were you know really very proud of
if we do if we discover them often

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489
if we do if we discover them often
 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.680
if we do if we discover them often
we are looking for them the idea that a

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690
we are looking for them the idea that a
 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.080
we are looking for them the idea that a
lot of discovery is serendipitous and

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090
lot of discovery is serendipitous and
 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.290
lot of discovery is serendipitous and
accidental is tremendously tremendously

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300
accidental is tremendously tremendously
 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.109
accidental is tremendously tremendously
overplayed I think it's much more likely

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119
overplayed I think it's much more likely
 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.480
overplayed I think it's much more likely
that one sees something almost in

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490
that one sees something almost in
 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.380
that one sees something almost in
everyday life

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390
everyday life
 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.719
everyday life
that puzzles you and you carry it around

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729
that puzzles you and you carry it around
 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.380
that puzzles you and you carry it around
with you for some period of time and

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390
with you for some period of time and
 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.730
with you for some period of time and
then you see some way of connecting to

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740
then you see some way of connecting to
 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.120
then you see some way of connecting to
it uh you could say our discoveries in

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130
it uh you could say our discoveries in
 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.279
it uh you could say our discoveries in
autism is an example of that at a very

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289
autism is an example of that at a very
 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.050
autism is an example of that at a very
early age I was impressed by this child

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060
early age I was impressed by this child
 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.510
early age I was impressed by this child
and later saw an opportunity and I

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520
and later saw an opportunity and I
 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.180
and later saw an opportunity and I
struck when the opportunity was there to

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190
struck when the opportunity was there to
 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.960
struck when the opportunity was there to
satisfy my curiosity so most discovery

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970
satisfy my curiosity so most discovery
 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.160

is of that type sometimes you see things

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170
is of that type sometimes you see things
 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.139
is of that type sometimes you see things
that you can't explain and I shouldn't

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149
that you can't explain and I shouldn't
 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.059
that you can't explain and I shouldn't
say sometimes a lot of time you see

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069
say sometimes a lot of time you see
 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.900
say sometimes a lot of time you see
things that you can't explain and

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910
things that you can't explain and
 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.040
things that you can't explain and
sometimes you come up with explanations

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050
sometimes you come up with explanations
 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.790
sometimes you come up with explanations
that are really exciting and 99% of the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800
that are really exciting and 99% of the
 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.550
that are really exciting and 99% of the
time all those are wrong and there's

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560
time all those are wrong and there's
 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.859
time all those are wrong and there's
really some trivial explanation for the

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869
really some trivial explanation for the
 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.589
really some trivial explanation for the
thing that's gotten you excited early in

00:01:58.589 --> 00:01:58.599
thing that's gotten you excited early in
 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:59.999
thing that's gotten you excited early in
my career I used to hate those things

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009

something it's weird you have a you come
up with some great encompassing idea

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370
up with some great encompassing idea
 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.369
up with some great encompassing idea
that'll explain it's gonna change how

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379
that'll explain it's gonna change how
 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.229
that'll explain it's gonna change how
people think and then the next day you

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239
people think and then the next day you
 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.940
people think and then the next day you
realize that you were really a dumb

realize that you were really a dumb
nowadays when those things happen I

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909
nowadays when those things happen I
 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.890
nowadays when those things happen I
actually really enjoy them because there

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900
actually really enjoy them because there
 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.190
actually really enjoy them because there
are so few you know real Eureka moments

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200
are so few you know real Eureka moments
 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.750
are so few you know real Eureka moments

I've actually gotten to enjoy those
those weird results that we can't

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409
those weird results that we can't
 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:41.780
those weird results that we can't
explain

come up with fanciful ideas and then try
 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.220
come up with fanciful ideas and then try
to batter them and then you get a double

satisfaction because your end up
 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.649
satisfaction because your end up

destroying the idea and it's satisfying
to destroy the idea almost as much fun

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790
to destroy the idea almost as much fun
