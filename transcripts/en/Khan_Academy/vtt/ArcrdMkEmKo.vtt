00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.120
We're nearing the home
stretch of our quest

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.020
to find the inverse of this
three-by-three matrix here.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.610
And the next thing
that we can do

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.680
is find the determinant
of it, which we already

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.810
have a good bit
of practice doing.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.860
So the determinant
of C, of our matrix--

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.290
I'll do that same
color-- C, there

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.310
are several ways
that you could do it.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.759
You could take this
top row of the matrix

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.290
and take the value of
each of those terms

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.060
times the cofactor-- times
the corresponding cofactor--

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.190
and take the sum there.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.300
That's one technique.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.760
Or you could do
the technique where

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.620
you rewrite these
first two columns,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.061
and then you take the product
of the top to left diagonals,

00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:53.995
sum those up, and
then subtract out

00:00:53.995 --> 00:00:55.462
the top right to
the bottom left.

00:00:55.462 --> 00:00:57.160
I'll do the second
one just so that you

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.179
can see that you
get the same result.

00:00:59.179 --> 00:00:59.720
So let's see.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.910
The determinant is going
to be equal to-- I'll

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.610
rewrite all of these
things-- so negative

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.870
1, negative 2, 2,
2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 5.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.150
And let me now, just to make
it a little bit simpler,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.260
rewrite these first two columns.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.802
So negative 1,
negative 2, 2, 1, 3, 4.

00:01:22.802 --> 00:01:25.290
So the determinant
is going to be

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.030
equal to-- so let
me write this down.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.100
So you have negative
1 times 1 times 5.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.200
Well that's just going
to be negative 5,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.230
taking that product.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:42.590
Then you have negative
2 times 1 times 3.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.690
Well that's negative 6.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.760
So we'll have negative 6.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.830
Or you could say plus
negative 6 there.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.430
And then you have
2 times 2 times 4.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.150
Well that's just 4 times
4, which is just 16.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.650
So we have plus 16.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.980
And then we do the top
right to the bottom left.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.460
So you have negative
2 times 2 times 5.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.650
Well that's negative 4 times 5.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.070
So that is negative 20.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.150
But we're going to
subtract negative 20.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.430
So that's negative 4
times 5, negative 20,

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.682
but we're going to
subtract negative 20.

00:02:18.682 --> 00:02:22.530
Obviously that's going to
turn into adding positive 20.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.860
Then you have negative 1 times
1 times 4, which is negative 4.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.670
But we're going to
subtract these products.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.080
We're going to
subtract negative 4.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.450
And then you have 2 times
1 times 3, which is 6.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.640
But we have to subtract it.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.300
So we have subtracting 6.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.800
And so this simplifies
to negative 5 minus 6

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:52.570
is negative 11, plus 16
gets us to positive 5.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.050
So all of this
simplifies to positive 5.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.180
And then we have plus 20 plus 4.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.016
Actually, let me do
that green color,

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:06.480
so we don't get confused.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.169
So we have plus
20 plus 4 minus 6.

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:14.210
So what does this get us?

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:24.720
5 plus 20 is 25, plus 4 is
29, minus 6 gets us to 23.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.077
So our determinant right
over here is equal to 23.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.620
So now we are really
in the home stretch.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.360
The inverse of this
matrix is going

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.030
to be 1 over our determinant
times the transpose

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.970
of this cofactor matrix.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.220
And the transpose of
the cofactor matrix

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.800
is called the adjugate.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.780
So let's do that.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.704
So let's write
the adjugate here.

00:03:54.704 --> 00:03:55.620
This is the drum roll.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.070
We're really in
the home stretch.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.130
C inverse is equal to
1 over the determinant,

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:09.830
so it's equal to 1/23,
times the adjugate of C.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:18.829
And so this is going to be equal
to 1/23 times the transpose

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.810
of our cofactor matrix.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.470
So we have our cofactor
matrix right over here.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.480
So each row now
becomes a column.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.970
So this row now
becomes a column.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.730
So it becomes 1, negative 7,
5 becomes the first column.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.640
The second row becomes
the second column-- 18,

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.320
negative 11, negative 2.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.890
And then finally, the third
row becomes the third column.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.716
You have negative 4, 5, and 3.

00:04:58.716 --> 00:05:00.090
And now we just
have to multiply,

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.410
or you could say divide, each of
these by 23, and we are there.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.085
So this is the inverse of
our original matrix C, home

00:05:09.085 --> 00:05:09.990
stretch.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:16.870
1 divided by 23 is just 1/23.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.194
Then you have 18/23.

00:05:18.194 --> 00:05:20.610
Actually, let me give myself
a little bit more real estate

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.506
to do this in.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.010
So there we go.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:38.590
So 1 divided by 23-- 1/23,
18/23, negative 4/23,

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:52.830
negative 7/23, negative 11/23,
5/23, 5/23, negative 2/23.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.840
And then finally,
assuming we haven't made

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.780
any careless mistakes,
which would shock me

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.250
if we haven't, we get to 3/23.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.320
And we are done.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.610
We have successfully inverted
a three-by-three matrix.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.650
Once again, something I
strongly believe better done

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.030
by a computer and
probably should not

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.690
be part of a typical Algebra
2 curriculum, because it tends

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.467
to be displayed in a,
non-contextual way.
