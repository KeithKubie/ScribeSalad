00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.030
As the old saying goes, there’s nothing
new under the sun.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.050
For fans of movies and TV, that means that
every story that can be told already has been.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.580
But sometimes, the movies that seem to be
retelling a well-known story TOO closely are

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.180
singled out, accused of being a ripoff, copycat,
or unoriginal.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.500
The most famous example is James Cameron’s
Avatar, a story of a human being welcomed

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.829
into a native tribe, betraying their trust,
but eventually saving the day.

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:42.079
As soon as the movie hit theaters, people
dismissed the billion-dollar blockbuster as

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.859
a ripoff of Pocahontas, or even Fern Gully
before it.

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:51.269
The truth is, it’s telling the same story
told by dozens, even hundreds of famous films.

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.530
But that’s not a reason to attack it, or
any other re-skinned movie myth – it’s

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:07.909
just an opportunity for our latest Docu Series,
The Hidden Truth Behind ALL Movies!

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.780
The Unlikely/Unknowing/Unwitting Hero

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.530
There’s been plenty of research into the
shared structure of a successful screenplay,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.980
from three-act structures to a “save the
cat” moment for a movie’s hero – a term

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.590
coined by Blake Snyder, referring to the unnecessary
good deed that lets audiences know a hero

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.320
is good at heart.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.049
But keeping things simple, there’s one kind
of hero every movie fan loves: and that’s

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.189
an unlikely one.

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.080
In movies like Avatar, The LEGO Movie, even
Star Wars, and Guardians of the Galaxy, it

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.329
isn’t some wealthy, powerful, or royal figure
who gets a chance at greatness, but an everyday

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:44.540
child, or person.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.719
It’s a clear case of wish fulfillment, but
it also sets the bigger story in motion.

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:54.189
After all, a character can’t realize their
greatness unless they’re oblivious to it

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:55.189
at the start.

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.659
So even though their circumstances might be
different – Jake Sully is a paraplegic,

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.810
Star-Lord is an everyday kid, Emmet is just
a face in the crowd, and even Superman is

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.780
a humble farmboy – they have more in common
with the viewer than a prince or princess,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.410
powerful leader, or deadly warrior would.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.320
Whether it’s a trip into space, or just
a massive secret revealed, everyday people

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:28.200
are pulled into a story far bigger than themselves
– but being useful usually comes at a price.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.300
The Honest Deceit

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.490
Nobody becomes a hero overnight, and in blockbuster
movies, writers don’t change up the format

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.960
more than they have to.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.960
So no matter how a protagonist’s mission
might seem different, or how good their reasons

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.000
may be, a little dishonesty, or lingering
doubts are guaranteed.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.260
It’s here where the charges are made that
Avatar is just a re-skinning of other stories.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.990
Jake is sent to infiltrate the enemy ranks,
quietly learning their ways, and eventually

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.760
coming to respect them, even joining their
community as a valued member, not to mention

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.690
falling in love with Neytiri, the chief’s
daughter.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.630
That’s the same thing that happened with
Zack in Fern Gully, and John Smith in Pocahontas,

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.060
so the comparisons are fair.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.060
But there’s one problem.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.970
It’s also the exact same thing that happened
to Brian O’Connor in The Fast &amp; The Furious,

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.580
Johnny Utah in Point Break, Ash in Army of
Darkness, Han Solo in Star Wars, Ralph in

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.580
Wreck-it Ralph, Vallon in Gangs of New York
, Emmet in The LEGO Movie… you get the idea.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.270
By getting close to the enemy, our hero becomes
one of them – and starts to wonder if they’re

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.510
on the wrong side after all.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.090
But if their new family was to find out they
weren’t telling the truth, things would

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.120
get ugly fast…

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.880
The Betrayal

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.990
It’s almost a certainty that the hero’s
secret will be spilled prematurely, before

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.340
they’ve gotten a chance to tell it themselves.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.850
The result is the loss of their new family,
whether it’s deserved or not.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.880
Brian and Johnny Utah lose their lovers when
their lies are exposed, Emmet can’t explain

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.650
that he’s not a Master Builder after all,
Star-Lord is accused of only caring about

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.180
the Infinity Stone’s value, Leia and Luke
accuse Han of only being in it for the money,

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.730
and Jake, Zack, and John Smith are all branded
as traitors without getting to explain that

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.310
they never shared their army’s beliefs to
begin with.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.750
The twist can also be played by women, like
when Mulan is exposed as a woman fighting

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.030
in a man’s army, having their bonds and
trust disappear, leaving them with no side

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.350
to join, and shame for hurting the people
they came to truly care for.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.810
That would all be a problem, if it wasn’t
for one other thing all unlikely movie heroes

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.490
have in common…

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:53.370
The Chosen One

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.460
These are still our heroes, so of course,
they’re going to get to save the day.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.990
But it isn’t enough for them to just be
hailed as worthy members of the community,

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.720
tribe, gang, or family – these unlikely
heroes are the chosen ones, born leaders,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.120
who only realize their true greatness when
they have to prove they weren’t traitors

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.180
after all.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.160
Any movie fan can instantly remember the same
scene played out in hundreds of films: when

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:25.000
the outsider hero is welcomed, wearing the
armor, colors, or clothing that proves he’s

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.290
been accepted, ready to show why he’s greater
than anyone actually accepting him.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.710
Again, it’s clearly wish fulfillment to
see so many everyday people try something

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.650
new, and realize they’re secretly born to
do it.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:46.250
But it’s truly shocking when you realize
how many movies stick to this exact path.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.870
Even the Star Wars series seems to fit, since
the novels explained that Anakin was a child

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.960
born of Dark Side meddling.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.550
Raised and trained by the Jedi, only to come
home to the Sith, and become the greatest

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.350
there ever was.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:06.270
The same goes for Superman, who chose humanity
over his own people, becoming a greater warrior

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.870
than either civilization had ever known.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:14.020
So yes, Avatar, The Fast &amp; The Furious, and
Guardians of the Galaxy might just be John

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.419
Smith, Johnny Utah, and Han Solo all over
again, but their stories are told in more

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:21.900
movies, and ways, than are immediately clear.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.560
Especially when Captain America is as unlikely
a hero as Luke Skywalker or even Hal Jordan,

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.010
or Tony Stark’s path to true heroism has
so much in common with Tom Cruise’s Last

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.010
Samurai.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.010
They’re all different, sure.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.560
But when their eyes are opened, their secrets
are spilled, and their destinies are achieved,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.230
they’re all just telling the same great
story we all wish could be our own.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:52.840
That’s our case for the shared path of most
unlikely movie heroes and heroines, and why

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.840
it isn’t anything new, or unoriginal.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.840
What do you think?

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.949
Are movies just looking to tell old stories
in new ways, just like novels, TV shows and

00:06:58.949 --> 00:06:59.949
comic books?

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:01.320
Or do you have your doubts?
