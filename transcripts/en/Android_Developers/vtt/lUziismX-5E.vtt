[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:09.090
ANTHONY SULLIVAN: Mobile
is hugely important to us

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.839
at "The Guardian."

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:10.870
So mobile is our future.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.102
Like many publishers, we're
seeing a huge transition

00:00:13.102 --> 00:00:15.180
of our audience onto
mobile platforms.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.480
So what we see is our
apps users consume

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.930
vastly more content than
any other user that we have,

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:21.660
actually.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.559
Android is clearly
a huge part of that.

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:24.975
TOM GRINSTED: It's
not overstating

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:27.960
it to say that our apps users,
including our Android users,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.310
are our most valuable users
across the entire portfolio.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.350
They read more of our content.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.990
They stick around for longer
and spend more time with us.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.000
App users are between
10 and 20 times

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.352
more engaged than
the average web user.

00:00:40.352 --> 00:00:43.760
Native apps like our
Android app provide features

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.310
that you can't get
on the mobile web.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.140
And really, this comes
down to key things

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.036
around ever presence.

00:00:50.036 --> 00:00:52.535
The fact that once you're on
the device, you're always there

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:54.830
and you're running-- that
gives us opportunities

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.550
that we've never had before.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.540
If you look at our
Android web integration,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.900
for instance, then that's
really about enabling people

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.260
to receive "Guardian"
notifications in a much more

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.800
timely and interesting way.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.870
And then to be able to read them
straightaway, or even save them

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.800
for later if they get a story
that they really care about,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.600
but they're in a situation where
they can't quite read it yet.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.040
I'm really proud
of the team here,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.204
and have opt-in
rate of over 90%.

00:01:18.204 --> 00:01:19.620
So fewer than 10%
of people choose

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.924
not to get our notifications.

00:01:20.924 --> 00:01:22.465
And that really
speaks to the quality

00:01:22.465 --> 00:01:25.330
of the editorial choices
that we make around them.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.760
With such a large
audience for our apps,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.140
then personalization become
increasingly important.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.084
You can personalize
your homepage.

00:01:32.084 --> 00:01:34.000
And this is a really,
really powerful feature.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.980
It allows users to select
any kind of content

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.850
from across the entire network.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.946
So it could be your
favorite subject,

00:01:40.946 --> 00:01:42.320
it could be your
favorite writer.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.180
And we want to make sure the
content that's relevant to them

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.550
is really front and center
for their experience.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.730
ANTHONY SULLIVAN: Having engaged
users is critically important.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.070
In fact, in many ways it's
more important than just having

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.861
a large number of users
for "The Guardian."

00:01:53.861 --> 00:01:56.610
And creating a habit, that's
really important to us.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.152
So that not only helps
us with monetization,

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:01.830
but building that really sort
of long lifetime relationship

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.020
with the audience.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.305
TOM GRINSTED: As a business,
we passionately believe

00:02:04.305 --> 00:02:06.471
that the only way to be
confident about the products

00:02:06.471 --> 00:02:09.240
we're going to launch is to test
them, test them, test them--

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.060
and get them in front of as many
real readers and real users as

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.960
possible.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.890
We do that through Google Play,
through replying to reviews.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.000
We do that through the
Android beta program.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.749
Now, the reason we do
all of those things,

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:21.970
it's because we really
want to understand

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.600
what they're doing
with our products.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.620
And what they're
finding difficult,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.690
and what they're loving.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.470
That kind of feedback does help
us make strategic decisions

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.510
about what's most
important for our readers

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.800
when they're using the app.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.484
A good example is the new
search that we're releasing.

00:02:35.484 --> 00:02:36.900
It's a direct
response to feedback

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.540
we've got both from our beta
program, and on Google Play

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.680
as well.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.260
Mobile on Android has played
a key part in our growth

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.340
strategy, both in
emerging markets

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.530
and mature markets as well.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.200
When we look at
our new markets--

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.240
so India is a really
good example-- then

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.440
people there are going
straight to mobile.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.470
And Android is a
large part of that.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.760
So our work on Android is part
of our international growth.
