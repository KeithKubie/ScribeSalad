electromechanical systems they were

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420
electromechanical systems they were
 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.120
electromechanical systems they were
talking about sensors and actuators

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
talking about sensors and actuators
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.880
talking about sensors and actuators
those are MEMS okay so they forgot to

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890
those are MEMS okay so they forgot to
 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.350
those are MEMS okay so they forgot to
say that I was going to interrupt but I

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360
say that I was going to interrupt but I
 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.190
say that I was going to interrupt but I
decided I'd wait till later and so yeah

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200
decided I'd wait till later and so yeah
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.380
decided I'd wait till later and so yeah
all the stuff Bosh does would not exist

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390
all the stuff Bosh does would not exist
 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.210
all the stuff Bosh does would not exist
if not for MEMS you forgot to include

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220
if not for MEMS you forgot to include
 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.830
if not for MEMS you forgot to include
that as well and you're talking but

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840
that as well and you're talking but
 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.069
that as well and you're talking but
that's ok yeah that's true

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079
that's ok yeah that's true
 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.450
that's ok yeah that's true
and actually if you come to my office

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460
and actually if you come to my office
 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.550
and actually if you come to my office
you'll see a picture that was made for

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560
you'll see a picture that was made for
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.800
you'll see a picture that was made for
me by the folks at MEMS and bashed men

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810

it's in any case part of what I did when

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259
it's in any case part of what I did when
 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.440

do kind of trip notes for people I would

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860
do kind of trip notes for people I would
 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.679
do kind of trip notes for people I would
do the summary of the day it would

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689
do the summary of the day it would
 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.170
do the summary of the day it would
capture funny quotes and sometimes we

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180
capture funny quotes and sometimes we
 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.780
capture funny quotes and sometimes we
would do it as a competition I'm working

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790
would do it as a competition I'm working
 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.670
would do it as a competition I'm working
my way into that so eventually you guys

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680
my way into that so eventually you guys
 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.530
my way into that so eventually you guys
can do be it could be collaborative you

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
can do be it could be collaborative you

can do be it could be collaborative you
could be a part of this process but I

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
could be a part of this process but I
 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.950
could be a part of this process but I
decided I put together a couple of

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960
decided I put together a couple of
 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.639
decided I put together a couple of
slides to talk about what were the key

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649
slides to talk about what were the key
 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.080
slides to talk about what were the key
thoughts and now the issue is I cannot

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090
thoughts and now the issue is I cannot
 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.040
thoughts and now the issue is I cannot
read very well so what I did is and will

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050
read very well so what I did is and will
 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.010

stories about how far we've come as a
region and so what he was talking about

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530
region and so what he was talking about
 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.190
region and so what he was talking about
is how I'm out now to Metro 21 is

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200
is how I'm out now to Metro 21 is

at Metro 21 we heard this again and
 

00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:07.550
at Metro 21 we heard this again and
again this idea that we need to try them

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.560
again this idea that we need to try them
 

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.370

thing I mean that's what stands us apart

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:29.190
thing I mean that's what stands us apart

thing I mean that's what stands us apart
a lot from these high tech universities

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:31.770
a lot from these high tech universities
 

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:33.800
a lot from these high tech universities
is because we really are focused on the

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:33.810
is because we really are focused on the
 

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:36.230

policy and the people we talked about
ownership of data and then we asked them

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:40.229
ownership of data and then we asked them
 

00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:42.469

the future and I thought it was

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:44.400
the future and I thought it was
 

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.730

we're gonna be doing more work and not
 

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.910
we're gonna be doing more work and not
just the metropolitan areas but those

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920
just the metropolitan areas but those

right and then deployments in the real

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:50.620
right and then deployments in the real
 

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.529
right and then deployments in the real
world to solve real world problems right

00:17:52.529 --> 00:17:52.539
world to solve real world problems right
 

00:17:52.539 --> 00:17:55.529

and then meanwhile we want to take a

00:17:55.529 --> 00:17:55.539
and then meanwhile we want to take a
 

00:17:55.539 --> 00:17:57.590
and then meanwhile we want to take a
scientific approach which enables

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600
scientific approach which enables
 

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.460

fundamentally new ways of thinking about

00:17:59.460 --> 00:17:59.470
fundamentally new ways of thinking about
 

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:02.100
fundamentally new ways of thinking about
things fundamentally new ways of solving

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:02.110
things fundamentally new ways of solving
 

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.200
things fundamentally new ways of solving
problems and then as Jim pointed out

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:04.210
problems and then as Jim pointed out
 

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.090
problems and then as Jim pointed out
there are engineering ways of doing it

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:06.100
there are engineering ways of doing it
 

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.100
there are engineering ways of doing it
as well by trial and error so basically

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:08.110
as well by trial and error so basically
 

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:09.779
as well by trial and error so basically
and then from engineering comes science

00:18:09.779 --> 00:18:09.789
and then from engineering comes science
 

00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:11.010
and then from engineering comes science
from science urine engineering
