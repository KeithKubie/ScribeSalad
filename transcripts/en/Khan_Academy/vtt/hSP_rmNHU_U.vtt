00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.810
- [Tutor] So we are interested in studying

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.040
the relationship between the amount

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.021
that folks study for a test
and their score on a test,

00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:10.560
where the score is between zero and six

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.370
and so what we're going to
do is go look at the people

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.700
who took the test, we're
going to plot for each person

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.760
the amount that they
studied and their score,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.560
so for example, this data point is someone

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.380
who studied an hour and
they got a one on the test

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.470
and then we're going to
fit a regression line

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.500
and this blue regression line
is the actual regression line

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.240
for these four data points

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.184
and here is the equation
for that regression line.

00:00:34.184 --> 00:00:37.067
Now there's a couple of
things to keep in mind,

00:00:37.067 --> 00:00:39.149
normally when you're doing
this type of analysis,

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.480
you would do it with far
more than four data points,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.950
the reason why I kept this to four

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.980
is because we are actually
going to calculate

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.680
how good a fit this
regression line is by hand

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.870
and typically you would not do it by hand,

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.331
we have computers for that.

00:00:55.331 --> 00:00:57.480
Now the way that we're going to measure

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.910
how good a fit this regression line is

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.420
to the data has several names,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.420
one name is the standard
deviation of the residuals,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.960
another name is the root
mean square deviation,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.086
sometimes abbreviated RMSD,

00:01:14.086 --> 00:01:17.154
sometimes it's called
root mean square error,

00:01:17.154 --> 00:01:19.858
so what we're going to
do is is for every point,

00:01:19.858 --> 00:01:22.553
we're going to calculate the residual

00:01:22.553 --> 00:01:23.950
and then we're going to square it

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.330
and then we're gonna add up

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.271
the sum of those squared residuals,

00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:30.950
so we're gonna take the sum

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.260
of the residuals,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
residuals squared

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.600
and then we're going to divide that

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.060
by the number of data
points we have minus two

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.100
and we can talk in future videos

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.670
or a more advanced statistics class

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.852
of why you divide by two,
but it's related to the idea

00:01:48.852 --> 00:01:51.324
that what we're calculating
here is a statistic

00:01:51.324 --> 00:01:54.090
and we're trying to
estimate a true parameter

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.380
as best as possible and n minus two

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.110
actually does the trick for us.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.851
But to calculate the root
mean square deviation,

00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:02.960
we would then take a square root of this

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.750
and some of you might recognize

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.440
strong parallels between
this and how we calculated

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.663
sample standard deviation
early in our statistics career

00:02:11.663 --> 00:02:13.520
and I encourage you to think about it.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.529
But let's actually calculate it by hand,

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:17.730
as I mentioned earlier in this video,

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.260
to see how things actually play out.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.240
So to do that, I'm going to
ourselves a little table here,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.300
so let's say that is our
x value in that column,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.233
let's make this our y value,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.610
let's make this

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.590
y hat, which is going to be equal

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.380
to 2.5x minus two

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.750
and then let's make this
the residual squared,

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.420
which is going to be our y
value minus our y hat value,

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.134
our actual minus our estimate
for that given x squared

00:02:51.134 --> 00:02:53.680
and then we're going to sum them all up,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.830
divide by n minus two
and take the square root.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.416
So first let's do this data point,

00:02:58.416 --> 00:03:01.360
so that's the point 1,1,

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.000
1,1,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.370
now what is the estimate
from our regression line?

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.359
Well, for that x value,
when x is equal to one,

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.013
it's gonna be 2.5 times one minus two,

00:03:10.013 --> 00:03:12.570
so it's gonna be 2.5

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.520
times one minus two,

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.340
which is equal to 0.5

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.530
and so our residual squared
is going to be one minus 0.5,

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.490
one minus 0.5 squared,

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.330
which is equal to, that's
gonna be .5 squared,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.512
which is gonna be 0.25.

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:34.740
Alright, let's do the next data point,

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.560
we have this one right over here,

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.430
it is 2,2,

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.810
now our estimate from the regression line

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.760
when x equals two is going to be equal

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.990
to 2.5 times our x value,

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.430
times two minus two,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.090
which is going to be equal to three

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.090
and so our residual squared is
going to be two minus three,

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.252
two minus three squared,
which is negative one squared,

00:04:04.252 --> 00:04:07.170
which is going to be equal to one,

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.820
then we can go to this point,

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.423
so that's the point 2,3, 2,3,

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.420
now our estimate from our regression line

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.380
is going to be 2.5 times
our x value, times two

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.380
minus two, which is going
to be equal to three

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.101
and so our residual
here is going to be zero

00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:31.994
and you can see that that point
sits on the regression line,

00:04:31.994 --> 00:04:34.640
so it's going to be three minus three,

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.200
three minus three squared,
which is equal to zero

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.750
and then last but not least,

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.250
we have this point right
over here, when x is three,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.410
our y value, this person
studied three hours

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.560
and they got a six on the
test, so y is equal to six,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.126
and so our estimate from
the regression line,

00:04:54.126 --> 00:04:56.160
you can see what you would
have expected to get,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.910
based on the regression line is 2.5

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.580
times our x value, times three minus two

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.750
is equal to 5.5

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.735
and so our residual squared
is six minus 5.5 squared,

00:05:11.735 --> 00:05:13.235
it is 5.5 squared,

00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:16.253
so it's .5 squared, which is 0.25.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.090
So now the next step,

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.790
let me take the sum of all
of these squared residuals,

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.820
so this is, let me just write
it this way, do it like this,

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.340
so the sum of the residuals,

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.500
residuals squared

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.870
is equal to,

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.413
if I just sum all of this up,

00:05:38.348 --> 00:05:41.847
it's going to be 1.5,

00:05:41.847 --> 00:05:43.405
1.5

00:05:43.405 --> 00:05:46.800
and then if I divide that by n minus two,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.477
so if I divide by n minus two,

00:05:48.477 --> 00:05:51.150
that's going to be equal
to, I have four data points,

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.469
so I'm gonna divide by four minus two,

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:54.730
so I'm gonna divide by two

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.540
and then I'm gonna wanna
take the square root of that,

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.730
then I'm gonna take
the square root of that

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.720
and so this is going to get us

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.250
1.5 over two is the same
thing as three-fourths,

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.820
so it's the square root of three-fourths

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.448
or the square root of three over two

00:06:09.448 --> 00:06:12.610
and you could use a calculator
to figure what that is,

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.676
to figure out what that is as a decimal,

00:06:14.676 --> 00:06:16.040
but this gives us a sense

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.700
of how good a fit this regression line is,

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.200
the closer this is to zero,

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.900
the better the fit of the regression line,

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.965
the further away from zero, the worst fit

00:06:24.965 --> 00:06:26.720
and what would be the units

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.070
for the root mean square deviation?

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.300
Well, it would be in terms of

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.340
whatever your units are for your y axis,

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.900
in this case, it would
be the score on the test

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.094
and that's one of the other
values of this calculation,

00:06:40.094 --> 00:06:42.520
of taking the square root of the sum

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.810
of the squares of the residuals
dividing by n minus two.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.410
So big picture, this square
root of three over two

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.060
can be viewed as the approximate size

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.810
of a typical or average prediction error

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.360
between these points

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.013
and what the regression
line would have predicted

00:07:00.013 --> 00:07:03.320
or you could view it
as the approximate size

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.753
of a typical or average residual.
