00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.410
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. This is Radiolab.

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.900
Today we have part two of a three part series that we're calling in the no,

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.310
no, as in no, we were inspired to do this, uh,

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.330
after hearing a set of stories on a show called the heart produced by Caitlin

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.070
press last week. We played excerpts of that series. And if you haven't heard,

6
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.420
uh, last week's episode,

7
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:25.250
I would encourage you to go back and listen because the, uh,

8
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.430
stories that Katelyn told, uh, which got some very intense, uh,

9
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.570
reactions from our listeners online all over the map, however you feel, I mean,

10
00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:38.571
those stories that she made are a very striking personal view of consent from

11
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:41.394
the inside.

12
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.060
Now it just so happens that Katelyn produced those stories in the spring of

13
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:48.990
2017, which is the spring,

14
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:53.100
just before all the accusations started hitting the news, um,

15
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.090
first against Harvey Weinstein and then congressmen like Al Franken,

16
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.130
actors like Kevin Spacey and then Comedians. And then in many cases,

17
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:03.000
the very people,

18
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:07.500
very men who were reporting about those stories and much of what made it into

19
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:09.060
the news was pretty clear cut,

20
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.080
like criminal cases or accusations of clear breaches of consent.

21
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:17.220
But then we started to hear about the cases that were harder,

22
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.720
not explicitly criminal, more nuanced.

23
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.690
And that gray zone, which Katelyn was, was, uh,

24
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.940
in many ways exploring in her piece. It occurred to us like,

25
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.210
this is a conversation we're all trying to have right now.

26
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.050
So what we started doing in the wake of listening to her stories was doing a

27
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:42.051
series of interviews of our own with people all over the map who are thinking

28
00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:44.430
and rethinking consent in interesting ways.

29
00:01:44.431 --> 00:01:46.020
We'll play a couple over the next two weeks,

30
00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:50.880
but we ran into one particular interview. Let's see

31
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.880
<v 1>if it's working. Katelyn, you there? Yes, I'm here. Hey, I did it. You did it.</v>

32
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.730
Did we

33
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.920
<v 0>not stop thinking about, in fact,</v>

34
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:02.400
it created a lot of really difficult conversations internally.

35
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.020
And uh,

36
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.730
so we just kind of decided why don't we play this thing relatively raw,

37
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.560
which we don't do very often.

38
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:14.100
But let's just put it out more or less how it happened and all of its flaws.

39
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.600
<v 1>Caitlin, Caitlin, can you hear Hannah? Yes, it's sal. It's Hannah.</v>

40
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.920
Hannah. Okay. Sorry. Yeah. Caitlin, could you hear it? Hona I'm speaking.

41
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:26.040
Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. Okay, sweet. Thanks for coming in,

42
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.930
both of you guys. Thank you. Really glad to be here. Okay. So, uh,

43
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.830
since I've already pronounced your name and correctly,

44
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.120
can you tell me who you are and how to say your name and what you do? Sure.

45
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.830
My name is Hannah Startland. I'm an independent consultant. I work on,

46
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.821
sorry,

47
00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:46.821
I'm an independent educational consultant and I specialize in educational crisis

48
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:48.310
management

49
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.970
<v 0>and we, uh,</v>

50
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.900
call upon him because she has a very particular vantage point on this whole set

51
00:02:52.901 --> 00:02:53.734
of questions.

52
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.920
<v 1>When I see a unfamiliar number from a distant area code on my phone,</v>

53
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.310
um, if I can, I pick that up and it happens quite regularly there.

54
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:05.220
I pick it up and I just hear sobbing, hmm,

55
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.660
that's a mom whose kid just got expelled. So that happens regularly,

56
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.740
like daily, weekly, more like once or twice a month.

57
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.270
Often the calls are coming from moms whose sons have been accused of some kind

58
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:20.560
of sexual misconduct.

59
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.010
I got my first two calls on that topic in January of 2014 and since then it's

60
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:30.120
grown and grown and grown. And about a third of my work now, um,

61
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.750
is students who are involved with a title nine in one way or another.

62
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.610
Title nine is a federal law that deals with, among other things, uh,

63
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.470
sexual harassment, sexual violence on college campuses.

64
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.490
What Hannah will do when she gets these calls is she'll work with these young

65
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:48.490
men who've been accused to get them back into school,

66
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.440
either the school they were in,

67
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.290
but more often it means transferring to a different school.

68
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.060
So families hire me to help their kids get into college or Grad school.

69
00:03:58.061 --> 00:03:58.894
Usually.

70
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.100
I think it is a good thing when people in general,

71
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.130
even people who may have done something very bad, um,

72
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.990
who want education can continue to get education.

73
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.950
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

74
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.240
<v 1>Um, as long as they're seeking it, honestly. But what if you,</v>

75
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.850
but what if you're then just deferring the problem to some other campus? I mean,

76
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.300
like, let's say there's a guy who, uh,

77
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.510
that's victimized somebody and then you help them get to another college where

78
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:27.130
maybe they do it again. Well, they,

79
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:29.050
they'd be in the community one way or another.

80
00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:33.850
And I think this is an area where I see a lot of problems with,

81
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.510
um, classism, uh,

82
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:40.800
and probably racism to where we're,

83
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.650
we're so concerned about that accused person being on another college campus.

84
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.440
If he isn't on a college campus, where do you think he's going to be?

85
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.240
Cause he's not going to jail. Hmm. Um, the students that we're talking about,

86
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.060
typically the police don't even get called, but if they do,

87
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:58.690
they come and see the evidence and say, this evidence is so thin.

88
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.340
You know, we're not, we're not even gonna impose charges. Um,

89
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.340
so say, you know, okay, well he's not going to college anymore.

90
00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:08.510
He's going to work at McDonald's.

91
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.120
And so if there's a risk to the fellow people at McDonald's,

92
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.900
then we just don't care because they're not the upper middle class white women

93
00:05:14.901 --> 00:05:18.260
who were actually worried about on the college campuses.

94
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.650
And I have misgivings about the ideas at the,

95
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.620
the college students are special need that community needs special attention

96
00:05:30.621 --> 00:05:32.710
that other young adults don't need. So you're,

97
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:36.110
I just so that I know that I have your point of view that I understand it.

98
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.400
It's that you don't,

99
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.240
it's not that you don't think that some people should be expelled sometimes.

100
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.440
Oh, sure. They show that. Yeah. Okay. But, um,

101
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.310
I feel very comfortable with the idea that people who want to continue their

102
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:04.661
education ought to be able to make their case for why they want to continue it.

103
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.340
What I do is help them talk about what happened.

104
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.490
So if you're interested in covering it up or hiding it,

105
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.190
there's no reason to hire me. Um,

106
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.510
I help you have that hard conversation or write that difficult essay about what

107
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:24.530
went wrong. Even if you feel you were wrongly accused,

108
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.680
you were railroaded by the school, um,

109
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.710
you better find unwise choices that you made selfish choices that you made.

110
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.770
There are not a lot of these cases where I think while you handled everything

111
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:40.940
perfectly, you didn't make any risk preferring choices.

112
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.210
There's nothing you could change to keep this from happening to you in the

113
00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:45.044
future.

114
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.260
You still have to tell a story about mistakes that you made and how you're

115
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:53.840
working to fix them. How does that go? I mean,

116
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:57.350
do you find that people will maintain that?

117
00:06:57.351 --> 00:07:00.980
Like will they sort of hold onto the idea that they did have consent even if the

118
00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:04.100
other person says that they didn't? Certainly,

119
00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:05.630
and I'm not trying to chase people,

120
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.430
I'm not necessarily trying to change their mind about whether they had consent

121
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.180
that, I mean they were there and I was not trusting. Do you see in a,

122
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.200
in a scenario where you have both sides of the story,

123
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.120
what's the usual difference? It depends.

124
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:27.650
There's a few cases where the stories just are incompatible. Um,

125
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:32.750
but there are, most of my cases,

126
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.090
the dispute is narrow.

127
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.940
Everybody agrees that the encounter was generally consensual,

128
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:47.350
but either the consent to all of it was withdrawn or uh,

129
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:48.200
you know,

130
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.200
according to the accuser or there was consents to ax a and B but not c and c

131
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:59.120
just happened before they knew it and there wasn't a conversation about it.

132
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.770
And um,

133
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.800
w the one party feels that c was a rape or that,

134
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.091
no, I agree.

135
00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:11.870
I acted like I wanted this the whole time and maybe even I said yes,

136
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.800
but in retrospect I was too drunk or high. Um,

137
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.570
and that that consent was no good.

138
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.960
It nullifies the consent at this point in the conversation we talked a little

139
00:08:20.961 --> 00:08:23.300
bit about like the different kinds of consent,

140
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:28.370
what works like affirmative consent, where it's about clear permission,

141
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.130
often verbal permission that can be withdrawn at any time,

142
00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:35.660
which Hannah says she is all 4000%. The question is if you don't do it,

143
00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:36.494
is it rape?

144
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:42.560
And that's the dichotomy that I object to or am a skeptic about, I should say.

145
00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:46.160
I mean if, if, again, if people can show me that this works and I'm interested,

146
00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:48.500
but when you say it, I guess that's the thing,

147
00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:52.930
like when you say if people can show me if this works, um,

148
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:57.030
can you sort of unpack what you mean by that? Like he let me just,

149
00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:01.260
it seems so clear to me that it does work. I don't know. So let me tell you,

150
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.990
let me tell you if my experience, so I'm just sort of curious.

151
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.460
Let me tell you a few stories. Um,

152
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.680
there's a couple that I can give more identifying information about because this

153
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.490
case is in litigation now.

154
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:15.090
And so that's on the public record and the fact that I'm involved in the cases

155
00:09:15.091 --> 00:09:19.320
on the public record, so I, I can say a few more things. So I had a student, um,

156
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.760
he in a girl wearing his room, um, after a party,

157
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:24.900
they didn't know each other well.

158
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.520
He touched her private parts and there was vaginal penetration with his fingers.

159
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:39.930
Both parties agree that he asked for and got affirmative verbal consent.

160
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.950
He said, do you like this? And she said yes. And she faked an orgasm.

161
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.430
Both port parties are telling the exact same story.

162
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.960
And he was found responsible for sexual assault. Cause she said,

163
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.890
I didn't mean it. I said yes, I was enjoying it. Um,

164
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.500
in order to get it over with faster. Um,

165
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.050
I wanted a graceful way to leave his room and I thought I'm making him think I

166
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:07.950
was having an orgasm would would help me get out of there more gracefully

167
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.920
without being rude. Um,

168
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:14.370
and he was suspended for two and a half years. I let you finish.

169
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.520
I'll let you finish and then I'll say what I think. I just, no, I mean,

170
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:23.250
so yeah, I mean that's, that's what I'm seeing in practice. You know,

171
00:10:23.251 --> 00:10:27.900
it's, it's other, other cases that I've seen, um,

172
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.480
is someone who basically the, the my, my student is a big black guy,

173
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.120
you know, well over six feet tall, a lot of muscles. He's an athlete. Um,

174
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:43.440
and it's undisputed that that uh,

175
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:47.700
he and the accuser were in her dorm room together to hook up.

176
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:49.350
Um,

177
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:54.350
they took off all their clothes and she touched his genitals and performed oral

178
00:10:57.541 --> 00:10:58.374
sex on him.

179
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:03.280
And she said that, um,

180
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:07.590
she did that because she was fearful once they were both naked.

181
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.490
Um, and she felt that

182
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.540
the situation was so overwhelming that she had to,

183
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.140
um, reach out and touch him and then reach out and use her mouth on him.

184
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:28.080
Um, and the, the school decided in that situation, um,

185
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:33.330
that the only thing that had gone wrong was that there wasn't a verbal

186
00:11:33.331 --> 00:11:34.164
confirmation.

187
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.490
And so if you go in somebody's dorm room,

188
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:43.491
you take and both of you take off your clothes and she touches you in places,

189
00:11:44.941 --> 00:11:47.070
your penis in her mouth when you're not speaking,

190
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:52.310
she has not conveyed consent. Hmm.

191
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:58.470
Which I think [inaudible] I think, yeah. Yeah. I guess from my,

192
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.630
<v 3>from my point of view, it's like the rules are,</v>

193
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.440
are set up in a way that, that kind of protect, um,

194
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.270
the person who feels violated.

195
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:10.580
<v 1>Like I, I guess to me,</v>

196
00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.390
I agree there's a different type of person who feels violated difference,

197
00:12:14.391 --> 00:12:16.350
which like, I mean, sorry. Oh, well,

198
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.700
we're not supposed to be concerned about who feels violated.

199
00:12:19.701 --> 00:12:22.550
We're supposed to be concerned about who was violated.

200
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:24.790
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

201
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.380
<v 1>Yeah. But I mean, I, I guess</v>

202
00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:32.090
<v 3>the person who was violated, I mean, if they feel violated,</v>

203
00:12:32.091 --> 00:12:35.180
then I would argue that they are, they were violated. So, you know,

204
00:12:35.181 --> 00:12:38.480
if they feel violated. I guess what I'm saying is that like,

205
00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:43.100
I think that having affirmative consent be a rule that's, that's,

206
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:48.000
that's followed and taken seriously when it comes to like legal stuff. It just,

207
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.860
it protects that ambiguity.

208
00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.090
People should go to jail for not getting the verbal. Yes.

209
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.180
Um, well, I mean, I talked about definitely complicated.

210
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.600
What I think it's complicated, but I think that it, it, it,

211
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:07.690
it makes it so that the person who was violated feels violated,

212
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:12.740
is the one who is always protected and who's the one who's always in the right.

213
00:13:12.741 --> 00:13:14.180
And I think that that's a good thing.

214
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.320
<v 1>Yeah. I don't agree with you about that. You know what I think?</v>

215
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:18.760
I don't think they're always in the room.

216
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.200
I don't think they're always in the right [inaudible]

217
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.870
<v 3>I don't think they're always in the right,</v>

218
00:13:22.871 --> 00:13:26.130
but I think that it's safer to assume that they're always in the right. Well,

219
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.590
you know, there's going to be a very small margin of people who are not,

220
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.910
but I feel like it's important to.

221
00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.730
<v 1>But how do we know? That's just my point of view. First of all,</v>

222
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:40.600
how do we know how small that merging is? I don't know how small it is.

223
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:45.380
I mean, I, I'm thinking to, um,

224
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.530
various various encounters that my students have had, for example, where, um,

225
00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:55.300
is they both agreed that they were having consensual intercourse and they both

226
00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:59.140
agree that the consent was withdrawn during the intercourse and that the

227
00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:03.370
intercourse stopped. The dispute is about how rapidly it stopped.

228
00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:10.770
Hmm. Um, and so, and, and there isn't,

229
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:16.280
you know, in that case, I, I just, I just hesitate to say,

230
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:21.030
and, and again, it's, it seems clear on paper that the absolutes of that, well,

231
00:14:21.031 --> 00:14:25.170
you control your body the second you convey, um,

232
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:29.940
for example, um, start to cry during sex. All right,

233
00:14:29.941 --> 00:14:31.050
well then, okay.

234
00:14:31.051 --> 00:14:35.760
I would assume non-verbally that this should stop or, you know,

235
00:14:35.761 --> 00:14:40.200
we should make sure, and it did stop, but, you know,

236
00:14:40.201 --> 00:14:44.790
did that take two seconds, five seconds, 30 seconds.

237
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:51.030
Um, and that from, from the, the moment of

238
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.550
<v 3>theirs, is it problem? The other problem is there's no, you know,</v>

239
00:14:55.551 --> 00:14:58.690
what should you reasonably be aware of. And,

240
00:14:58.691 --> 00:15:03.691
and I I'm very uncomfortable with the idea that person A's feelings determine

241
00:15:04.761 --> 00:15:07.610
whether person B's behavior was rape or not.

242
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.880
Because always calling it rape. I mean sometimes sexual assaults,

243
00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.190
it's called sexual assault, you know, sexual assault.

244
00:15:16.191 --> 00:15:20.720
I feel like that's a really important distinction that like the terms even

245
00:15:20.721 --> 00:15:23.990
sexual assault is not, it is not adequate, you know,

246
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:27.380
because there are so many different great gradations. Yeah, absolutely.

247
00:15:27.381 --> 00:15:31.850
I don't think, I don't, I don't think like, I don't think I personally I do,

248
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.960
I do think that if someone is,

249
00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:39.060
someone's feelings should determine whether person B has assaulted them.

250
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:40.611
You know,

251
00:15:40.611 --> 00:15:44.540
like I think even thinking about like when someone cries in the middle of sex,

252
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:48.800
you know, like talking about talking about like the is it, is it five seconds,

253
00:15:48.801 --> 00:15:50.480
is it 10 seconds, is it 30 seconds?

254
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:53.840
Like what are all the things that happened leading up to that moment?

255
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:57.110
Well cause he is, he disputes. He says,

256
00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.960
I stopped as soon as I realized she was crying. Yeah.

257
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.740
And she says that she says I was,

258
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:07.190
I was crying for like 25 seconds, let's say 30 seconds.

259
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:12.020
And so that period between when I started crying and when he realized I was

260
00:16:12.021 --> 00:16:14.930
crying, but he wouldn't, my says he realized he, but I feel like,

261
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:18.020
to me when I hear a story like that,

262
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.630
I think that there was actually a lot of other,

263
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.710
there were probably a lot of other things leading up to that moment that we're

264
00:16:24.711 --> 00:16:26.600
not perceived, you know,

265
00:16:26.601 --> 00:16:30.140
or that the reason why she's coming forward and saying that this was an assault,

266
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:33.530
this was a violation. There's probably a lot, there's a,

267
00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.580
a much an unseen architecture to, to that,

268
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:42.650
to that story. Um, that is really complicated I guess. Like,

269
00:16:42.651 --> 00:16:44.900
I don't think that someone would just come out and be like,

270
00:16:44.901 --> 00:16:47.960
I cried for 30 seconds and then, and you didn't, you didn't stop. Like,

271
00:16:47.961 --> 00:16:51.080
it's probably a lot. It goes, it runs much deeper than that.

272
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:55.820
There was something, there's something unnameable happening in that room.

273
00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:56.900
Um,

274
00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:01.900
and she sort of hinges that unnameable feeling of violation on this grain if

275
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:06.470
they feel seems trivial when you talk about it out loud. Um,

276
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.970
but she's trying to say something was not right here, you know. I agree.

277
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:15.740
Um, yeah, so I, I very much agreed with it. It's just, it's complicated.

278
00:17:15.741 --> 00:17:19.430
I'm sort of just trying to get into the complicated area of it. Right. Um,

279
00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:23.270
I think dairy, we agree on a whole lot that, um, uh,

280
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:27.410
I don't dispute at all. Um, I see even in,

281
00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.960
even in my cases where I have the most doubt about what happened, um,

282
00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:35.990
I don't dispute that the accuser feels violated. I think, I think that's true.

283
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.700
Um, they usually convince him. They usually convince feels violated.

284
00:17:40.701 --> 00:17:41.870
She is violated

285
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:47.990
because there's all kinds of reasons besides being sexually assaulted that a

286
00:17:47.991 --> 00:17:49.380
person might feel violated.

287
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:51.960
<v 1>Um, so, I mean, I'll, I'll,</v>

288
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:56.070
I'll talk about one instance for myself. Um,

289
00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:57.720
you know,

290
00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.470
w w the people who have broken my heart when I was in love with people.

291
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:07.770
Um, and, you know, there was a breakup where I got treated like dirt,

292
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.080
uh, when we were in love and like knew each other's families and all of that.

293
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.460
And then, you know,

294
00:18:14.461 --> 00:18:18.930
basically ghosted me and then dumped me an phone call 10 months in.

295
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.040
Um, I felt extremely violated.

296
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:28.200
I can't put into words how bad he made me feel. Um,

297
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:29.791
you know, and,

298
00:18:29.791 --> 00:18:34.791
and how it colored my memory of every interaction we'd had for 10 months and

299
00:18:36.871 --> 00:18:40.470
Christmas together with my family in Hawaii, you know, and,

300
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:45.060
and calling into question, you know, did, was he lying to me then?

301
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:52.410
Um, I just, I, I feel very violated by his actions. Um,

302
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.880
it's probably not a word I would have come up with. Um,

303
00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.270
but I feel unbelievably, you know,

304
00:19:00.271 --> 00:19:03.680
I'm happy and married now. It's all good. Um, you know, I,

305
00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.430
I should not have ended up with him. Um, but especially at the time,

306
00:19:08.431 --> 00:19:11.220
I mean that, that was an experience that permanently changed me.

307
00:19:11.221 --> 00:19:13.620
I'm not the same person I was before that hurt rake,

308
00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:19.110
and he didn't sexually assault me. You know, this, this,

309
00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.270
it was, it was awful. What he did.

310
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:25.070
And I,

311
00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:30.090
it just makes sense to me that people could be unbelievably deeply hurt by all

312
00:19:30.721 --> 00:19:33.420
kinds of behavior that isn't sexual assault.

313
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:37.160
<v 3>That I, I can see, I can see that. I can see, I can see,</v>

314
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:42.500
I can see that. But I, I guess I feel like, um, you know,

315
00:19:42.501 --> 00:19:45.890
what we're doing right now is working against history. You know, like,

316
00:19:45.891 --> 00:19:49.420
I think that we're trying to make progress on,

317
00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.480
on this issue of sexual assault and the much larger issue of the imbalance of

318
00:19:54.921 --> 00:19:58.910
power as it is distributed between the genders. Like,

319
00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:02.930
can you ever really as a woman, and this is,

320
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:05.510
I don't know if I fully agree with what I'm about to say, but it's just,

321
00:20:05.511 --> 00:20:09.980
I'm just posing it as a, as a philosophical question. Um,

322
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:11.360
you know, if you're,

323
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:15.650
if you're taught from birth to define your pleasure based on someone else and

324
00:20:15.651 --> 00:20:16.850
someone else's pleasure,

325
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:22.150
how can you even know what you want or don't want in those private moments,

326
00:20:22.251 --> 00:20:25.340
you know? And like, how do we restore that balance? You know,

327
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:29.650
<v 1>I think a lot of what you're describing is on a,</v>

328
00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:34.840
what I'm seeing as a general, as a generational divide, um,

329
00:20:34.841 --> 00:20:39.450
in, in feminism. I don't know how old you are. I'm 42. Yeah. I'm, I'm,

330
00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.360
I'm 30. Yeah. Yeah. Women who are my age and older,

331
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.200
um, I find,

332
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:52.270
I tend to agree with me and the women who are college age are in their twenties

333
00:20:53.801 --> 00:20:57.690
now often don't. And um, the disconnect stems,

334
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.850
I feel like when you were describing how,

335
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.880
because of societal pressures and training from birth and all that,

336
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.620
when the man was naked in my room,

337
00:21:08.621 --> 00:21:11.680
I could not do anything but give him a blow job.

338
00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:17.620
I could not say no. And I would say you did not say no.

339
00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:22.060
And there may be situations,

340
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:26.950
um, where we agree that this is a can't situation,

341
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.880
but I don't see it as a hostage for my feminism.

342
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.330
<v 3>Mm. That's just helpless there. She has no agency.</v>

343
00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.690
They put her in a pink dress and now she has to give a blow job. Yeah,

344
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:45.890
I understand that. And I think that's a really important point of view.

345
00:21:45.891 --> 00:21:48.510
But I also, I guess people have done research about that. The,

346
00:21:48.511 --> 00:21:53.511
the fact that like young girls define how good sex was based on how much they

347
00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.080
perceived the other person enjoying it and, and,

348
00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:02.010
and even something as simple as that creates a power dynamic. And I,

349
00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:06.260
I feel like I'm not really seeing the men and the men that I know,

350
00:22:06.261 --> 00:22:07.400
the young men that I know,

351
00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:12.520
I'm not seeing them understanding the power that they have that's really easy

352
00:22:12.531 --> 00:22:15.620
to, to, to abuse, you know, and like how do you fix that?

353
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:19.950
That's what it kind of all comes down to. And like there has to be there what,

354
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.510
there has to be some kind of consequences if we're going to see it change.

357
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:53.180
this conversation between Kaitlin [inaudible] and myself. Just a moment.

369
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:52.650
We're back with the second episode and a three part series that we're doing. Uh,

370
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.420
inspired by collaboration with Katelyn pressed.

371
00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:57.990
It's called in the know and a,

372
00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:00.310
we're going to jump back into the conversation that Kaitlin and I were having

373
00:24:00.311 --> 00:24:03.030
with Hanta Startland. But before we do a,

374
00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:06.800
I want to bring in some other voices cause I'm where you're sitting and with

375
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:11.380
purchase place cause that way I can just like swoop as we were working on this

376
00:24:11.381 --> 00:24:14.380
series a, I mean it really wasn't exploration for us.

377
00:24:14.381 --> 00:24:17.440
One of the things that happened along the way is we convene groups of college

378
00:24:17.441 --> 00:24:20.950
students in different spots across the country. If we,

379
00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:24.910
if there are groups of uh, college shakes, men and women. Uh, I was with a man,

380
00:24:24.911 --> 00:24:27.820
my colleagues, Becca Bressler and she, my only, I are with women.

381
00:24:27.821 --> 00:24:31.000
We're going to hear more from the women next week. Uh, the only play,

382
00:24:31.001 --> 00:24:34.840
which is a bit of the men because when Hannah and Caitlin and I were talking a,

383
00:24:34.841 --> 00:24:39.550
it called to mind something that I heard a lot in these conversations,

384
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:40.670
<v 8>you have to take a leap.</v>

385
00:24:40.671 --> 00:24:43.400
At some point you have to take it like you're talking to this person,

386
00:24:43.401 --> 00:24:46.600
you're making eye contact or whatever and like, yeah,

387
00:24:46.601 --> 00:24:48.260
you can ask like can I kiss you?

388
00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:53.650
And like they say yes but like at the same time sometimes you just go for it and

389
00:24:53.691 --> 00:24:58.691
like that's where it gets iffy because like whether like sacrificing that is

390
00:25:00.921 --> 00:25:05.921
what we need to do for no one to get raped or no one's getting raped in these

391
00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:09.440
non super malicious scenarios. Like,

392
00:25:09.441 --> 00:25:12.770
maybe what we have to give up is just you're looking at your eyes,

393
00:25:12.771 --> 00:25:16.310
the sun's rising, you're like, hello, would you like,

394
00:25:16.311 --> 00:25:19.880
can I record you on my cell phone of you saying you're down to make out right

395
00:25:19.881 --> 00:25:23.150
now? You know? I mean, and as I say, you know,

396
00:25:23.151 --> 00:25:26.360
that's something I guess I'm willing to give up if that's what's being asked and

397
00:25:26.361 --> 00:25:28.130
if that actually solves the issue.

398
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:33.350
But I just think that we're coming to a point where that might be the line,

399
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:34.330
<v 0>by the way, the, the,</v>

400
00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:37.550
the thing he's talking about that is actually an app that exists.

401
00:25:37.551 --> 00:25:39.200
We talked to the guy who made it, but what he,

402
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:43.340
what he and other guys were saying was that they're uneasy.

403
00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:47.870
They still feel somehow caught between those old gendered expectation that it's

404
00:25:47.871 --> 00:25:51.500
the man's job to pursue and a, the world that we're in now,

405
00:25:51.501 --> 00:25:55.730
which seems to not want that, but maybe not entirely, not,

406
00:25:55.731 --> 00:25:57.620
not want that. They're not sure.

407
00:25:57.621 --> 00:26:02.570
And a lot of them worry that maybe they've already crossed the line without

408
00:26:02.571 --> 00:26:03.280
knowing it.

409
00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.270
<v 8>It's always in the back of my mind,</v>

410
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.270
like I've hooked up with a girl that's like instigated it.

411
00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.550
Like I'm like while having sex,

412
00:26:10.551 --> 00:26:13.890
she decides that like she doesn't want to do like she was going to go home and

413
00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:16.580
gets up, please. Okay. You know like then what?

414
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:21.640
Then if if the next day she decides that or she realizes that they like,

415
00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.770
but she didn't want to do that. Maybe after the fact,

416
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.440
then it just be my truth versus hers.

417
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:30.800
I've definitely hooked up with people where they were very drunk.

418
00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.170
It was the first time we talked up, no one ever was like,

419
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.380
oh that was not okay or anything. But in all those situations,

420
00:26:36.381 --> 00:26:38.840
I guarantee based on myself,

421
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:40.970
I was drunker than the person I was hooking up with.

422
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:45.330
But because I'm a man that could be retrospectively,

423
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.850
that could have been sexual assault. You know? And I, and I,

424
00:26:48.851 --> 00:26:52.500
that's definitely the biggest question I've given myself post this thing is

425
00:26:52.501 --> 00:26:54.720
like, wow, could it even be claimed?

426
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.870
Like I don't think that I sexually assaulted someone at all.

427
00:26:57.871 --> 00:26:59.710
I mean a given that, you know,

428
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:03.660
one I asked her are you sure but you that isn't even enough cause let's say

429
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:08.520
alcohol, you know even if you get a vocal consent, if there's alcohol involved.

430
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.020
So I guess that's where it gets interesting.

431
00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.940
I mean not interesting not to make it cold,

432
00:27:11.941 --> 00:27:15.300
but yeah we would've to though even if even if the end of that you didn't make a

433
00:27:15.301 --> 00:27:18.780
mistake as someone's like that wasn't okay what you did yesterday or something.

434
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:21.490
Right. You say your side, I'd be like, Yo,

435
00:27:21.491 --> 00:27:24.040
I really need to understand that you don't like you learn like we don't have to

436
00:27:24.041 --> 00:27:28.570
be, I don't think like be free, like be a good person. I understand that.

437
00:27:28.571 --> 00:27:32.260
But if somebody says like you sexually assaulted me and if it's a situation like

438
00:27:32.261 --> 00:27:35.470
you're talking about where you both have been drunk and you say, I'm sorry,

439
00:27:35.471 --> 00:27:36.304
is that not,

440
00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:41.230
I would be scared to say that because it's here to say what,

441
00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.280
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

442
00:27:42.281 --> 00:27:45.070
Because that's like you're admitting you're guilty even if you don't think you

443
00:27:45.071 --> 00:27:47.650
are, if you try to engage in a conversation like that.

444
00:27:47.651 --> 00:27:50.680
So just maybe like you don't say, I'm sorry you say oh my God,

445
00:27:50.681 --> 00:27:54.130
like please explain to me like how I did that or like what happened cause I was

446
00:27:54.131 --> 00:27:57.700
too drunk to even remember or like something. Yeah it's its,

447
00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.070
it's not about being like a second

448
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.520
<v 0>and after, you know, after having, after,</v>

449
00:28:02.521 --> 00:28:05.250
after listening to these guys and then having this conversation with Katelyn and

450
00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:06.443
Kauna. I mean for,

451
00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:10.500
for one the things that they were afraid of were exactly the things that we were

452
00:28:10.501 --> 00:28:11.160
talking about.

453
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:15.570
In two I started to think about the fear that sort of ambient fear that was

454
00:28:15.571 --> 00:28:18.660
always in the room in it's sort of a different way. It couldn't,

455
00:28:18.661 --> 00:28:23.100
you argue there's something useful about the fear because that fear

456
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.570
might push these guys to address exactly what Katelyn was just saying.

457
00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:31.620
It might push the guys to, you know what I mean? What, what, what I,

458
00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:34.380
what I hear over and over again when I talk to him when I talked to students is

459
00:28:34.381 --> 00:28:36.840
that the women in, in, in a,

460
00:28:36.841 --> 00:28:40.830
in a sexual encounter are thinking about 12 things and the guys are thinking

461
00:28:40.831 --> 00:28:43.170
about one thing, which is themselves, right? They're just,

462
00:28:43.171 --> 00:28:45.660
they're not reading the room. They're not reading their partner.

463
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:48.090
What's gonna change that if not fear,

464
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.950
like the fear that these guys feel right now could actually make them start to

465
00:28:52.951 --> 00:28:55.890
pay attention. Make us, I should say start to pay attention.

466
00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:58.130
<v 1>Yes. It might.</v>

467
00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:03.460
I certainly think of my essay writing support as a form of education,

468
00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:10.460
coaching, how a student's should handle a tough situation.

469
00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:11.270
Um,

470
00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:16.270
I'm not sure that making the consequence really bad is what makes it more likely

471
00:29:19.911 --> 00:29:21.440
that the behavior will change.

472
00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:26.780
But I would love to see, uh,

473
00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:31.490
young men encouraged to go through the kind of,

474
00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:32.420
um,

475
00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:37.420
analysis of their actions that a mind do with me.

476
00:29:37.791 --> 00:29:40.910
And, and it's, I think it's a really positive process for them. And,

477
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.010
and I see what looks to me like greater insight.

478
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:49.290
<v 0>Hmm. Can I can, I want to bring it back to the moment itself,</v>

479
00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:53.280
because a lot of what we're talking about on a macro level,

480
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:55.150
<v 4>okay.</v>

481
00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:58.790
<v 0>Uh, still has to be negotiated in these moments. Right? And you've talked about,</v>

482
00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:03.760
um, the idea of, of we need a reasonableness standard for,

483
00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:07.550
for the consensual moment. So what does that mean to you?

484
00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.490
<v 1>So to me it means that, um,</v>

485
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.233
<v 4>okay,</v>

486
00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:17.710
<v 1>communication needs to be in a shared language. You know, if,</v>

487
00:30:17.711 --> 00:30:21.520
if someone says to me in Russian, that doesn't feel good,

488
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:24.250
I just don't speak that.

489
00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:29.290
So is it reasonable to expect me to understand, um,

490
00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:33.790
what this person was conveying in a language that I don't speak? Um,

491
00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:37.020
like I would consider crying to be a universal language. Now, if,

492
00:30:37.021 --> 00:30:41.740
if it's dark and you're not touching the person's face, whatever,

493
00:30:41.741 --> 00:30:45.790
you might not realize immediately that they are,

494
00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:51.970
um, crying without, you know, it's not wow. Walk, type, crying. Um, it's just,

495
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.770
it's tears and, and, and emotion and clenched throat and all that. Um,

496
00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:02.460
how rapidly is it reasonable to expect that you perceive that communication,

497
00:31:03.431 --> 00:31:07.330
which is communication? And if you could see the person's face,

498
00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:11.350
and I'd say it's a very unambiguous communication. Um,

499
00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.490
is it reasonable to think it might take you a minute

500
00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:19.060
to, to realize that the,

501
00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:23.780
this my partner's feelings are totally changed. So there's,

502
00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:26.860
there's a spectrum between saying no, no, no,

503
00:31:26.861 --> 00:31:29.620
stop and expecting somebody to read your mind, right?

504
00:31:29.621 --> 00:31:33.970
That there's a million different ways to convey that with different levels of

505
00:31:33.971 --> 00:31:37.000
urgency and clarity. And I just think we should,

506
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:42.030
we should take into account what can we reasonably expect him in this scenario

507
00:31:43.091 --> 00:31:46.000
to realize about her changed frame of mind.

508
00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:47.963
<v 0>Caitlin, what do you think?</v>

509
00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:49.241
<v 3>For me,</v>

510
00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:52.750
I think a step forward is just being aware of the power dynamics that are

511
00:31:52.751 --> 00:31:57.310
happening in sex. Talking about them explicitly, understanding what they are,

512
00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.990
understanding the ways that they're fun, the ways that they're pleasurable and,

513
00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.830
and being really open about those things.

514
00:32:05.831 --> 00:32:09.970
And I think that like it all, it all comes back to communication.

515
00:32:09.971 --> 00:32:12.700
I mean like I really liked what you said, Hannah, about the,

516
00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:16.690
about the languages, you know, figuring out how to speak each other's languages,

517
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:19.270
figuring out trust. Um,

518
00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.470
and also just like having there be less of a stigma around conversations,

519
00:32:23.471 --> 00:32:27.910
explicit, open, totally shameless conversations about sexuality,

520
00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:33.340
um, would bring us forward and in, in massive, massive leaps around this stuff.

521
00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:35.410
And also just that like that. Like, I mean,

522
00:32:35.411 --> 00:32:39.320
I think the thing that I'm not seeing that I wish I did see was just giving a

523
00:32:39.321 --> 00:32:39.980
shit, you

524
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.210
<v 0>know, like Karen, like having had it, like, you know, when somebody says, Hey,</v>

525
00:32:44.211 --> 00:32:48.620
that, that experience sucked for me. Having the other person be like, wow,

526
00:32:48.621 --> 00:32:51.620
let's talk about it. Are you okay? You know, it's like,

527
00:32:51.621 --> 00:32:54.110
I feel like so many situations would be, would be,

528
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.200
would be solved if that was the dynamic as opposed to,

529
00:32:57.201 --> 00:33:01.890
what are you talking about? Like, um, the gas, lighting, all that stuff. Anyway,

530
00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.040
that's my list. Yeah.

531
00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:08.940
<v 1>The work I do with some of the students. Um, when I say,</v>

532
00:33:08.941 --> 00:33:13.680
so what do you regret? Um, and sometimes they're not sure. They were like,

533
00:33:13.681 --> 00:33:18.090
I really didn't attack her. And I said, but do you regret?

534
00:33:18.091 --> 00:33:22.110
Is it ever your goal to get into your bed with someone and have them walking

535
00:33:22.111 --> 00:33:25.530
away going, Oh, I'm glad that's over. And the guys are like, no,

536
00:33:25.531 --> 00:33:26.820
I don't want that. And I was like,

537
00:33:26.821 --> 00:33:31.320
well that's what you got and we can dispute.

538
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:36.000
We can dispute whether it was an assault or not. It is objective Lee,

539
00:33:36.001 --> 00:33:39.150
the case that this person had a bad experience with you.

540
00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:44.340
Everybody agrees on that and if that wasn't what you wanted to happen,

541
00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.400
then you probably have regret about that.

542
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:49.770
I should have done something differently. So it didn't come out that way.

543
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:53.010
I'm not telling them what they ought to want sexually,

544
00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:57.900
but I do tell them to consider what they want sexually.

545
00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.620
It is, it is not a, I want to preface this by saying,

546
00:34:01.621 --> 00:34:04.770
I'm not saying that the training of men and women is symmetrical. It's not.

547
00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:10.280
But that some of them may may realize some of the men may realize,

548
00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:14.490
you know what, I was told that men are supposed to like any,

549
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:17.160
any kind of sexual contact we can get from anyone anywhere.

550
00:34:17.161 --> 00:34:18.390
We're supposed to be happy about that.

551
00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:23.430
And is that actually what I want or is that what people expect me to want?

552
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:28.560
And maybe I would prefer more of a, you know, loving,

553
00:34:28.561 --> 00:34:30.900
gentle, a kind of relationship.

554
00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:36.030
Maybe I'm a man and not that kind of model would actually work better for me

555
00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:37.980
than this conquest model.

556
00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.170
<v 0>And it's interesting cause I mean what I hear a lot coming out of the me too</v>

557
00:34:41.171 --> 00:34:42.290
movement is that a,

558
00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:47.050
I hear a lot of women saying guys you need to do the work. Okay.

559
00:34:47.051 --> 00:34:50.950
Like this is, this is largely your work to do right now. Um,

560
00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:56.880
and I hadn't expected to hear you talking about what you do as in subsets being

561
00:34:58.391 --> 00:34:59.710
a part of that. Like you are actually,

562
00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:03.850
it seems involved in some of the guys doing the work.

563
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:07.870
I mean like how to do the work is it's own sort of can of worms like who we are,

564
00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.270
which is something we haven't really talked too much about.

565
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:15.310
But it is interesting to hear that I wasn't expecting that to be the case.

566
00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:15.980
Like it's

567
00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:18.450
<v 1>that it's not necessarily my goal,</v>

568
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.440
but it may be necessary in order to achieve my goal,

569
00:35:22.441 --> 00:35:24.570
which is to help you advocate for your education.

570
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:30.000
You can't do that effectively unless you've been thoughtful about your past.

571
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:33.360
Hmm. Um, and my,

572
00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:37.140
my thesis is grey help the kids see the gray

573
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:42.630
and you know, this is, this is not a binary world we live in,

574
00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:47.640
in terms of gender, in terms of communication. Uh, and,

575
00:35:47.641 --> 00:35:52.620
and to some extent I feel like we have to work with the complexity of what's in

576
00:35:52.621 --> 00:35:56.460
front of us and even if we wish it were black and white and that would make our

577
00:35:56.461 --> 00:36:01.230
job a lot easier. Yeah. Caitlin, any final thoughts?

578
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.870
Hey Man. No, I don't think so. I guess.

579
00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:11.210
Um, yeah, this has been really great and Combo. Loved it.

580
00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.073
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

581
00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.073
<v 7>okay.</v>

582
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:41.850
<v 6>You want to think Caitlyn crest and haunted Dotlan for sitting down to talk a</v>

583
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:47.110
few notes before we close. If you have experienced sexual assault,

584
00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:51.610
there are resources out there to support you and the national sexual assault

585
00:36:51.611 --> 00:36:53.950
hotline at 1-800-SIX-FIVE, six.

586
00:36:53.951 --> 00:36:58.951
Hope that is (800) 656-4673 can provide support and connect you to resources in

587
00:37:01.631 --> 00:37:05.500
your local area. And also, one thing I do want to add

588
00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.590
is that this conversation,

589
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:11.830
the reason we aired it without a ton of edits and amendments,

590
00:37:11.831 --> 00:37:15.970
is that this was not meant to be a comprehensive take on anything.

591
00:37:15.971 --> 00:37:19.330
This is one small piece of a Muslim larger conversation. If anything,

592
00:37:19.331 --> 00:37:24.331
this was simply an attempt to hold a space for that continuing conversation

593
00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:26.920
space where we can talk about this stuff,

594
00:37:26.921 --> 00:37:30.280
which we're going to continue to do next week and next week we'll end up in a

595
00:37:30.281 --> 00:37:34.870
place where that conversation happens very explicitly and very differently.

596
00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.080
For better or worse. In this episode,

597
00:37:38.081 --> 00:37:43.081
we had production help from Rachel Q sick research and reporting help from Becca

598
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.900
Bressler and Shimon [inaudible]. I'm Jad Abumrad. Thanks for listening.
