The Joe Rogan experience.
It's tricky.

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.210
If you find a thing,

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.570
they'll like works and then people like you should really concentrate on that.

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.000
I can remember Jamie Masada gave a friend of mine,
uh,

5
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:13.860
advice once way back in the day.
He's like,

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.300
you should be generation x guy when you go on stage,
you should be,

7
00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:23.301
I'm from generation x every time you'll know like my generation,

8
00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:26.220
generation x think this and talk like that.

9
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.380
But he was giving them advice and I was like,
listen to me.

10
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.640
Don't listen to that as Jimmy massage ever given good advice.
I don't know.

11
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.480
As Tiffany Haddish,
she's still mad.
He manages it.
Right.

12
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:39.000
So he's doing something right.
He's manages,
sir.
Yeah.

13
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.580
Like recently I actually fired everybody.
Maybe she fired him too.
Yeah.

14
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.750
I don't know.
She's a wild woman.
She can do whatever the fuck she wants now.

15
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.470
You know?
But you know,
I'm so happy for her.

16
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.290
I knew her when the shit wasn't going well.
You know?

17
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.030
She's always been wild though.
She's so while person it seems like.
Yeah.

18
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.770
In a good way.
Like,
yeah.
Yeah.

19
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.470
She's one of the two people that I saw like onstage.
It was like,
oh,

20
00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:06.660
you're going to be a star.
Yeah.
Like I didn't know anything about her,

21
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:07.141
but I was just like,

22
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:11.580
you just start wasn't when she was creeping into the microphone.
No,
no,

23
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.730
it was not that.
Not that I've ever seen her do that.
No.
Dude,

24
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.700
she can make the most ungodly sounds with her vagina.
Like for real?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

25
00:01:19.701 --> 00:01:21.120
Yeah.
She takes the microphone.

26
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.770
She puts it on her pussy and goes like she knows how to do it.

27
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.580
She has,

28
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.430
apparently she has an ability to make a noise with a vagina on cue.
Thanks.

29
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.060
I'm sure glad I did go before her.
How?
But if I had to follow that,

30
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:40.410
I'd be furious in front of six people.
Yeah.
Can I get a new mic?

31
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.920
Yeah.
I followed her before.
I didn't even think about it.
I probably should have,

32
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.850
you know,
I figure like the genes or filter enough.
Yeah.
You hope so.

33
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.550
I hope you know.
Still it's not ideal.
Yeah.
You like that type of person,

34
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.930
like that wild personality that like a garlic has that has like,

35
00:01:57.931 --> 00:02:02.610
what the fuck else could she have done other than stand up.
I don't know.

36
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.190
But there's a lot of those people out there that never find stand up.
Oh Shit.

37
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.860
Then life just becomes chaos.
Like the crazy person at the office.
Yeah.
You know,

38
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.590
it's just stuck there and then you know,

39
00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:14.610
you get fired from enough of those jobs where you can't even get that office job

40
00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:17.760
anymore because you know the word gets out.
Oh yeah,
don't hire Tiffany.

41
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.540
That crazy bitch.
She's never going to be there.
And when she is there,

42
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.980
she's gonna Queef into the fucking loud speaker.
Yeah,
yeah,

43
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.260
yeah.
This I wish,
I mean,
part of me says no,

44
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.740
I don't wish that there was like some sort of an organized program to get into

45
00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:37.860
comedy because figuring it out,
I figured it out.
You figured it out.

46
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.730
All of us did.
But then part of me says,
man,
there's so many kids out there.

47
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.880
There's probably a 16 year old kid right now who sees the hypocrisy in all the

48
00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:51.900
things that these adults are doing and he fucking hates class and he's sitting

49
00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:53.400
there right now going nuts.

50
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:58.020
Or there's a girl who's feeling the same way about all our stupid friends and

51
00:02:58.021 --> 00:03:01.300
her mom and all these fucking people that want her to be a certain way.

52
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.390
And she's like,
Jesus Christ,
I gotta get the fuck away from these people.

53
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.070
And she makes her friends laugh.
But nobody ever tells her,
hey listen to me,

54
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.950
you could do this.
You could talk shit about things.

55
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.900
Like you can be a really funny comedian.

56
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.250
Like you've got to figure out a way to do that.
Nobody does that.
Like you.

57
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.390
It's so the,
the number of people that have the,

58
00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:24.370
but like how many people have you ever met in your life that had the potential

59
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:27.550
to be a comic but never did it?
Like we are around them.
Me Like,
damn,

60
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:30.610
this guy's funny.
Can I a comment?
Five or six,
you know,

61
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:31.670
there are people who are like as

62
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.750
<v 1>funny as me in college who just went on and got jobs and I got funnier,</v>

63
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.000
you know,
like that.
I knew people like that are people.

64
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.700
One of the funniest guys I've ever met in my life was like a,

65
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.510
was like an executive producers Pa,
but he was so goddamn funny.

66
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:47.680
I couldn't believe it,
but he like,

67
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.290
I don't think it would have translated to the stage.
There's something like,

68
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.320
there's something you have to figure out in yourself to become a good community

69
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.850
in.
If you're the funniest guy in the world.
Yes.
You know,
it's a different,

70
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.110
it's a different muscle.

71
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.580
<v 2>Okay.</v>
