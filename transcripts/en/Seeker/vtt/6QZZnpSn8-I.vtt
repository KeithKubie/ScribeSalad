00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.170
Guys…

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.170
I know this is going to sound like I'm about
to get a case of the munchies… but… what

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.850
is the universe?

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.350
Dude...

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.059
Hello there humble viewers, Trace here for
DNews.

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.630
James Cameron said, "Science is curiosity
acted upon."

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.680
Scientists all over the world, throughout
history, have attempted to answer what is

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.539
this place we're all living in!

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.210
So, with the help of Smithsonian.com, I pulled
them together in one big trippy universe explainer.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.500
It all started with the Big Bang theory.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.051
This theory says the universe was densely
packed, smaller than the head of a pin, and

00:00:36.051 --> 00:00:39.460
expanded by 100 trillion trillion times in
a tiny fraction of a second.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.170
Since then, scientists figured the universe
was constantly expanding, but didn't have

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.109
direct evidence until earlier this year when
cosmologists detected ripples in the cosmic

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.209
background radiation left behind by that event.

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:57.670
Those ripples, if they can be independently
verified, may prove that expansion expansion!

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.089
Assuming that is all correct, and that IS
how the universe got started, we're still

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.259
not answering WHAT THIS IS, MAN.

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.450
One theory says our universe was born in an
unstable false vacuum in spacetime.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.570
Think of it this way, IF the universe expanded
100 trillion trillion times in a fraction

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.640
of a second, what caused it to eventually
slow?

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.360
Some physicists believe it was our universe
impacting neighboring ones, like bubbles in

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.810
foam, but instead of air inside, each one
is a universe…

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.040
This is called the multiverse theory, and
it COULD be proven IF they could spot where

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.979
WE are touching another universe.

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.080
Scientists looking at the light left over
from the big bang know there's an odd "cold

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.659
spot" in the sky -- perhaps that's where our
bubble is touching the neighbor's?

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.859
Of course it could also be data error...

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:49.070
Researchers at the University of California
Santa Cruz are looking for more evidence.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.520
Another theory says we're living inside a
computer simulation.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.859
Basically, the paper, written in 2002, says
that if some future-race of humans want to

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.170
learn about their past, they'll probably use
their massive computer power to simulate the

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.979
entirety of their evolution, history, and
culture to observe how they came to be.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.060
Given that so few races will ever achieve
this level of technology, we are probably

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.730
being simulated.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.620
To test this, physicists at the University
of Washington designed an experiment to test

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.080
the boundaries of this simulation using quantum
physics.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.470
Basically, they're saying the computer is
only simulating the things it NEEDS to simulate.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.629
Like, if a tree falls in the woods, and no
one's around, the simulation wouldn't have

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:30.920
it make sound...

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.510
There IS a problem in quantum physics, where
particles’ locations cannot be determined

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.980
until they're observed… does this reveal
we're all a simulation?!

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.980
MAYBE!!

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.980
I dunno.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.030
And recently, Ian O'Neill was here and we
talked about how the universe could be a hologram.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.400
They're testing it right now.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.980
If we occupy three dimensional space, and
time is the fourth dimension -- then it stands

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.450
to reason that it's made of something.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.630
Physicists crunched the math and determined
if the universe is a hologram, then we might

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.329
be "printed" on the fabric of spacetime, and
the pixels of that printing might be detectable…

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.930
They designed an experiment and they're looking
for these pixels which are a hundred billion

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.790
billion times smaller than a proton.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.730
IS this the truth?

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.730
The scientists are looking now…

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.790
Our universe is a wondrous thing, and we're
happy to have it, obviously, but WHAT it is

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.209
and how it works is the study of some of the
greatest minds of humankind.

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.260
What do YOU think?

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.290
Which of these three theories is your favorite?

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.360
What would you do if we found out one was
true?!

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.860
Do you think the world would freak?

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.599
If it did, you could hear about it over on
TestTube, where Tara and I cover current events,

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.740
politics, and how these things affect YOU
and us.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.579
It's a really awesome show, I love doing it,
and I'd love it if you checked it out.

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:48.760
There's a link in the description OR YOU CAN

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.300
the U.S. can still call itself a wealthy nation.

But, back to the universe, you've got an opinion,
and conveniently, we've got a place where

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.629
you can LEAVE your opinion.

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:02.629
