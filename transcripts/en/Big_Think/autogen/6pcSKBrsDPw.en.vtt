this non conscious matter and then

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890
this non conscious matter and then
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.799
this non conscious matter and then
there's this thing called consciousness

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809
there's this thing called consciousness
 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.620
there's this thing called consciousness
which is attached to some matter and not

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630
which is attached to some matter and not
 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.289
which is attached to some matter and not
to others now pen psychism to me is not

even that interesting it's almost

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710
even that interesting it's almost
 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.370
even that interesting it's almost
obvious it's just the foundation in the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380
obvious it's just the foundation in the
 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.230
obvious it's just the foundation in the
beginning for thinking about

beginning for thinking about
consciousness because then you have

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799
consciousness because then you have
 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.460
consciousness because then you have
interesting questions like you know why

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470
interesting questions like you know why
 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.590

is the consciousness associate with my

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600
is the consciousness associate with my
 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.060
is the consciousness associate with my
brain so much more you know

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070
brain so much more you know
 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.670
brain so much more you know
self-reflective and you know dynamic and

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680
self-reflective and you know dynamic and
 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.760
self-reflective and you know dynamic and
in some sense is intense then say the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
in some sense is intense then say the
 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.380
in some sense is intense then say the
consciousness is associated with my hat

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390
consciousness is associated with my hat
 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.350
consciousness is associated with my hat
all right I mean that the Hatun it's a

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360
all right I mean that the Hatun it's a
 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.789
all right I mean that the Hatun it's a
cool high that may be it may be more

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799
cool high that may be it may be more
 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.410
cool high that may be it may be more
conscious than the average hat but I

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420
conscious than the average hat but I
 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.499
conscious than the average hat but I
mean in in the end the brain has these

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509
mean in in the end the brain has these
 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.569
mean in in the end the brain has these
complex feedback loops the brain can

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579
complex feedback loops the brain can
 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.149
complex feedback loops the brain can
model itself the brain responds very

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159
model itself the brain responds very
 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.830
model itself the brain responds very
differently to slightly different

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840
differently to slightly different
 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.740
differently to slightly different
stimuli coming in and many properties of

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750
stimuli coming in and many properties of
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.039
stimuli coming in and many properties of
the brain seem associated with the you

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049
the brain seem associated with the you
 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.779
the brain seem associated with the you
know the more powerful and dynamic

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789
know the more powerful and dynamic
 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.760
know the more powerful and dynamic
states of consciousness that it has

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770
states of consciousness that it has
 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.340
states of consciousness that it has
relative to other things so if you

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350
relative to other things so if you
 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.679
relative to other things so if you
accept pen psychism that everything is

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689
accept pen psychism that everything is
 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.600
accept pen psychism that everything is
imbued some out with an element of

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610
imbued some out with an element of
 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.940
imbued some out with an element of
consciousness you know some things can

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950
consciousness you know some things can
 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.740
consciousness you know some things can
still be more conscious than others and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750
still be more conscious than others and
 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.460
still be more conscious than others and
some things are differently conscious

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470
some things are differently conscious
 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.230
some things are differently conscious
there's and then that that's where

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240
there's and then that that's where
 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.090
there's and then that that's where
things get interesting right when you

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100
things get interesting right when you
 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.960
things get interesting right when you
talk about AI so I would imagine if I

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970
talk about AI so I would imagine if I
 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.670
talk about AI so I would imagine if I
were able to you know tap a wire into my

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680
were able to you know tap a wire into my
 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.980
were able to you know tap a wire into my
brain or Wi-Fi connection into my brain

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990
brain or Wi-Fi connection into my brain
 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.310
brain or Wi-Fi connection into my brain
and why are my brain into your brain

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320
and why are my brain into your brain
 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.560
and why are my brain into your brain
then as I increase the bandwidth of that

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570
then as I increase the bandwidth of that
 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.630
then as I increase the bandwidth of that
wire between my brain in your brain I

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640
wire between my brain in your brain I

would feel your mind they're like on the
 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.900
would feel your mind they're like on the
fringe of my mind like almost as if we

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910
fringe of my mind like almost as if we
 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.030

wired it into my hat like I might I

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820
wired it into my hat like I might I
 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.810
wired it into my hat like I might I
might feel what it is to be a hat but I

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820
might feel what it is to be a hat but I
 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.000
