00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.257
So in understanding our customer segments,

00:00:03.257 --> 00:00:06.158
it was really helpful to pictures up and as

00:00:06.158 --> 00:00:10.175
we build an archetype of who our three potential

00:00:10.175 --> 00:00:12.909
customer segments are. The first one we

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:15.624
called Gasol, the next one we called Junior,

00:00:15.624 --> 00:00:17.947
and then the third we called Becky. And

00:00:17.947 --> 00:00:20.142
we talked about their age, their income,

00:00:20.142 --> 00:00:22.072
their demographics. Whether they were

00:00:22.072 --> 00:00:24.039
buyer, or whether they were – they were

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.657
wearing the jersey as a social statement or

00:00:26.657 --> 00:00:29.123
whether they were actually a social sports viewer.

00:00:29.123 --> 00:00:31.304
What kind of fan type were they Avid,

00:00:31.304 --> 00:00:33.878
In-Season, Casual. What kind of class were

00:00:33.878 --> 00:00:36.542
they? Were they upper class and could

00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:37.534
they afford anything? Or were they

00:00:37.534 --> 00:00:38.908
middleclass or could they barely – they

00:00:38.908 --> 00:00:41.424
don’t even have a credit card. What

00:00:41.424 --> 00:00:43.823
was their Facebook status, and more

00:00:43.823 --> 00:00:45.641
importantly, what kind of rental type

00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:47.441
would they like. And it turned out that

00:00:47.441 --> 00:00:50.158
it was really helpful to kind of understand

00:00:50.158 --> 00:00:52.707
our pricing model and our revenue streams.

00:00:52.707 --> 00:00:56.231
So archetypes really helped us understand

00:00:56.231 --> 00:00:58.457
our customers, they value prop, the

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:01.628
revenue and some of our pricing tactics.
