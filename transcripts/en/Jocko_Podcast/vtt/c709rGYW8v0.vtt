1
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.730
Move on,
straight up,
move on.

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:06.803
Forget them.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.210
They are lying and they are untrustworthy.

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.950
So move on.
Now sometimes this can be hard,

5
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:20.220
especially if they've somehow tied themselves into your life.

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.230
Especially like for instance,

7
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.450
you get the kids involved in a divorce scenario,
you can't move on,

8
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.030
but you have to mentally move on.

9
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:34.890
You have to emotionally detach from that human,

10
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.190
and that's hard to do because obviously they were someone that you trusted be.

11
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.140
And the reason I know that you trusted them is because they got to a point where

12
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:48.810
they were able to be true your and destroy you.

13
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.490
So they they,
it's hard,

14
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.670
but the fact that they trust that you trusted them,

15
00:00:56.671 --> 00:00:58.740
the fact that you had that relationship,

16
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.640
that's even more reason to walk away.

17
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:05.160
It's even more reason to move on.

18
00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:08.130
You've got to see them for

19
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.530
what they are.
And this is an important piece right here.

20
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.460
This is an important cause.

21
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:19.461
This is something I learned as a young lad out there in the world.

22
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.010
That person is not who you thought they were,

23
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.750
right?
They are not who you thought they were.

24
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.780
The idea that this person was a trustworthy,

25
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.570
faithful companion is not true.
It is not true.

26
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.240
That person does not exist.

27
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.750
They didn't exist and they don't exist.
It was in your head.

28
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.410
It was in your head that this person was trustworthy and you the,

29
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:55.510
they were everything you wanted them to be and they were faithful command.

30
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.410
That is a lie.
They are not.
That person

31
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.500
may have proved it.
They've proved it by their actions,

32
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.090
so move on and at the risk of sounding callous,

33
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.830
get over it.
Get over it.

34
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.020
Do not dwell.
Do not dwell on to not dwell on,

35
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.110
on on what it was and don't dwell on what it could have been you who you are.

36
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.260
When guys go through bad breakups,
you know it's,
I just thought we were going to,

37
00:02:32.261 --> 00:02:36.900
it's like,
no,
don't dwell on that.
Deal with what it is right now,

38
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.370
what that person is.

39
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.580
Deal with reality except reality and be be thankful for reality.

40
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.650
Be Thankful that you were able to learn before you invested more into this

41
00:02:49.651 --> 00:02:51.260
person.
Be Be.

42
00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:55.530
Be Thankful that you found out when you did that this person was a liar,

43
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.190
that this person was unfaithful,
is untrustworthy.
Be Thankful

44
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.230
that you know it and you know it now instead of later.

45
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.270
And you know what else is going to make it a lot easier to get over these

46
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:12.010
situations is recognize that there's plenty of people out there in the world

47
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:16.210
that are trustworthy and there are faithful good people.
They're out there.

48
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.800
Go find one of them.

49
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.843
<v 1>But</v>

50
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.510
<v 0>don't think that that person that you had was the only one in the world.</v>

51
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:29.290
They're not.
And you know what if that sometimes,

52
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.670
sometimes people have a hard time making that trust because they're so caught up

53
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:36.250
and they,
they,
they don't want to meet someone else right away.
That's fine.

54
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.810
Start with yourself,
right?
Rely on yourself.
Trust yourself.
Because we,

55
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.340
when,
when someone breaks our trust,
we,

56
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.450
we questioned ourselves too.
Like we think are my judgments bad.

57
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.650
I'm not a good judge of human character cause I totally put my faith in this

58
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:56.260
person and look what they did to me.
So now we don't trust our,

59
00:03:56.261 --> 00:03:58.780
so you've got to build that trust up.

60
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.990
You've got to build that trust up back again with yourself.
How do you do that?

61
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.000
Read
right?
Learn,

62
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.090
workout,
be alone.
It's okay to be alone.

63
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.010
Some people get freaked out when they're alone.
It's okay to be alone.
It's okay.

64
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.880
It's okay to be alone.
There's no big deal.
Enjoy it.

65
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.460
Do something productive and build that trust up in yourself.
You know,

66
00:04:26.461 --> 00:04:28.020
look back at a situation and learn from it.

67
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.360
We do that and I'll post operational debrief.
Oh,

68
00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:33.810
you've put too much trust in somebody.
Cool.
They broke your heart.
All right,

69
00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:36.690
Roger that.
Let's see,
what would the steps,
what should I have recognized?

70
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.930
How many times did I say,
well,
you know,
they didn't call me,

71
00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:43.220
but it's probably just because their phone was out of battery.
No.

72
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.000
Once your phone runs out of battery once,
okay,
you don't let it happen again,

73
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.660
right?

74
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.960
So you start seeing those red flags so you the mistakes that you made and then

75
00:04:51.961 --> 00:04:56.280
look for them next time around because you deal with people all the time that

76
00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.990
they made mistakes.
The first run,
they go back and they make the same mistakes.

77
00:05:00.991 --> 00:05:03.270
The second run,
they go back and make the same mistakes.
The third run,

78
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.930
that's when you've got to start blaming yourself on your situation.

79
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.030
That's why,
that's why I said you got to like build a relationship with yourself.

80
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.900
You've got to learn yourself.
You've got to trust,
got to learn to trust yourself.

81
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.410
So spend some time doing that.
And

82
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.120
then when you go back and you start dealing with people,
because that's what,

83
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.270
that's what you got to watch out for,
is that you become a hardened criminal.

84
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.030
You don't trust anybody.
Like you were talking about cops.

85
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.660
You know sometimes cops have a hard time because they're dealing with scumbags

86
00:05:33.661 --> 00:05:35.880
all day long and it builds up this,

87
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.850
this mistrust of other people.

88
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.230
So you don't want to have that happen.
You want to be suspicious of people,

89
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.080
but you want to be able to build trust once they've proven themselves.

90
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.080
So take those small steps and start to build up over time.

91
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.090
Don't just jump in and give someone a hundred percent trust out of the gate.

92
00:05:54.091 --> 00:05:58.250
You don't know him.
Don't know him.
You know back in the day,

93
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.270
back in the day with old hardcore bands used to have this t shirt that just said

94
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:05.990
trust.
No one was like,
yeah,
that's legit.
Right.
You don't,

95
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.040
don't go out of the gate with the big trust on somebody with important stuff.

96
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.700
Don't do it.
But the good news is,
like I said,

97
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.590
there's plenty of people out there that are good people that you are give you,

98
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.960
you can give all your trust to just take it slow brother.
Yeah.

99
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.010
<v 2>It's so crazy how you just explained that so simple and it makes total sense</v>

100
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:31.520
when you're in the situation though all the motions,

101
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.010
you know like you can't just detach and be like,

102
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:37.440
what are the red flags that I didn't know you're too busy missing

103
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.920
<v 0>person or whatever your disaster</v>

104
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.170
thing was.
Looking at pictures,
that's the worst.

105
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.920
You have to get out the picture and stare.
I've seen guys doing that.

106
00:06:50.921 --> 00:06:54.580
I'm like Bro,
give me that.
Let me fill this away for you.
It's not going to help.

107
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:58.930
That person that I was always to me was,
was explaining like,
listen,

108
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.390
cause guys,
which she was,
no,
no,
she wasn't.

109
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.920
That is a lie.

110
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.520
That person that you put put together in your head that you've assembled in your

111
00:07:09.521 --> 00:07:13.120
mind,
that person doesn't exist.
They don't exist.

112
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.590
The person that you dealt with was a liar,
was the unfaithful,

113
00:07:18.591 --> 00:07:20.380
was a cheater.
That's the person.

114
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.590
The person wasn't this person that you're putting forth in your mind.

115
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.630
That person doesn't exist.
So stop,
but you don't understand the good times.
Yeah,

116
00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:32.170
I know.
I know.
I know.
It's a,
here's the trick.
Okay.
So

117
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:34.563
if,

118
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.570
<v 2>okay,
that person a liar,
that per the cheater and what I kind of said there,</v>

119
00:07:37.571 --> 00:07:39.690
it was like you don't understand the good time.
That's a real part of it.

120
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.750
That's really it.
It's like sure they did this.
Sure sheet.
Um,
uh,
flats,

121
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.410
my tires when she gets measure all that.
But the good times we have are so good.

122
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:52.120
So it's,
it's,
it's proof that it,
it's not about the person.

123
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.790
It's not about the person that you can see all the red flags and how they

124
00:07:54.791 --> 00:07:57.150
mistreat you from time to time or they beach.

125
00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:01.390
It's about yourself and how you're sad now because of all these reasons.

126
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.440
But the trick comes with what one of the tricks come with.
Um,

127
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.510
same thing I said about drinking,
where it's your brain.

128
00:08:07.511 --> 00:08:10.630
Cause it's like chemicals.
When you bond with someone in certain,
in certain ways.

129
00:08:10.631 --> 00:08:14.650
And it's different from,
you know,
it varies from person to person,
but it's like,

130
00:08:14.651 --> 00:08:17.830
I think it's like oxytocin or I don't know,
something where it's,
it's,

131
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.790
it basically,
yeah.
So I want to go into,

132
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.500
but you feel this bond with this specific person.

133
00:08:23.501 --> 00:08:26.170
That's why you have these feelings.
Even though this girl like lies to you,

134
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:30.120
you see her lying text messages on your phone right now.
You're looking at him.

135
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.750
Meanwhile you still,
I still miss them.

136
00:08:31.751 --> 00:08:36.751
It's a trick because it's saying like that your emotional wellbeing is attached

137
00:08:37.031 --> 00:08:39.190
to this person kind of thing.
Right.
And all the other stuff,

138
00:08:39.191 --> 00:08:42.790
you just kind of ignore it.
So it just like,
um,
how was the same with drinking?

139
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.930
Right?
Why?
No.
Consciously like,
I'm going to be hung over tomorrow.

140
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.030
I won't get anything done.
All this stuff,

141
00:08:49.031 --> 00:08:53.170
but why do I want to drink so bad right now?
You know,
kind of thing.
Um,

142
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.040
and it's the same thing.
The chemicals your brain are telling you

143
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.900
<v 0>like this girl is essential for you.
You know,
for your wellbeing's not,
yeah.</v>

144
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.960
Oh,
that's the magic though.
That's a lie.
It's a trick.
I'll listen to them.

145
00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:08.300
Don't listen to your brain.
Listen to me.
She's not essential,
bro.

146
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:12.330
I'm telling you the,
but that's the logic.
Those chemicals were blocking.

147
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:17.420
I have seen so many situations where guys are just in,

148
00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:21.330
what's horrible is,
I'm sitting here saying this,
it's,

149
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.690
you could be smacking someone in the face,
telling them,
move on,
move on,

150
00:09:24.691 --> 00:09:27.720
and they're not going to listen.
That's all.
So you got to make that decision.

151
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.680
Yeah,
that's,
that's,
that's,
it's hard.
And guys ruined their lives.

152
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:35.700
I mean the others due do two girls and guys,
they ruin their lives,
you know,

153
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.850
with over somebody that is completely abusive,

154
00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:42.810
whether mentally or physically that just completely abusive and they'll ruin

155
00:09:42.811 --> 00:09:45.960
their lives for this person,
that person and see in my mind,

156
00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:48.300
I think it's because they build a person,

157
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.500
they build a person on the framework of reality.

158
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:57.000
They build a fantasy and they're in love with that fantasy and they want to keep

159
00:09:57.001 --> 00:09:59.100
it going.
It's a fantasy.

160
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.600
So stop and they get away ignore like all the Quona version for sure.

161
00:10:03.601 --> 00:10:07.590
And they remember the good times,
even if it's like 10 minutes a week,

162
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.910
they remember those good times.

163
00:10:08.911 --> 00:10:13.911
They ignore the red flags foot because of that,

164
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.350
that you know that trick,
that chemical truck in their brain.

165
00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.860
So it reinforces that thing that they built,

166
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.040
you know that fantasy that they built it.
It's true.
It's this big,

167
00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:27.090
the reality is this big and look the fantasy and they just attached to it.

168
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.630
You ever see like a friend or whatever,

169
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.280
cause I'm assuming you've never been in this situation like you ever had a

170
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.330
friend where they're really into it.
They're almost ruining their life,

171
00:10:36.331 --> 00:10:37.500
they're in bad shape or whatever,

172
00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:39.780
and then whether it be all of a sudden are years later,

173
00:10:39.781 --> 00:10:42.460
whatever they're thinking back and they're like,
whoa.

174
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:46.140
Was I think because of the chemical trick so to speak,

175
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.500
wears off and then they can see all that logic that you're talking about.

176
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.680
You're like,
oh my gosh man.
It's,
it's almost like,

177
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.770
it's almost like you feel like you were a different person when you recovered

178
00:10:57.771 --> 00:11:01.470
from cancer and just the fact that you can't talk any sense into people and

179
00:11:01.471 --> 00:11:05.190
they're in that situation is the trick.
You got to try and,
yeah,
it's hard.

180
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:08.070
It's hard,
but I think knowing that that's it.

181
00:11:08.071 --> 00:11:11.640
It's a chemical in your brain that is tricking you and it goes for a lot of

182
00:11:11.641 --> 00:11:15.980
stuff.
Donuts,
like all this stuff.
It's tricking you if you know like,
Hey,

183
00:11:15.981 --> 00:11:19.120
and you say,
I'm not going to be tricked.
I feel it.
I feel this,

184
00:11:19.121 --> 00:11:22.980
that I feel the sadness.
They feel missing this person,
but it's a trick,
you know?

185
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.580
That's,
that helps.
It totally helps.
I like it.

186
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:32.670
So move on man.
I know it's hard.
Trust us.

187
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.400
Speaking of moving on,
next question,

188
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:42.780
unless we want to talk about this tomorrow.
No,
I think you're exactly right.

189
00:11:42.781 --> 00:11:43.614
Let's move on.

190
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:49.790
In what circumstances do you recommend direct?
I will hold on.
Oh,

191
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.350
we're not moving and you're stuck on it.
But what's horrible is men,

192
00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:57.610
people killed themselves in these situations.
Yes.
Over a lie.

193
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.040
Yeah.
That's,
that's,
to me,
that's the trick.

194
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:05.100
But it's a lie it in guys or girls get so distraught over this fantasy that

195
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:07.600
doesn't exist.

196
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.650
And what's really jacked up is if they could just move on,

197
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:15.640
they'd find a reality that was actually congruent with what their desires are.

198
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:19.350
And it's out there.
You can see people all over the world.
They're there,

199
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:24.010
they're in relationships or having fun from every level.
Right?

200
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.410
There's someone out there,
but you,

201
00:12:26.411 --> 00:12:29.560
you get caught up in this mental trap and,

202
00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:34.240
and obsessing over a fantasy.
It's a fantasy.
Don't,
don't,

203
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:38.380
don't obsess.
Over the fantasy,
man.
There's,
you can,

204
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:39.370
you can get over it.

205
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.550
And there's plenty of other human beings out there that are awesome.

206
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.610
So go find one of them.
And in the meantime,

207
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:49.690
hang out with your Badass self,
right.
And become a better person.

208
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.080
And working out is a big one for sure.
For sure.

209
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.250
That's the 100% just get it,
get in the gym and get after it.

210
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:02.050
Jujitsu solves everything.
This lifting solves every day.
All right.
