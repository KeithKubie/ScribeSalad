presenter: Good afternoon everyone.
[laughs]

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.533
Thank you all for coming out
this afternoon.

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.867
We're honored to be hosting today's guests. 

00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:14.467
This has been a work in progress
for a few weeks and today's guests,

00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:19.633
as you all know, is Jad and Robert,
hosts of Radiolab.

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:20.400
And--

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.067
[applause] [laughs]

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:30.133
And a very special guest,
the Avant Cellist, Zoë Keating.

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:35.067
[applause]

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:39.767
So, as this room is proof positive,
Radiohead-hah. Radiohead.

00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:43.000
Radiolab is well known
around the Google campus

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.733
for its unique and thought-provoking
mix of modern-

00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:47.367
I'm sorry- 

00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:51.467
thought provoking mix of human curiosity
and cutting edge sound design,

00:00:51.467 --> 00:00:54.900
covering scientific and cultural topics
from often very unique angles.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.500
And those of you that have heard their
podcasts know exactly what I'm talking about.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.967
And Zoë, she's known
as a one woman orchestra.

00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:05.333
She fuses classical cello sounds
with modern technology

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:11.933
to produce incredibly rich and
dynamic array of music pieces.

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:14.700
No two performances of Zoë's are alike 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.767
and today will definitely be no exception.

00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:20.267
Jad, Robert, and Zoë are
currently on tour together,

00:01:20.267 --> 00:01:23.667
performing a live version 
of Radiolab entitled "Symmetry".

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:25.800
And on behalf of the @Google team, 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.433
it's my pleasure to introduce you
to Radiolab and Zoë Keating.

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:30.033
[applause]

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.767
[applause]

00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:46.867
Robert Krulwich: So we were enjoying
the extensively huge Green Room,

00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:48.733
which includes a pool.

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:51.500
You probably don't, cause you probably
don't come to this building often.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.567
There's a golf course over there.

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:55.500
It's enormous.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.033
It's very plush.

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:59.267
Jad Abumrad: Are you ready?
Yeah. Hey, everyone.

00:01:59.267 --> 00:02:00.900
Robert Krulwich: I'm Robert
and this is--

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.200
Jad Abumrad: Jad.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.900
Robert Krulwich: Jad. 
And this is Zoë. 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.867
And we understand that you,
we didn't know what to call you --

00:02:06.867 --> 00:02:09.900
Googlielols or whatever. 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.600
However, we got advice
from a variety of people.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.367
You are Googlers.

00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:13.833
You are Carpooglers.

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:18.433
You are Geegooglers, Nooglers, Zooglers,

00:02:18.433 --> 00:02:24.500
and maybe, like if we do this right,
they'll be Zoëooglers and Jadooglers.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.967
Jad Abumrad: We should be so lucky.

00:02:25.967 --> 00:02:32.033
Robert Krulwich: Yeah, so you wanna, I guess
the first question is what's unusual about us?

00:02:32.033 --> 00:02:32.833
[Jad laughs]

00:02:32.833 --> 00:02:36.467
Jad Abumrad: Well, I figure
since we're here with Zoë,

00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:39.467
honored to be here with Zoë
and thank you all for the invitation.

00:02:39.467 --> 00:02:41.600
We're so happy to be here.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.200
We thought we would do something
which sketches the sort of,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.933
if Zoë and Radiolab overlap, 

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:52.600
what's that portion of the Venn
diagram that we all share?

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.933
So, I'll get things started.

00:02:53.933 --> 00:02:56.500
Then we'll throw to Zoë.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.900
Radiolab, as you may know,
is a show about all kinds of things.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.733
It's about ideas.

00:03:01.733 --> 00:03:04.233
It's about questions.

00:03:04.233 --> 00:03:05.433
It's sometimes about science. 

00:03:05.433 --> 00:03:06.700
It's about storytelling.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.300
But if you put the content aside,

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.167
it is, I hope, a show that
when you turn on the radio,

00:03:12.167 --> 00:03:17.967
or hit play on your iPhone 
or Android phone, it will-

00:03:17.967 --> 00:03:19.467
it just sounds different.

00:03:19.467 --> 00:03:22.433
It hits your ears in a different sort of way.

00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:25.133
So I wanted to start there
and just to talk a little bit about

00:03:25.133 --> 00:03:27.833
what it is that we think about
when we're making the show

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:30.633
and we're making the sounds in the show.

00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:35.800
I think the reason that Radiolab sounds
the way it does has to do with how we,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.333
how we bleed borders.

00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:40.300
And I'll tell you what I mean.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.500
A while ago,

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.100
when we were first working on the show,

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.733
I ran into an essay by a guy
named Walter Murch.

00:03:47.733 --> 00:03:50.167
I don't know if any of
ya'll know Walter Murch.

00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:51.467
He's a great film editor. 

00:03:51.467 --> 00:03:53.433
He edited 'The Godfather'.

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:56.900
He edited 'Apocalypse Now' 
and a ton of other movies.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.633
And he wrote this essay,

00:03:58.633 --> 00:04:01.167
which started with a very simple diagram

00:04:01.167 --> 00:04:04.933
where it was one line and
then it had on one side "words",

00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:06.167
and on the other, "music".

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:10.600
So we're gonna basically, 
in our low rent way,

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.967
do that for you now.

00:04:11.967 --> 00:04:13.567
So -- 
[laughter]

00:04:13.567 --> 00:04:15.533
Robert Krulwich: I'm sorry for you
in the middle back area.

00:04:15.533 --> 00:04:18.433
You can't, but this is gonna
be for you a true radio experience.

00:04:18.433 --> 00:04:20.433
I know like in row seven, 
you can't see anything.

00:04:20.433 --> 00:04:21.433
[laughter]

00:04:21.433 --> 00:04:23.233
Jad Abumrad: We are radio.
Robert Krulwich: This'll be all you'll see.

00:04:23.233 --> 00:04:23.933
Jad Abumrad: We are radio, after all. 

00:04:23.933 --> 00:04:25.000
We don't do pictures very often.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.700
Robert Krulwich: Yeah, we don't believe
that you should see anything.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.900
Jad Abumrad: So, you've got
these two poles of sound.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.467
You've got "music" on one pole
and "words" on the other.

00:04:32.467 --> 00:04:39.333
And the idea is pretty simple initially,
which is that a word is,

00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:41.100
it's an agreement of a kind.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.600
So, like this thing right here.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.433
[knocks on table twice]

00:04:43.433 --> 00:04:45.100
This table. 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.700
The only reason we call this thing a
"table" is because sometime long ago,

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.700
some people got together and
agreed that the syllables, ta-ble,

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.533
mean this.

00:04:54.533 --> 00:04:55.833
But then, in the Mediterranean--

00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:58.033
Robert Krulwich: It probably wasn't
a discreet meeting, but never mind.

00:04:58.033 --> 00:04:59.500
Jad Abumrad: No, it wasn't that exactly. 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.567
But the point is that the meetings
happen differently in different places.

00:05:04.567 --> 00:05:07.067
In Arabic, we call it "tawila".

00:05:07.067 --> 00:05:09.633
That's somehow what we call this thing.

00:05:09.633 --> 00:05:11.700
In the Philippines, they call it "mesa". 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.367
So in other words,
it's completely arbitrary.

00:05:13.367 --> 00:05:15.067
It's just a collection of syllables that you,

00:05:15.067 --> 00:05:18.933
in a sense, have to crack the husk
of in order to extract the meaning,

00:05:18.933 --> 00:05:21.667
which is nothing more than
a picture of a table.

00:05:21.667 --> 00:05:22.600
So that's a word.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.100
It is an agreed upon thing.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.500
Now, music requires no agreement.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.700
It is a,

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.600

Robert Krulwich: Well,--

00:05:31.567 --> 00:05:32.433
Jad Abumrad: Hold on, hold on.

00:05:32.433 --> 00:05:34.133

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.433
Now would you say this 
means sadness? 

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:53.433
Does it represent sadness?

00:05:53.433 --> 00:05:55.133
 It just is sad. 

00:05:55.133 --> 00:05:56.300
There's something about,

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.967
this is "Adagio for Strings" and I'm
sorry to do this for you, to you,

00:05:58.967 --> 00:06:01.467
'cause it's the most manipulative thing ever.

00:06:01.467 --> 00:06:04.933
But it just embodies sadness. 

00:06:04.933 --> 00:06:07.833
It's the kind of sound
that has no intrinsic meaning. 

00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:10.567
It just repre-- 
it is the thing that it is.

00:06:10.567 --> 00:06:12.867
It's an emotion embodied. 

00:06:12.867 --> 00:06:14.067
So in a sense, t

00:06:14.067 --> 00:06:16.333
he difference, as you, would you
like to register a statement?

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:18.467
Robert Krulwich: Well, I just, as a footnote,

00:06:18.467 --> 00:06:21.533
if you were living in the center
of the Brazilian jungle

00:06:21.533 --> 00:06:25.000
and had no sense of this kind of music,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.267
you might hear it and think
it was joyous, or I don't know.

00:06:28.267 --> 00:06:29.867
Jad Abumrad: No, that's absolutely true,
but you wouldn't--

00:06:29.867 --> 00:06:31.667
Robert Krulwich: I don't know. You might not.
I don't know.

00:06:31.667 --> 00:06:33.600
Jad Abumrad: Well, I mean
what's the big debate,

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.567
actually as to whether music
has a universal meaning.

00:06:35.567 --> 00:06:38.800
But my point is simply that
it is not a linguistic meaning.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.933
It is a, somehow, 
an embodied meaning. 

00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:45.100
So what you've got are on the one pole, words,
which is an encoded sound.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.767
It's a code that you have to crack.

00:06:46.767 --> 00:06:49.633
And then here, you've got an embodied sound.

00:06:49.633 --> 00:06:54.633
And that's how the schematic
that Walter Murch laid out.

00:06:54.633 --> 00:07:02.567
Now, I think Radiolab works, when it does,
sonically, because we confuse the two. 

00:07:02.567 --> 00:07:08.400
So I'm gonna play you a little three-minute
thing that some of you may recognize.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.800
And then we'll deconstruct. 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.100
This is the opening to a show;

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.333
one of the first shows that Robert
and I worked on together.

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:17.233
Jad Abumrad: [on audio clip] And let's begin
today with something deceptively familiar.

00:07:17.233 --> 00:07:20.367
Robert Krulwich: [on audio clip] Fireflies are
something that we have all loved as kids, right?

00:07:20.367 --> 00:07:21.600
Catching them in the backyard, 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.800
putting them in a jar
and watching them glow.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.600
So we don't tend to think of them
as anything all that mysterious.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:32.133
Well, they do one thing very nicely,
which is flash on and off.

00:07:32.133 --> 00:07:33.933
Jad Abumrad: [on audio clip] That's all
fireflies do, flash. 

00:07:33.933 --> 00:07:37.500
But what interests Steve Strogatz, 
a mathematician at Cornell University,

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.400
is that there are places in the world--

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.300
Robert Krulwich: [on audio clip] Not here, but
in Southeast Asia, in Malaysia or Thailand--

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.467
Jad Abumrad: [on audio clip] Where fireflies
don't just flash randomly, like we're used to.

00:07:46.467 --> 00:07:48.533
They somehow flash together.

00:07:48.533 --> 00:07:52.067
Man on audio clip #1: There are enormous
congregations of fireflies along riverbanks.

00:07:52.067 --> 00:07:52.867
Man on audio clip #2: How many?

00:07:52.867 --> 00:07:54.467
Robert Krulwich: [on audio clip] It could
be tens of thousands.

00:07:54.467 --> 00:07:55.067
Jad Abumrad: [on audio clip] Tens of thousands.

00:07:55.067 --> 00:07:58.433
Robert Krulwich: [on audio clip] Tree after tree,
extending for literally miles along the rivers,

00:07:58.433 --> 00:08:01.333
all flashing in sync like a Christmas tree.

00:08:01.333 --> 00:08:04.433
Rows and rows of Christmas trees
all wired together, going off.

00:08:04.433 --> 00:08:09.400
And it's one of the most hypnotic and
spellbinding spectacles in nature. 

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.100
Because you have to keep in mind, 
it is absolutely silent.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:17.467
Picture it, there's a riverbank in Thailand
in the remote part of the jungle.

00:08:17.467 --> 00:08:20.133
You're in a canoe, 
slipping down the river.

00:08:20.133 --> 00:08:21.733
There's no sound of anything, 

00:08:21.733 --> 00:08:25.167
maybe the occasional exotic
jungle bird or something.

00:08:25.167 --> 00:08:27.233

Brilliantly lit, total darkness. 

00:08:55.633 --> 00:08:56.467
Jad Abumrad: [on audio clip] All of them in sync.

00:08:56.467 --> 00:08:59.167
Man on Audio Clip #2: Yeah. And no
Westerner had ever seen this sight.

00:08:59.167 --> 00:09:00.067
There was folklore.

00:09:00.067 --> 00:09:02.100
There were stories about it, 

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.600
but nobody had gone in and
photographed and captured samples.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.467
Jad Abumrad: [on audio clip] Well,
not until 1965.

00:09:07.467 --> 00:09:08.933
Robert Krulwich: [on audio clip] This was done
by John Buck. 

00:09:08.933 --> 00:09:11.700
Man on Audio Clip #3: John Buck.
B-U-C-K.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.333
Man on Audio Clip #1: One of the great
researchers.

00:09:13.333 --> 00:09:16.067
Man on Audio Clip #3: According to
the records, I'm 92.

00:09:16.067 --> 00:09:17.333
Man on Audio Clip #1: Buck and his wife,
Elisabeth.

00:09:17.333 --> 00:09:19.167
Woman on Audio Clip: Elisabeth Mast Buck.

00:09:19.167 --> 00:09:23.667
Man on Audio Clip #1: Went to Thailand
and captured bags full of male fireflies.

00:09:23.667 --> 00:09:25.667
Woman on Audio Clip: You could just reach up

00:09:25.667 --> 00:09:29.467
and shake the branches
and fireflies would rain down.

00:09:29.467 --> 00:09:30.900
Man on Audio Clip #1: And brought them
back to their hotel room.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.400
Woman on Audio Clip: And we turned off
the lights.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.767
Man on Audio Clip #3: We turned them loose.

00:09:35.767 --> 00:09:38.667
Man on Audio Clip #1: And saw that the fireflies
flittered around on the walls and ceiling.

00:09:38.667 --> 00:09:40.167
Man on Audio Clip #3: They flew
back and forth.

00:09:40.167 --> 00:09:41.133
Woman on Audio Clip: Flashing randomly.

00:09:41.133 --> 00:09:44.233
Man on Audio Clip #3: Elisabeth lay
on the floor of the room.

00:09:44.233 --> 00:09:50.367
Woman on Audio Clip: I was just tired and John
stayed awake and he was the one who saw.

00:09:50.367 --> 00:09:51.933
Man on Audio Clip #1: Within a few minutes,

00:09:51.933 --> 00:09:54.600
little groups, duos and trios, formed.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.367
Man on Audio Clip #3: And after a while.

00:09:56.367 --> 00:09:57.767
Man on Audio Clip #1: A fourth one
would join in.

00:09:57.767 --> 00:10:00.367
Man on Audio Clip #3: They got
closer and closer together

00:10:00.367 --> 00:10:03.000
and then finally,
they were synchronized.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Man on Audio Clip #1: The whole room
was blinking in perfect harmony.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.667
Woman on Audio Clip: He was excited the next
morning when he told me about it. [laughs]

00:10:09.667 --> 00:10:11.033
[Man on Audio Clip #3 [laughs]

00:10:11.033 --> 00:10:12.100
Jad Abumrad: [on audio clip] Twenty years later,

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.033
John Buck is still asking this question.

00:10:14.033 --> 00:10:16.067
Man on Audio Clip #3: Well, what is going on?

00:10:16.067 --> 00:10:16.967
Jad Abumrad: [on audio clip] Because no one knows.

00:10:16.967 --> 00:10:18.733
Man on Audio Clip #1: There are
literally ten theories.

00:10:18.733 --> 00:10:19.733
Jad Abumrad: [on audio clip] What seems
to be clear, says Steve,

00:10:19.733 --> 00:10:22.833
is there is no one firefly
that makes it all happen.

00:10:22.833 --> 00:10:25.133
It just happens on its own.

00:10:25.133 --> 00:10:28.200
Order materializes out of nothing.
[end clip]

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.000
Jad Abumrad: I'll stop it right there. 

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.567
So, that was how we opened up a show,

00:10:31.567 --> 00:10:36.700
which ultimately was on the idea of
groupthink and how does groupthink--

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.033
I'm just gonna fix this,
the microphone, real fast.

00:10:39.033 --> 00:10:46.700
How does groupthink come out of individuals
who are like myself at this very moment,

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.667
not so smart?

00:10:47.667 --> 00:10:49.000
[audience laughter]

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.100
There we go. 

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:50.733
That's better. 

00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:53.467
So we go and talk about
all kinds of things.

00:10:53.467 --> 00:10:55.267
But I wanted to zero in to,
for just a moment,

00:10:55.267 --> 00:11:00.567
on the visual picture of the fireflies
as they're flashing on and off.

00:11:00.567 --> 00:11:03.833
Now, there's a case where you have,
you've got music.

00:11:03.833 --> 00:11:06.733
You wanna put up your music?

00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:07.567
You got your music.
[audio clip starts]

00:11:07.567 --> 00:11:09.300
Man on Audio Clip #1: And let's begin today.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.067
Jad Abumrad: So here's the music.

00:11:11.067 --> 00:11:13.233
[music]

00:11:13.233 --> 00:11:15.033
Jad Abumrad: It's giving you feeling.

00:11:15.033 --> 00:11:17.367
It's embodying a feeling,
but you've also got the words.

00:11:17.367 --> 00:11:21.767
Man on Audio Clip #1: It's one of the most
hypnotic and spellbinding spectacles in nature,

00:11:21.767 --> 00:11:25.600
because you have to keep in mind,
it is absolutely silent.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.333
Picture it.

00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:27.800
There's a riverbank--

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.100
Jad Abumrad: So, we've got words
and music on either end.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.500
But you've also got this thing that happens
about ten seconds into the scene.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.367
[bird sounds]

00:11:35.367 --> 00:11:37.467
The bird. 
The sound of a bird. 

00:11:37.467 --> 00:11:40.167
So, where does that fit in?

00:11:40.167 --> 00:11:40.667
Well--

00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:42.367
Robert Krulwich: Well, Strogatz said, 

00:11:42.367 --> 00:11:44.233
"There's the occasional sound
of the bird."

00:11:44.233 --> 00:11:45.167
Jad Abumrad: Exactly, and you hear--

00:11:45.167 --> 00:11:46.267
[bird sounds]

00:11:46.267 --> 00:11:48.433
So, it's kind of like a word.

00:11:48.433 --> 00:11:50.800
Robert Krulwich: What if he said
there's the occasional sound of a tricycle?

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.900
Would you have a--
would you have had a tricycle?

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.900
Jad Abumrad: If it made sense
to have a tricycle, sure.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.567
So, you've got now a slightly,

00:11:58.567 --> 00:11:59.700
it's not exactly words.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:00.967
And it's certainly not music.

00:12:00.967 --> 00:12:03.933
But it's something like a word
so it's a linguistic sound.

00:12:03.933 --> 00:12:06.800
So, let's just take this little bird.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.700
Can we affix it to, say,
your elbow here?

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.033
[audience laughter]

00:12:12.033 --> 00:12:14.067
Robert Krulwich: My elbow,
because it's closer to--

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:16.067
Jad Abumrad: It's closer to "words", right?

00:12:16.067 --> 00:12:18.367
So you've got that. 

00:12:18.367 --> 00:12:21.267
But then you get to a certain point
where you've got the words.

00:12:21.267 --> 00:12:21.967
You've got Steve. 

00:12:21.967 --> 00:12:22.667
You've got the music. 

00:12:22.667 --> 00:12:23.533
You've got a bird.

00:12:23.533 --> 00:12:25.667
You've got the sound of
water at a certain point.

00:12:25.667 --> 00:12:28.633
But then you also have fireflies. 

00:12:28.633 --> 00:12:30.100
And I remember as we were
making this, we're like,

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.633
"What do fireflies sound like?

00:12:31.633 --> 00:12:33.333
They don't actually make sound."

00:12:33.333 --> 00:12:38.267
Robert Krulwich: Remember also, Strogatz said
that this whole event takes place in total silence.

00:12:38.267 --> 00:12:38.600
Jad Abumrad: That's right.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.333
Robert Krulwich: So we're violating
some rule that he set up.

00:12:41.333 --> 00:12:42.200
Jad Abumrad: Absolutely.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.033
Oh. You're about to lose your bird.

00:12:44.033 --> 00:12:45.133
Robert Krulwich: I am going to lose my bird.

00:12:45.133 --> 00:12:47.667
Jad Abumrad: Well, but,
OK it's on your hip now.

00:12:47.667 --> 00:12:49.400
Well, alright, well. 

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.233
The bird is on his elbow
in our imagination.

00:12:51.233 --> 00:12:53.767
So, fireflies was an interesting thing. 

00:12:53.767 --> 00:12:54.867
I think fireflies, for me,

00:12:54.867 --> 00:12:58.267
captures something about what
we try and do on the show always. 

00:12:58.267 --> 00:13:00.767
They don't make sound,
but you want to evoke it in sound.

00:13:00.767 --> 00:13:04.400
But there's no sound effect
for a firefly, thank God.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:10.633
So, after much trial and error,
here's the sounds we came up with.

00:13:10.633 --> 00:13:11.467
[bird sounds]

00:13:11.467 --> 00:13:12.433
That's the bird.

00:13:12.433 --> 00:13:13.700
[electronic beep]

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:14.400
Just that. 

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:20.100
[electronic beep]

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.667
No firefly in the history of
creation ever made that noise.

00:13:24.667 --> 00:13:28.533
 But somehow it creates for
you an impression of a firefly. 

00:13:28.533 --> 00:13:29.967
Now, what would you,
where would you put this?

00:13:29.967 --> 00:13:32.733
Well this, I think, 

00:13:32.733 --> 00:13:34.400
I would put it probably 

00:13:36.533 --> 00:13:38.100
[audience laughter]

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.233
--there.

00:13:39.233 --> 00:13:40.867
It's smack in the middle.

00:13:40.867 --> 00:13:45.367
It's evoking something like the image
that you would get from a word,

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:48.600
but it's not doing it literally. 

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.467
It's a musical gesture that somehow
creates the impression.

00:13:52.467 --> 00:13:55.033
And for me, this moment 

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.000
and some subsequent
moments were kind of an epiphany.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.133
I was like, "If we can do that, 

00:14:01.133 --> 00:14:04.133
if we can get right between them,

00:14:04.133 --> 00:14:09.133
you can create a sonic space that is
precise in the way that you need it to be",

00:14:09.133 --> 00:14:11.433
which is what a sound effect will give you,

00:14:11.433 --> 00:14:14.067
but it won't date the way
that a sound effect does.

00:14:14.067 --> 00:14:17.633
It won't sound canned the way
that a sound effect does.

00:14:17.633 --> 00:14:19.800
Anything I say over this music
sounds poignant.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.400
It's amazing.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.800
[audience laughter]
[audience clapping]

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.633
But.

00:14:24.633 --> 00:14:29.267
Robert Krulwich: Out of curiosity, the three
elements of the sound of the fireflies.

00:14:29.267 --> 00:14:30.700
It seemed like
there were three parts.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.367
Do you go to a--
where do you, where did,

00:14:34.367 --> 00:14:36.867
what trunk of sounds do you look at?

00:14:36.867 --> 00:14:39.367
Jad Abumrad: That's a, that's a,
it's a little bit of the music

00:14:39.367 --> 00:14:43.100
and then I made the beep 
a third above it.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.700
So it's just a little tiny stack.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.200
And then this,

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.800
I cannot remember
how I made that noise.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.300
Robert Krulwich: Well, these sounds
are all software developed.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.933
You take the sound that
you find on a record,

00:14:53.933 --> 00:14:56.400
or in a file somewhere,
and you screw it up.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.767
Jad Abumrad: Yeah. 
Yes, sometimes you steal it. 

00:14:58.767 --> 00:15:00.267
Most of the time you screw it up. 

00:15:00.267 --> 00:15:03.867
You filter it so you get these little high
squeals or something that in some way--

00:15:03.867 --> 00:15:05.767
Robert Krulwich: I wouldn't say
you steal it in public.

00:15:05.767 --> 00:15:08.567
I would say what you do is you made it
so different from what it was

00:15:08.567 --> 00:15:10.333
that it became an original act.

00:15:10.333 --> 00:15:11.733
That's the [inaudible] you were looking for. 
[audience laughter]

00:15:11.733 --> 00:15:13.500
Jad Abumrad: That's, yes.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:18.100
Thank you for legalistically putting me
in the right place.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:23.767
But so, for me, that talks about, that's,
for me, the key of Radiola

00:15:23.767 --> 00:15:25.767
So that firefly,

00:15:25.767 --> 00:15:31.300
right there on your breastbone
is where we try and live.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:36.533
Robert Krulwich: So, Zoë, your music is also,
as we're about to hear

00:15:36.533 --> 00:15:40.400
is a pile up of sounds also.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:40.767
Zoë Keating: Mm-hmm.

00:15:40.767 --> 00:15:44.467
Robert Krulwich: Your sounds come
from this instrument.

00:15:44.467 --> 00:15:45.000
ZoÎ Keating: This.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.967
Robert Krulwich: Can you explain
what else you got?

00:15:47.967 --> 00:15:49.900
ZoÎ Keating: Well, so I've got this cello.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.867
His name is Ariej
and he's from France.

00:15:51.867 --> 00:15:53.967
He's very sensitive.
But I--

00:15:53.967 --> 00:15:55.600
Robert Krulwich: Is Ariej a girl name
or a boy name?

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.033
Zoë Keating: He's a boy.

00:15:56.033 --> 00:15:58.100
Robert Krulwich: Boy.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.133
Zoë Keating: Yeah. And so, I play Ariej 

00:15:59.133 --> 00:16:03.367
and I record the sounds
in real time into the computer

00:16:03.367 --> 00:16:06.167
and I use a bunch
of midi controls to do that.

00:16:06.167 --> 00:16:10.533
And then, I just play these layers
of sound back at the audience

00:16:10.533 --> 00:16:16.067
and then I play on top of them so that you have
little pieces that make up a whole larger piece.

00:16:16.067 --> 00:16:20.100
Robert Krulwich: And like Jad is
trying to evoke something specific,

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.000
but he's trying to invent a vocabulary,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.633
as he puts it, in the middle 
to find that specificity.

00:16:25.633 --> 00:16:32.700
When you compose, do you compose to
pictures in your head, or moods, or what?

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.867
Zoë Keating: It's very hard to say.

00:16:33.867 --> 00:16:38.533
I would call it an emotional landscape

00:16:38.533 --> 00:16:43.200
that is made of emotion and light
and color and direction.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.733
It's sort of this, it's like a feeling

00:16:46.733 --> 00:16:51.100
and I imagine it 
as a three-dimensional space.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:51.600
Robert Krulwich: You do?

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.367
Zoë Keating: Yeah, definitely. 

00:16:52.367 --> 00:16:55.367
And when I record the sounds 

00:16:55.367 --> 00:16:58.900
and I place them in the sonic spectrum
for the audience, or on a CD,

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.933
it's very much like I'm crafting a shape;

00:17:01.933 --> 00:17:05.733
these little, little shapes that make larger
shapes that make larger shapes, larger shape.

00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:07.800
And they have some kind
of meaning to me

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.933
that is absolutely impossible
to express in words,

00:17:09.933 --> 00:17:12.700
which is why I can only
do it with music.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.567
Robert Krulwich: But you know
you're in the right place

00:17:14.567 --> 00:17:17.867
when the shape is present in your mind,

00:17:17.867 --> 00:17:21.500
or is it like filling a container
to get to a shape?

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.500
Do you arrive early, or do
you arrive along the way?

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.767
Zoë Keating: [laughs] Can you
rephrase that question?

00:17:26.767 --> 00:17:29.433
[audience laughter]

00:17:29.433 --> 00:17:31.400
Zoë Keating: By a shape,
I mean like for example a little,

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:38.200
it might be some sort of translucent,
semi-translucent, you know.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.567
Robert Krulwich: Oh, don't even
try to describe it.

00:17:39.567 --> 00:17:41.167
Just play something.

00:17:41.167 --> 00:17:44.133
Zoë Keating: Well, I think I'm gonna play,
since that music was so nice, 

00:17:44.133 --> 00:17:46.333
I think I'm gonna play a piece
called "Sun Will Set".

00:17:46.333 --> 00:17:50.100
And now, I have a real hard
time naming pieces

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.133
because I don't like to
put meaning on them.

00:17:53.133 --> 00:17:56.533
And one thing I love about this piece
in particular is I wrote it a while ago.

00:17:56.533 --> 00:17:58.733
And I get emails all the time
from people

00:17:58.733 --> 00:18:01.167
who tell me what it means to them

00:18:01.167 --> 00:18:05.200
and what it is and their meaning
and they're totally certain about it.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.400
Robert Krulwich: And you think they're
totally right. Wrong?

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.233
Zoë Keating: Well, the thing is that it means
whatever it means you at that moment 

00:18:11.233 --> 00:18:12.967
and that's a completely valid
interpretation.

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:14.867
So it might have meant something
when I wrote it.

00:18:14.867 --> 00:18:17.100
And then it meant something
when I mixed it that was really different.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.600
It means something different.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.067
It's different every time
I play it on stage.

00:18:20.067 --> 00:18:21.367
It has a different meaning.

00:18:21.367 --> 00:18:24.033
Robert Krulwich: So now,
for the very first time ever,

00:18:24.033 --> 00:18:27.000
is a composition that you have
already played many times before.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.800
Zoë Keating: Yes.
[laughter]

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.733
Robert Krulwich: Oh, just go ahead.

00:18:41.133 --> 00:24:01.900
[Zoë Keating plays cello]

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:11.567
[applause]

00:24:11.567 --> 00:24:15.300
Jad Abumrad: Wow. Zoë, can I ask you
a question about that song?

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.000
Since we were talking about the ways

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.667
in which music can or cannot
evoke meaning, or pictures,

00:24:22.667 --> 00:24:23.667
or that kind of thing,

00:24:23.667 --> 00:24:25.800
you call that song Sun Will Set, right?

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.467
I was just thinking,
musically, actually in a way,

00:24:31.467 --> 00:24:35.100
the sun doesn't need to set cause your loops
can always just keep going in a way.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.333
Zoë Keating: There you go.

00:24:36.333 --> 00:24:37.700
Jad Abumrad: You know?

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:41.067
Zoë Keating: Well, I was sort of,
I mean, "Sun Will Set".

00:24:41.067 --> 00:24:44.700
Out here in California we enjoy
these really long sunsets and so,

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:49.433
those ones that never end and they go on
and on and on and on and on and on.

00:24:49.433 --> 00:24:54.833
Robert Krulwich: I was curious if you had [sings bit
of music that Zoë played] if in the first iteration,

00:24:54.833 --> 00:24:56.333
you had made a mistake, 

00:24:58.767 --> 00:25:01.267
you'd be stuck with the mistake, right?

00:25:01.267 --> 00:25:03.200
Your foot is, then what do you do?

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.567
Zoë Keating: That happens all the time.

00:25:04.567 --> 00:25:05.033
Robert Krulwich: Oh it does?

00:25:05.033 --> 00:25:07.367
Zoë Keating: Yeah.
[audience laughter]

00:25:07.367 --> 00:25:07.833
Robert Krulwich: So then are you--

00:25:07.833 --> 00:25:09.233
Zoë Keating: That's how I write new music.

00:25:09.233 --> 00:25:12.233
[audience laughter and applause]

00:25:12.233 --> 00:25:15.567
Actually, a surprising amount of
my music comes from mistakes.

00:25:15.567 --> 00:25:16.800
Jad Abumrad: In what sense?

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.667
Zoë Keating: Well, in the, I'm recording
something and I might do it wrong. 

00:25:20.667 --> 00:25:24.467
And then you have to save the piece
by playing the rest of the loops

00:25:24.467 --> 00:25:27.000
to go along with the thing you did wrong.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.667
And then that might, or might not,
lead to something interesting.

00:25:30.667 --> 00:25:31.167
So.

00:25:31.167 --> 00:25:33.567
Robert Krulwich: You've been
interested in loops, right?

00:25:33.567 --> 00:25:34.300
Jad Abumrad: Yeah. 

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:42.033
Actually there was a moment for me
actually when the idea of looping

00:25:42.033 --> 00:25:45.433
was really, became very, very interesting.

00:25:45.433 --> 00:25:47.233
I'd love to play, 
if you guys are OK with it,

00:25:47.233 --> 00:25:48.467
a three minute piece.

00:25:48.467 --> 00:25:50.233
If you're thinking back
to the words and music,

00:25:50.233 --> 00:25:53.000
a dichotomy that you had up,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.367
there was a moment
where I realized that--

00:25:55.367 --> 00:25:57.700
it was sort of a Zoë moment really--

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:02.100
where I realized that words
could become music instantly.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:07.367
This is a short, short introduction
to another show, 

00:26:07.367 --> 00:26:08.467
which just makes that point.

00:26:08.467 --> 00:26:10.433
It doesn't need much setup, 
so I'll just play it.

00:26:10.433 --> 00:26:12.033
Diana Deutsch: I'll tell you what happened

00:26:12.033 --> 00:26:15.967
is that when you do post-production,
as you know--

00:26:15.967 --> 00:26:18.633
Jad Abumrad: I should just say that
woman speaking is Diana Deustch.

00:26:18.633 --> 00:26:20.100
She's a music psychologist. 

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:25.233
And this is describing a realization
that she had that we,

00:26:25.233 --> 00:26:26.533
that we used in our story.

00:26:26.533 --> 00:26:30.700
Diana Deutsch: I'll tell you what happened
is that when you do post-production,

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:36.400
as you know, of speech, you loop things,
loop things, loop things

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.900
so that you can zero in on piece. 

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.300
Pu-pu that sound too loud.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.967
You need to unpop, or s's that
sound too sharp and so on.

00:26:44.967 --> 00:26:50.500
So you put things on loops in order to
fine tune the way the speech sounds.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:55.533
So I had this particular phrase
on a loop and forgot about it.

00:26:55.533 --> 00:26:56.667
Jad Abumrad: What phrase was this?

00:26:56.667 --> 00:27:01.367
Diana Deutsch: It's a phrase that occurs
at the beginning of the CD in which I say,

00:27:01.367 --> 00:27:04.200
"The sounds as they appear
to you are not only different

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.600
from those that are really present,

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.600
but they sometimes behave so strangely
as to seem quite impossible."

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.400
Diana Deutsch: [simultaneously] as to
seem quite impossible.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.600
Diana Deutsch: Now, I had "sometimes
behave so strangely" looped.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.467
Diana Deutsch: [simultaneously] The sounds
as they appear to you

00:27:18.467 --> 00:27:21.767
are not only different from those
that are really present,

00:27:21.767 --> 00:27:24.967
but they sometimes behave so strangely,

00:27:24.967 --> 00:27:27.167
sometimes behave so strangely.

00:27:27.167 --> 00:27:28.167
Diana Deutsch: Just those few words. 

00:27:28.167 --> 00:27:30.167
Diana Deutsch: [simultaneously] Sometimes
behave so strangely. 

00:27:30.167 --> 00:27:31.033
Diana Deutsch: And forgot about it. 

00:27:31.033 --> 00:27:33.900
Diana Deutsch: [simultaneously] Sometimes
behave so strangely. 

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.900
Diana Deutsch: Sometimes behave so
strangely.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:36.600
Jad Abumrad: [on audio clip] So,
here's what happened.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.867
Diana leaves her studio.

00:27:37.867 --> 00:27:40.700
She closes the door and goes
into the kitchen to make some tea.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.733
All the while, this loop is worrying
away in the background.

00:27:43.733 --> 00:27:46.467
As she's sipping her tea, she thinks,

00:27:46.467 --> 00:27:47.900
"Is someone singing?

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:48.533
Who's singing?"

00:27:48.533 --> 00:27:50.933
Diana Deutsch: I heard what sounded
like song in the background.

00:27:50.933 --> 00:27:52.900
Jad Abumrad: She realizes,
"Wait a second.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:56.733
That's not singing, that's me talking."

00:27:56.733 --> 00:27:57.600
Diana Deutsch: That very phrase. 

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.467
Diana Deutsch: [on audio clip] Sometimes
behave so strangely. 

00:27:58.467 --> 00:27:59.300
Diana Deutsch: But at this point, 

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.133
Diana Deutsch: [on audio clip] Sometimes
behave so strangely. 

00:28:01.133 --> 00:28:05.333
Diana Deutsch: it appeared to be sung
rather than spoken.

00:28:05.333 --> 00:28:08.100
Diana Deutsch: [on audio clip] Sometimes
behave so strangely. 

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:12.267
This is "sometimes behave
so strangely" right? [laughs]

00:28:12.267 --> 00:28:13.467
You still hear the words, 

00:28:13.467 --> 00:28:17.067
but they're sung words
rather than spoken words.

00:28:17.067 --> 00:28:17.467
Jad Abumrad: [on audio clip] It's weird. 

00:28:17.467 --> 00:28:19.467
Like it just switches at a certain point,

00:28:19.467 --> 00:28:20.700
three or four repetitions in.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:21.267
Diana Deutsch: Right.

00:28:21.267 --> 00:28:23.467
Jad Abumrad: [on audio clip] It's going,
it's going, and then pow.

00:28:23.467 --> 00:28:24.667
It becomes music. 

00:28:24.667 --> 00:28:26.900
And then now none of us
can get it out of our head.

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:30.000
Like, the whole office is like, 
♪ sometimes behave so strangely. ♪

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Jad Abumrad and Diana Deutsch:
♪ Sometimes behave so strangely. ♪

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:33.833
Diana Deutsch: And you know what?

00:28:33.833 --> 00:28:38.467
If you do this demo and then you
go back to the original sentence,

00:28:38.467 --> 00:28:44.700
it sounds like speech to begin with and
when you come to that very phrase,

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.467
I seem to be bursting into song.

00:28:46.467 --> 00:28:48.533
Diana Deutsch: [on audio clip] The sounds
as they appear to you

00:28:48.533 --> 00:28:51.900
are not only different from those
that are really present,

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:56.500
but they sometimes behave so strangely
as to seem quite impossible.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.800
 I have to say this can continue
for months and months.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:04.200
It's sort of like your brain gets altered
for that particular phrase

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.833
and it continues to sound like singing 

00:29:07.833 --> 00:29:09.500
[Voices Singing]
♪ Sometimes behave so strangely. ♪

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.767
Diana Deutsch: --for a very, very long time.

00:29:10.767 --> 00:29:13.400
[Voices Singing]
♪ Sometimes behave so strangely. ♪.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:13.967
Jad Abumrad: [on audio clip] All right. 

00:29:13.967 --> 00:29:18.800
So here we have just one small indication
that music is, well,

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.433
it behaves very strangely.

00:29:21.433 --> 00:29:24.000
Jad Abumrad: I'll just drop it out there.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.833
But it's one of those things
where it makes you realize like,

00:29:25.833 --> 00:29:31.367
if a word repeated can become music,
then what the hell is music really?

00:29:31.367 --> 00:29:32.200
You know?

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.400
Robert Krulwich: Do you, do you,
do you --

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.500
when you hear your own phrases that
you have invented for certain pieces,

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.733
do they sometimes seem fresh to you?

00:29:41.733 --> 00:29:43.367
Sometimes stale to you?

00:29:43.367 --> 00:29:46.567
Because things are going round and round.

00:29:46.567 --> 00:29:47.767
Zoë Keating: Yeah, definitely. 

00:29:47.767 --> 00:29:53.200
I mean, one of the tricks of being a performer
is to try to make your pieces new every day,

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.833
if you're performing day after day.

00:29:54.833 --> 00:29:56.567
And I know that I am --

00:29:56.567 --> 00:30:01.000
things are going well if I can play
a little phrase and I don't get bored.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.067
But often, it's such a subtle difference.

00:30:03.067 --> 00:30:08.433
It's like, it's some really subtle thing
that happens at the end of the bar

00:30:08.433 --> 00:30:14.333
that makes it interesting for five minutes
or interesting for ten seconds. [laughs]

00:30:14.333 --> 00:30:16.100
Robert Krulwich: And when it's at ten second,

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:20.200
when you're having an OCD moment
with the phrase, can you bury it?

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.533
I mean, it's in this machine.

00:30:22.533 --> 00:30:27.333
Can you say, with your foot,
"Go away now?"

00:30:27.333 --> 00:30:28.467
Zoë Keating: Yes, yes I can.

00:30:28.467 --> 00:30:29.133
Robert Krulwich: OK.

00:30:29.133 --> 00:30:30.033
Zoë Keating: Yeah, yeah I can.

00:30:30.033 --> 00:30:31.300
Robert Krulwich: Yet there is something about

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:36.633
what both of you do that you both
play with time in an interesting way.

00:30:36.633 --> 00:30:43.333
For you, something is made and then goes
around and round and round and builds.

00:30:43.333 --> 00:30:53.600
And it seems like you are always
thinking about more, less, stop, go.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.033
It's interesting.

00:30:55.033 --> 00:30:56.733
Why do you guys like each other?

00:30:56.733 --> 00:31:00.333
[audience laughter]

00:31:00.333 --> 00:31:00.967
Jad Abumrad: Yeah. She's nice.

00:31:00.967 --> 00:31:04.267
Robert Krulwich: I'm making
a presumption about --

00:31:04.267 --> 00:31:07.967
Jad Abumrad: I'll speak about
what I find fascinating.

00:31:07.967 --> 00:31:09.533
I think Zoë's music is amazing.

00:31:09.533 --> 00:31:10.733
So there's-- 

00:31:10.733 --> 00:31:11.933
Zoë Keating: And I think Radiolab
is amazing.

00:31:11.933 --> 00:31:13.800
Jad Abumrad: It's not an entirely
rational thing.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:18.933
But I like imagining that when you're
playing there's first just one Zoë

00:31:18.933 --> 00:31:20.667
and then suddenly there are two Zoë's,

00:31:20.667 --> 00:31:22.300
and then there are four Zoë's,
and then there are eight.

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:28.067
And suddenly there's an entire, entire quantum
orchestra that is created in the moment. 

00:31:28.067 --> 00:31:31.467
And the Toscanini is your left foot there.

00:31:31.467 --> 00:31:33.200
Zoë Keating: But that is
kind of true in a way.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.033
I spent most of my teenage years
playing in orchestras

00:31:36.033 --> 00:31:38.967
and it was like a peak experience
for me, was to play in an orchestra.

00:31:38.967 --> 00:31:43.800
And then it did dawn on me recently that I might
have recreated the cello section for myself.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.433
[Robert Krulwich laughs]

00:31:45.433 --> 00:31:46.400
Digitally.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.567
Robert Krulwich: Can you do one -- 

00:31:47.567 --> 00:31:48.833
before we get to questions and answers,

00:31:48.833 --> 00:31:53.867
is there anything else you'd like to,
just to, you and your foot?

00:31:53.867 --> 00:31:54.733
Zoë Keating: Do my foot?

00:31:54.733 --> 00:31:56.100
Robert Krulwich: To play, I mean.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:56.967
Zoë Keating: Yeah, I could play.

00:31:56.967 --> 00:31:59.300
Robert Krulwich: And your hand.
I shouldn't really demote your hand.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.400
Zoë Keating: Yeah, I'll play another piece.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.700
Robert Krulwich: It's just the foot
that's so interesting.

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.667
Zoë Keating: This one has some starting
and stopping in it, which you might like.

00:32:03.667 --> 00:32:04.700
Robert Krulwich: OK.

00:32:12.933 --> 00:37:57.400
[Zoë plays cello]

00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:03.567
[applause]

00:38:03.567 --> 00:38:04.300
Zoë Keating: Thank you. 

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.533
[applause]

00:38:08.533 --> 00:38:11.033
My socks are very slippery.

00:38:11.033 --> 00:38:12.400
Robert Krulwich: Your socks are slippery.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.500
Zoë Keating: Yeah, I usually
don't play in socks.

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:14.833
I have special performance shoes 

00:38:14.833 --> 00:38:20.267
that have toes that are pointy
and rubber and very elegant shoes.

00:38:20.267 --> 00:38:21.567
And I didn't bring them.

00:38:21.567 --> 00:38:22.433
So I have to do socks.

00:38:22.433 --> 00:38:26.067
Robert Krulwich: Where do you shop
for cello-foot, cello-feet shoes?

00:38:26.067 --> 00:38:27.667
Zoë Keating: It's not something
you can look for on Zappos.

00:38:27.667 --> 00:38:31.100
It's not one of the categories.
[laughter]

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:31.967
Robert Krulwich: So, what is it, 

00:38:31.967 --> 00:38:36.567
the original intended use for the shoe
that you use was jogging?

00:38:36.567 --> 00:38:39.033
Zoë Keating: [laughs] I think
just looking nice.

00:38:39.033 --> 00:38:39.567
Robert Krulwich: Looking nice. 

00:38:39.567 --> 00:38:41.833
Robert Krulwich: OK. 

00:38:41.833 --> 00:38:43.000
Question time. 

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.200
The only
rule I was told was that apparently 

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.867
if you can't get to a microphone then
you just shout it out and I'll repeat it.

00:38:49.867 --> 00:38:57.067
If you can, which is there's one here,
and then let's do that.

00:38:57.067 --> 00:39:01.033
[pause] 

00:39:01.033 --> 00:39:02.100
male #1: Hi, thank you.

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.200
Robert Krulwich: Let's see,
you have to turn on the mic, there.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.000
male #1: Check, one, two.
Robert Krulwich: There you go.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000
male #1: Hi, thank you for coming.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.900
Love the show. 

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.367
For me, the third dimension
from words and music,

00:39:10.367 --> 00:39:12.900
if I had to stretch it out, would be imagery.

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:17.300
And I found it was hard for me
in Zoë's first song

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.767
to block out that imagery
that came with that song.

00:39:20.767 --> 00:39:25.167
I believe it was on TED XSF,
her website, correct?

00:39:25.167 --> 00:39:26.167
Zoë Keating: Ah. I didn't know that.

00:39:26.167 --> 00:39:27.333
male #1: So, I had a hard time--

00:39:27.333 --> 00:39:29.133
Robert Krulwich: Oh, this is
hardcore fandom here.

00:39:29.133 --> 00:39:30.867
Zoë Keating: I didn't know
that that was on the website.

00:39:30.867 --> 00:39:35.267
Robert Krulwich: The shoe salesman with her
who sold her the thing will be along shortly, I think.

00:39:35.267 --> 00:39:40.833
male #1: But the subsequent
song is much easier to not have preacquired
image in my mind.

00:39:40.833 --> 00:39:43.767
Zoë Keating: It's like when you hear
something in commercials.

00:39:43.767 --> 00:39:49.267
male #1: They were city shots of
the San Francisco Bay area and the bridges.

00:39:49.267 --> 00:39:53.233
Zoë Keating: Hmm. Well, I'm gonna
have to see this.

00:39:53.233 --> 00:39:53.900
male #1: So I was curious, 

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.767
I saw also that you played mostly
with your eyes closed

00:39:56.767 --> 00:39:58.933
and it helped me with the latest song,
just to close my eyes.

00:39:58.933 --> 00:40:01.667
Very different watching you versus
just having my eyes closed.

00:40:01.667 --> 00:40:06.533
So, does that help you in forming that three
dimensional shape that you had in mind?

00:40:06.533 --> 00:40:09.400
Zoë Keating: Yeah. I'm a very
deliberate eye-closer.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.700
I close my eyes for two reasons.

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:14.933
One is that I don't know if you know,
but when I close my eyes, I'm invisible.

00:40:14.933 --> 00:40:17.500
[audience laughter]

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:21.000
And so, and it really helps me perform
when I know that I'm invisible.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.100
And the second reason 
is that it just helps me--

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.100
Robert Krulwich: It's alarming to the rest of us.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:28.467
Zoë Keating: Yeah, yeah it is. 
But you can, just the cello remains. 

00:40:28.467 --> 00:40:33.200
But, and the other reason is that that landscape
of sound that I was talking about that,

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.633
it's like I can see it when I close my eyes.

00:40:35.633 --> 00:40:39.300
And if I open my eyes, I see you
and it makes it very hard.

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:40.100
There's this kind of disconnect 

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:42.733
between what I'm seeing and
what I'm creating with the music.

00:40:42.733 --> 00:40:45.400
So, if I close my eyes, then it's all,
it's right there.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:47.667
Jad Abumrad: Are they all
with you in that place?

00:40:47.667 --> 00:40:49.433
Or is it by yourself?

00:40:49.433 --> 00:40:50.033
Zoë Keating: The landscapes? 

00:40:50.033 --> 00:40:53.433
No. I'm definitely not alone
by any means.

00:40:53.433 --> 00:40:55.633
Robert Krulwich: I close my eyes
when we were, actually.

00:40:55.633 --> 00:40:57.100
Do you close yours?

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:58.400
Jad Abumrad: You do close your eyes. 

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.567
'Cause often, I'm gesticulating like-Robert?

00:41:01.567 --> 00:41:02.967
Robert Krulwich: [laughs] I do.
I do it.

00:41:02.967 --> 00:41:04.433
I don't know why.

00:41:04.433 --> 00:41:07.367
I wanna be by myself in tandem but --

00:41:07.367 --> 00:41:09.333
[audience laughter]

00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:11.367
Jad Abumrad: Together, but alone.

00:41:11.367 --> 00:41:12.033
male #1: Thank you.

00:41:14.033 --> 00:41:18.833
male #2: I close my eyes when I'm listening to ,
well, when I'm not driving.

00:41:18.833 --> 00:41:20.500
And anyway, thanks for the show. 

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:25.300
It's amazing how you bring science
and sound effects and everything.

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.700
It's so compelling in a way.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:31.367
So, one thing that, and the show
definitely sounds different

00:41:31.367 --> 00:41:35.400
from anything else 
on the radio or anywhere.

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.333
One thing I know that you do every show,

00:41:37.333 --> 00:41:42.467
that you get people who appeared
on the show to read the credits.

00:41:42.467 --> 00:41:43.400
So I'm just wondering.

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.333
Do you just really play back everything
they recorded on your answering machine,

00:41:47.333 --> 00:41:50.633
or you edit it out in some way?

00:41:50.633 --> 00:41:51.433
Jad Abumrad: What do you mean? 

00:41:51.433 --> 00:41:54.867
Do we use their voices, you mean like
all the fumbles and mispronunciations?

00:41:54.867 --> 00:41:55.833
male #2: I know it's--

00:41:55.833 --> 00:42:02.300
Robert Krulwich: Thank you, Jad A-bim-rad.
Did I get that right.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.600
Jad Abumrad: Like, part of the whole,
part of the whole thing for us is just,

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:08.933
'cause we're two idiots who are wandering
through the world trying to figure things out.

00:42:08.933 --> 00:42:11.767
And somewhere along the way,

00:42:11.767 --> 00:42:13.300
we started doing this whole credits thing

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.567
because the credits, credits are
like one of these puzzles and--

00:42:15.567 --> 00:42:16.533
Robert Krulwich: We're not allowed to say them.

00:42:16.533 --> 00:42:17.400
It's a legal thing.

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:22.967
Apparently the people at NYC decided that hosts
of any editorial product should not advertise.

00:42:22.967 --> 00:42:25.433
So then the choice to say,

00:42:25.433 --> 00:42:28.000
"Money brought to you by blah blah
blah blah," was not available to us.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.800
Jad Abumrad: And it's also,
I mean it's just generally,

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:32.533
like, it's tune out time 
when there's the credits.

00:42:32.533 --> 00:42:36.333
So we're like, "How can make it not a tune
out moment and make it a fun moment?"

00:42:36.333 --> 00:42:39.967
And so, we had people start reading
the credits and they instantly pronounced,

00:42:39.967 --> 00:42:42.800
mispronounced my name 400 times.

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:45.233
Every time, we're like,
"Is, is kind of funny."

00:42:45.233 --> 00:42:46.267
[audience member laughs]

00:42:46.267 --> 00:42:50.433
So it somehow reinforced
the notion of ourselves that we have,

00:42:50.433 --> 00:42:52.467
which is that we're not gonna
take ourselves too seriously.

00:42:52.467 --> 00:42:53.433
Robert Krulwich: There's also,
I think--

00:42:53.433 --> 00:42:56.000
male #2: Your name, the name
of the foundation that funds you.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.767
Jad Abumrad: Well, we try and keep those
from not being pronounced.

00:42:58.767 --> 00:43:01.600
They have less of a sense
of humor about it than I do.

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.200
Robert Krulwich: I think there's another
sort of a richer thought here

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.167
that all journalism is a package

00:43:07.167 --> 00:43:11.100
and when it's done on ABC or NBC,
you know the package very well.

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:13.933
And when it's done on NPR you know
the package very well, actually.

00:43:13.933 --> 00:43:16.933
So we decided to make that
a little bit more transparent.

00:43:16.933 --> 00:43:20.067
So we have people whose headphones
fall off in the middle of interviews

00:43:20.067 --> 00:43:21.867
and they have to find them on the floor.

00:43:21.867 --> 00:43:24.633
We always keep that stuff.
[audience laughter]

00:43:24.633 --> 00:43:26.067
Jad Abumrad: It's true.

00:43:26.067 --> 00:43:27.000
male #2: [laughs] Thank you very much.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.067
Jad Abumrad: Sure, thank you.

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.000
male #3: Hi, my name is Mark.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.900
And Zoë, I just wanted to say first
that your music is extraordinary.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:34.833
It's really beautiful.

00:43:34.833 --> 00:43:35.600
Zoë Keating: Thank you.
male #3: So thank you.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:37.267
Jad Abumrad: Mark, I would like to say
that your t-shirt is extraordinary.

00:43:37.267 --> 00:43:38.067
Robert Krulwich: Extraordinary.
[audience laughter]

00:43:38.067 --> 00:43:39.400
Zoë Keating: Yeah, I love that t-shirt.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.433
male #3: I'm surprised I'm not seeing more.

00:43:40.433 --> 00:43:42.567
Go to chopshop.com, or whatever it is.

00:43:42.567 --> 00:43:43.433
They're great. 

00:43:43.433 --> 00:43:50.133
So for Jad and Robert, I think Google and
Radiolab share a mission in some sense.

00:43:50.133 --> 00:43:54.500
That is, organizing information
and making it accessible.

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.533
There's some things I think Google
does better than you,

00:43:56.533 --> 00:43:57.667
but there are a lot of things that they --

00:43:57.667 --> 00:44:01.067
Robert Krulwich: Like what?
[audience laughter]

00:44:01.067 --> 00:44:01.533
male #3: Scale.

00:44:01.533 --> 00:44:02.267
Robert Krulwich: Just asking.

00:44:02.267 --> 00:44:03.067
male #3: Scale.

00:44:03.067 --> 00:44:03.500
Robert Krulwich: Scale.

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:04.533
male #3: Scale and different languages.

00:44:04.533 --> 00:44:05.133
Robert Krulwich: That's fair.

00:44:05.133 --> 00:44:06.600
Jad Abumrad: Revenue might
be another one too.

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:09.933
[audience laughter]

00:44:09.933 --> 00:44:14.267
male #3: So, but there's some things that
I think that you do a lot better than us.

00:44:14.267 --> 00:44:19.433
For one thing, I think making stories
and information sticky,

00:44:19.433 --> 00:44:20.533
I know you did a show on that.

00:44:20.533 --> 00:44:24.533
But also you make it consumable
in a way that I don't have to,

00:44:24.533 --> 00:44:27.000
I can do other things while
I'm consuming the information.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:27.700
I can drive.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:28.367
I can work out.

00:44:28.367 --> 00:44:29.933
I can do things like that.

00:44:29.933 --> 00:44:31.900
So my question for you is this.

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:33.600
In Google Search in particular,

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.633
I think we're stuck on the "words"
end of that spectrum.

00:44:36.633 --> 00:44:39.900
So how would you fix Google Search?

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:47.967
[audience laughter]

00:44:47.967 --> 00:44:49.633
Robert Krulwich: How much [audience laughter]
should we charge for this answer?

00:44:49.633 --> 00:44:51.400
Jad Abumrad: Yeah.

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.567
male #4: Sounds like an interview.

00:44:52.567 --> 00:44:55.600
male #3: You can think about it
and do a show on it.

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:57.400
Jad Abumrad: How to fix Google Search. 

00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:03.567
Does Google still have like
"I just wanna like get lucky" option?

00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:05.400
[audience laughter]

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.900
male #3: In many ways, yes.
[audience laughter]

00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:13.800
Jad Abumrad: I think that came out of
my mouth wrong, but you know what I mean.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:20.400
Robert Krulwich: Well, I mean one of the things
that Google doesn't do very much of is--

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:25.367
we do leave the written word
and the literal words behind

00:45:25.367 --> 00:45:28.800
and we do play with the sounds a lot. 

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:35.500
And so, the business
of searching for an answer.

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:36.200
You're right.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:40.367
A lot of journalism is done
where a reporter goes,

00:45:40.367 --> 00:45:42.267
decides on a question
that they wanna solve.

00:45:42.267 --> 00:45:45.067
And then goes and reads a book
and interviews people

00:45:45.067 --> 00:45:47.367
and takes notes and gets it down.

00:45:47.367 --> 00:45:50.167
And then, in a voice
as authoritative as they can,

00:45:50.167 --> 00:45:51.667
trying to sound omniscient,
they say,

00:45:51.667 --> 00:45:55.067
[speaks deep, nonsense syllables],

00:45:55.067 --> 00:45:56.333
this sort of sound.

00:45:56.333 --> 00:46:02.733
And our plan right from the beginning
was to say "we don't know".

00:46:02.733 --> 00:46:06.267
We begin by stumbling around.

00:46:06.267 --> 00:46:11.100
And you see, people use Google to stumble, 

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:15.333
but we are actually trying to
try to figure something out.

00:46:15.333 --> 00:46:18.367
What's very interesting for us is,

00:46:18.367 --> 00:46:23.533
because we wanted people to hear
what it's like to ask stupid questions,

00:46:23.533 --> 00:46:27.167
what it's like to argue
in the middle of an investigation,

00:46:27.167 --> 00:46:29.500
what's it like to interpret data.

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:33.833
We had a huge fight about
falling cats the other month.

00:46:33.833 --> 00:46:36.467
We wanted to let people know
that there is no,

00:46:36.467 --> 00:46:39.167
that it's not a binary business that you
don't know. 

00:46:39.167 --> 00:46:41.067
Beep. You know.

00:46:41.067 --> 00:46:42.400
That there's a middle.

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.800
And the middle is where most people live

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.400
and the middle is where most
people are afraid to go.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.767
If you don't think you're gonna
understand something,

00:46:48.767 --> 00:46:52.700
you try to wait for someone else
to solve it for you.

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:57.967
What our secret advertisement
is is you can, too. Like, look at us.

00:46:57.967 --> 00:46:59.167
Jad Abumrad: Yeah, it's funny.

00:46:59.167 --> 00:47:02.767
It's to applying that to
the Search question.

00:47:02.767 --> 00:47:08.133
Given that there is no bright shining line
between knowledge and ignorance,

00:47:08.133 --> 00:47:11.567
that the hierarchy of the search
results sometimes is misleading.

00:47:11.567 --> 00:47:14.900
And there's such a premium placed
on being first or second or third,

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:17.100
or on that first page. 

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.533
And there's something about the format

00:47:18.533 --> 00:47:24.200
which sort of creates an expectation
of relevance that somehow,

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:26.800
maybe if you could confound
that in some way,

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.967
but still keep it ordered.

00:47:28.967 --> 00:47:33.267
So there's some sort of presentational thing
that maybe it could represent the information

00:47:33.267 --> 00:47:36.267
in a different way and different dimension.

00:47:36.267 --> 00:47:39.100
Robert Krulwich: Yeah, cause I always think
when you're looking for an answer, 

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.133
sometimes as in a library,

00:47:41.133 --> 00:47:45.033
you get caught in the middle of
your search by some other idea.

00:47:45.033 --> 00:47:48.933
And then you just turn around and
suddenly you're doing something else.

00:47:48.933 --> 00:47:52.533
And the fun, and the surprise,

00:47:52.533 --> 00:47:58.133
of looking for one thing and finding
another is missing in a very teleological,

00:47:58.133 --> 00:47:59.700
very directed search.

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:02.100
In Googleland,

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:03.700
 "So you want to know X.

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:07.767
We'll move step by step by step
inevitably towards X."

00:48:07.767 --> 00:48:08.467
Whereas we say,

00:48:08.467 --> 00:48:09.733
"You want to know X.

00:48:09.733 --> 00:48:12.133
Well that's nice.

00:48:12.133 --> 00:48:15.733
And then, you know."
[audience laughter]

00:48:15.733 --> 00:48:17.933
And you forget why you came here. 

00:48:17.933 --> 00:48:20.033
In Google, you don't ever forget.

00:48:20.033 --> 00:48:21.867
I mean, actually that's not fair.

00:48:21.867 --> 00:48:24.433
Jad Abumrad: I'm not sure that makes
a terrible amount of business sense

00:48:24.433 --> 00:48:27.100
to give people what they don't want,

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:31.867
but we'll get back to you on that.

00:48:31.867 --> 00:48:32.367
male #3: Well good.

00:48:32.367 --> 00:48:33.400
Jad Abumrad: We'll send you a bill, too.

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.733
male #3: All right, I look forward to the amounts.
Thank you very much.

00:48:35.733 --> 00:48:36.933
Robert Krulwich: Thank you.

00:48:38.533 --> 00:48:41.867
male #4: So, a while ago, I don't know
if you're still doing this or not,

00:48:41.867 --> 00:48:47.533
you could send a text to a number
to donate ten dollars to WNYC.

00:48:47.533 --> 00:48:49.567
And I thought that was a really great idea.

00:48:49.567 --> 00:48:51.633
And so, one thing I wanted
to encourage you.

00:48:51.633 --> 00:48:55.267
So this is my question, which is
really a thinly disguised request,

00:48:55.267 --> 00:49:00.833
is could you encourage WNYC
to allow people to donate easily?

00:49:00.833 --> 00:49:03.300
'Cause when I tried, every time
I hear the radio, I'm like,

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:04.600
"I really want to support these guys."

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.133
So I go to WNYC and
I start filling out the form.

00:49:07.133 --> 00:49:09.767
And then I get to the second page
and I'm still filling out a form.

00:49:09.767 --> 00:49:11.000
And then I get to the third page and I'm like,

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.333
"I don't want to tell you 
how much my median income is.

00:49:13.333 --> 00:49:14.600
I just want to give you money.

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:16.533
Take the money, please."
[audience laughter]

00:49:16.533 --> 00:49:18.300
So, yes.

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:23.233
I would love if you would encourage
the encouragement of the program.

00:49:23.233 --> 00:49:27.733
Robert Krulwich: We are in a peculiar situation
where we have a large number of listeners

00:49:27.733 --> 00:49:32.033
who are very much in that mood
and we are terrible business people.

00:49:32.033 --> 00:49:33.033
[audience laughter]

00:49:33.033 --> 00:49:37.100
And we haven't quite figured out
how to pluck coins from their pockets

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:38.933
because, I think, we also get lost.

00:49:38.933 --> 00:49:44.000
I think we're so busy making the thing
that we forgot to pay for the thing in a way.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.433
And so, we do have to get back. 

00:49:45.433 --> 00:49:47.300
We do have a lot of homework
to do in that area.

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:50.400
Jad Abumrad: Yeah. But the business
model is basically what you just,

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.533
you are the business model, basically.

00:49:52.533 --> 00:49:53.333
I like you.

00:49:53.333 --> 00:49:55.633
I would like to support you.

00:49:55.633 --> 00:49:56.333
So, yeah, you're right.

00:49:56.333 --> 00:49:59.933
The mechanism of that is sometimes
clumsy and we're working on it.

00:49:59.933 --> 00:50:05.400
But it's all about just people in a sense, 

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.800
giving you money from their heart in a way.

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:08.833
And--

00:50:08.833 --> 00:50:12.733
Robert Krulwich: Like you know,
she's making a pile at heart.

00:50:12.733 --> 00:50:15.033
Jad Abumrad: We have, we have
a lot to learn from her. [laughter]

00:50:15.033 --> 00:50:17.700
Robert Krulwich: She is. Like, how much
do you charge on iTunes for your songs?

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:20.200
Zoë Keating: Well, iTunes is flat.
It's 99 cents per song.

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:20.867
Robert Krulwich: 99 cents per song.

00:50:20.867 --> 00:50:23.567
Zoë Keating: But on Bandcamp, I have
a minimum of eight dollars for an album.

00:50:23.567 --> 00:50:24.633
Robert Krulwich: Minimum of eight dollars?
Zoë Keating: Yeah.

00:50:24.633 --> 00:50:27.033
Robert Krulwich: What's your average receipt?

00:50:27.033 --> 00:50:28.333
Jad Abumrad: Can they give you
more than eight if they want to?

00:50:28.333 --> 00:50:29.933
Zoë Keating: Yeah, they can
give me anything they want.

00:50:29.933 --> 00:50:33.167
And so, some people will give me
a hundred dollars or fifty dollars.

00:50:33.167 --> 00:50:37.167
But the average is $12.

00:50:37.167 --> 00:50:39.567
Robert Krulwich: So the average
is well above what's required?

00:50:39.567 --> 00:50:40.267
Zoë Keating: Mm-hmm.

00:50:40.267 --> 00:50:42.133
Robert Krulwich: So is that a kiss?

00:50:42.133 --> 00:50:43.100
Zoë Keating: It's definitely a kiss.

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:43.433
Robert Krulwich: It's a kiss.

00:50:43.433 --> 00:50:44.100
Zoë Keating: Yeah.

00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:46.500
Robert Krulwich: So there's a big,
fat kiss out there.

00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:48.667
And all you have to do is
just get your lips next to it.

00:50:48.667 --> 00:50:50.567
It's like -- 
she's closer than we are.

00:50:50.567 --> 00:50:52.100
[audience laughter]

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:56.467
But that's, that's a business model,
is to pucker, somehow.

00:50:56.467 --> 00:50:58.500
[laughter]

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:03.667
male #5: And I heard one slightly e-mistake
earlier on, of mentioning Radiohead.

00:51:03.667 --> 00:51:05.133
Actually got me thinking of,

00:51:05.133 --> 00:51:08.067
well, there's actually Radiohead uses
some of the same techniques

00:51:08.067 --> 00:51:09.200
you use in sound editing.

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.900
And I'm wondering,
are they an inspiration to you?

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:15.000
Is it something that
you try to strive towards, or--

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:15.933
Robert Krulwich: We're suing them.

00:51:15.933 --> 00:51:17.700
Jad Abumrad: Yeah.
[audience laughter]

00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:20.500
male #5: Will you tour with
them soon?

00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:22.367
Jad Abumrad: Well, you know Radiohead. 

00:51:22.367 --> 00:51:26.633
Those guys are inspired by the same
people that we're inspired by, sonically.

00:51:26.633 --> 00:51:32.733
I mean, that's a rock band that
pulls in avant classical influences.

00:51:32.733 --> 00:51:34.933
It pulls in electronic influences.

00:51:34.933 --> 00:51:38.700
It's not concerned with genre borders.

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:41.100
And I think we're the same way. 

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:46.333
I mean, the fun of it just on the craft level
and also just in this chatty level is to, 

00:51:46.333 --> 00:51:49.667
is to disrespect borders. 

00:51:49.667 --> 00:51:54.400
So an interview becomes
a weird bit of Radio Theater,

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:58.733
which then becomes a strange
sonic landscape,

00:51:58.733 --> 00:52:00.833
which then just becomes
a conversation again.

00:52:00.833 --> 00:52:04.533
Like, those very distinct borders that
you hear in other shows

00:52:04.533 --> 00:52:08.167
are the very things we try
and destroy just for fun.

00:52:08.167 --> 00:52:11.600
And I think Radiohead has
the same approach to, to music.

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:16.300
I'm not inspired by them specifically,
although I like them, personally. 

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.833
male #5: Thank you very much.

00:52:18.833 --> 00:52:22.100
Robert Krulwich: I have some, here, also,
I guess these come from somewhere,

00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:24.333
but go ahead.
I, I will--

00:52:24.333 --> 00:52:24.867
female #1: Are you sure?

00:52:24.867 --> 00:52:25.900
Robert Krulwich: Yes. Go ahead.

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:27.167
female #1: This is for Zoë. 

00:52:27.167 --> 00:52:28.567
I actually grew up playing cello.

00:52:28.567 --> 00:52:30.967
And so, I love what you do
for multiple reasons.

00:52:30.967 --> 00:52:31.933
I mean, obviously, I'm at Google. 

00:52:31.933 --> 00:52:33.533
So I'm a huge technerd.

00:52:33.533 --> 00:52:35.000
So I love what you do with that.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.733
I also, I personally never enjoyed
playing in symphony very much,

00:52:38.733 --> 00:52:43.500
so I love that you get to do what you want
and really bring out the cello music,

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:45.033
because, of course,
it's the best instrument.

00:52:45.033 --> 00:52:46.767
But--
[audience laughter]

00:52:46.767 --> 00:52:48.333
Yes. Yes.

00:52:48.333 --> 00:52:48.967
Big cello geeks.

00:52:48.967 --> 00:52:50.400
Anyway. 
My question for you actually--

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.333
Robert Krulwich: You're gonna be killed
by a violist one say.

00:52:52.333 --> 00:52:54.167
[audience laughter]

00:52:54.167 --> 00:52:55.600
female #1: Yeah, that might happen.

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:57.500
Yep, that might. 

00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:01.400
My question for you is when you're not
writing your own music,

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:02.867
how do you hone your craft?

00:53:02.867 --> 00:53:06.133
Is there certain classical music
that you still learn and practice?

00:53:06.133 --> 00:53:08.033
How do you hone your craft?

00:53:08.033 --> 00:53:10.833
Zoë Keating: Yeah, actually,
I do practice classical music

00:53:10.833 --> 00:53:14.100
because there's nothing quite
like it for improving your technique.

00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:16.733
Because I can get really lazy
if I just do what I want.

00:53:16.733 --> 00:53:20.033
It's like I just go to the fridge
and I keep eating the pickles.

00:53:20.033 --> 00:53:22.967
Left to my own devices.

00:53:22.967 --> 00:53:24.433
So, occasionally, I go--

00:53:24.433 --> 00:53:26.867
Robert Krulwich: There's a metaphor for you.

00:53:26.867 --> 00:53:30.300
Zoë Keating: and I practice,
I really like to work through,

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.967
I have all these books
of orchestral excerpts,

00:53:31.967 --> 00:53:33.767
which is the cello parts
for various symphonies.

00:53:33.767 --> 00:53:37.167
I like to play that 'cause it's really good.

00:53:37.167 --> 00:53:40.400
Symphonic music is all about blending,
and so I work hard to blend.

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:42.867
And then I also spend
a lot of time improvising.

00:53:42.867 --> 00:53:45.300
Like, it's really important not just on my own,

00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:50.900
but when I can with other people,
because just to sort of broaden your horizons.

00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:52.467
And then, just allow myself
to make mistakes

00:53:52.467 --> 00:53:57.267
cause I have a tendency to make things more
and more and more and more and more perfect,

00:53:57.267 --> 00:54:00.633
until they're dead. 

00:54:00.633 --> 00:54:05.667
And it's important to add that
element of chaos back in.

00:54:05.667 --> 00:54:06.467
female #1: OK, thank you.

00:54:06.467 --> 00:54:06.800
Zoë Keating: Yeah.

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:08.767
Robert Krulwich: Before we go on to the next
question, though, you should stand by.

00:54:08.767 --> 00:54:09.867
This comes from Kate Bee.

00:54:09.867 --> 00:54:13.967
This must be from the diaspora of Google,
like Google Other Campus.

00:54:13.967 --> 00:54:14.800
No? 

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:15.367
Where is this from?

00:54:15.367 --> 00:54:16.533
Where are these people?

00:54:16.533 --> 00:54:18.033
presenter: From the Radiolab on Facebook.

00:54:18.033 --> 00:54:19.500
Robert Krulwich: Radiolab's Facebook page. 

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:21.067
Our own people. OK.

00:54:21.067 --> 00:54:22.533
But are they part of this? 

00:54:22.533 --> 00:54:23.500
Are they looking at us?

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:29.300
Oh, OK. Hello, Kate Bee.
That's her name, Kate B-E-E, as in the insect,

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:30.633
which is a nice thing. 

00:54:30.633 --> 00:54:33.233
If you could collaborate
with anyone living, 

00:54:33.233 --> 00:54:35.400
artists, scientists, writer, anyone,

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.900
who would it be and
what would the project be?

00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:42.267
Jad and you.

00:54:42.267 --> 00:54:43.267
Jad Abumrad: And what
was the question again?

00:54:43.267 --> 00:54:44.633
If I could collaborate with anyone living?

00:54:44.633 --> 00:54:45.733
Robert Krulwich: You could
collaborate with anyone living.

00:54:45.733 --> 00:54:51.933
He could be, she could be a scientist,
a writer, a DJ, artist, anyone.

00:54:51.933 --> 00:54:55.067
Who would you like to collaborate with?

00:54:55.067 --> 00:54:57.667
Jad Abumrad: Zoë, you go first.

00:54:57.667 --> 00:55:01.767
Zoë Keating: No. I was hoping
you would go first so I can think.

00:55:01.767 --> 00:55:10.933
Jad Abumrad: Well, OK, here's my--
roundabout way of answering that question. 

00:55:10.933 --> 00:55:15.600
So, recently, I've been really
fascinated with-- what?

00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:18.033
You and I have already
collaborating on things.

00:55:18.033 --> 00:55:20.700
This is an aspirational question.

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:21.800
This is not for someone who's not---

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:23.100
Robert Krulwich: I didn't want to be left out.

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:25.367
Jad Abumrad: Okay.
Robert Krulwich.

00:55:25.367 --> 00:55:27.700
Robert Krulwich: Thank you.
Anybody else?

00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:30.633
Jad Abumrad: Well, yes.

00:55:30.633 --> 00:55:36.200
Recently, I've been really fascinated by
this guy Joshua Davis, who does visual art.

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.200
And he works with computers.

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:41.767
And he programs these computers
to have, like to make pictures for him.

00:55:41.767 --> 00:55:44.167
He'll give the computer certain rules

00:55:44.167 --> 00:55:48.167
having to do with shapes and how the shapes
intersect and which colors go together.

00:55:48.167 --> 00:55:49.533
And he just hits the space bar 

00:55:49.533 --> 00:55:55.567
and the computer just barfs out
thousands of pictures.

00:55:55.567 --> 00:55:58.667
And some of them are ugly and
some of them are amazingly beautiful.

00:55:58.667 --> 00:56:00.733
And he then, acts as a kind of curator. 

00:56:00.733 --> 00:56:03.900
And he like, "Oh, no, no, no, no, oh,
that looks nice, no, no, no, no, that's nice."

00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:12.133
And he then basically, he's the curator
of his machines artistic output.

00:56:12.133 --> 00:56:13.600
And there's something kind
of cool about that for me.

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.500
There's something very "of this moment"

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:20.933
that the machines have become
so brilliantly capable,

00:56:20.933 --> 00:56:22.700
but artistically dumb.

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:24.300
They don't know what's pretty. 

00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:25.100
They don't know what's good,

00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:28.067
but they can make things that are
much better than us at this point. 

00:56:28.067 --> 00:56:29.300
So, I don't know. 

00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:32.600
Maybe I'd collaborate with
Joshua Davis's machines.

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:34.100
[audience laughter]

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:35.633
Zoë Keating: That's a good answer.
I know that-

00:56:35.633 --> 00:56:38.667
I know who I want to collaborate with,

00:56:38.667 --> 00:56:41.233
but I don't know who they are yet.

00:56:41.233 --> 00:56:42.233
If that answers the question.

00:56:42.233 --> 00:56:46.733
Robert Krulwich: So, if that's a shape
in your head, what kind of a shape is it?

00:56:46.733 --> 00:56:48.700
Zoë Keating: What I really wanna do
is I wanna collaborate with someone

00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:53.333
to try to render this landscape
in a visual way.

00:56:53.333 --> 00:56:55.800
Like, as I'm playing it on stage.

00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:59.033
And just sort of experiment
with that in projections

00:56:59.033 --> 00:57:01.767
and a new graphical environment on stage.

00:57:01.767 --> 00:57:03.567
Jad Abumrad: But you've don't that
before in some way, right?

00:57:03.567 --> 00:57:06.067
Zoë Keating: I've done it
in small bits but never fully,

00:57:06.067 --> 00:57:12.600
like, somebody who's really involved in going
all out to try to figure it out as a problem.

00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:15.133
So I'm actually looking
for that person.

00:57:15.133 --> 00:57:15.733
Jad Abumrad: Google.

00:57:15.733 --> 00:57:19.100
Robert Krulwich: Maybe you're that person,
who can, -- who are you?

00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:20.033
male #6: My name is Hunter.
Hello.

00:57:20.033 --> 00:57:23.933
Robert Krulwich: Hi, Hunter. 

00:57:23.933 --> 00:57:26.367
male #6: Very small graphics ability.

00:57:26.367 --> 00:57:29.167
Actually, I had a question for Zoë.

00:57:29.167 --> 00:57:30.567
The new album is awesome.

00:57:30.567 --> 00:57:33.633
"Don't Worry" is what I wake up
to every morning.

00:57:33.633 --> 00:57:34.167
Zoë: Thanks.

00:57:34.167 --> 00:57:35.800
male #6: But I was wondering.

00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:43.000
So you do a lot of like, textual, with everything
being laid on top of each other.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.467
And I was wondering, are you thinking about
doing anything like with a soundscape?

00:57:46.467 --> 00:57:47.933
Like with stereo. 

00:57:47.933 --> 00:57:53.967
Have things kind of at different points so
you can hear different parts and pull it out?

00:57:53.967 --> 00:57:58.533
Zoë Keating: You mean, more like doing things
like just, with less instruments, or--

00:57:58.533 --> 00:58:01.233
male #6: No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
like instead of just stereo,

00:58:01.233 --> 00:58:04.167
just having like 5.1 or some sort
of three-dimensional soundscape.

00:58:04.167 --> 00:58:05.067
Zoë Keating: Oh, yeah. 
Oh, of course. 

00:58:05.067 --> 00:58:08.900
I'm always, I'm always for more,
bigger, better, more. [laughs]

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:11.200
More dimensions, yeah.

00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:16.533
That's, I actually, somebody, I have
a recording I'm gonna work on next,

00:58:16.533 --> 00:58:20.733
which would be the idea is to do it as
hi res as possible with surround sound.

00:58:20.733 --> 00:58:22.267
male #6: Oh, cool.
Very cool.

00:58:22.267 --> 00:58:25.867
Have you considered ever releasing
any songs as multitracks

00:58:25.867 --> 00:58:27.933
so other people could play around with it?

00:58:27.933 --> 00:58:32.067
Zoë Keating: Yes. Yes. People ask all the time
and I have a database of loops, 

00:58:32.067 --> 00:58:34.533
because every time I have a performance,
the loops are there.

00:58:34.533 --> 00:58:35.467
I save them.

00:58:35.467 --> 00:58:39.167
And so, since I used to be
an information architect,

00:58:39.167 --> 00:58:43.200
I thought I should just make
some way to categorize them all

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:46.833
and then people could pick and, pick
and choose from the database of loops.

00:58:46.833 --> 00:58:49.533
Jad Abumrad: It would be cool
if from the moment you performed,

00:58:49.533 --> 00:58:53.067
somehow there's some backend thing
just throwing them into the internet.

00:58:53.067 --> 00:58:55.167
Zoë Keating: Could be. Somebody
might find that useful.

00:58:55.167 --> 00:58:57.567
Jad Abumrad: Somebody here I bet
could do that in like, five minutes.

00:58:57.567 --> 00:59:00.067
[audience laughter]

00:59:00.067 --> 00:59:05.167
Robert Krulwich: You have some
work questions. I'm good.

00:59:05.167 --> 00:59:06.767
Before you go, 
this is from Jeff Seamster. 

00:59:06.767 --> 00:59:10.567
He wants to know what are
your three favorite sounds.

00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:14.833
Zoë Keating: I love trains.

00:59:14.833 --> 00:59:17.300
Robert Krulwich: Trains. 

00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:18.467
Trains. 

00:59:18.467 --> 00:59:19.767
That's one.

00:59:19.767 --> 00:59:25.667
While you're thinking of the other two,
Jad, three favorite sounds.

00:59:25.667 --> 00:59:27.833
Jad Abumrad: The hum of the refrigerator.

00:59:27.833 --> 00:59:28.767
Robert Krulwich: You're making this up.

00:59:28.767 --> 00:59:30.633
Jad Abumrad: Well, I don't know. 

00:59:30.633 --> 00:59:31.767
I'm not sure it's my favorite.

00:59:31.767 --> 00:59:33.433
But it's on the list somewhere.

00:59:33.433 --> 00:59:35.767
Zoë Keating: My son's giggle.

00:59:35.767 --> 00:59:37.433
Robert Krulwich: Yeah, we like that.

00:59:37.433 --> 00:59:38.867
Jad Abumrad: I see that one, too.

00:59:38.867 --> 00:59:40.633
Robert Krulwich: OK, while you're thinking,
you ask something.

00:59:40.633 --> 00:59:42.433
[audience laughter]

00:59:42.433 --> 00:59:45.767
male #7: So, Robert, earlier you asked
how Zoë and Jad are alike.

00:59:45.767 --> 00:59:49.567
And it occurred to me, especially listening
to their answers to the questions,

00:59:49.567 --> 00:59:53.800
that one of the really interesting ways
is how you play with the intersection

00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:59.200
between craftsmanship and serendipity
in the things that you produce.

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:02.733
And I guess that's one the things
that is while,

01:00:02.733 --> 01:00:06.200
makes Radiolab sound so interesting
and so different to me,

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.067
is how, and Zoë, your music as well,

01:00:09.067 --> 01:00:13.000
whereas a classical piece is very
well crafted and very well honed.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.667
And while a normal radio piece
is often very scripted

01:00:16.667 --> 01:00:19.533
and has that authoritative voice
that you mentioned.

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:21.100
Radiolab is much more conversational,

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:23.967
has much more serendipity thrown in.

01:00:23.967 --> 01:00:26.467
And so I guess my question
is about your process.

01:00:26.467 --> 01:00:29.000
How you balance the two.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.933
Do you just get a bunch of stuff together?

01:00:30.933 --> 01:00:32.167
Do you get a bunch of music together?

01:00:32.167 --> 01:00:34.600
And then you hone it, hone it, hone it
and that's what you produce?

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.633
Or, do you have to go
back and forth sometimes?

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:38.867
How does that, 
how does that work?

01:00:38.867 --> 01:00:43.600
Robert Krulwich: Our method is completely,
completely ridiculous by almost any measure.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:48.567
It's conceived as an anti Ira Glass, I think.
[audience laughter]

01:00:48.567 --> 01:00:54.033
'Cause we very much admire him,
but we couldn't bear to be like him.

01:00:54.033 --> 01:00:56.500
We just wanna be like, 
as good but different.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.600
And that's actually hard. 

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.800
He's so good in so many places.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:03.700
So we decided just stupidly that one of
the things that he does a lot is he reads.

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:05.433
Everybody on that show reads
from the script.

01:01:05.433 --> 01:01:06.767
So we decided arbitrarily.

01:01:06.767 --> 01:01:09.467
We're not reading.

01:01:09.467 --> 01:01:14.000
That led to the most bizarre production
system ever invented by anyone.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:14.333
Jad Abumrad: Yes. 

01:01:14.333 --> 01:01:18.000
You see what will happen is like;
one of us will make a thing.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.767
We'll come in with our thing
and it's really like, it's made.

01:01:20.767 --> 01:01:25.533
It's like, indelible and perfect
and like she was saying, dead.

01:01:25.533 --> 01:01:26.200
Right?

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:30.500
And then, we'll put it there and
then we'll start yakking at it

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:35.367
and we'll throw all the yak in and then
it gets really long and loose and flabby.

01:01:35.367 --> 01:01:36.900
And then we're like, 
"It's long and loose and flabby."

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.933
So we cut it back, 
cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, 

01:01:39.933 --> 01:01:44.100
and it's kind of beautiful again,
but it's not totally dead but it's sort of dead.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:44.900
So we're like, "OK." 

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.267
So then we yak at it again,
da-da-da-da-da-da, 

01:01:47.267 --> 01:01:49.833
put that back in and
it's a little less flabby,

01:01:49.833 --> 01:01:51.300
but then it needs to get cut back.

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.567
And there's tension.

01:01:52.567 --> 01:01:53.667
Robert Krulwich: What this means,
by the way,

01:01:53.667 --> 01:01:55.367
in real life is that we are
actually going into the studio

01:01:55.367 --> 01:01:57.400
and have sound that goes, "blahblahblahblahblahblah,"

01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:01.500
and then I go,
"wawawawawaawwawawa".

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:04.967
We put it all together and
then that sounded good.

01:02:04.967 --> 01:02:08.500
And then we do the whole thing over again
because we didn't like it.

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.900
And then we take it and some of the previous
one and we do that over again.

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:16.467
And then it gets down to wheedly things,
'cause of the musician in him will say like,

01:02:16.467 --> 01:02:18.900
"That should be the answer."

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:19.667
"Well, I just said that."

01:02:19.667 --> 01:02:21.767
He says, "No. You said that
should be the answer.

01:02:21.767 --> 01:02:24.667
THAT should be the answer,"
and it gets like that.

01:02:24.667 --> 01:02:27.200
It gets really ridiculous--

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.267
Jad Abumrad: It doesn't really
get like that, Robert.

01:02:29.267 --> 01:02:31.667
I mean, honestly, 
let's just think about it.

01:02:31.667 --> 01:02:34.100
 Do we ever talk, "That?" 

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:38.533
No, it's all just like vomited out
and it gets edited into being.

01:02:38.533 --> 01:02:42.000
It is actually, on some level, improvised;
almost everything in the show.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.567
Robert Krulwich: That's true.

01:02:43.567 --> 01:02:47.833
So, yes.
And it's musical, really.

01:02:47.833 --> 01:02:50.133
The logic of it is musical. 

01:02:50.133 --> 01:02:52.333
And that's, that's the difference, I guess.

01:02:52.333 --> 01:02:57.733
I think other journalism outfits just try to
be authoritative and right and on time.

01:02:57.733 --> 01:03:03.967
And ours has to be beautiful in some
way that exists right between us.

01:03:03.967 --> 01:03:06.900
And we don't have the same
sense of beauty all the time,

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:11.033
except in the very, very last,
last iteration, we kinda do.

01:03:11.033 --> 01:03:12.600
It would be as if you were making, 

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:18.367
you had a vase and he had
an iris and daisy and a tulip.

01:03:18.367 --> 01:03:21.867
And I had an iris and a daisy and a tulip,
and you can put them in in any,

01:03:21.867 --> 01:03:23.167
you can snip them and over.

01:03:23.167 --> 01:03:28.200
And the thing is you have to agree at a certain
point that that's a beautiful arrangement. 

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:33.933
And it's so delicate and so weird and
so hard to get and then when you get it,

01:03:33.933 --> 01:03:35.433
we seem to agree.

01:03:35.433 --> 01:03:39.367
Jad Abumrad: Yeah. And it is, and I think you
actually, in your question, captured it really.

01:03:39.367 --> 01:03:44.600
It is, in some sense,
about a kind of like gladiatorial dual

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:49.867
between the part of you that likes to organize
and the part of you that wants anarchy.

01:03:49.867 --> 01:03:53.667
And then the two of them
have to fight to a draw,

01:03:53.667 --> 01:03:57.433
I feel like for Radiolab to
get a special, special groove.

01:03:57.433 --> 01:03:58.733
Robert Krulwich: OK, let's, thank you. 

01:03:58.733 --> 01:04:03.067
One more and then maybe a Zoë
and then we'll waltz out of here.

01:04:03.067 --> 01:04:04.233
male #8: Hi.
Thanks again for coming.

01:04:04.233 --> 01:04:05.967
I'm Dan. 

01:04:05.967 --> 01:04:11.533
So currently, public radio is
under attach in a lot of ways.

01:04:11.533 --> 01:04:16.267
And Radiolab is a show
that often engages in big,

01:04:16.267 --> 01:04:20.233
philosophical questions that often
have political implications about

01:04:20.233 --> 01:04:24.433
humanness and life and all that stuff. 

01:04:24.433 --> 01:04:28.133
And I was just wondering if you guys
have come under any scrutiny

01:04:28.133 --> 01:04:33.133
or had been criticized at all
from listeners or people

01:04:33.133 --> 01:04:36.267
within the larger public radio world? 

01:04:36.267 --> 01:04:38.667
And if so, how do you
deal with that?

01:04:38.667 --> 01:04:40.167
How do you respond?

01:04:40.167 --> 01:04:41.233
Jad Abumrad: We've been criticized,

01:04:41.233 --> 01:04:44.900
not in the way that public radio
has been criticized now,

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:47.600
but we get criticized
for using too many sounds.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:52.433
We get criticized sometimes by,
very rarely actually,

01:04:52.433 --> 01:04:55.867
by scientists who feel like
we're being too poetic,

01:04:55.867 --> 01:04:58.067
or we're using too many metaphors.

01:04:58.067 --> 01:05:01.433
We get criticized by people who don't
wanna hear so many layers.

01:05:01.433 --> 01:05:04.767
They just wanna hear someone
talking in a plain, simple way.

01:05:04.767 --> 01:05:09.000
We get those kinds of,
those criticisms constantly.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.833
Not the other kind.
Thank you.

01:05:10.833 --> 01:05:13.033
Robert Krulwich: I don't know
how we've been exempt from,

01:05:13.033 --> 01:05:15.800
I mean, we don't have a right-wing
kind of cabal that's saying,

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:21.867
"We know the real reason
why you chose looping for your show.

01:05:21.867 --> 01:05:22.600
It's part of the--

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:24.967
"No, we don't. I don't know how
we've avoided those people.

01:05:24.967 --> 01:05:27.100
Yeah, socialist looping.

01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:29.133
We haven't had that.
[audience laughter]

01:05:29.133 --> 01:05:30.833
male #8: Can I ask a quick follow-up question?
Robert Krulwich: Yeah.

01:05:30.833 --> 01:05:32.433
male #8: Robert, I heard a rumor

01:05:32.433 --> 01:05:36.000
that you have an impression
of conservative talk radio.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:36.967
Is that true?

01:05:36.967 --> 01:05:38.233
[audience laughter and clapping]

01:05:38.233 --> 01:05:38.900
Robert Krulwich: No, I don't. 

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.800
male #8: Do you have
an impression of NPR?

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:41.833
Robert Krulwich: I like,

01:05:41.833 --> 01:05:47.667
I mean, frankly some of the people who do
conservative talk radio arevery talented.

01:05:47.667 --> 01:05:49.133
They can be very funny.

01:05:49.133 --> 01:05:51.900
Jad Abumrad: Rush Limbaugh actually is,
have you ever listened to him in the morning?

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:54.500
It's amazingly produced.
I mean--

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.567
Robert Krulwich: I don't do
impressions of him, though.

01:05:56.567 --> 01:05:57.467
Jad Abumrad: Yeah.

01:05:57.467 --> 01:06:00.733
Robert Krulwich: Yeah. I actually had
problems because I was, at one point,

01:06:00.733 --> 01:06:04.700
suspended from NPR because I take,
I have a Zelig problem.

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:07.100
So, I can listen, 
if I listen to something intensely,

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:09.900
or go to a place where everybody's
talking in a certain way,

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:11.800
I inadvertently talk like them.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.933
So I was suspended once for
going to the Texas State Fair at NPR

01:06:14.933 --> 01:06:16.667
and becoming a Texan inadvertently.

01:06:16.667 --> 01:06:18.000
I didn't hear that I was one.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.067
[audience laughter]

01:06:19.067 --> 01:06:20.000
And that happened again 

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:26.067
when I was interviewing the President of
the United States’ National Security Advisor.

01:06:26.067 --> 01:06:27.000
He was Polish.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.867
Zbigniew Brzezinski was his name.

01:06:28.867 --> 01:06:31.667
And the interview started,
and I said, "How are doing?"

01:06:31.667 --> 01:06:33.100
He said, 
"I'm Zbigniew Brzezinski."

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:35.067
And I think in the middle, I was already, 

01:06:35.067 --> 01:06:37.567
I was, [speaking in heavy Polish accent]
"So you have a cold?"

01:06:37.567 --> 01:06:39.000
[audience laughter]

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.533
And that was very bad. 

01:06:41.533 --> 01:06:45.133
So that's why I try to avoid impressions
whenever possible.

01:06:45.133 --> 01:06:48.367
But thank you very much for not avoiding us,
like so many of you.

01:06:48.367 --> 01:06:49.033
Jad Abumrad: Yes, thank you very much.

01:06:49.033 --> 01:06:51.800
Robert Krulwich: So let's hear one more
from Zoë and then we'll say goodbye.

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.200
Do you have anything you wanna?

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.033
Zoë Keating: Well, if you guys can
bear to hear "Optimist" again.

01:06:56.033 --> 01:06:57.533
Robert Krulwich: We can.
Jad Abumrad: Always.

01:06:57.533 --> 01:06:58.800
Zoë Keating: OK.
Jad Abumrad: Please.

01:07:02.133 --> 01:07:04.467
Zoë Keating: I dropped my bow.

01:07:04.467 --> 01:07:06.033
Robert Krulwich: Optimists
never drop their bow.

01:07:06.033 --> 01:07:08.967
You have to change the song now.

01:07:08.967 --> 01:07:11.233
Jad Abumrad: It's a cool story,
I mean, this song for you.

01:07:11.233 --> 01:07:12.333
It came from a cool place.

01:07:12.333 --> 01:07:14.200
Do you just wanna set it up real fast?

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.033
Zoë Keating: Yeah, It's a song
that I wrote for my son, Alex,

01:07:16.033 --> 01:07:20.067
who's ten months old and I wrote it
when he was negative four months.

01:07:20.067 --> 01:07:21.733
So, yeah.

01:07:21.733 --> 01:07:22.467
I hope he likes it.

01:07:22.467 --> 01:07:24.400
Robert Krulwich: So he's into this tune
in all kinds of ways.

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.000
[Zoë laughs] 

01:07:33.933 --> 01:11:50.300
[Zoë plays cello] 

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:52.100
[audience applause]

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:52.700
Zoë Keating: Thank you.

01:11:52.700 --> 01:12:06.667
[applause]

01:12:06.667 --> 01:12:09.567
Jad Abumrad: Sure. Again, thanks
so much for having us.

01:12:09.567 --> 01:12:10.500
We had a great time.

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:15.733
It's really cool and inspiring to be here
and we'll be hanging out.

01:12:15.733 --> 01:12:16.267
Robert Krulwich: Thanks.

01:12:16.267 --> 01:12:17.600
[audience applause] 
01:12:17.600,00:00:00.000
