00:07:52.273 --> 00:07:54.940
&gt;&gt;  I'm going to get my glasses,
if I can find them.

00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:57.551
Good afternoon.

00:08:00.682 --> 00:08:03.564
Justice Thomas, who is in the 
room downstairs, distinguished 

00:08:03.565 --> 00:08:08.684
guest and colleagues, thank you 
for joining the law Library of 

00:08:08.685 --> 00:08:10.685
Congress and the United 

00:08:13.799 --> 00:08:16.643
States Supreme Court today for 
the 2018 Supreme Court Fellows 

00:08:16.644 --> 00:08:18.644
Program annual lecture.

00:08:20.783 --> 00:08:22.783
My name is Jane Sanchez and I 
have the 

00:08:24.457 --> 00:08:26.457
honor of serving as the 25th Law
Librarian of Congress.

00:08:28.292 --> 00:08:30.292
A little bit about the library.

00:08:32.387 --> 00:08:35.042
The law library serves as the 
nation's custodian of a legal 

00:08:35.043 --> 00:08:37.043
and legislative 

00:08:38.752 --> 00:08:40.831
collection of nearly 3 million 
items from all countries and 

00:08:40.832 --> 00:08:42.832
legal systems of the world.

00:08:46.236 --> 00:08:48.280
Our foreign law specialists are 
a diverse group of foreign 

00:08:48.281 --> 00:08:50.281
trained 

00:08:52.541 --> 00:08:54.541
attorneys who provide 
information and 

00:08:56.222 --> 00:08:58.658
analysis on over 270 
jurisdictions in the world.

00:09:05.418 --> 00:09:07.465
Our skilled law library staff, 
both American trained attorneys 

00:09:07.466 --> 00:09:09.466
and law 

00:09:10.521 --> 00:09:13.409
librarians also provide research
assistance and reference 

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.903
services on U.S. federal and 
state legal issues.

00:09:20.778 --> 00:09:22.778
While our collections and our 
expertise 

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.785
reach across all points of the 
globe, for today's event we've 

00:09:26.786 --> 00:09:30.468
partnered with our next-door 
neighbor, who happens to be the 

00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:32.469
highest court in the country.

00:09:34.181 --> 00:09:36.439
By the way, they are pretty good
neighbors.  They're quiet and 

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.932
they keep to themselves pretty 
much.

00:09:41.986 --> 00:09:43.986
This afternoon we are pleased to
be able 

00:09:45.288 --> 00:09:47.288
to collaborate with the Supreme 
Court as 

00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:51.155
they celebrate their 45th year 
of the Fellows Program.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.302
Please note that today's program
is being live-streamed on the 

00:09:56.303 --> 00:10:01.776
Library of Congress YouTube 
channel, so all sound, images 

00:10:01.777 --> 00:10:03.777
and remarks will be captured on 
video.

00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:07.011
Please take a moment to silence 
your 

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.633
cell phones and refrain from 
taking photos on any devices 

00:10:10.634 --> 00:10:13.311
throughout the event.  For that 
we would thank you.

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:19.218
At this time, I would like to 
invite to the stage, Jeffrey P.

00:10:22.703 --> 00:10:25.408
Minear, executive director of 
the Supreme Court Fellows 

00:10:25.409 --> 00:10:28.291
Program and counselor to the 
Chief Justice of the United 

00:10:28.292 --> 00:10:31.295
States.  Thank you.

00:10:34.303 --> 00:10:39.061
[Applause]
&gt;&gt; JEFFREY MINEAR: Thank you, 

00:10:39.062 --> 00:10:41.062
Jane, for the warm introduction.

00:10:44.406 --> 00:10:46.241
And thanks to you and the law 
Library of Congress for your 

00:10:46.242 --> 00:10:48.285
partnership with the Fellows 
Program in sponsoring this 

00:10:48.286 --> 00:10:50.286
afternoon's event.

00:10:53.774 --> 00:10:55.613
Since its creation in 1832 when 
John Marshall was serving as 

00:10:55.614 --> 00:10:58.916
Chief Justice, the law library 
has been an important resource 

00:10:58.917 --> 00:11:01.765
and steady friend of the court. 
We could not ask for a better 

00:11:01.766 --> 00:11:06.044
neighbor than the largest law 
library in the world, and 

00:11:06.045 --> 00:11:08.711
they're pretty quiet too.  Let 
me say a word about the Supreme 

00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:11.349
Court Fellows Program and my 
capacity as its executive 

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:15.738
director.  Each year the Supreme
Court fellows commission made up

00:11:15.739 --> 00:11:18.402
of judges and other legal 
leaders appointed by the Chief 

00:11:20.278 --> 00:11:22.327
Justice selects four talented 
professionals to spend a year 

00:11:22.328 --> 00:11:24.570
within the federal judiciary 
participating in court 

00:11:25.804 --> 00:11:27.637
administration while engaging in
research and other enrichment 

00:11:27.638 --> 00:11:31.095
opportunities.
This afternoon's event is the 

00:11:31.096 --> 00:11:35.776
public component of two days of 
activities in which we celebrate

00:11:35.777 --> 00:11:37.777
our current Supreme 

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:40.664
Court fellows and bring together
45 years of Fellows Program 

00:11:40.665 --> 00:11:42.665
alumni.

00:11:43.925 --> 00:11:45.755
Over the course of today and 
tomorrow we'll select next 

00:11:45.756 --> 00:11:47.804
year's fellows from the superb 
finalists with us this 

00:11:47.805 --> 00:11:50.056
afternoon.
I understand we have many law 

00:11:50.057 --> 00:11:52.511
students with us in the audience
today, as well 

00:11:56.175 --> 00:11:56.779
as law clerks from several 
courts in the federal and state 

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:01.475
systems.  If you have an 
interest in how federal courts 

00:12:01.476 --> 00:12:03.739
work I hope you will take time 
to learn about the Fellows 

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.740
Program and consider applying in
a future year.

00:12:10.695 --> 00:12:14.378
I invite you to go to website 
fellows .supreme Court.gov.  

00:12:14.379 --> 00:12:16.379
Applications for the 2020 class 
will be due in November.

00:12:18.193 --> 00:12:19.424
But before you set to work on 
your applications, we have a 

00:12:19.425 --> 00:12:21.425
great feature this afternoon.

00:12:24.096 --> 00:12:25.332
We have as our distinguished 
guest the 105th justice of the 

00:12:25.333 --> 00:12:29.258
Supreme Court of the United 
States, the Honorable Clarence 

00:12:29.259 --> 00:12:31.259
Thomas, who has served on the 
court since 1991.

00:12:33.749 --> 00:12:35.749
Ten years ago Justice Thomas 
published 

00:12:38.251 --> 00:12:41.319
his best-selling autobiography, 
"my grandfather's son."  It 

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.364
shared in his own words his 
remarkable American story.  I 

00:12:44.365 --> 00:12:46.409
commend it to anyone seeking a 
compelling read.  We have the 

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.678
book available for purchase here
and at the Supreme Court gift 

00:12:49.679 --> 00:12:51.679
shop.

00:12:53.558 --> 00:12:54.993
We are fortunate to have with us
also Gregory Maggs to moderate 

00:12:54.994 --> 00:12:56.994
today's conversation.

00:12:58.064 --> 00:12:59.905
When we planned this program, 
Greg was a professor at George 

00:12:59.906 --> 00:13:03.977
Washington University Law 
School, but in the past month 

00:13:03.978 --> 00:13:05.191
he's received his judicial 
commission as a judge of the 

00:13:05.192 --> 00:13:07.192
United States court of appeals 
for the Armed Forces.

00:13:10.333 --> 00:13:12.563
Judge Maggs was a law clerk to 
Justice Thomas in 1991 and 

00:13:12.564 --> 00:13:14.564
before that to justice Anthony 
Kennedy.

00:13:17.667 --> 00:13:19.667
Please join me in welcome 
Justice Thomas and Judge Maggs.

00:13:23.751 --> 00:13:25.816
[Applause]

00:13:43.196 --> 00:13:43.599
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Do you feel 
comfortable?

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.600
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: No.

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:51.143
This is not the most suitable 
position for introverts, but you

00:13:51.144 --> 00:13:53.144
can ask.

00:13:54.449 --> 00:13:56.449
We like to be in the shadows 
someplace.

00:13:56.512 --> 00:13:57.736
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: They're having
a great time...

00:13:57.737 --> 00:13:58.801
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: It was just 

00:13:58.802 --> 00:14:02.051
fine back there.  You don't have
anything to do?

00:14:02.637 --> 00:14:05.297
[ Laughter ]
Oh, my goodness!

00:14:07.947 --> 00:14:09.947
Sorry y'all are dragging 
yourselves out on this day.

00:14:11.429 --> 00:14:13.429
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Mr.

00:14:15.316 --> 00:14:17.316
Minear mentioned the 10th 
anniversary 

00:14:18.391 --> 00:14:20.391
of the publication of your book 
"my grandfather's son."

00:14:21.241 --> 00:14:22.474
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: I had 
forgotten about that.

00:14:22.475 --> 00:14:23.902
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: I thought I 
would start by asking you 

00:14:23.903 --> 00:14:25.903
questions ant the book.

00:14:27.577 --> 00:14:28.794
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: So you're 
Judge Maggs now.

00:14:28.795 --> 00:14:33.314
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: About a week.
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: I think 

00:14:33.315 --> 00:14:35.315
that's great.

00:14:37.026 --> 00:14:38.475
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: Just 

00:14:38.476 --> 00:14:40.476
changing the subject.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.510
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Yeah.

00:14:48.073 --> 00:14:51.329
Justice, you start out the book 
when you're nine years old.  Why

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.330
is that the place to start your 
autobiography?

00:14:55.614 --> 00:14:57.614
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: You know, I 
had the 

00:15:01.715 --> 00:15:03.715
manuscript to that and Terry 
Teachott, 

00:15:04.777 --> 00:15:06.777
my final editor, just a 
phenomenal human 

00:15:08.302 --> 00:15:12.597
being and editor and musician.  
And he understood.  He dug deep 

00:15:12.598 --> 00:15:14.598
into the manuscript and he 

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.690
said, you know, you have a great
title.

00:15:20.792 --> 00:15:22.734
I had picked out the title to 
"My Grandfather's Son," but he 

00:15:22.735 --> 00:15:27.285
said you have to explain the 
title within the first page or 

00:15:27.286 --> 00:15:29.113
two, and he said, I found the 
explanation buried in your 

00:15:29.114 --> 00:15:33.783
manuscript.  And the line is "I 
was nine years old when I met my

00:15:33.784 --> 00:15:35.784
father q.

00:15:36.865 --> 00:15:38.865
"  And he said, most people 
wouldn't think of that.

00:15:41.765 --> 00:15:43.765
Because ultimately my 
grandfather is my father.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:48.870
So I'm my grandfather's son, not
my father's son.

00:15:50.782 --> 00:15:52.782
So that was my first encounter 
that I remember with my father.

00:15:54.796 --> 00:15:56.796
And so that's why I started it 
out 

00:15:59.756 --> 00:16:01.756
there, to explain why I was my 
grandfather's son.

00:16:02.626 --> 00:16:04.626
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Life didn't 
start out too easy.

00:16:06.082 --> 00:16:07.513
You mention in the book you grew
up in Pinpoint, and then in a 

00:16:07.514 --> 00:16:11.597
home that didn't have water, 
didn't have electricity.  When 

00:16:11.598 --> 00:16:13.243
the house burned down you moved 
to Savannah and conditions got 

00:16:13.244 --> 00:16:15.244
worse.

00:16:16.702 --> 00:16:18.702
I think you write that in the 
winter 

00:16:20.794 --> 00:16:21.390
of 1995 you remember being 
hungry.

00:16:21.391 --> 00:16:24.650
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: 1955.  I was
doing fine in 1995.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.880
[ Laughter ]

00:16:29.349 --> 00:16:30.811
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: 1955, you were
hungry without knowing when you 

00:16:30.812 --> 00:16:33.254
would eat and cold without 
knowing when you would be warm.

00:16:33.255 --> 00:16:35.255
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: That's a 
horrible feeling.

00:16:39.851 --> 00:16:41.851
But, you know, today we kind of 
-- I just get worn down.

00:16:44.544 --> 00:16:47.409
I was with a young woman who 
happened to be black in Kansas 

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:49.410
recently, and she said something
really interesting.

00:16:51.913 --> 00:16:53.762
She said, I'm really tired of 
having to play the role of being

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:55.763
black.  I just want to go to 
school.

00:16:59.901 --> 00:17:02.585
And I think we -- at some point 
we're going to be fatigued with 

00:17:02.586 --> 00:17:04.586
everybody being a victim.

00:17:08.926 --> 00:17:11.734
When I was a kid, there were 
tons of people who were in 

00:17:11.735 --> 00:17:13.735
really bad circumstances.

00:17:16.417 --> 00:17:18.417
My grandfather would not let us 
wallow in that.

00:17:20.281 --> 00:17:22.281
And as you could tell throughout
this book, he's my hero.

00:17:25.596 --> 00:17:27.596
He is the single greatest human 
being I have ever met.

00:17:30.903 --> 00:17:32.903
Nine months of education, but he
never saw himself as a victim.

00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:39.114
He used to say he was a 
motherless child.  He never knew

00:17:39.115 --> 00:17:41.115
his father.

00:17:42.788 --> 00:17:45.218
His mother died when he was 
seven or eight years old.  Of 

00:17:45.219 --> 00:17:48.093
course, they didn't have birth 
certificates then, so he never 

00:17:48.094 --> 00:17:50.094
knew quite how old he was.

00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:54.253
And then he was raised by his 
grandmother, who was a freed 

00:17:54.254 --> 00:17:56.254
slave.

00:17:57.683 --> 00:18:00.332
Then she dies and then he lives 
with an uncle who has 12 or 13 

00:18:00.333 --> 00:18:05.296
kids and who was a hard man.
And yet he never complained.

00:18:08.723 --> 00:18:11.630
And he always said -- he would 
have this saying "When you want 

00:18:11.631 --> 00:18:13.631
to whine or something...

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:17.090
He said, "you know, you have to 
play the hand you're dealt."

00:18:20.593 --> 00:18:23.241
This those days blacks played 
big Whigs a lot.  You have to 

00:18:23.242 --> 00:18:25.681
play the hand you're dealt.  If 
you're dealt a bad hand, you 

00:18:25.682 --> 00:18:28.345
still have to play it.  When we 
whine about things -- if you 

00:18:30.578 --> 00:18:32.011
look at the bust in my office, 
my wonderful wife had made for 

00:18:32.012 --> 00:18:34.012
me when I 

00:18:35.582 --> 00:18:37.582
went on the court, his favorite 
quote 

00:18:38.591 --> 00:18:40.591
was

00:18:41.765 --> 00:18:43.765
"old man" can't "is dead, I 
helped bury him.

00:18:46.112 --> 00:18:47.125
I don't know if you saw the 
movie" The Help ."  That's my 

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:49.126
family.  We were the help.

00:18:53.646 --> 00:18:55.897
My mother maid $10 a week, $5 
more if you had car fare.  My 

00:18:55.898 --> 00:18:57.898
mother was a maid.

00:18:59.861 --> 00:19:02.709
My grandmother had been a maid. 
Cousin Bea was a maid.

00:19:06.784 --> 00:19:10.239
Cousin Doshier was a maid.  All 
of them were maids.  And they 

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:14.316
were the help.  And yet they 
never ever complained.  And life

00:19:14.317 --> 00:19:18.084
was hard.  I mean, the things 
that we consider hard today -- I

00:19:18.085 --> 00:19:20.137
had some college students ask me
a few years back how 

00:19:24.017 --> 00:19:26.884
would I explain, you know, talk 
to them now that the economy had

00:19:26.885 --> 00:19:29.785
taken a down turn?  And I 
said...

00:19:31.835 --> 00:19:33.052
And I'm looking at them and I 
said, how many of you don't have

00:19:33.053 --> 00:19:35.764
cell phones?
Of course, they all had cell 

00:19:35.765 --> 00:19:37.405
phones.
How many of you don't have a 

00:19:37.406 --> 00:19:41.307
computer?
They all had computers.

00:19:42.121 --> 00:19:43.538
How many of you don't have a 
car?  I think all but one had a 

00:19:43.539 --> 00:19:45.539
car.

00:19:48.463 --> 00:19:50.311
I said, you're so far above the 
poverty line, and when I was in 

00:19:50.312 --> 00:19:52.312
school, you were at the poverty 
line.

00:19:54.785 --> 00:19:58.436
You're making 90 cents an hour, 
you had no money, no shoes.  You

00:19:58.437 --> 00:20:00.383
had like boots and things like 
that.  And you didn't worry 

00:20:00.384 --> 00:20:02.624
about it.  Because virtually 
everybody was there.

00:20:05.502 --> 00:20:07.980
And so when the economy took a 
down turn, when you're on the 

00:20:07.981 --> 00:20:09.981
floor, there isn't a whole lot 
further you can go.

00:20:14.298 --> 00:20:15.523
And for them, they're losing 
from up here to maybe midway 

00:20:15.524 --> 00:20:19.242
down.  So I really had no 
connection with them.

00:20:21.298 --> 00:20:23.298
But my further point...
[ Laughter ]

00:20:24.144 --> 00:20:26.192
I didn't have a radio.  I didn't
have a telephone.

00:20:27.426 --> 00:20:29.426
And they're complaining.  And I 
certainly didn't have a car.

00:20:30.302 --> 00:20:34.162
But it wasn't a problem.  
Because you had your dreams.  

00:20:34.163 --> 00:20:36.810
You had your energy.  You had 
more than the people you grew up

00:20:36.811 --> 00:20:38.811
around.

00:20:40.939 --> 00:20:42.381
I grew up around a world of 
total illiteracy.  That's the 

00:20:42.382 --> 00:20:44.382
beauty.  I'm in the Library of 
Congress.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:50.141
Total illiteracy.  But the thing
they had was hope that the next 

00:20:50.142 --> 00:20:52.142
generation would learn how to 
read.

00:20:53.203 --> 00:20:55.203
They knew how important it was 
for me.

00:20:55.861 --> 00:20:57.498
So my grandfather wouldn't let 
me take -- I was a really good 

00:20:57.499 --> 00:21:00.949
athlete too.  I don't like to 
say that because then people 

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:04.236
want you to kind of show that 
you were a great athlete.  And 

00:21:04.237 --> 00:21:06.237
it's kind of too late in the day
now.

00:21:06.476 --> 00:21:08.476
[ Laughter ]

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.646
But the -- he would not give us 
time off to play sports.  We 

00:21:13.647 --> 00:21:15.887
worked on the oil truck or on 
the farm.  But if it had to do 

00:21:15.888 --> 00:21:17.888
with the library, you could do 
it.

00:21:21.803 --> 00:21:24.684
So at night he would let me go 
to the Carnegie Library where I 

00:21:24.685 --> 00:21:26.685
started going 

00:21:29.161 --> 00:21:31.161
in the summer of 1955 for the 
noble 

00:21:32.225 --> 00:21:34.051
reason that summer of '55, I was
seven years old and we just 

00:21:34.052 --> 00:21:36.052
moved into this 

00:21:37.744 --> 00:21:40.626
little tenement on the east 
side, and on Saturday, they gave

00:21:40.627 --> 00:21:42.627
you cookies and juice.

00:21:45.116 --> 00:21:47.195
So I went for the very 
high-minded reason of getting 

00:21:47.196 --> 00:21:49.856
cookies and juice.
And when you live in these 

00:21:51.747 --> 00:21:53.747
neighborhoods, cookies and juice
are a real treat.

00:21:55.275 --> 00:21:57.275
Along the way, they introduce 
you to Dr. Seuss.

00:22:01.607 --> 00:22:02.623
And if I hear "see spot run" one
more time...

00:22:02.624 --> 00:22:04.624
But it was wonderful.

00:22:05.975 --> 00:22:08.346
And you got cookies and juice.
But it gave me this image of the

00:22:08.347 --> 00:22:13.703
library as this place to learn, 
and it became a haven.  So I 

00:22:13.704 --> 00:22:15.704
walked in here.

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:19.390
I said, look where I am!

00:22:22.731 --> 00:22:24.354
I come from a world of 
illiteracy, treasured learning, 

00:22:24.355 --> 00:22:26.355
and I get to be in a place of 
learning with all the books and 

00:22:26.591 --> 00:22:28.591
people who are literate.

00:22:30.487 --> 00:22:32.729
So that's a long way of saying I
was very fortunate to grow up 

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:34.730
around people 

00:22:35.822 --> 00:22:37.822
who saw beyond their 
circumstances and 

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.080
who refused to be limited by 
those 

00:22:42.384 --> 00:22:44.005
circumstances or to wallow in 
the sort of victim status of 

00:22:44.006 --> 00:22:46.263
their circumstances.
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Tell me more 

00:22:46.264 --> 00:22:50.978
about your grandfather.  He was 
a very strict man.  Was he 

00:22:50.979 --> 00:22:52.831
unfair?
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: Oh, God no, 

00:22:52.832 --> 00:22:54.832
no, no.

00:22:56.924 --> 00:22:58.924
People ask sometimes about the 
nuns and my grandfather.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.180
Because in those days you had 
corporeal punishment.

00:23:04.639 --> 00:23:07.113
They said, did you get beatings?
Yeah, but not as many as I 

00:23:07.114 --> 00:23:10.492
deserved.
And my grandfather, whenever he 

00:23:10.493 --> 00:23:15.390
gave you one that he found out 
was unfair, that you didn't 

00:23:15.391 --> 00:23:17.023
deserve at that time, he said, 
that's what you got away with.

00:23:17.024 --> 00:23:21.300
And then you couldn't -- what do
you say?  Because you knew you 

00:23:21.301 --> 00:23:26.381
got away with stuff.
And every one of us knew... oh, 

00:23:26.382 --> 00:23:28.382
boy, I'm glad he didn't get me 
on that one.

00:23:29.893 --> 00:23:31.893
But, no, my grandfather was a 
hard man but not a harsh man.

00:23:32.758 --> 00:23:34.758
Life was hard.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.698
I mean, anybody in this room who
grew up in that environment, 

00:23:39.699 --> 00:23:41.699
that is a hard life.

00:23:42.975 --> 00:23:44.975
Where you have to figure out how

00:23:46.665 --> 00:23:48.665
you're going to put a meal on 
the table, 

00:23:52.369 --> 00:23:54.414
where you -- there's a very fine
line between the -- between you 

00:23:54.415 --> 00:23:56.859
not being able to eat today and 
being able to eat.

00:24:00.787 --> 00:24:01.739
And the gratitude -- we always 
said grace before and after 

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.753
meal..  We're Catholic.

00:24:08.239 --> 00:24:10.675
And he would always be grateful 
-- and this is almost -- this is

00:24:10.676 --> 00:24:15.176
the old porcelain top table.  My
grandfather sat here.  I always 

00:24:15.177 --> 00:24:18.287
sat facing him.  I don't know 
why I got that position, where 

00:24:18.288 --> 00:24:21.349
he would just stare at you.  Oh,
my God, help me!

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:25.833
And my grandmother sat here and 
my brother sat here at a small 

00:24:25.834 --> 00:24:27.834
table.

00:24:30.154 --> 00:24:32.785
And he would always say, we are 
grateful that we have food on 

00:24:32.786 --> 00:24:36.877
our table, clothes on our back 
and a roof over our head.  And 

00:24:36.878 --> 00:24:38.878
it doesn't get much better than 
that.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.408
So he was never unfair.  He was 
very generous.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.311
What he would do is -- let's 
say, he would make us work to 

00:24:47.312 --> 00:24:49.312
produce something.

00:24:51.613 --> 00:24:53.868
Then he would say, We are able 
to provide for others because we

00:24:53.869 --> 00:24:56.724
work.  So we're able to give 
them corn or 

00:25:02.453 --> 00:25:03.058
beans or peas or syrup or 
sugarcanes or fruit, because we 

00:25:03.059 --> 00:25:05.059
work.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.360
We were able to give them meat 
because we raised the hogs.

00:25:11.259 --> 00:25:12.677
What he taught us we had an 
obligation to do well so that we

00:25:12.678 --> 00:25:15.783
could do good.
Particularly for others.

00:25:17.814 --> 00:25:19.814
So I could not call that fair.

00:25:21.484 --> 00:25:24.162
I think my grand mather was 
probably one of the -- 

00:25:24.163 --> 00:25:26.244
grandfather was one of the most 
compassionate people I've known,

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:29.938
because he always told us the 
truth.  He always told us the 

00:25:29.939 --> 00:25:31.939
truth about life 

00:25:35.137 --> 00:25:37.002
and he -- so I asked my broth 
er, my brother, unfortunately, 

00:25:37.003 --> 00:25:39.879
died 18 years ago jogging.  He 
was a year and four months 

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.833
younger and he and I grew up 
with my grandparents.

00:25:47.696 --> 00:25:49.696
And I asked him when we were in 
our 40s, 

00:25:52.279 --> 00:25:54.106
we were very close, and I said, 
do you think my -- my 

00:25:54.107 --> 00:25:56.107
grandfather, we went to 

00:25:59.241 --> 00:26:00.504
live with him in '55, said, "I 
will never tell you to do as I 

00:26:00.505 --> 00:26:02.505
say.

00:26:04.292 --> 00:26:06.292
I will always tell you to do as 
I do.  Watch me."

00:26:08.976 --> 00:26:10.976
And so I asked my brother years 
later, 

00:26:12.289 --> 00:26:14.737
after my grandfather was long 
gone, was he ever a hypocrite?  

00:26:14.738 --> 00:26:16.738
And my brother said, absolutely 
not.

00:26:19.516 --> 00:26:21.516
That he lived up to that, to 
think about that.

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:24.808
Would you set yourself up as the
model and the example to your 

00:26:24.809 --> 00:26:26.809
own children?

00:26:28.478 --> 00:26:31.133
And you say, do as I do.  Watch 
me every day.

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:34.970
And once -- and we watched it.

00:26:36.265 --> 00:26:38.265
Because he would never let us 
out of his sight.

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.380
And when he did let you out of 
his sight, it was with the nuns.

00:26:43.693 --> 00:26:45.931
Or I could get away from him to 
the library.  I loved the 

00:26:45.932 --> 00:26:47.932
library.

00:26:50.414 --> 00:26:52.449
You know, the -- we take it for 
granted now because we have all 

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:57.285
these computers now and all that
stuff, but just think of 

00:26:57.286 --> 00:26:59.513
yourself coming from a house 
with no books and you get to 

00:26:59.514 --> 00:27:01.514
walk into this 

00:27:04.989 --> 00:27:06.989
world and have encyclopedia

00:27:08.452 --> 00:27:10.452
Americana, encyclopedia

00:27:12.005 --> 00:27:14.005
Britanica, it had Wagner and all
sorts 

00:27:17.978 --> 00:27:19.978
of fiction, you know, it had

00:27:22.585 --> 00:27:24.585
magazines Life, Time, all the 
newspapers.

00:27:25.674 --> 00:27:28.754
It was a smorgasbord every time 
you walked in.  And you had the 

00:27:28.755 --> 00:27:30.772
reference library and it would 
introduce you to new things.

00:27:33.825 --> 00:27:35.051
Then they introduce you to 
National Geographic, so you were

00:27:35.052 --> 00:27:39.722
all over the world.  This is all
in Savannah, Georgia.  This is a

00:27:39.723 --> 00:27:41.162
world of segregation, so it gave
you this window to everything 

00:27:41.163 --> 00:27:43.618
else.  It gave you a window 
beyond Georgia.

00:27:48.091 --> 00:27:50.091
And the nuns encouraged it, the 
librarians encouraged it.

00:27:52.146 --> 00:27:54.146
So I had an opportunity some 
years ago 

00:27:55.751 --> 00:27:57.763
to go back and write and thank 
all the librarians, and most 

00:27:57.764 --> 00:28:02.470
recently I ran into a lady in 
Savannah, an elderly white lady,

00:28:02.471 --> 00:28:04.471
because I was among the early 
kids 

00:28:06.991 --> 00:28:09.228
who went to the Savannah Public 
Library, desegregated, and I was

00:28:09.229 --> 00:28:11.229
kind of a nuisance there because
I kept showing up.

00:28:15.997 --> 00:28:16.809
It was like I was "Where's 
Waldo?"

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:19.472
Where's Clarence?  He's got to 
be here someplace.

00:28:22.974 --> 00:28:24.823
And it's time to get away from 
my grandfather, and it was just 

00:28:24.824 --> 00:28:29.641
this amazing world.  And I ran 
into this elderly white lady and

00:28:29.642 --> 00:28:31.642
she started crying.

00:28:34.048 --> 00:28:36.882
And she said, I helped you at 
the Savannah Public Library.  I 

00:28:36.883 --> 00:28:38.883
said, oh, my gosh... it was 
really kind of emotional because

00:28:40.347 --> 00:28:42.347
I remember how scared I was.

00:28:46.306 --> 00:28:47.719
You have to cross in those days 
a lot of lines, but going to the

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.896
library was worth doing then.
Anyway, that's the library.

00:28:52.787 --> 00:28:55.813
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Tell me more 
about your Catholic education.  

00:28:55.814 --> 00:28:57.814
And your decision to go to 
seminary.

00:28:57.862 --> 00:28:59.862
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: You know, I 
look 

00:29:01.639 --> 00:29:03.948
back -- I used to ask Justice 
Scalia about that.  He thought 

00:29:03.949 --> 00:29:06.005
it was interesting we were so 
similar.  He would say, 

00:29:06.006 --> 00:29:08.006
Clarence...

00:29:09.726 --> 00:29:10.987
he said, my parents, my father 
was a romance literature 

00:29:10.988 --> 00:29:13.040
professor, my mother was a 
teacher, so I know how I got 

00:29:13.041 --> 00:29:17.871
here.  How did you get here?
And why are we at the same 

00:29:17.872 --> 00:29:20.314
place?  Why do we have the same 
set of beliefs?

00:29:25.222 --> 00:29:27.222
And I think the beauty of having
gone to 

00:29:28.333 --> 00:29:31.269
parochial schools was they 
taught us how to -- there was a 

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:34.947
right way to think about things,
that we have to be honest with 

00:29:34.948 --> 00:29:37.198
ourselves, honest about math, 
honest about physics, honest 

00:29:37.199 --> 00:29:41.907
about chemistry, that you 
couldn't cheat when you did your

00:29:41.908 --> 00:29:44.142
Latin translations or German or 
French, because I had all those 

00:29:44.143 --> 00:29:49.236
in high school.
And so I was talking recently 

00:29:49.237 --> 00:29:53.140
with someone and he said, it was
your formation, that there was 

00:29:53.141 --> 00:29:55.824
always a right way to do things.
There was an honest way to do 

00:29:55.825 --> 00:29:57.825
things.

00:29:59.691 --> 00:30:01.691
And the progression is, I became

00:30:04.049 --> 00:30:07.042
Catholic when I went to the 
second grade in

00:30:10.169 --> 00:30:12.169
1955, sister Rosa, a wonderful 
person.

00:30:15.866 --> 00:30:17.866
At any rate, I became an altar 
boy and 

00:30:18.932 --> 00:30:20.932
the progression is you become an
altar 

00:30:22.416 --> 00:30:23.839
boy and if you progress as an 
altar boy you consider whether 

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.840
or not you have a vocation.

00:30:27.956 --> 00:30:29.956
In those days you went to a 
minor seminary.

00:30:32.645 --> 00:30:35.306
In 1964 I decided I thought I 
had a vocation, so I was 15 and 

00:30:35.307 --> 00:30:37.790
then following year when I was 
16 I went to seminary.

00:30:41.047 --> 00:30:41.872
The difficulty was, again, 
things hadn't been desegregated 

00:30:41.873 --> 00:30:43.873
yelt.

00:30:47.787 --> 00:30:49.411
So you were, again, drossing 
racial barriers, -- crossing 

00:30:49.412 --> 00:30:52.699
racial barriers, so you had that
challenge.  Even that was not 

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:56.567
nearly as difficult as going to 
school in New England.

00:30:59.416 --> 00:31:02.696
No one -- there were a few 
jerks.  We all have those.  But 

00:31:02.697 --> 00:31:05.136
beyond that, the school was 
excellent.  The people were fair

00:31:05.137 --> 00:31:09.047
to me.  It was very, very 
challenging academically.

00:31:12.098 --> 00:31:13.922
And also I got to -- I like to 
say I finished in the top ten of

00:31:13.923 --> 00:31:16.769
my high school class, but 
because there were only nine of 

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:18.770
us...
[ Laughter ]

00:31:20.639 --> 00:31:22.683
You have to take these things 
when you get them.

00:31:24.354 --> 00:31:26.354
That would be the last time I 
would be able to say that.

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:29.257
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: What about 
your decision to leave seminary?

00:31:29.258 --> 00:31:31.258
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: That was 
1968.

00:31:35.012 --> 00:31:37.012
Any of us who were around in 
1968, it was 1968.

00:31:38.705 --> 00:31:40.705
The wheels were coming off the 
wagons in a lot of ways.

00:31:47.489 --> 00:31:49.558
And the little Catholic kid from
the rather insular world of 

00:31:49.559 --> 00:31:51.559
Savannah 

00:31:55.688 --> 00:31:58.731
suddenly was reading and it was 
a long, hot -- Dr. King was 

00:31:58.732 --> 00:32:00.732
assassinated and we became 

00:32:02.203 --> 00:32:03.214
quite race conscious, which 
problematic sides and has good 

00:32:03.215 --> 00:32:05.215
sides.

00:32:09.806 --> 00:32:11.446
And like a lot of us, went from 
being nice Catholic kid to the 

00:32:11.447 --> 00:32:13.906
angry black kid.  And that was 
1968.

00:32:16.369 --> 00:32:18.369
So then I returned home and was 
greeted 

00:32:19.824 --> 00:32:21.824
with my grandfather, who told me
that if 

00:32:22.868 --> 00:32:23.692
I'm going to do that, then I 
need to find another place to 

00:32:23.693 --> 00:32:28.817
live.  So he kicked me out of 
the house and I was on my own.  

00:32:28.818 --> 00:32:31.267
I was 19 years old.  May 1968.

00:32:34.956 --> 00:32:36.173
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: But you went 
to Holy Cross?

00:32:36.174 --> 00:32:38.003
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: I know 
there's all this myth about how 

00:32:38.004 --> 00:32:40.004
-- people love to come up with 
narratives and myths.

00:32:45.751 --> 00:32:47.751
They should read or something.

00:32:51.494 --> 00:32:53.494
At any rate, my chemistry 
teacher asked 

00:32:54.768 --> 00:32:56.768
the high school classmate of 
mine to send me an application.

00:32:59.881 --> 00:33:01.945
I had ranked very high in my 
class in seminary, first year of

00:33:01.946 --> 00:33:06.213
college, and I just simply 
filled it out and I transferred 

00:33:06.214 --> 00:33:08.441
to Holy Cross.  I was accepted 
almost immediately and 

00:33:11.286 --> 00:33:13.325
transferred to Holy Cross in 
1968.  Pi wasn't going to go 

00:33:13.326 --> 00:33:17.612
because I was tired of being the
only black kid or one or two or 

00:33:17.613 --> 00:33:19.613
three.

00:33:20.718 --> 00:33:22.718
I was going to go to Savannah 
State, 

00:33:23.762 --> 00:33:25.396
but then when my grandfather 
disinvited me from living in his

00:33:25.397 --> 00:33:28.258
house, I thought it might not be
a good idea to hang around.

00:33:31.765 --> 00:33:34.069
So I just... I hadn't thought 
about any other schools.

00:33:37.938 --> 00:33:40.374
So I had been accepted to Holy 
Cross, so got on the train and 

00:33:40.375 --> 00:33:43.221
went to Holy Cross.
You can see the planning I did.

00:33:47.506 --> 00:33:48.731
I say to people, my whole life 
has been providential because I 

00:33:48.732 --> 00:33:51.173
certainly didn't know what was 
going on.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.240
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: In your book, 
Justice, 

00:33:57.516 --> 00:33:58.322
you talk about being a radical 
at Holy Cross, about being 

00:33:58.323 --> 00:34:00.323
angry.

00:34:02.599 --> 00:34:04.230
Did you feel you were treated 
unfairly?

00:34:04.231 --> 00:34:06.671
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: At Holy 
Cross?  No, no, I was just mad 

00:34:06.672 --> 00:34:11.765
at the world.  It was 1968.  I 
was angry.  I really didn't need

00:34:11.766 --> 00:34:14.822
a logical reason to be angry.  I
was angry about things that 

00:34:14.823 --> 00:34:17.259
happened in the past.  I was 
angry about things that were 

00:34:18.075 --> 00:34:20.075
going to happen in future.

00:34:21.421 --> 00:34:23.885
If you said "good morning" to me
I was angry.  If you didn't say 

00:34:23.886 --> 00:34:25.961
"good morning," I was angry.  
And people sort of exploited 

00:34:25.962 --> 00:34:27.962
that.

00:34:29.466 --> 00:34:31.466
And, you know, I was -- I 
remember 

00:34:34.572 --> 00:34:36.572
going to Harvard Square in April
of 19 

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:40.870
-- April 15, 1970, and we were 
pretty upset.

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:49.845
You know, I couldn't explain to 
myself why I just did that.  All

00:34:49.846 --> 00:34:51.846
night we were rioting.

00:34:53.987 --> 00:34:56.032
And I got back home, got back to
Holy Cross and that's when I 

00:34:56.033 --> 00:35:00.423
made a promise to God that I 
would never -- that if he took 

00:35:00.424 --> 00:35:03.725
anger out of my heart, I would 
never do that again.  I would 

00:35:03.726 --> 00:35:05.726
never let anger control my life.

00:35:07.798 --> 00:35:09.798
That was the morning of April 
16, 1970.

00:35:11.133 --> 00:35:12.551
And I've attempted to live up to
that.

00:35:12.552 --> 00:35:14.552
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: What made you 
choose law?

00:35:18.263 --> 00:35:19.076
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: It's kind of
the far scump effect.  How do I 

00:35:19.077 --> 00:35:21.077
know?  I was going to to be a 
priest.

00:35:27.655 --> 00:35:28.911
When you have a vocation, you 
think the belief of God is 

00:35:28.912 --> 00:35:30.912
calling you.

00:35:31.986 --> 00:35:34.845
That's the only dream I've ever 
had was to be a priest.  I don't

00:35:34.846 --> 00:35:37.284
think it ever quite leaves you. 
When I went off to Holy Cross, I

00:35:37.285 --> 00:35:39.285
was 

00:35:40.783 --> 00:35:43.213
in a little bit of a tailspin.  
I was looking for the next call,

00:35:43.214 --> 00:35:46.078
what am I called to do?  So I 
decided that God would call me 

00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:50.416
to go to Savannah and to help 
out.  And one way to do that was

00:35:50.417 --> 00:35:52.417
to be in law.

00:35:55.559 --> 00:35:58.446
And so I went to law school to 
return to Savannah.  If you 

00:35:58.447 --> 00:36:00.447
noticed, I never really worked 
at a law firm.

00:36:02.312 --> 00:36:04.166
I worked at a small firm in 
Savannah, Georgia, in the summer

00:36:04.167 --> 00:36:07.233
between second and third year of
law school because I wanted to 

00:36:07.234 --> 00:36:09.234
return to Savannah.

00:36:11.124 --> 00:36:13.124
For reasons that I'm not going 
to get 

00:36:14.265 --> 00:36:16.265
into, that job did not live up 
to my expectations.

00:36:19.472 --> 00:36:21.943
Now I've got a wife -- today is 
my son's 45th birthday, so he 

00:36:21.944 --> 00:36:23.944
was a little kid.

00:36:25.218 --> 00:36:28.075
And I had a wife and child and 
student loans.  And now I need a

00:36:28.076 --> 00:36:30.311
job, because I'm not going back 
to the situation that I don't 

00:36:31.942 --> 00:36:33.942
think is right in Savannah.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:37.849
And I couldn't get a job in 
Savannah, Georgia.  That's 

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:42.114
literally it.  I couldn't get a 
job in Atlanta, Georgia.  I 

00:36:42.115 --> 00:36:43.553
couldn't get a job in 
Washington, D.C.  I couldn't get

00:36:43.554 --> 00:36:47.299
a job in New York.  And I 
couldn't get a job in LA.  I 

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:49.300
struck out every place I could.

00:36:50.367 --> 00:36:52.367
So I wound up in Jefferson City,
Missouri.

00:36:54.237 --> 00:36:56.058
And because they didn't give me 
a job in Atlanta is the reason I

00:36:56.059 --> 00:36:58.099
wound up on the court.  So it's 
their fault.

00:37:00.339 --> 00:37:02.975
[ Laughter ]
Otherwise I would be comfortably

00:37:02.976 --> 00:37:06.470
a tax lawyer or something.
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Tell me about 

00:37:06.471 --> 00:37:09.333
your years at Yale.
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: What about 

00:37:09.334 --> 00:37:11.578
it?
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Do you 

00:37:11.579 --> 00:37:16.281
remember them?
[ Laughter ]

00:37:17.908 --> 00:37:20.169
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: You know, I 
think that had -- that was ages.

00:37:20.784 --> 00:37:24.652
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: No, no, no...
[ Laughter ]

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.960
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: That was a 
slight on Yale.

00:37:32.429 --> 00:37:34.429
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: You can see 
I've 

00:37:35.698 --> 00:37:36.102
always enjoyed my law clerks, 
and we enjoyed teaching 

00:37:36.103 --> 00:37:38.103
together.

00:37:39.362 --> 00:37:42.034
We have had -- we've been 
teaching together six or seven 

00:37:42.035 --> 00:37:44.035
years at GW Law School and had a
total blast.

00:37:46.651 --> 00:37:48.898
It's a good thing they don't 
really pay us for it.

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:52.752
You're not going to get paid now
because you're going to be 

00:37:52.753 --> 00:37:54.753
adjunct like the rest of us.

00:37:58.287 --> 00:38:00.287
You know, Yale was the perfect 
school for me.

00:38:01.966 --> 00:38:03.966
I've had my complaints for 
reasons 

00:38:07.492 --> 00:38:09.492
after Yale, but Yale showed me 
where I needed to be.

00:38:12.391 --> 00:38:13.016
If I had -- if I went back to 
Yale I would go differently 

00:38:13.017 --> 00:38:15.876
today.  I wouldn't go with all 
these burdens 

00:38:21.566 --> 00:38:22.584
of anger and bitterness and 
self-restrictions and 

00:38:22.585 --> 00:38:24.585
constraint.

00:38:26.661 --> 00:38:29.306
I would spend a lot of time in 
the sterling Library, which I 

00:38:29.307 --> 00:38:32.557
loved being in.  I would spend a
lot of time doing the things 

00:38:32.558 --> 00:38:34.558
that I like.

00:38:36.033 --> 00:38:37.449
I would be like that young kid 
at KU.  I just want to go to 

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:42.566
school.  I just want to be a 
kid.  I like chamber music.  I'd

00:38:42.567 --> 00:38:46.038
go to that.
I like debates.  I like 

00:38:46.039 --> 00:38:48.039
recitals.

00:38:51.577 --> 00:38:53.844
You know, I'm reading a book now
on the Plantagents.

00:38:57.928 --> 00:39:00.775
Keagan was at Yale.  I should 
have gone to those lectures, 

00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:05.541
whether it's Greek history or 
myth or wars.

00:39:06.631 --> 00:39:08.631
The Peloponnesian wars or 
something.

00:39:09.286 --> 00:39:12.163
I loved debates.  I loved 
philosophy.  And it was all 

00:39:12.164 --> 00:39:14.164
there.

00:39:16.668 --> 00:39:18.707
I could go to Off Broadway 
plays.  I didn't go to anything 

00:39:18.708 --> 00:39:21.748
because I was mad at the world. 
I was self-restricted in this 

00:39:21.749 --> 00:39:23.749
place that offered all these 
opportunities.

00:39:25.833 --> 00:39:28.069
The law school was good for me 
because it showed me how much 

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:30.070
work I needed to do, to do what 
I wanted to do.

00:39:34.836 --> 00:39:36.474
How much I needed to learn and a
question I asked myself when I 

00:39:36.475 --> 00:39:38.475
left was:  Are you willing to do
the work?

00:39:41.759 --> 00:39:42.364
Are you willing to dedicate 
yourself to learning all you 

00:39:42.365 --> 00:39:44.365
need?

00:39:46.232 --> 00:39:48.232
And so I would have to say in 

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.140
retrospect, it was small enough,
it was 

00:39:54.388 --> 00:39:56.388
academically challenging, it was

00:39:58.254 --> 00:40:00.254
interesting, the professors were
fair to me.

00:40:01.335 --> 00:40:03.370
It wasn't the best choice as far
as being able to distinguish 

00:40:03.371 --> 00:40:05.371
yourself, because of the grading
system.

00:40:08.379 --> 00:40:12.035
But I can't say -- I can't look 
back and offer any complaints.  

00:40:12.036 --> 00:40:13.869
I know in the past I've not said
pleasant things, but that would 

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:17.273
have to do with some other 
reactions.

00:40:19.506 --> 00:40:21.506
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Let's move 
forward to confirmation process.

00:40:23.195 --> 00:40:25.369
A third of your book has to do 
with confirmation process.  

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:27.370
That's been 27 years or so.

00:40:28.848 --> 00:40:30.947
How was your view of being 
confirmed and the politics 

00:40:30.948 --> 00:40:34.430
involved?  How is all that -- 
have you changed a bit?

00:40:35.841 --> 00:40:37.841
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: You know, I 
think 

00:40:38.922 --> 00:40:40.148
it's sort of like surgery, the 
only minor surgery is on the 

00:40:40.149 --> 00:40:42.149
other guy.

00:40:47.076 --> 00:40:49.965
I don't think the process is 
what it ought to be.  I think 

00:40:49.966 --> 00:40:52.003
that these are serious jobs and 
I think they should be serious.

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:58.309
I don't think they should become
spectacle.  This is not the 

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:03.006
Roman coliseum.  We're not glad 
yaiters.  I think we're going to

00:41:03.007 --> 00:41:06.264
lose some of our best people who
choose not to go through the 

00:41:06.265 --> 00:41:08.911
ordeal.  They don't want to have
to fight the 

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:14.410
lion in order to be a judge or 
to be in government.

00:41:15.249 --> 00:41:17.251
And I think it's our own fault 
for allowing this to happen.

00:41:20.065 --> 00:41:22.065
I was confirmed five times in 
ten years.

00:41:23.355 --> 00:41:25.355
And it got increasingly worse.

00:41:29.443 --> 00:41:31.740
And I think that we are going to
at some point have the 

00:41:32.948 --> 00:41:34.948
leadership we deserve.

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:41.277
Because we allow the selection 
process to get out of our 

00:41:41.278 --> 00:41:43.278
control and to have 

00:41:44.574 --> 00:41:46.597
very little to do with selecting
the kind of people we need.

00:41:47.417 --> 00:41:49.417
Think about it.

00:41:51.308 --> 00:41:53.308
You went through confirmation.

00:41:54.569 --> 00:41:55.988
And yours wasn't particularly 
controversial, but it was an 

00:41:55.989 --> 00:41:57.989
ordeal.

00:42:02.014 --> 00:42:04.674
And what if it was embittered?  
And I think a lot of people have

00:42:04.675 --> 00:42:06.696
second thoughts.  I can't tell 
you how many people I 

00:42:10.599 --> 00:42:12.599
know who in the middle of it 
said "what was I thinking?"

00:42:13.082 --> 00:42:15.332
I think that's unfortunate.  I 
think the country is going to 

00:42:15.333 --> 00:42:17.333
lose something because of that.

00:42:21.437 --> 00:42:22.037
So, you know, I don't have 
bitter feelings or anything like

00:42:22.038 --> 00:42:24.881
that.  I don't have strong 
reactions.

00:42:28.546 --> 00:42:31.195
But I think I'm sober in my 
judgment of it and I think a lot

00:42:31.196 --> 00:42:33.449
of the difficulties are 
irrelevant to the jobs.

00:42:34.463 --> 00:42:36.463
Think about it.

00:42:38.938 --> 00:42:40.938
How many people, for example, 
who have 

00:42:43.032 --> 00:42:45.032
done the job of judging, who 
actually 

00:42:47.307 --> 00:42:49.307
talk about judges, it's usually 
the 

00:42:50.707 --> 00:42:52.707
people doing the most talking 
have never judged a single case.

00:42:53.728 --> 00:42:56.593
I find it absolutely 
fascinating.  A lot of the 

00:42:56.594 --> 00:42:58.594
commentary has nothing to do 
with the job itself.

00:43:00.658 --> 00:43:03.305
I found when I got to the D.C. 
Circuit, I found that job 

00:43:03.306 --> 00:43:08.244
absolutely fabulous.  The people
there were fabulous.  And to the

00:43:08.245 --> 00:43:10.245
Supreme Court, after going 

00:43:11.301 --> 00:43:13.301
through all those difficulties, 
the 

00:43:15.421 --> 00:43:17.421
members of the court were just 
wonderful people.

00:43:18.699 --> 00:43:21.137
To a person, it was a fabulous 
place to work.  You were there. 

00:43:21.138 --> 00:43:23.138
It was a lot of work.

00:43:26.869 --> 00:43:28.713
It was very difficult first 
term, but in retrospect it was 

00:43:28.714 --> 00:43:32.731
an exciting time, just the ideas
and learning, and everybody 

00:43:32.732 --> 00:43:34.732
there made it as decent a place 
as it could possibly be.

00:43:37.403 --> 00:43:39.403
So the Court itself is quite 
different from the ordeal.

00:43:41.483 --> 00:43:43.483
It's almost the opposite of the 
or deal it took to get there.

00:43:43.542 --> 00:43:47.207
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: What are the 
best and worst things about 

00:43:47.208 --> 00:43:49.253
being a Supreme Court justice?
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: The best I 

00:43:49.254 --> 00:43:51.254
think 

00:43:52.312 --> 00:43:54.312
would have to be interacting 
with my 

00:43:56.665 --> 00:43:59.731
kids as they clerk to going 
through life, watching you all. 

00:43:59.732 --> 00:44:01.732
It's just -- that's the best 
part.

00:44:06.087 --> 00:44:08.087
I would have to say, too, my 
wife is now a former law clerk.

00:44:10.173 --> 00:44:12.829
She is emeritus.  We gave her 
honorary law clerk degree.

00:44:16.878 --> 00:44:19.130
But watching her... my wife was 
34 years old when I got to the 

00:44:19.131 --> 00:44:21.131
court.

00:44:24.826 --> 00:44:26.258
Watching her enjoy the clerks 
and the kids, it is such a joy.

00:44:26.259 --> 00:44:31.149
I remember when Nicholas was 
born.  Now what is he doing?

00:44:32.559 --> 00:44:32.763
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Graduate 
school.

00:44:32.764 --> 00:44:34.764
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: Yeah.

00:44:36.246 --> 00:44:38.246
So, watching all of that, it's 
just fantastic.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.343
And then when Janice got 
married, you know, it's just -- 

00:44:41.344 --> 00:44:43.344
so that's the best part.

00:44:46.043 --> 00:44:47.898
The worst part is the loss of 
anonymity.

00:44:47.899 --> 00:44:51.352
I don't like the public part.  
But that's a part of the deal.  

00:44:51.353 --> 00:44:53.353
I'm not going to complain about 
it, 

00:44:54.598 --> 00:44:56.029
but I just -- those of you who 
are introverts, you know what 

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:58.030
I'm talking about.

00:44:59.719 --> 00:45:01.333
We prefer -- it's sort of like I
said to my clerks who were 

00:45:01.334 --> 00:45:03.334
introverts.

00:45:04.998 --> 00:45:07.662
Introverts of the world unite.  
And then they said, but do we 

00:45:07.663 --> 00:45:09.663
have to go to meetings?

00:45:11.891 --> 00:45:13.891
[ Laughter ]

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:19.706
So I read Susan Cane's book 
"quiet," which I think is the 

00:45:19.707 --> 00:45:21.707
best book.

00:45:25.018 --> 00:45:26.942
For those of us who are 
introverts, that's the hard 

00:45:26.943 --> 00:45:28.943
part, the public part.

00:45:30.257 --> 00:45:36.096
You know what, I could add to 
that.  It's not a complaint.  

00:45:36.097 --> 00:45:40.593
All of this is a part of the 
deal.  I have no complaints.

00:45:46.937 --> 00:45:48.937
I don't like the myth-making 
around the Court and who we are.

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:54.250
There's a real decided 
difference 

00:45:55.303 --> 00:45:57.303
between what is said about what 
goes on 

00:45:58.972 --> 00:46:00.972
in judging and the Court and 
what actually happens.

00:46:01.631 --> 00:46:03.885
There's the real world and 
there's the myth of that world.

00:46:09.189 --> 00:46:11.189
We don't have the time, the 
energy or 

00:46:13.088 --> 00:46:16.087
the ink or the bits or bites or 
whatever they

00:46:22.103 --> 00:46:23.319
call that to change to engage in
that narrative battle.  We have 

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:25.320
work to do.  We have to write 
opinions.

00:46:28.408 --> 00:46:32.481
I've been around a lot of 
judges, whether you agree with 

00:46:32.482 --> 00:46:34.482
them or not, they actually put 
the work in.

00:46:37.567 --> 00:46:39.567
It's a wonderful world to work 
in.

00:46:42.244 --> 00:46:44.142
Where you actually have to write
out your opinions and think 

00:46:44.143 --> 00:46:46.143
things through and have 
arguments and go through all 

00:46:49.229 --> 00:46:50.465
the statutes and go through all 
the constitutional provisions 

00:46:50.466 --> 00:46:52.466
and go through 

00:46:53.512 --> 00:46:55.512
all the rules of statutory 
interpretation or construction.

00:46:58.849 --> 00:47:00.849
All the interpretive cannons.

00:47:02.369 --> 00:47:06.051
It's fascinating.
So I like that world.  But then 

00:47:06.052 --> 00:47:07.884
the world that people talk about
that you don't agree on 

00:47:07.885 --> 00:47:09.917
something... oh, you hate old 
people!

00:47:10.527 --> 00:47:13.766
What!?
Or you want to execute people.

00:47:13.767 --> 00:47:18.479
I haven't met a judge who wants 
to execute anybody.  I haven't 

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.480
met that judge yet.

00:47:25.643 --> 00:47:27.882
In fact, every judge I have met,
going through these cases, look 

00:47:27.883 --> 00:47:31.752
at what it does to your hair.
So you start out, your hair is 

00:47:31.753 --> 00:47:33.753
black, 

00:47:35.233 --> 00:47:37.233
you have lots of it, and then 
all of a 

00:47:39.735 --> 00:47:43.002
sudden you're follicle-ly 
impaired.  And it's gray.  Oh, 

00:47:43.003 --> 00:47:45.003
my God, another execution!

00:47:46.677 --> 00:47:47.694
Every one of us is like, did I 
get it right?  Did I make a 

00:47:47.695 --> 00:47:49.695
mistake?

00:47:50.733 --> 00:47:52.733
And yet you have the people who 
create the myth about it.

00:47:55.562 --> 00:47:58.017
, who think that somehow you're 
callously doing these things.  

00:47:58.018 --> 00:47:59.861
Those are people who never 
stayed up in the middle of the 

00:47:59.862 --> 00:48:01.862
night and voted for one of these
things.

00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:04.713
So I like being around judges.  
I like the work.

00:48:08.205 --> 00:48:10.205
I like the world that I'm a part
of.

00:48:14.088 --> 00:48:16.088
I think the world -- those who 
talk 

00:48:18.702 --> 00:48:19.908
about it are not doing the world
justice or the rest of the 

00:48:19.909 --> 00:48:22.760
fellow citizens justice in 
talking about an important part 

00:48:22.761 --> 00:48:25.421
of their government.
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Talking about 

00:48:25.422 --> 00:48:29.710
the work, I notice the Supreme 
Court statistics that for the 

00:48:29.711 --> 00:48:34.619
last two years you have written 
about twice as many opinions as 

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:35.429
any of the other justices.
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: That's 

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:37.430
because I really don't talk, so 
I get to write a lot.

00:48:38.077 --> 00:48:40.136
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Why so many 

00:48:40.137 --> 00:48:42.137
opinions?
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: Who knows?

00:48:49.071 --> 00:48:51.071
Justice Scalia said I was 
solisistic.

00:48:52.522 --> 00:48:53.754
I said, I have no idea what that
means, but I like the ring of 

00:48:53.755 --> 00:48:55.755
it.

00:48:58.273 --> 00:49:01.144
So I think that means I like my 
own opinions.  He said once, 

00:49:01.145 --> 00:49:03.369
Clarence, you don't care for 
other people's opinions, do you?

00:49:05.632 --> 00:49:07.632
No, I do care, but I prefer my 
own.

00:49:08.678 --> 00:49:10.678
I don't know.

00:49:17.042 --> 00:49:19.042
I think it is really important 
that 

00:49:21.152 --> 00:49:23.152
when you vote for these things 
that you 

00:49:24.214 --> 00:49:25.601
explain why, and that if it 
doesn't make sense -- my 

00:49:25.602 --> 00:49:28.483
granddaddy -- I'm not going to 
use the words he used exactly, 

00:49:28.484 --> 00:49:32.942
but he would say... "Boy, if it 
don't make no sense, it don't 

00:49:32.943 --> 00:49:35.416
make no sense."
He would spice it up a little 

00:49:35.417 --> 00:49:39.298
bit.
And, you know, things have to 

00:49:39.299 --> 00:49:41.299
make sense to me.

00:49:43.588 --> 00:49:46.458
When you come from the lower 
levels of society, when you -- 

00:49:46.459 --> 00:49:48.459
poverty, things have to make 
sense.

00:49:50.958 --> 00:49:52.381
My granddaddy, either you fed 
the hogs or you didn't feed the 

00:49:52.382 --> 00:49:57.264
hogs.  You greased the tractor 
or didn't grease the tractor.  

00:49:57.265 --> 00:49:59.905
You either planted the corn or 
you didn't plant the corn.  It 

00:49:59.906 --> 00:50:01.906
was binary.  It was clear.

00:50:04.405 --> 00:50:06.405
And I think when we do these 
cases, we 

00:50:09.516 --> 00:50:10.546
owe it to our fellow citizens to
explain in plain language what 

00:50:10.547 --> 00:50:12.547
we are doing.

00:50:14.198 --> 00:50:16.198
And sometimes when you see me 
writing, 

00:50:17.243 --> 00:50:18.996
it's because what the Court is 
doing, the premise, I think, 

00:50:18.997 --> 00:50:22.259
disagree with, and I think it's 
wrong.  And if you go back and 

00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:24.260
you look at the 

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:30.780
Court of Appeals judges, I think
it is a 

00:50:31.832 --> 00:50:34.294
little bit glib -- I'm not going
to say disrespectful -- for us 

00:50:34.295 --> 00:50:36.295
to -- when there 

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:41.051
are differences of opinions in 
the Courts of Appeals and 

00:50:41.052 --> 00:50:43.052
District Courts, 

00:50:44.575 --> 00:50:46.575
for us not to explain why we 
hold a 

00:50:48.465 --> 00:50:51.463
different opinion from them or 
not to fully explore the 

00:50:51.464 --> 00:50:53.704
opinions below, and just glibly 
disagree.

00:50:55.744 --> 00:50:57.744
And I think we owe them that 
respect.

00:50:59.476 --> 00:51:02.316
So I worked through everything. 
And I probably put a lot of 

00:51:02.317 --> 00:51:06.522
pressure on my law clerks.  I 
wouldn't clerk for me.

00:51:08.135 --> 00:51:10.810
That is way too much work.  And 
I tell them that before they're 

00:51:10.811 --> 00:51:14.468
done.  Are you sure you want to 
do this?  Why are you doing 

00:51:14.469 --> 00:51:18.534
this?  You know there's a 13th 
amendment.

00:51:22.251 --> 00:51:24.212

&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: What's changed

00:51:24.213 --> 00:51:28.193
in your judging over the 27 
years?

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:31.637
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: That is 
really a good question.  Judge.

00:51:42.284 --> 00:51:45.232
You know, it's sort of like if 
you climb a mountain, when 

00:51:45.233 --> 00:51:47.464
you're at 1,000 feet, you see 
something.  You still look at 

00:51:47.465 --> 00:51:50.106
the same scenery, but you have a
different view from when 

00:51:55.175 --> 00:51:57.175
you're at 10,000 feet or 5,000 
5,000 feet.  You see more.

00:51:58.839 --> 00:52:01.478
I've been doing this so long 
that you see more.  You 

00:52:01.479 --> 00:52:03.479
understand more.

00:52:05.355 --> 00:52:07.355
The reason I was reading this 
book on 

00:52:08.361 --> 00:52:10.361
the

00:52:11.534 --> 00:52:12.808
Plantaginents was because of 
English common law, starred out 

00:52:12.809 --> 00:52:14.809
people do a lot 

00:52:18.108 --> 00:52:19.320
of talking about stare decisis, 
so I decided to teach a course 

00:52:19.321 --> 00:52:21.321
to understand it in depth.

00:52:23.013 --> 00:52:24.239
But to understand stare decisis,
you have to understand English 

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.240
common law.

00:52:27.279 --> 00:52:29.335
To understand English common 
law, you have to understand 

00:52:29.336 --> 00:52:31.336
where England came 

00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:34.953
from, the Norman conquest, the 
Vikings, the Romans.  Then to 

00:52:34.954 --> 00:52:36.954
understand that you have to 
trace those histories.

00:52:40.201 --> 00:52:42.201
So anyway, I've done that and 
now I'm 

00:52:44.279 --> 00:52:45.090
fascinated by the Platginents 
and what they've done developing

00:52:45.091 --> 00:52:48.167
England.  What were they doing? 
Why did the king pull all this 

00:52:48.168 --> 00:52:51.015
together?
But to understand you've got to 

00:52:51.016 --> 00:52:53.091
pull all the history together.  
But look how many years that 

00:52:53.092 --> 00:52:55.092
takes.
That's what I learned at Yale.

00:52:59.757 --> 00:53:03.025
This wasn't a sprint.  It was a 
marathon.  It was a life-long 

00:53:03.026 --> 00:53:06.075
endeavor.  It's what you and I 
do when we teach constitutional 

00:53:06.076 --> 00:53:08.076
law together.  Look at the cases
we've read.

00:53:11.157 --> 00:53:14.009
Look at how in-depth we've read 
those cases.  How many people 

00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:19.746
care about Crop v. Dulles.  You 
and I do.  We care about it.  

00:53:19.747 --> 00:53:24.197
Vlas v. Cohen.  Decided but they
don't read it.  You and I do.  

00:53:24.198 --> 00:53:28.230
We have to.  Why?
Because we're messing with other

00:53:28.231 --> 00:53:30.287
people's constitution.  You and 
I have to do it, and you know 

00:53:30.288 --> 00:53:35.428
why.  We have to go back and 
read the briefs.  Because we're 

00:53:35.429 --> 00:53:38.263
tinkering with other people's 
constitution.  We don't have any

00:53:38.264 --> 00:53:40.264
unlimited license to do that.

00:53:43.583 --> 00:53:46.736
And we certainly don't have a 
right to be reckless with it.  

00:53:46.737 --> 00:53:49.426
So over the years what you learn
is it's like you've peeled -- 

00:53:49.427 --> 00:53:51.427
you've gone 

00:53:53.074 --> 00:53:54.555
higher or another metaphor, 
you're peeling the onion and you

00:53:54.556 --> 00:53:56.556
understand, you see more.

00:53:58.435 --> 00:54:00.435
Not because you're smarter or 
because 

00:54:01.693 --> 00:54:02.313
people love to set themselves up
as philosopher, kings or 

00:54:02.314 --> 00:54:07.197
something.  No.  It's because 
you've been doing it longer.  

00:54:07.198 --> 00:54:10.200
This is what I do.
I don't have hobbies.

00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:17.890
Well, except for rooting against
Alabama.

00:54:19.501 --> 00:54:21.856
[ Laughter ]

00:54:25.171 --> 00:54:27.171
You knew it was coming, didn't 
you?

00:54:29.226 --> 00:54:31.479
Oh, my gosh, they stole another 
national championship!

00:54:32.292 --> 00:54:35.949
You know, I...
I don't...

00:54:36.762 --> 00:54:38.762
This is what I do.  I do law.

00:54:41.679 --> 00:54:43.679
And it consumes you.

00:54:48.805 --> 00:54:49.823
And virtually everything I do is
in preparation of doing this 

00:54:49.824 --> 00:54:54.192
job.  I think I owe this.  
Remember, it's about your 

00:54:54.193 --> 00:54:56.193
calling.

00:54:57.236 --> 00:54:57.449
And if you're called to do it, 
you're called to do it a certain

00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:59.450
way.

00:55:01.558 --> 00:55:02.566
If you go back and look at 
Justice Scalia, look what he 

00:55:02.567 --> 00:55:04.567
died doing.

00:55:06.034 --> 00:55:08.034
People forget, he had finished 
-- he 

00:55:09.092 --> 00:55:11.947
thought it was our job to fly 
the flag, to go different places

00:55:11.948 --> 00:55:13.948
and to talk to people about what
we do.

00:55:15.933 --> 00:55:17.933
He was more outgoing than I am.

00:55:20.227 --> 00:55:22.452
But he would tell me, Clarence, 
you got to fly the flag.  You 

00:55:22.453 --> 00:55:24.453
have to go out there.

00:55:26.775 --> 00:55:27.791
Then the other thing, when he 
did his work, everything 

00:55:27.792 --> 00:55:32.698
mattered to him.  Every 
sentence.  Every word.  Every 

00:55:32.699 --> 00:55:40.043
comma.  Every idea.  It all 
mattered.  And it mattered.  

00:55:40.044 --> 00:55:42.897
That's one of the reasons we 
trusted each other.  Because we 

00:55:42.898 --> 00:55:44.898
both knew it mattered.

00:55:46.155 --> 00:55:48.155
Getting it right was important 
to both of us.

00:55:48.769 --> 00:55:52.635
Why would we do it otherwise?
Why would we be doing this?  

00:55:52.636 --> 00:55:56.107
This is wrong.  How would you 
look your fellow citizens in the

00:55:56.108 --> 00:55:59.211
eye if you didn't get it right?
If I looked at you and told you,

00:55:59.212 --> 00:56:04.223
oh, I don't care.  I kind of... 
you know, I go and watch 

00:56:04.224 --> 00:56:06.666
cartoons and then, you know, I 
kind of flip coins for your 

00:56:06.667 --> 00:56:08.696
constitution.  Or I just kind of
do whatever I want to do.

00:56:09.718 --> 00:56:12.358
I would never do that.  Ever.
Because that's wrong.

00:56:13.984 --> 00:56:16.211
And he believed the same thing. 
We took an oath to do it a 

00:56:16.212 --> 00:56:18.212
certain way.

00:56:19.875 --> 00:56:22.316
So I think I have to inform 
myself in order to make 

00:56:22.317 --> 00:56:24.317
decisions about your 
constitution.

00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:26.807
And you feel the exact same way.
And you just became a judge.

00:56:30.691 --> 00:56:32.691
And you know you feel exactly 
the same way.

00:56:33.947 --> 00:56:35.947
That you have a special 
obligation or 

00:56:37.221 --> 00:56:39.221
you wouldn't have been 28 years 
as a Reservist in the military.

00:56:40.987 --> 00:56:43.390
Or the best teacher at GW Law 
School for a quarter of a 

00:56:43.391 --> 00:56:44.635
century.
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Talk about 

00:56:44.636 --> 00:56:46.891
your teaching, Justice.
[ Laughter ]

00:56:48.316 --> 00:56:50.316
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: I knew you'd
change the subject.

00:56:52.211 --> 00:56:54.211
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: You've taught 
at 

00:56:55.218 --> 00:56:55.817
Georgia and George Mason, GW.
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: I love it.

00:56:55.818 --> 00:56:57.818
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: What is your 
goal in teaching?

00:57:00.152 --> 00:57:02.152
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: You know, I 
think 

00:57:05.053 --> 00:57:06.059
that we -- I think that people 
make learning -- well, let me 

00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:09.701
back up.  Did you see the wizard
of Oz?

00:57:10.295 --> 00:57:12.295
Who was the wizard?

00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:17.016
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Who was the 
wizard?

00:57:18.114 --> 00:57:19.771
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: This little 
guy.

00:57:19.772 --> 00:57:21.759
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: The little 
guy, I could have said that.

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.923
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: I think what
we do sometimes is we make 

00:57:23.924 --> 00:57:27.383
everything mysterious.
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Don't look 

00:57:27.384 --> 00:57:29.195
behind the curtain.
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: Yeah, that's

00:57:29.196 --> 00:57:31.223
what we do in our class.  It's 
not mysterious.

00:57:33.057 --> 00:57:34.682
There was a young man in our 
constitutional law class at the 

00:57:34.683 --> 00:57:38.977
end, he said, I'll never look at
law the same again.  I don't 

00:57:38.978 --> 00:57:41.738
know what his meanings were.  I 
don't care what his ideology is.

00:57:43.767 --> 00:57:46.249
What we were trying to get him 
to do is de-mystify it.  It's 

00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:48.250
not that complicated.
Why do we make it complicated?

00:57:48.492 --> 00:57:50.645
Why do we make it inaccessible.

00:57:57.719 --> 00:57:59.719
?  I had a buddy who was a

00:58:01.236 --> 00:58:03.236
quadriplegic, back in the '70s 
before 

00:58:05.246 --> 00:58:07.246
you have the flush and curb 
cuts.

00:58:08.413 --> 00:58:10.413
Every time we got a curb, it was
a great wall of China.

00:58:12.879 --> 00:58:16.367
If we weren't there to lift him,
it was inaccessible to him.  To 

00:58:16.368 --> 00:58:18.368
some extent that's what we do to
law.

00:58:19.844 --> 00:58:21.844
We start talking about negative 

00:58:23.307 --> 00:58:25.211
pregnants and use double 
entendres and throw in a little 

00:58:25.212 --> 00:58:28.064
Latin or a little of this.  Why 
don't we talk in English?

00:58:30.292 --> 00:58:31.517
That farmer in rural Alabama has
a right to know what his 

00:58:31.518 --> 00:58:36.401
constitution says.  And so what 
I do is -- one of the things I 

00:58:36.402 --> 00:58:38.402
say -- and I said it even when 

00:58:40.504 --> 00:58:42.504
you were clerking, is that 
genius is not 

00:58:46.191 --> 00:58:48.191
putting a $20 ten-cent idea in a
$20 sentence.

00:58:51.503 --> 00:58:53.503
Genius is putting a $20 idea in 
a ten-cent sentence.

00:58:55.153 --> 00:58:57.153
It is to make it accessible as 
possible to average people.

00:58:59.859 --> 00:59:01.859
So when I used to go back home, 
think 

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.160
about it, I came from a world of
illiteracy, near illiteracy.

00:59:08.431 --> 00:59:11.275
And when you went back home, you
could not talk down to people.  

00:59:11.276 --> 00:59:13.276
That's what they would say to 
you.

00:59:15.364 --> 00:59:17.822
They wouldn't use the word 
"condescend."  That wasn't in 

00:59:17.823 --> 00:59:20.049
their vocabulary.  You're 
talking down to me, you're 

00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:22.460
putting me down.

00:59:23.918 --> 00:59:25.950
But you have to explain things 
to them without treating them 

00:59:25.951 --> 00:59:27.951
like they're lesser human 
beings.

00:59:29.825 --> 00:59:32.462
So it's what we used to say in 
the vernacular back in the '60s,

00:59:32.463 --> 00:59:35.314
you have to break it down.
In other words, you have to 

00:59:35.315 --> 00:59:40.007
speak without losing meaning, 
without losing content, you have

00:59:40.008 --> 00:59:43.263
to explain it in a language that
they understood.

00:59:45.092 --> 00:59:47.778
And I think one of the things 
that we try to do in the 

00:59:47.779 --> 00:59:50.629
opinions is to explain things to
people.  I think we owe it to 

00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:53.918
people.
In order to do that, we have to 

00:59:53.919 --> 00:59:56.962
know it, as we do in the 
classes.  Look at the eyes on 

00:59:56.963 --> 00:59:58.963
the students when we're done.

01:00:01.041 --> 01:00:03.041
When they figure out that they 
know 

01:00:04.087 --> 01:00:05.511
more about Lockner now than they
did before, simply because we 

01:00:05.512 --> 01:00:08.981
read the briefs and articles 
about it, et cetera, and we know

01:00:08.982 --> 01:00:11.248
the story behind it.
And all of a sudden they can 

01:00:11.249 --> 01:00:13.916
claim it.  They understand it.  
It makes sense.

01:00:16.966 --> 01:00:19.006
If you look -- when I wrote 
separately in the McDonald 

01:00:19.007 --> 01:00:21.007
opinion, what I was 

01:00:22.697 --> 01:00:24.322
trying to do is, after all this 
talk of substantive due process,

01:00:24.323 --> 01:00:27.808
just simply explain to people, 
we don't know where it -- where 

01:00:27.809 --> 01:00:30.047
does it come from?  Where does 
it come from?  It's not in the 

01:00:30.048 --> 01:00:33.296
constitution.
So you go back and you say, here

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:38.121
is what is there.
You don't have to agree.  But 

01:00:38.122 --> 01:00:40.122
the immunity clause is actually 
there.

01:00:40.362 --> 01:00:42.362
Here is what they actually 
debated.

01:00:42.399 --> 01:00:44.399
You can disagree with that.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.480
But you can see the coherence.

01:00:50.428 --> 01:00:52.428
You can see -- you can go to 
Dred 

01:00:56.635 --> 01:00:58.635
Scott and you can see -- you 
know, like 

01:00:59.936 --> 01:01:03.207
Tawney says, can't be citizen, 
remedied in the 14th amendment. 

01:01:03.208 --> 01:01:05.208
And you can't deny citizenship.

01:01:06.647 --> 01:01:08.399
It makes sense once you go 
through the history.  That's 

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:11.068
what I tried to do in the 
opinions.  It's not so much to 

01:01:11.069 --> 01:01:13.914
give you some legal theory but 
to give you the progress of this

01:01:13.915 --> 01:01:16.148
provision.
And then to show you where it's 

01:01:18.385 --> 01:01:20.423
connected to some of the other 
concerns they had about blacks 

01:01:20.424 --> 01:01:23.686
in the south being able to 
defend themselves.

01:01:25.711 --> 01:01:26.884
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Justice, I 
wish we could stay all 

01:01:26.885 --> 01:01:28.723
afternoon.
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: Well, 

01:01:28.724 --> 01:01:30.146
they're leaving, but you and I 
can stay.

01:01:30.147 --> 01:01:31.582
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: I've gotten 

01:01:31.583 --> 01:01:33.817
the signal that time is up.  
Thank you for your remarks.

&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: Thank you 
all for spending this afternoon 

01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:39.490
with us.

01:01:41.558 --> 01:01:43.399
I'm sorry to take so much of 
your time.  And maybe we didn't 

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:48.665
cover everything that you 
probably wanted us to, but we're

01:01:48.666 --> 01:01:50.682
going to be talking later on 
about the dormant commerce 

01:01:50.683 --> 01:01:52.683
clause for those 

01:01:53.744 --> 01:01:55.378
that are interested interested.
Thank you all very, very much.

01:01:58.775 --> 01:02:00.891
