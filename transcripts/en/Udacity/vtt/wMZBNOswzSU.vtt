00:00:00.563 --> 00:00:02.004
So let's take a look and see how our

00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.267
Jersey Square team is doing in tinkering out

00:00:04.267 --> 00:00:06.495
their revenue streams, that is how much

00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:08.882
money each segment is willing to pay

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:12.035
and how would they like to pay this amount.

00:00:12.035 --> 00:00:14.265
So what they discovered as we found out earlier

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:16.209
is that they have two customer segments

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.879
Sport Jersey Owners and Single Game Attendees

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:22.319
and as you will think that the Single Game Attendees

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:25.642
would actually like to pay per rental, that is

00:00:25.642 --> 00:00:30.128
you are going to rent a jersey for one-time use

00:00:30.128 --> 00:00:33.182
from Jersey Square but the people who already own

00:00:33.182 --> 00:00:36.634
Sport Jerseys kind of like the idea of an annual

00:00:36.634 --> 00:00:39.887
subscription and now getting out of the building

00:00:39.887 --> 00:00:41.790
they actually talk to enough customers

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.540
and have enough data to realize that these

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.893
Sports Jersey owners would pay $200 a year

00:00:48.893 --> 00:00:51.793
to get a clean, pressed, dry-clean jersey

00:00:51.793 --> 00:00:55.245
for each game. It isn't clear yet

00:00:55.245 --> 00:00:57.278
in their customer discovery process,

00:00:57.278 --> 00:00:59.407
how much the Single Game Attendees will

00:00:59.407 --> 00:01:01.474
pay but they intend to talk to more

00:01:01.474 --> 00:01:05.000
customers and fill in that data.
