00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.951
- [Instructor] We're asked
to find a power series for f,

00:00:02.951 --> 00:00:05.656
and they've given us f of
x is equal to six over one

00:00:05.656 --> 00:00:08.630
plus x to the third power.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.988
Now, since they're letting
us pick which power series,

00:00:11.988 --> 00:00:14.639
you might say, well, let me
just find the Maclaurin series

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.020
because the Maclaurin series
tends to be the simplest

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.993
to find 'cause we're centered at zero.

00:00:19.993 --> 00:00:22.598
And so you might immediately
go out and say all right,

00:00:22.598 --> 00:00:24.340
well, let me evaluate
this function at zero,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.775
evaluate its derivative at zero,

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:28.523
its second derivative at
zero, so on and so forth.

00:00:28.523 --> 00:00:30.476
And then I can use the formula

00:00:30.476 --> 00:00:32.901
for the Maclaurin series
to just expand it out.

00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:35.794
But very quickly, you
will run into roadblocks

00:00:35.794 --> 00:00:37.656
because the first,

00:00:37.656 --> 00:00:39.004
evaluating this at f,

00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:40.778
at x equals zero is
pretty straightforward.

00:00:40.778 --> 00:00:42.915
Evaluating the first derivative
is pretty straightforward.

00:00:42.915 --> 00:00:44.118
But then once you start taking the second

00:00:44.118 --> 00:00:47.344
and third derivatives, it
gets very hairy, very fast.

00:00:47.344 --> 00:00:49.878
You could do a simplification,
where you could say,

00:00:49.878 --> 00:00:52.065
well, let me find the Maclaurin series

00:00:52.065 --> 00:00:55.648
for f of u is equal to
six over one plus u,

00:00:56.804 --> 00:00:59.775
where u is equal to x to the third.

00:00:59.775 --> 00:01:02.625
So you find this Maclaurin
expansion, in terms of u,

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:04.742
and then you substitute
for x to the third.

00:01:04.742 --> 00:01:06.624
And actually, that makes
it a good bit simpler,

00:01:06.624 --> 00:01:08.699
so that is another way to approach it.

00:01:08.699 --> 00:01:11.101
But the simplest way to
approach it is to say,

00:01:11.101 --> 00:01:13.979
hey, you know what, this
form right over here,

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.796
this rational expression,
it looks similar.

00:01:16.796 --> 00:01:20.282
It looks like the sum
of a geometric series.

00:01:20.282 --> 00:01:21.985
Let's just remind ourselves what the sum

00:01:21.985 --> 00:01:23.908
of a geometric series looks like.

00:01:23.908 --> 00:01:25.241
If I have a plus

00:01:26.356 --> 00:01:30.837
a times r, so a is my first
term, r is my common ratio,

00:01:30.837 --> 00:01:32.744
plus, I'm gonna multiply it times r again,

00:01:32.744 --> 00:01:34.661
plus a times r squared,

00:01:36.748 --> 00:01:39.412
plus a times r to the third power,

00:01:39.412 --> 00:01:42.699
and I keep going on,
and on, and on forever.

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:46.602
We know that this is going to
be equal to a, our first term,

00:01:46.602 --> 00:01:48.883
over one minus our common ratio,

00:01:48.883 --> 00:01:53.604
and this just comes from a,
the sum of a geometric series.

00:01:53.604 --> 00:01:55.861
And notice that what we
have here, our f of x,

00:01:55.861 --> 00:01:57.584
our definition of f of x,

00:01:57.584 --> 00:02:01.049
and the sum of a geometric
series look very, very similar.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.761
If we say that this,
right over here, is a,

00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:06.873
so a is equal to six.

00:02:06.873 --> 00:02:11.043
And if negative r is
equal to x to the third,

00:02:11.043 --> 00:02:13.181
or we could say, let me rewrite this.

00:02:13.181 --> 00:02:15.785
I could write this
denominator as one minus

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:18.403
negative x to the third.

00:02:18.403 --> 00:02:21.579
And so now, you could say, okay, well, r

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.785
could be equal to negative x to the third.

00:02:24.785 --> 00:02:26.828
And just like that, we can expand it out.

00:02:26.828 --> 00:02:29.078
Well, if a is equal to six,

00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:32.644
and r is equal to negative
x to the third, well,

00:02:32.644 --> 00:02:35.360
then we could just write this
out as a geometric series,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.775
which is very straightforward.

00:02:36.775 --> 00:02:38.093
So let's do that.

00:02:38.093 --> 00:02:41.553
And I will do this in, I'll do
this in this nice pink color.

00:02:41.553 --> 00:02:44.545
So the first term would be six,

00:02:44.545 --> 00:02:47.603
plus six times our common ratio,

00:02:47.603 --> 00:02:50.875
six times negative x to the third.

00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:52.744
And so actually, let me just write that as

00:02:52.744 --> 00:02:56.142
negative six x to the third,
and then we're gonna multiply

00:02:56.142 --> 00:02:58.526
by negative x to the third again.

00:02:58.526 --> 00:03:00.666
So that's going to be, if I multiply this

00:03:00.666 --> 00:03:02.359
times negative x to the third,

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.542
that's gonna be positive six

00:03:04.542 --> 00:03:07.042
times x to the sixth power.

00:03:08.263 --> 00:03:10.127
And then I'm gonna multiply
it by times negative x

00:03:10.127 --> 00:03:14.995
to the third again, so it's
gonna be minus six times x

00:03:14.995 --> 00:03:16.578
to the ninth power,

00:03:17.767 --> 00:03:19.886
and I'm gonna go on, and on, and on.

00:03:19.886 --> 00:03:21.660
So it's gonna be, and
then I could keep going,

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.207
I multiply it times
negative x to the third.

00:03:24.207 --> 00:03:28.210
I will get six x to the twelfth power.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.099
Now, we can go on, and on,
and on, and on forever.

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.826
And so the key here was,

00:03:33.826 --> 00:03:37.914
and this is the Maclaurin
series expansion for our f of x,

00:03:37.914 --> 00:03:39.809
but the key is to not have to go through

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:41.618
all of this business and just to recognize

00:03:41.618 --> 00:03:43.923
that hey, the way this
function was defined

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:47.350
is it looks a lot like the
sum of a geometric series.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.732
And it can be considered the
sum of a geometric series,

00:03:49.732 --> 00:03:54.324
and we can use that to find
the power series expansion

00:03:54.324 --> 00:03:55.306
for our function.

00:03:55.306 --> 00:03:58.639
This is a very, very, very useful trick.
