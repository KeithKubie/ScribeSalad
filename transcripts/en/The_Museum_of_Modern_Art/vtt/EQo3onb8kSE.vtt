Welcome to Fashion as Design

00:00:01.844 --> 00:00:05.500
a course brought to you by The Museum of Modern Art.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.100
I am Paola Antonelli.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.280
I'm a senior curator in Architecture and Design at MoMA.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.480
I'm Michelle Millar Fisher.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.719
I'm a curatorial assistant at MoMA.

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.520
Stephanie Kramer, research assistant at MoMA.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.315
And we're all brought here together by a great project

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.500
which is the exhibition

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.931
"Items: Is Fashion Modern?"

00:00:22.931 --> 00:00:28.940
Itâ€™s a very ambitious project because it
brings together 111 items of clothing and

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.320
accessories that had a strong influence on the world in the past 100 years.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.500
We believe strongly that fashion is a form
of design, we believe strongly that no true

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.570
design history can be told without discussing also garments and everything that they encompass

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.699
from aesthetics and technology to economy, sociology, anthropology, labor practices,

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.210
the whole world.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.890
That's what we believe that design is, a way to understand more deeply and with more awareness

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.780
the world in which we live.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.410
So we have these two realms we have design,
we have fashion, we have the larger world

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.760
of the Museum of Modern Art that has traditionally
the fine arts and architecture.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.320
And with this course we would like to try
and position them together.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.140
When we go through this course, we're going
to see pairings of humble masterpieces like

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.970
the white t-shirt, like perhaps the Panama
hat with things that are perhaps more entrenched

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.920
in a designer led mode of fashion that isn't
necessarily humble, but when we take them

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.420
together, we really see that they're no different
from one another in terms of providing lenses

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.440
through which we can really uncover some of
these larger issues that both fashion and

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.930
design allow us to explore.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.770
We've played a game during the exhibition
preparation where, as we've been walking through

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.420
the city, we've looked at people who are walking
by us and thought what are they wearing that's

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.150
on our checklist of 111.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.100
If you look around you on a daily basis, you
see someone wearing a turtleneck, a white

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.869
t-shirt, a biker jacket, a pair of jeans,
etc. and you realize that the subjects that

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.239
you'll see in this course, the items that
you'll see in this course really are from

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.769
the very esoteric to the very quotidien things
that really do affect us on a day-to-day basis.

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.410
It really is about not only playing the game
and looking what other people are wearing.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.319
But rather playing the game, which is a serious
game, and look at what you are wearing and

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:37.760
understand in delight and also in like, really
sense of responsibility, understand what you're

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.690
putting on yourself.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.099
This is not about punishing people or about
taking the fun out of things, quite the opposite.

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:51.170
We believe that by knowing what is contained
in every single garment is going to be just

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.440
a fuller life presented in front of you and
also a more... how can I say, a more aware

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:05.120
stance as a serious citizen to be able to
push back, accept and celebrate good deeds.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.500
And instead, also push the industry towards
a more ethical stance when necessary.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.440
We hope you enjoy the material in the weeks
to come, and we look forward to hearing what

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.300
you have to say in the discussion forums.
