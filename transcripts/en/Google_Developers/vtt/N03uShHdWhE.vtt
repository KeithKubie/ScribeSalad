LAURENCE MORONEY: Did you
know that 86% of users

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.370
don't like creating and
remembering new passwords

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.065
to interact with you?

00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:08.565
I'm surprised the
number's that low.

00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:11.120
I'd have figured it was 100%.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.330
Not only that, but 54% of
users will quit altogether

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.270
if you ask them
to fill out a form

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.210
to create a new account
just to sign into your app.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.420
All that time and effort
you've spent attracting them

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.450
to your app, and more
than half of them

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.350
would walk away before
they even start using it.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.679
And it gets even worse.

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.720
You've gotten them to the
front door of your app.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.240
They've actually signed up for
a new username and password.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.120
And when they come
back, of course,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.740
they can't remember their
username or password.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.570
Guess what?

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.080
A whopping 92% of
them will walk away

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.870
when this happens
instead of going

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.585
through the reset process.

00:00:46.585 --> 00:00:47.660
I'm Laurence Moroney.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.240
And I'm here today to talk
about sign-in with Google,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.240
allowing your users to
simply use what they know,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.630
trusting that their
login is secure.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.610
So you're thinking,
this is all very good.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.640
But you've implemented
sign-in already.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.480
You might even have implemented
sign-in using Google.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.629
Either way, I've got
great news for you.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.570
The UX has improved greatly.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.920
Let me step you through it.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.580
But first, let me show you
what it used to be like.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.340
There were a lot of
steps, a lot of steps.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.540
And the user experience
just wasn't the greatest.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.960
We did make some
mistakes in our design.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.430
Sorry about that.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.920
Well, here's the good news.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.510
That's a thing of the past.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.530
With the new APIs that first
shipped in Google Play services

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.210
8.3, we've greatly
streamlined it.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.860
First, you pick that you
want to sign in with Google.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.840
Note the nifty new
Alphabet branding.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.640
We'll show more of
that in a second.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.180
Then, your users are
asked to pick the account.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.320
And then, they're in your app.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.880
So easy it's not even worth
shooting a video about it,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.290
right?

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.440
But I've started,
so I'll finish.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.330
Earlier, I spoke about
the new graphics.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.370
There's a set of branding
guidelines about them

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.620
at this URL.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.270
Here you can find
the standard button

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.630
that I've shown in both
light and dark themes.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.930
You can download graphics
for it in disabled, focus,

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.580
normal, and pressed modes.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.550
And the basic elements are there
so that you can customize it

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.540
in all kinds of dpi,
including hdpi, ldpi,

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.770
all the way up to xxxhdpi.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.530
And don't worry.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.777
This triple x is safe for work.

00:02:12.777 --> 00:02:14.110
And that's it for this Dev Byte.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.530
Stay tuned to the Android
Developers channel on YouTube

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.000
for more, including how you can
write all the code to achieve

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.430
this kind of sign-in
and allowing your users

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.810
to share their identity
with your server.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.050
I'm Laurence Moroney.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.140
And you're going to
go build better apps.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.790
