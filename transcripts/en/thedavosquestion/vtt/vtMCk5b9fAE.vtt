00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.610
&gt;&gt; When I tell people what I do, I'm often
called an idealist.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.910
People look at me and they say, so, you want
to change the world?

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.840
Well, actually I don't think that we need
to change the world at all.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.509
I think that the world is perfect as it is.
I think that what we need to change is how

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.829
we treat the world, our
attitudes toward the world.

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:30.529
&gt;&gt; My name is Lee White and I live here.
When we consider the state of the world, economic

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.210
collapse, climate
change, species depletion, food crises, acts

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.170
of genocide, terrorism and
a war, and the increasing disparities between

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.070
those who have and those
who don't, it's daunting.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.769
&gt;&gt; We live in the globalized world where corporations
are getting

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.570
more and more influence and have more reach
than governments which are

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.050
in many cases bound to their national borders.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.890
&gt;&gt; I actually believe now that enough people
can see through the

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.250
illusionary way which banks can and legally
do conjure into existence

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.260
money out of thin air.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.829
&gt;&gt; There are many puzzles and mysteries in
the mechanisms of aging.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.140
Equally puzzling is why the fight against
aging is not on the world's

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.740
agenda.
Are just a few people interested in why we're

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.740
aging?

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.090
&gt;&gt; Critics like Danbesa Moyo have accurately
and truthfully pointed out

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.321
that we have sent billions and billions of
our tax dollars to the

00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:18.320
developing world and much it of it has just
disappeared.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.119
It's also true that when you are just dumping
money from a rich country

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.229
to a poor country that you can create dependence.
These are problems with aid.

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.090
But it's also true as people like Dr. Jeffery
Sacs have accurately

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.549
pointed out targeting specific problems can
create a huge impact that

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:31.740
help break the cycle of poverty.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.380
&gt;&gt; I believe in nonviolence struggling, in
fighting against wars in

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.829
this world, in fighting against human rights
violations.

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:46.500
&gt;&gt; 3 million girls a year are cut forcibly.
FGM happens because women are disempowered.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.780
They deserve to reach their potential.
They deserve access to education, autonomy

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.840
over their own bodies.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:04.600
&gt;&gt; We are portrayed as a world where you have
the North with idea, with

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:12.671
technology, with capital.
And the South is portrayed as this land of

00:02:12.671 --> 00:02:17.470
lack of opportunity,
corruption, and problems.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.870
And if that were the case, then the only thing
we need to do is to

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.600
transfer money and resources from the North
to the South.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.860
And we know that is not pathway that we need
to follow.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.670
&gt;&gt; If we want to survive as a species, folks,
we've got to act together

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.850
as a species.
Thank you for your attention.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:37.850
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.280
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Well, I'd like to welcome
you here.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.110
My name is Nicholas Kristof.
I'm a columnist from the New York Times.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.340
And I -- this is an unusual session in a couple
of ways, but first of

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.920
all, I want to kind of give a bit of a PG
warning.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.150
And the reason is that we realized as we walked
in, that the topic it

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.160
says "Design Your Cause."
And so I think some of you may be here to

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.590
figure out how to design your
own cause or promote it.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.950
And this emerged because Julia Lalla-Maharajh
designed her cause which

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.440
happened to be female genital mutilation.
So as a result, this panel is about a discussion

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.861
of where we go and how
we deal with female genital mutilation.

00:03:22.861 --> 00:03:26.510
And we didn't want to have a lot of people
wincing in the audience if

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.270
you were expecting a discussion about, you
know, how one goes about how

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.230
designing your cause.
So fair warning.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:41.730
And, of course, this is unusual in that respect
that, you know, we

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.430
associate Davos with turgid discussions of
interest rates and Middle

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.310
East policy and whatever, not particularly
about genital cutting.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.050
The other way in which this was most unusual
was that this topic arose

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.940
from a YouTube audience.
And we've talked all the time about the importance

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.800
of social media, how
we can build campaigns.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:08.240
Well this is an embodiment of precisely that.
And if you are here in the room, of course,

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.700
please turn off your cell
phones.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.251
If you are at home watching on YouTube, then
turn on your cell phones

00:04:13.251 --> 00:04:24.250
really loudly and just hit pause.
Um, as I said, this topic arose because people

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.969
on YouTube were invited
to vote among some competing ideas, some competing

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:32.770
causes.
And Julia Lalla-Maharajh, I want to -- you

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.419
want to raise your hand
there?

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:43.099
Um, Julia submitted a video which explains
her passion, her cause, and

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:44.640
let's cut to that now.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.420
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:52.150
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: Last year, I volunteered
in Ethiopia.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.120
And one of the things I saw there, female
genital mutilation, has

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.590
completely changed the path of my life.
I realized I couldn't look away from this

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.610
urgent issue.
So I came back to London and volunteered with

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.259
an organization.
And a friend sent me a link to the YouTube

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:17.449
Debates saying someone with
a urgent human rights cause had to go to Davos.

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.419
And I thought, this is got to be it.
So why send me to Davos?

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:27.650
Because I want to ask those innovative and
intrepid world leaders to

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.810
put their hearts and minds and power behind
ending FGM.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:42.210
I've just found out that I am going to Davos.
Since I won, I've been doing a video diary

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.819
every day and really just
trying to raise awareness of the basics of

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:50.310
this very complex issue.
So what is FGM?

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.439
It's very simply the removal of a girl's external
genitals, the

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:54.599
clitoris, the labia, and in severe cases,
the wound that's left is sewn

00:05:54.599 --> 00:06:07.909
up, so there's only a tiny hole left.
I'm just pleased the day is here, actually,

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:11.180
because it's been a lot of
prep to get to this point.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.389
It's night one in Davos and as you can see,
it's absolutely beautiful.

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:22.520
My belief is that issues like this can't stay
on the margins, that they

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.199
really have to be debated at the highest levels.

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.090
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.780
BILL CLINTON: I'll follow up.
Bless you.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:38.289
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: I'm really delighted
I entered this competition.

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:43.370
Who would have thought ten days later I would
go from my kitchen table

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.849
to Davos?
But let's not be complacent.

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:49.620
This is just a few days at Davos.
There's so much more to be done.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.520
There's still 3 million girls a year being
cut.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:07:07.039
So what can we do together today to help do
something about this?

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:12.220
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:20.870
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Well, hats off to Julia
on that, and fair warning,

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.910
as you can see, she may well buttonhole you
in the room and try to get

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:30.610
you to join the movement.
I also think it's really quite extraordinary

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.150
that considering all the
causes that there that the YouTube audience

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.410
a large audience chose this
one as a foremost issue that they wanted to

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.090
address.
And I think in a larger sense it does reflect

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:44.809
the degree to which the
rights of women and girls around the world

00:07:44.809 --> 00:07:50.270
are rising on the agenda.
But, um, Julia I wonder if you could -- if

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.430
we could just start off by
you just addressing this question, you know,

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.849
given all the concerns
that we have around the world, whether on

00:07:56.849 --> 00:08:00.020
the human rights front or on
the environmental front, economic front.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:05.650
Why do you think this one is the one that
should rise to the top and

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:09.150
why indeed did the -- did the YouTube generation,
which is maybe more

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.870
your generation than mine, alas, sign up for
it?

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.689
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: You know, I think it
just really caught people's

00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:20.909
hearts and minds and actually it has languished
in that box that we all

00:08:20.909 --> 00:08:25.029
tick that says this is too difficult.
This is a taboo area.

00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:30.590
This is something that we didn't know about.
And as a result, I think just coming out,

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:35.160
and saying three million
girls a year are still being cut -- people

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.590
just caught onto that.
And a lot of the comments on YouTube actually

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:43.090
said, we didn't realize
this still happened.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:49.710
And I think just bringing it out in that way.
And also, you know, what was wonderful was

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:55.620
people could go very
instantly and look at clips about FGM in far

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.910
more detail.
So using social media in that way, actually

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:03.180
allowing people to inform
themselves about what the issue was, I think,

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.470
you know, just created
this tidal wave of interest.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:09.750
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: We have a terrific panel
and indeed a lot of

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.690
questions that have been submitted by YouTube
viewers.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:19.040
And we'll also, you know, invite your comments
and questions as well.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.700
Here on my left, beside me is Kathy Calvin,
who's the head of the UN

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.710
Foundation, which has been very involved in
this issue.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.920
Beside her, Larry Cox, who is the head of
Amnesty International, the

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.370
Executive Director of Amnesty, which has likewise
been involved in this

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:39.890
as a central human rights issue.
And Ann Veneman, the Director, Executive Director

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:46.550
of UNICEF, which has
both gathered the data on this -- the 3 million

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:50.430
figure annually in
Africa alone figure that Julia cited, and

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:56.360
is also been very active in
supporting one of the ventures in Senegal,

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:01.770
Tostan, that has been most
effective in really seeing progress against

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:07.080
this.
Kathy, let me maybe start with you.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.570
You know, is indeed one of the problems that
this does feel like a

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:17.820
taboo topic; that you know, it always seems
to me that AIDS -- so many

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.110
millions of more people died of AIDS because
it involved sex and it was

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.390
hard to talk about.
It is the problem here that it involves genitals

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.870
and so it's something
that it's very hard to have a serious conversation

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:26.870
about.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.390
KATHY CALVIN: You know, I actually think it's
not a hard subject to

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.770
have a conversation about -- and that Julia
said the right thing.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.730
I don't think people really understand that
it's still exists.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.610
It sort of one of those things that we heard
about in our childhood and

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:42.210
we don't hear enough about it today.
So my -- my hat is off to Julia for bringing

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.460
this back up front and
center.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.420
I think the other reason we don't hear as
much about it is it's about

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:50.080
girls.
And we don't really have an understanding

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.830
of the life of 600 million
girls around the world, that they don't get

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.760
to stay in school, they get
married off early.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:02.030
They are subject to genital mutilation.
Their lives are challenges in ways that American

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:05.040
girls don't really
understand and when they hear about it, they're

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.320
shocked.
They think it's unfair, and they want to do

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.520
something.
So yes, there's probably something about how

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.300
do we talk about this?
I frankly think reproductive health is just

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.040
as difficult to talk about
especially when it comes to girls, but increasingly

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.710
people -- I heard
Melinda Gates yesterday speaking out about

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.800
it.
It's time to deal with these issues and so

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.150
here we are.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:30.970
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Larry, one of the -- I had
a conversation once with

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:35.810
a Sudanese diya, a women who does the cutting
and I pushed her on

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:39.190
genital cutting and she said, this is our
culture.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:43.560
This is our religion.
What business is it of you Americans whether

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.650
we circumcise our
daughters?

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.440
How do we answer her?

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.950
LARRY COX: Well, it's a very important question.
And when Amnesty started working on this several

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.620
decades ago, it was a
question that actually for awhile even divided

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.870
our own membership.
People were very afraid that they were being

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:03.140
culturally insensitive or
even imperialistic in taking this on.

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:07.420
I think what makes the difference is hearing
the voices of the actual

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.370
women who experienced this and who are fighting
against it.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:14.250
It then becomes clear it's not a question
 -- who defines the culture

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:17.940
and how does culture change?
Culture is not something stagnant.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:23.120
Of course, it's easy for us to say, you know,
human rights always trump

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.820
culture.
It's also interesting that these cultural

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:30.500
arguments are usually not
always used to justify cruelty and pain that

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.821
effect women and not men.
I think if men were being cut in this way,

00:12:33.821 --> 00:12:37.020
somehow the cultural
arguments would fade away.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:42.890
But I think it is very important to: (A) listen
to the women

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:45.700
themselves make their voices heard because
that completely undercuts

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.260
the argument that this is something being
imposed from abroad.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.340
It's not.
And secondly, I think it is important to take

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.640
the cultural argument
seriously in the sense that to end the practice,

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.070
one has to really
seriously address how you get the whole community

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:04.560
to understand that
this is something which is not in the interests

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.620
of a community, not in
the interests of the girl they care about.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:13.810
And to take the lead in fact in trying to
stop it.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:19.500
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Let me, Ann, let me sort
of follow up on that in the

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:24.310
sense that this is something that the West
has pushed hard against

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:30.700
really since the 1920s.
I think because of British influence Sudan

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:36.580
banned infibulation which is
the worst kind of FGM back in 1925 and a similar

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:42.010
period in Kenya.
And in fact, it really led in those, especially

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:45.540
in those early periods,
to something of a backlash.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.720
It was this sense these outside imperialists
telling us what to do,

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.510
this is our culture.
So Ann, if you could maybe talk a little bit

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:57.330
about I mean is it fair to
say that especially since the 1970s when there

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:03.610
was a ramped up effort
that that effort really didn't, that it really

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.870
was something of a
failure, which is my view.

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.722
But that now, in the last ten years or so,
we're kind of getting the

00:14:10.722 --> 00:14:11.722
formula for what works?

00:14:11.722 --> 00:14:18.090
ANN VENEMAN: I think, um, part of the problem
is as you say that

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:25.570
people react to having them, having them their
cultures, you know, said

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:31.550
that they're not right.
So as Nick mentioned one of the organizations

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:35.260
that has been very
successful is an organization called Tostan,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:40.290
T-O-S-T-A-N, for of you
who want to look it up on the web.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.480
It works primarily in West Africa, but also
across the band of Africa

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:50.250
where this practice is most prevalent.
But I think the important thing about is that

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:55.100
it starts at the
community level with community discussions.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:15:00.320
One of the first things that they did was
they no longer referred to it

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.530
as female genital mutilation, because the
word "mutilation" is

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:12.260
judgmental, the word cutting is factual.
This came about with conversations with the

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.560
leadership of the
communities themselves.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:19.310
I've visited the first community that Tostan
began in.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:24.670
And they started by talking with the imam,
the senior leader.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:29.460
This was a community where men and women were
so separated that the

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:34.350
women literally had to walk in a different
part of the whole community

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:39.860
if the men were sitting in the town square.
There was absolutely no mixing of men and

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.200
women.
So they began with the imam to talk about

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:47.550
the health impacts.
And suddenly the lights go on, and say, well,

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:51.500
yes, I remember my niece
went a little crazy after this because of

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:56.510
infection.
Well, they had never put the health impacts

00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:00.980
really on the agenda.
So then they begin to talk about it as a human

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:07.320
rights issue.
The community now, has come together men and

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:14.910
women, not only has this
practice -- they've abandoned it as a community,

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:19.160
but they've also seen
that the education rates have gone up; the

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:25.050
access to health care has
gone up; better access for women to reproductive

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.800
health services and
attended births.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.090
So there's been a lot of impacts of working
together as a community.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:35.230
Now the other thing that they found, again,
a cultural aspect is you

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:39.810
couldn't just do it in one community.
And so you had to reach out to the other communities

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:45.670
because the
question was if my daughter is not cut, she

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:49.240
won't be able to get
married because it's a cultural expectation.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:53.990
And so they had to begin to work in groups
of communities to really get

00:16:53.990 --> 00:17:01.350
impact on this practice.
Now, there are over 4,000 communities now

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.680
in Senegal that have
abandoned as a result of this community-based

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.159
approach.
And so I think we now know what the formula

00:17:06.159 --> 00:17:07.159
is that works.

00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:10.409
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: And just to push a little
harder.

00:17:10.409 --> 00:17:15.780
I mean, it is fair to say that the previous
campaign really since the

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:21.569
1970s, these laws passed, conferences held
 -- I was in Guinea last year

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:27.059
where FGM is punishable by life imprisonment
on the part of the

00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:31.389
parents, or in some cases if the girl dies,
actually by execution.

00:17:31.389 --> 00:17:35.110
And yet, 99 percent of Guinean girls are still
cut.

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:39.669
I mean, given the need to learn from mistakes,
is it fair to say that

00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:44.870
that long campaign, until the more community-based
approach of Tostan,

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:49.210
really is a failure that we should learn from?
And I'll toss that out to anybody.

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:54.759
I don't mean to subject Ann to -- to this.
But, I mean you're welcome to address that

00:17:54.759 --> 00:17:56.260
Ann or anybody else can jump
in.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:00.441
ANN VENEMAN: I think, I mean I think this
is one of the consequences

00:18:00.441 --> 00:18:05.759
is that, you know, people don't want to be
told what to do particularly

00:18:05.759 --> 00:18:09.649
when they believe it's part of their culture
that has been around for

00:18:09.649 --> 00:18:12.970
generations.
On the other hand, one of the countries with

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:16.940
the highest prevalence of
female genital cutting is Egypt.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:21.279
And they have, particularly with some of the
women in the country

00:18:21.279 --> 00:18:25.710
speaking out themselves, some of the local
women, some of the leaders

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.870
including the First Lady speaking out on these
issues, they're finding

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:33.860
that they can have an impact particularly
as more and more women get

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.940
access or more and more families get access
to television.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:41.399
So they can address some of these issues on
things like soap operas or

00:18:41.399 --> 00:18:45.970
other ways of communicating with women on
television to begin a little

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:49.429
bit more dialogue about whether or not this
is really something that

00:18:49.429 --> 00:18:52.530
has to be continued in the culture or whether
or not it can be changed.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:58.280
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: And I think as well,
Nick, that the absolute

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:02.830
importance of a multilevel approach, so the
community grassroots level

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.639
work is absolutely vital.
But unless, as you say, the legislation is

00:19:06.639 --> 00:19:11.320
there, unless legislation is
enforced, unless there's allied advocacy,

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:16.519
a media campaign's coming in
to tell people about the changes in law.

00:19:16.519 --> 00:19:22.870
Recently, Uganda outlawed FGM, but there's
a criticism there that

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.970
governments done very little to actually tell
people within Uganda that

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:30.659
it's illegal.
So you need an approach across the board that

00:19:30.659 --> 00:19:32.300
is there to reinforce
this message.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.830
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: And Julia, there's a question
here that from a

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:43.269
YouTube viewer, um, and I wondered if you
could answer it while raising

00:19:43.269 --> 00:19:47.600
some of the consequences, the practical consequences,
in terms of

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.990
health sexual assault whatever it may be.
Mitch from London says if you could spend

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:54.280
five minutes with a
grandmother of a girl that was about to be

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.309
cut, presumably the
grandmother being -- the assumption is grandmother

00:19:58.309 --> 00:20:00.490
is the decisionmaker
there, if you could spend five minutes with

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:05.179
a grandmother of a girl who
was about to cut, what would you say?

00:20:05.179 --> 00:20:06.179
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: You know the first thing
 --

00:20:06.179 --> 00:20:08.090
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: And actually if -- maybe
let's pretend Mitch didn't

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.679
say five-minutes, let's say one minute.

00:20:10.679 --> 00:20:13.460
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: Okay.
Not five minutes.

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:19.169
Actually first of all I'd listen.
I'm volunteering in this area and I know as

00:20:19.169 --> 00:20:22.779
Larry was talking about
this charge of cultural imperialism coming

00:20:22.779 --> 00:20:26.330
in changing communities.
I cannot sit in front of a grandmother and

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:31.009
leap in and tell her why
this is wrong.

00:20:31.009 --> 00:20:37.850
But what I can do is talk about health impacts,
as Ann said, the causal

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:44.519
links between what happens in FGM, and then
the constant infections,

00:20:44.519 --> 00:20:50.619
the sepsis, the childbirth complications,
everything that results are

00:20:50.619 --> 00:20:54.059
not known often because the girls are cut
at such a young age.

00:20:54.059 --> 00:20:57.090
So they don't realize that the impacts that
this has.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:02.360
And in fact, many circumcisers are the greatest
advocates within their

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.770
own community to say why this must end, once
they've seen it.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:12.259
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Larry, your -- you and your
organization are

00:21:12.259 --> 00:21:19.950
obviously focused on human rights.
And if a -- um, what -- has the human rights

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:27.350
community been sort of
slow to look, to focus on some of these broad

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:29.540
issues that involve every
home?

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:33.760
In other words if a -- if a Sudanese dissident
gets arrested by the

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.200
government, then obviously everybody writes
letters.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:43.600
If 3 million girls a year get cut, then you
know, whether it's

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.539
organizations, whether it's we in the media,
everybody -- that people

00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:50.040
kind of tune out.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.539
LARRY COX: Yeah.
There's no doubt about that.

00:21:52.539 --> 00:21:56.430
We have been too slow.
And it's a sort of painful history to have

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:57.619
to look at.
To understand not only the importance of this

00:21:57.619 --> 00:22:03.490
issue but the important
general of the rights of women as key not

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:07.110
only to women but to in fact
the advancement of all human rights.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:10.490
And it really was the Women's Movement that
pushed the human rights

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:16.340
community to begin to understand this.
And as it did, our work on all human rights

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:21.410
began to improve because
the lessons that you've learned about FGM

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:25.240
are lessons that in fact
apply to other human rights violations as

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.740
well.
That you have to work with the community,

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.320
that you have to understand,
you have to listen, that you have to empower

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.919
the people who are there
and you also understand that in this issue,

00:22:32.919 --> 00:22:38.700
it's not simply a question
of -- of this issue separate from the larger

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:42.240
issue of violence against
women and the larger issue of the devaluation

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.090
of women, of the
discrimination against women.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:47.740
I don't think you can really solve -- and
Tostan certainly took this

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.090
approach the reason it adopted a human rights
approach was because

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:55.080
human rights speak across-the-board.
That has a holistic vision of what people

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.279
need.
It's not just issue-oriented, but it's issued

00:22:57.279 --> 00:22:59.139
on the basic rights that
everyone needs.

00:22:59.139 --> 00:23:02.519
And when it did that, the community began
to understand this not as a

00:23:02.519 --> 00:23:06.240
isolated cultural practice that everyone condemned
by as part of

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.789
general fight for the human rights of everybody
in the community.

00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:14.200
And I think that made a difference.
But we have learned a lot.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:18.259
And we need to keep learning.
I think now, I'm proud to say, that certainly

00:23:18.259 --> 00:23:23.909
my own organization has
made the rights of women central, central

00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:25.769
to its work on human rights.

00:23:25.769 --> 00:23:28.730
KATHY CALVIN: And I would just add where the
UN is on the ground

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:32.870
dealing with this, whether it's UNICEF or
UNFPA, the population fund,

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:36.630
or UNIFEM, the approach is actually a very
holistic one where they're

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:40.090
trying to keep the girls in school and take
care of all the other

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:43.659
issues that change both the culture of the
community, and the girls'

00:23:43.659 --> 00:23:48.409
own aspirations for her life, in effect, empowering
her.

00:23:48.409 --> 00:23:51.950
But the cutting takes place at such an early
age, you have to deal

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:55.029
with, then, the mothers and the fathers and
the whole community.

00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:58.340
So the girl doesn't become an advocate for
herself until it's too late.

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:02.029
I find it interesting that, you know, there's
roughly 28 countries in

00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:06.570
which it's prevalent still.
19 of them have laws against it, it is criminal,

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:08.700
criminalized in those
countries.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.580
But that's only half, and even in those countries,
we're still fighting

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.549
this battle.
So there is a rule of law problem here that

00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:16.029
I'm sure you're dealing
with as well.

00:24:16.029 --> 00:24:21.840
That it -- that's not the only answer obviously.
You need -- you need these groups in there

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:26.149
trying to change the culture
at the group level.

00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:27.789
LARRY COX: And it's also important to point
out it's not a problem

00:24:27.789 --> 00:24:30.870
that just confined to Africa or -- I mean,
it's now around the world.

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:36.429
It's in Europe; it's in the United States.
And that even makes it even more complicated

00:24:36.429 --> 00:24:40.539
to talk about how you're
going to -- to stop it.

00:24:40.539 --> 00:24:45.300
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Well, that actually goes
to a question here from Rob

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:54.289
from Loos, which is think is in the UK, asks,
"You and others have

00:24:54.289 --> 00:24:56.749
talked about the need to stop FGM within a
generation.

00:24:56.749 --> 00:24:58.040
Do you really think you can do it?"
Kathy?

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.909
KATHY CALVIN: Well, there's a goal that the
UN has set that to

00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:04.940
eliminate by 2015, which is the date for the
millennium development

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.950
goals.
I don't think there's any real we shouldn't

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:10.590
be trying for that.
That's far enough away that we could really

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:15.309
do a concerted effort and
frankly, it's going to take a global campaign,

00:25:15.309 --> 00:25:17.379
you know.
And we need a global campaign for girls.

00:25:17.379 --> 00:25:19.690
This ought to be right front and center at
the beginning of it.

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:20.760
So I think it's doable.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.450
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: So there's a -- there may
be a parallel with China.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:27.639
Foot binding was actually punishable by exile
on the part of

00:25:27.639 --> 00:25:30.769
the parents -- had zero impact.
At various points, it was banned.

00:25:30.769 --> 00:25:34.369
No impact.
And then early in the 20th century, really

00:25:34.369 --> 00:25:37.480
remarkable quickly, it
disappeared.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.600
And it went from a perception on the part
of parents that if they

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.909
didn't bind their daughter's feet, that it
would be hard for her to

00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:47.200
marry, to a perception that if they bound
her feet, it would be harder

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.980
for her to get married.
And, um, it, you know, I guess that --

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:57.299
KATHY CALVIN: One emperor changed the rule,
changed the perception.

00:25:57.299 --> 00:26:02.299
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: It was a really a bottom-up
social movement, um, led

00:26:02.299 --> 00:26:08.379
by elites from within the country, um, part
of this sense of awakening.

00:26:08.379 --> 00:26:12.869
And supported by outsiders to some degree
but -- but really led from

00:26:12.869 --> 00:26:18.999
within, pushed from within.
So I guess the question is how we can replicate

00:26:18.999 --> 00:26:22.649
that, and whether
groups like Tostan are indeed -- whether this

00:26:22.649 --> 00:26:27.389
is the next sort of foot
binding analogy, so that the change once it

00:26:27.389 --> 00:26:30.320
comes you've reached the
tipping point, it will happen very, very quickly.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.529
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: I just want to come
back to that point Kathy

00:26:33.529 --> 00:26:38.850
made of 2015.
I wished I shared your optimism, Kathy.

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:43.330
I just feel that we're here talking about
solutions.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:47.340
We seem to know what works.
We know this model is there.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:51.100
We know about the respect we have to give
to communities.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:56.919
Um, and many, many local NGOs and civil society
organizations are

00:26:56.919 --> 00:27:02.470
working on the ground, and you know to pay
tribute to all of those

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:08.169
small organizations really at danger as well.
One of the women who's contacted me through

00:27:08.169 --> 00:27:12.739
this campaign, Lucy Maswa,
who said, you know, go forth and speak at

00:27:12.739 --> 00:27:17.409
Davos about this.
And her story, once she started speaking out

00:27:17.409 --> 00:27:21.669
within her community, she
was raped, she was beaten, she was tied to

00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:27.260
a tree, she was jailed.
She's luckily living now in the US.

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:34.519
But I think what we need to see is how we
can in the next five years,

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:39.489
if that is true, take this to scale -- I'm
using the language of Davos

00:27:39.489 --> 00:27:45.399
there -- but really, you know, what is preventing
us if we know how to

00:27:45.399 --> 00:27:50.629
make things change, why can't we put this
into place?

00:27:50.629 --> 00:27:54.289
It is a funding issue?
It is a global awareness issue?

00:27:54.289 --> 00:27:57.570
What needs to happen?
What are the levers that we can pull?

00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:02.129
If we were sitting here saying actually this
is to intractable; this is

00:28:02.129 --> 00:28:05.090
too difficult.
We're not going to address this issue.

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:08.499
Fair enough.
But we're all sitting here in vehement agreement

00:28:08.499 --> 00:28:12.909
that is a severe
abuse, a child's right abuse, a women's right

00:28:12.909 --> 00:28:15.230
abuse.
We've got a solution.

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:16.679
What can we do?

00:28:16.679 --> 00:28:20.909
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: A bunch people from on YouTube
asked variations of

00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:26.759
that, you know, what have we learned from
 -- from, well, one person

00:28:26.759 --> 00:28:29.720
asked what have we learned from HIV campaigns
that can be transposed

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:33.240
into working to eradicate FGM, various other
people asked, you know,

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:37.429
variations of that.
But Ann, given what you talked about earlier,

00:28:37.429 --> 00:28:43.780
isn't indeed one lesson
perhaps that a bunch of outsiders, at the

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:49.299
treetops, the top-down
efforts on their own aren't going to get very

00:28:49.299 --> 00:28:54.899
far and that what does
work is outsiders supporting indigenous efforts

00:28:54.899 --> 00:28:59.669
from within the
culture, and giving them the microphone and

00:28:59.669 --> 00:29:02.029
us standing back and
letting them lead the way.

00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:04.191
I mean, is that -- is that part of it?

00:29:04.191 --> 00:29:07.129
ANN VENEMAN: Well, I absolutely think it's
part of it.

00:29:07.129 --> 00:29:13.619
I think that if you can't change the norms,
the practices of

00:29:13.619 --> 00:29:19.419
communities unless you listen and understand
and have a dialogue.

00:29:19.419 --> 00:29:24.909
And again the Tostan approach did exactly
that, listened to the why,

00:29:24.909 --> 00:29:29.850
listened to the perceptions.
And then also gave information about the health

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:35.080
effects, the facts.
I think that's one of the things that we haven't

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:39.789
done enough of as an
international community around a number of

00:29:39.789 --> 00:29:43.370
these issues.
And you mentioned HIV/AIDS, you know, one

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:48.110
of the most difficult things,
we've gotten better coverage of prevention

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:52.409
of mother-to-child
transmission, of treatment of AIDS generally,

00:29:52.409 --> 00:29:56.929
of treatment of pediatric
AIDS -- one of the most difficult things has

00:29:56.929 --> 00:30:03.379
been to understand how to
have an impact with education.

00:30:03.379 --> 00:30:07.529
It just hasn't seemed to work.
And part of it is, I don't think we understand

00:30:07.529 --> 00:30:10.450
and listen to
communities enough.

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:17.919
For example, you know, one of the things that
you talk about in

00:30:17.919 --> 00:30:21.480
Southern Africa where AIDS is most prevalent
is use of condoms.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:27.299
But there are practices in places like Swaziland,
where in order to get

00:30:27.299 --> 00:30:31.320
married, you have to get pregnant first to
show your fertility.

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.200
Well, it's a little difficult to talk about
using condoms when you want

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.590
to get pregnant.
And so, I think, if you don't listen to the

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:44.549
community and understand
the whys, the -- how the practices work and

00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:48.460
what's going on truly in
the communities and have a dialogue about

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.620
it, you can't actually make
the change.

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:55.070
And I think this, this human rights approach,
engaging the community in

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:59.659
human rights, in women's rights, in men and
women understanding each

00:30:59.659 --> 00:31:03.570
other and why things are happening is a way
to really make an impact in

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:06.419
changing some of these practices, particularly
those that are most

00:31:06.419 --> 00:31:07.549
harmful for women.

00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:08.690
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Larry?

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:12.450
LARRY COX: If I could just -- because I don't
want to create a sort of

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:17.269
dichotomy between the approach that you just
described, which I fully

00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:19.794
support, and the idea of outside pressure
because that can lead to a

00:31:19.794 --> 00:31:22.950
kind of paralysis on the part of people who
aren't able to have a

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:26.950
dialogue with the community.
And I think the lesson not only on this issue

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:30.859
but on many, many other
issues is as Julia said you need a multilevel

00:31:30.859 --> 00:31:34.749
or multifaceted kind of
approach.

00:31:34.749 --> 00:31:37.559
Because I think to take your China example,
which is really

00:31:37.559 --> 00:31:42.509
fascinating, which I want to like learn to
use more -- there was also

00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:46.419
very, very strong political will on the part
of the government that

00:31:46.419 --> 00:31:50.859
played a major role I think, as I understand
it.

00:31:50.859 --> 00:31:55.059
At least I'm thinking about --

00:31:55.059 --> 00:31:59.139
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: I actually -- I think at
previous points there was

00:31:59.139 --> 00:32:02.970
central political will that actually didn't
really get anywhere.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:07.640
And at the time when foot binding really ended
up being eradicated you

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.940
had very weak central governments that --

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:12.879
LARRY COX: All right.
I was thinking it happened after the Revolution.

00:32:12.879 --> 00:32:14.679
But it happened before?

00:32:14.679 --> 00:32:19.550
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Well, it began happening
before and the end of the

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:25.679
Ching Dynasty and then after that in a period
when you had real social

00:32:25.679 --> 00:32:28.809
awakening but pretty fragile central governments.

00:32:28.809 --> 00:32:33.519
LARRY COX: Well, at any rate, my point is
that I think you need to

00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:37.909
put -- we need to put pressure on governments
to not simply pass laws,

00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:43.769
which is the easy thing to do, but to actually
not allow the kinds of

00:32:43.769 --> 00:32:47.779
practices that Julia talked about.
I mean it's -- you know, where people are

00:32:47.779 --> 00:32:50.302
being threatened.
People are -- lives are in danger, you need,

00:32:50.302 --> 00:32:57.119
the outside world needs to
be in support in a very practical way of people

00:32:57.119 --> 00:33:02.250
who are speaking out
and who are being threatened as a result of

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:05.210
speaking out on this issue
as well as on other women's rights issues.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:10.220
So I don't think it's an either/or thing.
I think that we need very much to correct

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:15.270
what I think is a
longstanding failure to appreciate the community

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.190
approach.
But I also think we still need to keep --

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:20.759
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Let me press you on that
a little further since you

00:33:20.759 --> 00:33:27.249
have an -- a Y chromosome here.
And I think there might be some men watching

00:33:27.249 --> 00:33:33.039
whether here or on YouTube
who will think hey, you know, this isn't my

00:33:33.039 --> 00:33:36.610
fight.
I don't have a clitoris.

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:40.690
And what end -- and the same thing, I think,
applies to a lot of other

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:44.700
women's rights issues.
Um, what do you say to them?

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:45.700
Is this their fight or not?

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:51.409
LARRY COX: Oh, absolutely, it is their fight.
If they care at all about human rights, about

00:33:51.409 --> 00:33:53.210
their own freedom, and
their own dignity.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:58.019
I mean, I think that was my point about the
linkage between the fight

00:33:58.019 --> 00:34:00.049
for women's rights and the fight for all human
rights.

00:34:00.049 --> 00:34:07.210
I mean, it's not -- we all can very easily
draw the connections between

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:12.159
the status of women in any particular society
and the general status of

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:15.409
human rights in that society.
And that includes the societies in which many

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:24.280
of the people who are
watching this, um, discussion live.

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:29.700
Insofar as -- and it's the experience of my
own, my own life and my own

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:35.760
organization that it was the struggle of women
for their rights that

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:40.149
made us understand our own, our own rights
and the way things are

00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:44.049
connected, and the way that -- the approach
we were taking was a

00:34:44.049 --> 00:34:52.159
very narrow and very limited approach.
So I think it's in the vital interest of every

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:55.649
man.
And we, of course, don't live in isolation

00:34:55.649 --> 00:35:00.000
from women.
You know, we have daughters, we have wives,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.430
we have lovers.
We -- you know, it's inconceivable to me that

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:07.730
someone could say this is
not of any interest to me because I'm male

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:10.839
and this happens to women,
anymore than I would expect women to say,

00:35:10.839 --> 00:35:13.770
I'm not really interested in
what happened to Nelson Mandela because he's

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:17.470
a man and I'm a woman.
I mean what kind of world is that where we

00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:19.789
suddenly divide our
feelings?

00:35:19.789 --> 00:35:22.540
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Maybe one more way of thinking
about it is that the

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:25.390
Holocaust wasn't
a Jewish issue civil rights weren't a black

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:28.230
issue and FGM isn't just a
women's issue.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:29.230
LARRY COX: Right. Exactly.

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:33.369
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: And I think particularly,
men play such a huge

00:35:33.369 --> 00:35:37.400
part in the communities that practice this
as Ann has said because one

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:42.410
of the key reasons for FGM being in place
is it makes a girl marriageable.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:46.170
And when, as part of these community conversations,
the men come

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:52.109
together and decide that they will marry an
uncut woman, this is how it

00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:55.930
changes within a generation.
And you then move though to the next community

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:58.160
which is the
intra-marrying group.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:02.089
So men are so vital in this debate and particularly
as religious

00:36:02.089 --> 00:36:03.089
leaders as well.

00:36:03.089 --> 00:36:07.270
KATHY CALVIN: And I think when we focus on
rights, we get stuck.

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:10.530
When we focus on economics, which is really
what this all comes down to

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:14.680
is kind of what's a girl worth and is this
about marrying her for her

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:19.520
value -- it changes.
I think because it's girls, people do react

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.109
differently than women.
So I think that's going to help bring more

00:36:22.109 --> 00:36:26.490
people to the issue.
We've used economic incentives in a number

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:30.369
of cases to get communities
to think differently about early marriage.

00:36:30.369 --> 00:36:34.410
And the consequence of the man finally having
a reason to stop and

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:38.910
think about his daughter marrying early or
marrying late, when there's

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:43.930
an economic incentive to do so.
And in the case, in Ethiopia, a girl who stays

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:48.960
in school is eligible
for a sheep or a goat for her family if she

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.270
stays in school two more
years.

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:56.359
The fathers have been saying, hmmm, I wasn't
really in the conversation

00:36:56.359 --> 00:36:58.309
before.
I had no reason to have the conversation.

00:36:58.309 --> 00:37:01.440
I had no reason to think about it.
I had no reason to think about the value my

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:05.170
daughter could bring to my
family if she stayed in school longer.

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:11.540
The economic incentive got him to pay attention.
So I'm for the hybrid solution, which is the

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:16.030
community, the listening,
incentives where we can -- where we can apply

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:17.819
them.
And I know not everybody loves incentives

00:37:17.819 --> 00:37:22.339
but I think they work and the
external pressure.

00:37:22.339 --> 00:37:26.240
but I think rights sometimes gets people into
the different kind of

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.241
conversation where we have -- we have a different
view of rights.

00:37:29.241 --> 00:37:31.990
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Speaking of a different
kind of conversation, we've

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:34.750
been -- we've been discussing at one level.
But I want to kind of make it real.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:41.920
And we have a video clip from Mali, and I
have not yet seen it.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:46.020
I'm briefed that everybody in the history
who has ever seen it has

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:49.579
promptly burst into tears afterward so pull
out your handkerchiefs.

00:37:49.579 --> 00:38:13.490
But if we can role that, that would be great.

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:27.410
[VIDEO PLAYING]

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:41.339
[CHILDREN CRYING]

00:38:41.339 --> 00:39:49.660
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Well, that goes a zillion
times a day in much of the

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:54.059
world.
And, um, I don't know exactly what kind of

00:39:54.059 --> 00:39:59.760
cutting this was, but it did
not appear to be infibulation which is the

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:04.859
much worse kind.
And in that case, the girls' legs are afterward

00:40:04.859 --> 00:40:10.260
often tied together,
and for a couple weeks or so the wound can

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:20.029
heal.
And is, you know, is that squared.

00:40:20.029 --> 00:40:26.849
Jennifer, I'm sorry, Jane, from the UK asks
how can women fight GM in

00:40:26.849 --> 00:40:32.779
cultures where they have no voice?
And likewise, Sam from Devin says FGM seems

00:40:32.779 --> 00:40:36.690
to be about what women in
some cultures believe they must do and be,

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:39.960
to have value to the men who
hold power.

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:42.240
If we're to change the thinking of men and
women in these cultures what

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.140
can we draw from our own experience to guide
us?

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:47.859
And let me put out this -- frame that to the
panel.

00:40:47.859 --> 00:40:52.220
I mean, I think that there's a perception
that this is often really

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:55.960
about men oppressing women, and it seems to
me at least that it's much

00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:01.430
more complicated than that.
And typically, this is what women, in fact,

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:06.430
are doing to other women.
That the men, they may want to marry a girl

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:09.289
who's cut but they're
largely removed from the decision making.

00:41:09.289 --> 00:41:12.760
And in fact, partly because men are more likely
to be educated they --

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:18.420
it seems quite plausible to me that men are
more likely to be against

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:24.089
FGM than women are in these countries.
I don't know any survey but that, anecdotally,

00:41:24.089 --> 00:41:26.549
I wouldn't be surprised
if that's the case.

00:41:26.549 --> 00:41:32.440
So I wonder if the problem, you know, isn't
often patriarchal values

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:37.140
even misogynistic values, that are absorbed
and transmitted as much by

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:40.690
women as by men, you know, if that isn't a
better way of looking at

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:42.630
this than men oppressing women.

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:48.950
KATHY CALVIN: Well, and the video just showed
women are the primary

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:52.920
carriers of the culture.
I mean, Ann, you've probably -- because you've

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.430
seen it, you know, that
is the way it's passed on.

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:59.590
And you may have a point of view on that but
that's how it -- it is

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:00.661
carried into the community.

00:42:00.661 --> 00:42:08.289
ANN VENEMAN: Well, I think that, I mean, certainly
that clip showed

00:42:08.289 --> 00:42:13.400
that it is practiced -- when it's actually
done, it's women who cut the

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:19.910
girls.
And -- but yet, it is the men who were saying

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:24.109
my daughter will not be
able to get married if she's not cut.

00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:30.059
So I think it's -- it's a practice, it's a
culture that has to be

00:42:30.059 --> 00:42:33.020
addressed as a whole not -- it's not just
women.

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:36.559
It's not just men.
It's everybody's responsibility to kind of

00:42:36.559 --> 00:42:38.450
look at how this is going to
change.

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:44.089
Now having said that, it is not the same -- it's
not practiced the same

00:42:44.089 --> 00:42:50.680
in every country.
I went a year before last to Sierra Leone.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:55.630
I was reading my briefing papers and I find
out female genital cutting

00:42:55.630 --> 00:43:02.410
is quite prevalent in Sierra Leon.
So I call up Molly Melching, who founded Tostan,

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:04.579
and I said, what are
you doing in Sierra Leone?

00:43:04.579 --> 00:43:07.640
And she said, we're not because it's completely
different.

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:15.299
They practice something called secret societies.
And secret societies are where girls would

00:43:15.299 --> 00:43:20.619
go before there was an
education system, they would go off for maybe

00:43:20.619 --> 00:43:25.170
a few months at a time
and they would learn how to be a wife.

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:27.839
They'd learn how to do all of these different
things.

00:43:27.839 --> 00:43:32.880
This was their education.
And part of it was, they got cut.

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:38.160
Now those secret societies still exist in
Sierra Leone and still a

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:42.119
number of young girls get cut, although less
and less.

00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:45.940
And the secret societies are much less about
going for a long period of

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:51.549
time and more just about cutting now.
But one of the things I found when I was there,

00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:57.540
is that young teenage
girls who were still in school were talking

00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:02.150
about these secret
societies and these practices as things that

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:06.079
they were going to try to
help be a part of the past.

00:44:06.079 --> 00:44:11.180
And so I think there is some ability to engage
in some of these kinds

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:17.410
of communities, again, the practices are different.
And in that country, it's -- it's done in

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:20.210
a completely different way.
So I think it's again, it's about listening,

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:23.940
it's about learning.
Learning about the particular culture and

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:26.589
practices of a country and
the history of it.

00:44:26.589 --> 00:44:29.990
I think is key to finding the way to eliminate
it.

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:33.380
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Speaking of culture and
practices I mean another

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:40.520
layer of complexity here is frankly religion.
That there -- and I want to be very clear

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:48.049
here -- a great part of the
Muslim world does not practice cutting.

00:44:48.049 --> 00:44:54.180
There's nothing in the Qur'an about cutting.
In the Arabian peninsula, almost nobody does

00:44:54.180 --> 00:45:00.369
any cutting.
And there are also a number of Christian places,

00:45:00.369 --> 00:45:03.279
Ethiopia, in
particular.

00:45:03.279 --> 00:45:08.039
In fact in Ethiopia, Christians do some of
the most severe cutting.

00:45:08.039 --> 00:45:13.819
All that said, most of the cutting occurs
in Muslim countries, whether

00:45:13.819 --> 00:45:20.349
that is in Africa or in Asia.
And doesn't that -- I mean, given the problems

00:45:20.349 --> 00:45:25.069
right now between the
West and the Muslim world, doesn't that create

00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:31.960
one more layer of
complexity if you have Western efforts to

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:36.190
go against a practice that is
disproportionately embedded in the Muslim

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:41.170
world?
And I don't know who I want to hand this nice,

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:43.190
this potato to.

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:51.920
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: Can I turn it around
and just say Mauritania has

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:59.099
just issued a fatwa against FGM.
34 Islamic leaders have actually just said

00:45:59.099 --> 00:46:05.079
that this is absolutely not
in the Qur'an and not an issue.

00:46:05.079 --> 00:46:09.730
I hate to address the positives in the debate,
but you know there is

00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:12.619
change.
And at least if we know that this is one of

00:46:12.619 --> 00:46:15.089
the key issues, at least we
can begin to address it.

00:46:15.089 --> 00:46:19.160
LARRY COX: I think one of the things that
has changed that we need to

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:24.079
not keep acting as if it hasn't changed is
that, you know, human rights

00:46:24.079 --> 00:46:27.260
issues are no longer a concern of the West
somehow.

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:31.900
And the human rights movement is no longer
located in the West.

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:34.579
It's everywhere.
There are human rights organizations, there

00:46:34.579 --> 00:46:37.200
are thousands of human
rights organizations in virtually every region.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:41.819
And in the Muslim world there are incredible
organizations and fighters

00:46:41.819 --> 00:46:45.119
for human rights.
And I think what has to shift is that we need

00:46:45.119 --> 00:46:47.230
to see -- this is
something my organization has to struggle

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:51.700
with -- is how do we shift
our role from being sort of the saviors of

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:55.619
the world that savior
paradigm to a role of like really empowering

00:46:55.619 --> 00:46:59.520
and trying to help and
listen to those organizations in those cultures

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:02.049
who are fighting.
There is an incredible struggle, which we

00:47:02.049 --> 00:47:04.970
often don't publicize very
much, we don't write about it very much, we

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:10.539
act as if it's not there
within Islam, within the Muslim world, on

00:47:10.539 --> 00:47:12.940
these issues, on what it
means.

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:16.349
And that's the struggle, I think, which is
ultimately going to

00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:20.500
determine the success for the reasons we gave
about when human rights

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:25.740
succeed, it's because they're rooted in the
indigenous struggle; in the

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:28.660
culture, and that's what I think is the hope
for this.

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:32.960
That's it becoming a global issue not a Western
issue being imposed on

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:36.660
the part of the world that carries it out,
which was the model decades

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:37.660
ago.

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:41.480
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Marion from Germany asks
what do you think should be

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:44.359
the punishment levelled by the international
community for nations that

00:47:44.359 --> 00:47:50.000
permit FGM?
Um, now I don't -- my hunch is probably none

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.970
of you think countries as
such should be punished but, why not?

00:47:55.970 --> 00:48:00.150
I mean there are levers that we can apply
to countries to take this

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:02.770
issue more seriously?
Or would that create a backlash that would

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:03.770
be unhelpful?

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:08.340
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: It's already there in
the Maputo Protocol, which

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:13.160
has been signed up to by many African states,
but not yet ratified.

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:17.859
So absolutely we have role to play as an international
community to get

00:48:17.859 --> 00:48:23.260
some of these issues enshrined in law.
And, you know, we had a conversation about

00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:27.260
CEDAW, the -- elimination
of -- sorry.

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:30.950
The Commission for the Elimination of Discrimination
Against Women --

00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:37.019
trips off the tongue, you know, all of these
levers do play an

00:48:37.019 --> 00:48:40.500
important part, I think.
And we need to keep the pressure up to ensure

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.540
that they're ratified.

00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:44.671
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: CEDAW has been, of course,
passed by a hundred and

00:48:44.671 --> 00:48:49.309
-- I don't know how many countries, and one
of the very few that has

00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:57.650
not passed it is the US.
Um, let me open this up more broadly.

00:48:57.650 --> 00:48:59.150
There are folks here.
We have a microphone.

00:48:59.150 --> 00:49:04.530
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Michelle from San Francisco.
And I volunteered, I'm one of the many volunteers

00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:07.470
with V-Day and I'm
also in a doctorate program in international

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:10.650
human rights education in
San Francisco, so I wrote a paper last year

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:14.240
on FGM.
In the literature, I noticed that one of the

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:17.230
reasons why the women are
continuing the cutting is because it's one

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:19.029
of -- it's their means of
economic sustainability.

00:49:19.029 --> 00:49:22.289
So I was wondering given that it's the Economic
Forum, what

00:49:22.289 --> 00:49:25.920
public/private sector partnerships have been
built-in, if there are any

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:29.059
subsidies that governments might be giving
to women to help them

00:49:29.059 --> 00:49:33.380
transition from this profession, and what
means are -- what else we can

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:36.329
do as civil society actors to help move that
forward?

00:49:36.329 --> 00:49:41.920
And also in terms of leveraging some of the
new media technologies --

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:45.050
and Kiva.org and Women for Women International,
and Donor Choose, like

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:47.299
what we can do to help move that forward.

00:49:47.299 --> 00:49:50.670
KATHY CALVIN: You know, we've been try to
go move the issue of girls

00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:54.220
up on the agenda of Davos and have been fairly
successful, had a very

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:58.059
good session yesterday about girls and trying
to look at the actors,

00:49:58.059 --> 00:50:01.829
government, non-profits and business, and
there's a role for each.

00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:06.039
We've actually just created a girl fund to
help support with private

00:50:06.039 --> 00:50:10.049
sector money as well as government money,
work in communities to give

00:50:10.049 --> 00:50:13.510
girls more rights, keep them in school, give
them access to health and

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:16.819
freedom from these -- from sexual violence
or some of these other

00:50:16.819 --> 00:50:20.650
causes.
So I think increasingly, if we get more players

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:24.769
who are educated about
this and are engaged in it, the money does

00:50:24.769 --> 00:50:28.170
talk.
And, you know, that will be an important piece

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:30.630
of changing the way the
culture works.

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:35.079
And I -- to what Julia said earlier, I think
the communities need to

00:50:35.079 --> 00:50:39.119
see that this is part and parcel of what it
will take for them to grow

00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:42.609
and become a modern, a modern area.
So I absolutely think you're right.

00:50:42.609 --> 00:50:47.359
That we've, we've got to make this a part
of the work that all of the

00:50:47.359 --> 00:50:49.869
communities are doing, so when the US puts
money into these

00:50:49.869 --> 00:50:52.520
communities, this is one of the things they're
checking for.

00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:57.240
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: I would just also add that,
um, in -- not in

00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:02.200
Senegal, but in most other places, the person
who does the cutting is

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:05.160
the traditional birth attendant, the traditional
midwife.

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:10.510
And one -- there has to be a much broader
effort to address maternal

00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:14.609
health.
I mean, there is this, it's a scandal that

00:51:14.609 --> 00:51:18.319
more than half a million
women die a year in childbirth unnecessarily.

00:51:18.319 --> 00:51:21.839
And partly that is because there has been
a broad, and essentially

00:51:21.839 --> 00:51:24.940
failed effort, to improve maternal health
through traditional birth

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:28.619
attendants.
It did not work and now I think we're all

00:51:28.619 --> 00:51:33.210
realizing that.
But as we gear up a newer system to improve

00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:39.769
maternal health, based on
people who actually have much better training,

00:51:39.769 --> 00:51:45.599
who can refer to a
hospital, who bring people to clinics, real

00:51:45.599 --> 00:51:52.000
midwives, then I think it's
plausible that those people will then have

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.760
influence in those
communities over reproductive health.

00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:58.589
And it will go away from these traditional,
these diya, who are the

00:51:58.589 --> 00:52:01.720
ones who were doing the cutting.

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:06.529
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: Sorry.
What I find quite shocking about the FGM arena

00:52:06.529 --> 00:52:12.250
is the fact that 140
million women are living with the consequence

00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:18.490
of FGM and, um, they
appear to be missing from things like the

00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:23.950
maternal mortality debate,
from the child death, all of the MGDs that

00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:28.230
this addresses.
And the continuum of care that is needed for

00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:33.089
these women in particular
and yet, there's so much happening within

00:52:33.089 --> 00:52:36.789
this field.
And everywhere I look FGM always seems to

00:52:36.789 --> 00:52:41.119
be missing.
And I think exactly as you say all of these

00:52:41.119 --> 00:52:44.490
instruments can come into
play.

00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:49.329
And in a way, what we need to do is to be
focusing on a plethora of

00:52:49.329 --> 00:52:53.609
solutions that can help bring this back into
the mainstream, really.

00:52:53.609 --> 00:52:58.269
ANN VENEMAN: If I might just pick up on the
whole issue of maternal

00:52:58.269 --> 00:53:02.910
health and these issues, you know, we had
a little film about Mali and

00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:07.950
the prevalence of female genital cutting in
Mali, but in many of these

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:12.769
countries, there's also a very high incidence,
along with female

00:53:12.769 --> 00:53:20.150
genital cutting, of early marriage.
And the two issues combined, we know that

00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:25.240
the risks to maternal health
are greater with women who have been cut.

00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:30.930
We also know that, that a girl who was under
the age of 15 who gives

00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:35.029
birth is five -- has a five times greater
chance of dying in

00:53:35.029 --> 00:53:39.539
childbirth.
And so, when I was -- Mali was my last field

00:53:39.539 --> 00:53:43.680
trip as a matter of fact
just in November, and I had very interesting

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:48.030
conversations with the
Health Minister about his responsibility to

00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:52.130
address the issues of early
marriage and female genital cutting, because

00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:57.230
they truly are issues with
health consequences to women and effect the

00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:58.859
maternal health and
mortality issues.

00:53:58.859 --> 00:54:02.829
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: I mean, Kathy let me just
follow up on that.

00:54:02.829 --> 00:54:08.660
Given the success of this grassroots kind
of Tostan model of education,

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:15.269
discussion, leading to addressing FGM, can
that same model then be

00:54:15.269 --> 00:54:18.819
applied to the whole panoply of other issues,
of keeping girls from

00:54:18.819 --> 00:54:23.990
dropping out of school, preventing child marriage,
various reproductive

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:31.119
health questions including family planning.
I mean, is this bottom-up, grassroots, supporting

00:54:31.119 --> 00:54:35.740
the local actors
model is that something that can be used against

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:40.259
a whole variety of
other threats to the well-being of girls around

00:54:40.259 --> 00:54:41.259
the world?

00:54:41.259 --> 00:54:43.200
KATHY CALVIN: I mean, I think that's the only
way it can happen.

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:47.390
I think when we've tried to do things like
just focus on education or

00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:49.690
just focus on health, we're not nearly successful
because we're not

00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:52.640
dealing with the underlying issue of the girl's
value.

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:56.330
So if you put them all together: Economic
empowerment, education,

00:54:56.330 --> 00:54:59.119
health, especially the access to this kind
of health care and

00:54:59.119 --> 00:55:04.060
reproductive rights, then you're really dealing
with a whole chain

00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:07.119
mechanism that can make a big difference.
But it really has to be that.

00:55:07.119 --> 00:55:10.910
And luckily, the UN has a five-point approach
to girls, and that's the

00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:14.800
way they do it.
And I think increasingly we will all adopt

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:18.899
that kind of a holistic --
to your word -- holistic approach.

00:55:18.899 --> 00:55:24.009
&gt;&gt; Ron Freeman, Moscow.
Madam Lalla-Maharajh mentioned in Mauritania

00:55:24.009 --> 00:55:26.110
a collective fatwa against
FGM.

00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:29.579
I wonder if we could get a few more facts
about what lead to that and

00:55:29.579 --> 00:55:31.450
whether it was any milage, so to speak.

00:55:31.450 --> 00:55:34.490
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: I do know that there has
been a real effort by some

00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:39.840
of the community organizers to get Muslim
clerics organized in this

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:43.670
effort, because there is a perception on the
part of many ordinary

00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:47.190
people that this is religious, that this is
their religion.

00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:54.650
And so when you get Imam saying now, now,
they don't do this in Saudi

00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:59.259
Arabia, there's nothing no the Qur'an, that
then that actually has a

00:55:59.259 --> 00:56:04.710
tremendous amount of authority and so, that
has been one reason for

00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:06.640
trying to get these fatwas.

00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:11.650
&gt;&gt; Young global leaders and actually I come
from the Muslim world.

00:56:11.650 --> 00:56:15.890
And this is why I wanted to kind of to give
the comment.

00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:21.080
In fact, something like this is totally prohibited
in the Muslim world.

00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:25.720
And just kind of to rephrase Kristof's question,
I would assume it's

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:31.420
more culturally than it's religious.
So this is more actually instead of saying

00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:35.780
that it's Islam.
So that's kind of that first layer to really

00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:41.400
acknowledge it.
And I really respect that Ann Veneman by mentioning

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:45.299
that the First Lady
in Egypt stood out and acknowledged that this

00:56:45.299 --> 00:56:51.400
is totally against our --
let's say, or their traditions, their religion,

00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:56.859
and all the, let's say,
the social intrinsic values that we were raised

00:56:56.859 --> 00:57:02.809
up through.
Now, unfortunately, it's my own analysis,

00:57:02.809 --> 00:57:05.839
is only a comment so me allow
to take some time --

00:57:05.839 --> 00:57:07.999
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Please, well, have a question.

00:57:07.999 --> 00:57:11.690
&gt;&gt; There's no question.
Just wanted to clarify that.

00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:13.069
So thank you.

00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:14.359
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
I'm Jim Breyer.

00:57:14.359 --> 00:57:17.130
I'm a venture capitalist with Accel Partners
in Palo Alto.

00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:20.720
And I've been on the board of Facebook and
an investor in Facebook for

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:21.720
about five years.

00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:24.810
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: What's your next investment?

00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:29.270
&gt;&gt; Well, we have -- we have about a dozen
investments in social media

00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:33.559
companies around the world.
And Julia, and for any other panelist that

00:57:33.559 --> 00:57:38.440
might be interested, what
can we as either business investors or part

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:43.750
of the business community
around social media do better for further

00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:45.839
many of these causes that
we've talked about today?

00:57:45.839 --> 00:57:49.019
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: I'm going to talk to
you afterwards one-on-one

00:57:49.019 --> 00:57:55.360
because I need your advice.
Absolutely, I was talking about someone just

00:57:55.360 --> 00:58:02.700
the other day about how he
uses mobile phones to get medicines into villages.

00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:08.010
And able to predict supply and demand in a
much, much clearer way.

00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:11.859
And having been out in Africa, knowing the
growing use of that sort of

00:58:11.859 --> 00:58:16.680
technology is absolutely crucial.
I mean, imagine if this network of -- as we

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:20.779
said before, taking things
to scale, imagine if we can do that through

00:58:20.779 --> 00:58:24.759
empowering community
leaders to -- you know, even if it's someone

00:58:24.759 --> 00:58:30.180
saying I know that there's
a cutting ceremony that's due to take place

00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:33.440
within two months.
And then being able to gear up around that.

00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:38.119
I think there's so much that can be done and
the empowerment around

00:58:38.119 --> 00:58:42.329
that is huge.
But also what I found through my experience

00:58:42.329 --> 00:58:46.660
is how many people have
contacted me globally so this is not just

00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:52.650
about what the West can do.
I had some many e-mails from people in Cameroon,

00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:55.980
in Guinea, in all
sorts of places saying what can I do in my

00:58:55.980 --> 00:59:01.799
own community?
And one thought is just about, you know, there's

00:59:01.799 --> 00:59:06.529
not one database, for
example, that's --someone contacted me from

00:59:06.529 --> 00:59:11.069
Guinea-Bissau to say can I
download from the web?

00:59:11.069 --> 00:59:14.650
I'm about to teach this class.
What can I download from the web?

00:59:14.650 --> 00:59:19.420
I couldn't find a single place where that
person could just go to be

00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:23.970
able to say to their community these are the
issues that you could deal

00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:26.609
with.
So we need to hit this straight on.

00:59:26.609 --> 00:59:30.319
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Let me just add something
there vis a vie what Julia

00:59:30.319 --> 00:59:33.079
has done.
Frankly, one of the problems is that we in

00:59:33.079 --> 00:59:37.210
the news media tend to drop
the ball on these kinds of issues.

00:59:37.210 --> 00:59:40.299
That's what we do, we tend to cover what happened
yesterday.

00:59:40.299 --> 00:59:45.460
We tend not to cover what happens everyday.
And whether it's public health issues, whether

00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:52.210
it's this kind of daily
human rights abuse, it just falls through

00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:55.589
the cracks.
And since we don't -- since we in the media,

00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:58.650
who tend to be the ones
who help shape the agenda and since we drop

00:59:58.650 --> 01:00:03.240
the ball on these kinds of
issues that leaves it frankly to people like

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:05.670
Julia to bring it up on
the agenda.

01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:09.340
And I really salute you for having done that
at Davos.

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:12.720
And I think that is a model for a whole range
of other issues whether

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:17.750
it's malaria or anything else that, you know,
this is our greatest

01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:20.420
weakness.
We are not covering things that happen everyday.

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:24.779
We blow it on those issues, and you've got
to raise those and poke us

01:00:24.779 --> 01:00:28.180
and kind of hold our feet to the fire so that
we actually do a better

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:31.309
job of covering these incredibly important
issues that are ongoing and

01:00:31.309 --> 01:00:36.680
part of the background and get ignored as
a result.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.430
ANN VENEMAN: If I might just talk a little
bit about -- you talked

01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:44.630
about the use of cell phones for everything
from monitoring nutrition

01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:47.759
to health and UNICEF is doing a lot of this
work.

01:00:47.759 --> 01:00:53.740
But we also support Tostan extensively, and
one of the ideas of Tostan

01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:58.900
has been that these communities that have
become Tostan communities,

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:02.940
eliminating the practice through this community-based
approach suddenly

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:07.700
they begin to see cell phones in these communities,
particularly owned

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:11.390
by women.
And yet most of the women are illiterate.

01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:15.250
So they've now started in some of the Tostan
communities, a

01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:20.490
texting-for-literacy program, where they're
teaching women how to read

01:01:20.490 --> 01:01:25.680
because it's so much cheaper to text than
talk in Africa, unlike the

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:30.849
US.
And so I would challenge the tech community

01:01:30.849 --> 01:01:36.329
to say how do we take the
next leap forward, recognizing that many of

01:01:36.329 --> 01:01:40.490
these communities that
practice these cultures are now into the cell

01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:42.399
community as well.

01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:45.799
&gt;&gt; Yeah, my name is Rich, and I run an international
NGO that works on

01:01:45.799 --> 01:01:51.420
aging in the developing world.
And firstly, I opt my NGO and partners, over

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:54.119
70 countries, to play a
role.

01:01:54.119 --> 01:01:58.789
Older people in many of the countries are
connected to this particular

01:01:58.789 --> 01:02:01.780
practice and maybe we can actually do something
constructive and maybe

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:05.520
a coalition needs to be built.
But I think one of the most striking things

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.970
for me is about voice.
I mean, it is important.

01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:13.059
I can't remember the name of the Somali model
that wrote her

01:02:13.059 --> 01:02:17.750
autobiography about her life.
But I think the more that that happens, the

01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:22.490
more that voice can be
heard at the national level, and that actually

01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:24.630
women who have had to
bear this are able to have the courage to

01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:27.960
speak.
And using Facebook, you know, maybe there

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.900
are ways to enable voice to
be heard I think that that will be transformational.

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:35.920
And I don't know quite how we do that but
so maybe it's a useful

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.920
strategy.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:39.670
&gt;&gt; Hello.
I'm from Switzerland, Isabel.

01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:44.630
And I just wanted to ask what kind of programs
do we have to empower

01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:50.460
mothers who've been cut?
They say they need to do it for the daughters

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:54.799
but how can we empower
them to educate their sons not to marry a

01:02:54.799 --> 01:02:59.299
cut girl because then if the
expectation is not there anymore, maybe the

01:02:59.299 --> 01:03:00.910
girls won't undergo this.

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:05.849
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: Part of the model that
we're all saying Tostan,

01:03:05.849 --> 01:03:11.920
you know, in fact, a number of local civil
society organizations are

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:18.190
also implementing this model.
Part of that is as well as having conversations

01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:21.880
with the women, you of
course, have conversations with the men.

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:27.190
And of course, mothers are talking about their
sons as part of this but

01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:29.270
the whole community is coming together, so
the hope is that everyone

01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:32.540
all at once does come to a shift in awareness
about the practice.

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:38.010
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
I work at the newspaper and I'm also a young

01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:45.730
global leader.
I just wanted to ask you in terms of getting

01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:47.059
spokespeople from
communities that have given up female genital

01:03:47.059 --> 01:03:48.180
mutilation to go to
communities that haven't yet.

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:50.990
I mean, I'm sure you've had some experience
of this.

01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:57.049
But if we can take this to a greater scale,
if there's funding of such

01:03:57.049 --> 01:04:00.490
projects to facilitate their travel, because
I think that's the best

01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:03.220
way to get the message out.
To say that we used to do it and we've given

01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:07.010
up and these are the
benefits is probably the best person with

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:09.500
credibility, cause often with
these issues, it's about credibility.

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:14.089
And I think it's wonderful.
Have you raised that this is not an issue

01:04:14.089 --> 01:04:18.359
for Muslims or that Islam is
the one calling for this, and I think that

01:04:18.359 --> 01:04:21.680
breaks away the taboo
because if you tell Muslims and I am one of

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:24.890
them -- and this is not to
say, that just because you're Muslim we think

01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:26.480
that you are a bad person
doing this.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:29.950
On the contrary, there is an appreciation
this is not simply that the

01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:32.920
Qur'an dictates but sadly there are those
that twist the religion on so

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:35.160
many different levels.
So I salute the way you've approached it.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:39.880
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: I know that when people,
you know, have been making

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:43.039
this point, the fact that Saudi Arabia does
not -- there's no --

01:04:43.039 --> 01:04:46.029
there's no cutting in Saudi Arabia, that is
one of the things that is

01:04:46.029 --> 01:04:49.089
always emphasized and one of the things that
has the greatest surprise

01:04:49.089 --> 01:04:54.511
to people, has the greatest authority.
I don't know of any cases, I don't know if

01:04:54.511 --> 01:04:59.380
anybody else does, of, you
know, people, envoys being sent, clerics from

01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:04.940
Saudi Arabia, for example
to communities in these countries to say,

01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:06.999
you know, you've got it
wrong.

01:05:06.999 --> 01:05:12.039
Um, but I mean, in fact there -- in my experience,
invariably in every

01:05:12.039 --> 01:05:16.319
country there are voices from within that
country who are saying this

01:05:16.319 --> 01:05:19.660
is ridiculous.
This is not -- and so, so, you know -- and

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:26.460
to the extent that those
people speak the language and have local credibility

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:27.460
and authority.

01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:29.099
&gt;&gt; Sorry.
Very, very quickly but I mean, the communities

01:05:29.099 --> 01:05:32.089
that did used to
practice it, that's what I mean.

01:05:32.089 --> 01:05:35.900
Like you mentioned in Senegal or Mauritania
where there's a community

01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:40.200
that it was recently actually practiced and
then given up because I

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.630
think that's the most credible voice.

01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:48.770
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Very good point.
I want to now kind of wind up and for those

01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:52.539
who didn't get a chance to
ask your questions, you know, feel free to

01:05:52.539 --> 01:05:53.980
mob the folks here
afterward.

01:05:53.980 --> 01:06:01.660
But we've been talking about something that
happens to 3 million girls

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:04.440
a year.
Human rights violation, I think we agree on

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:09.510
a vast scale.
Leads to more maternal mortality, leads to

01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:13.650
more girls dying of
infection at a scale, and we don't really

01:06:13.650 --> 01:06:16.490
know.
When a girl dies after she's been cut, people

01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:18.910
just say, oh she just
died of malaria.

01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:22.849
People don't acknowledge how often this happens.
But what do we do?

01:06:22.849 --> 01:06:28.069
Somebody is here wants to get involved; somebody
is watching on

01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:31.599
YouTube.
They can go to the Tostan website which is

01:06:31.599 --> 01:06:36.309
Tostan.org T-O-S-T-A-N.org,
learn more about it in that way.

01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:45.009
They can go to Julia's website.
And I'll -- I'll -- I don't know.

01:06:45.009 --> 01:06:46.009
I'm sure --

01:06:46.009 --> 01:06:51.470
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: Which is EndFGMnow.org
But also another excellent website is ForwardUK.org.uk,

01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:54.529
which is where
I volunteer as well.

01:06:54.529 --> 01:06:58.250
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Let me -- so let's go systematically
through here

01:06:58.250 --> 01:07:00.980
and maybe Kathy you can start.
You know, what does somebody do?

01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:06.210
KATHY CALVIN: Well, I think it's awesome that
this -- that the YouTube

01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:09.080
community chose this issue and already has
stood up for it.

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:12.970
So having a voice is the first thing.
The second is to become an advocate for girls.

01:07:12.970 --> 01:07:17.249
If you haven't seen the girl effect video
which is on YouTube, it's an

01:07:17.249 --> 01:07:20.641
awesome thing and I think it gives you sense
of the positive that if

01:07:20.641 --> 01:07:23.940
you can be become an advocate for girls we
can end should have these

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:27.019
trouble some things.
I think you had a great idea which is instead

01:07:27.019 --> 01:07:31.020
of shame and blame, we
ought to be finding those who've already begun

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:33.859
to fight back and, you
know, we all probably need to do a better

01:07:33.859 --> 01:07:37.980
job of thanking Uganda for
just making the thing against the law right

01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:40.749
now.
So I think we all have voices and we should

01:07:40.749 --> 01:07:43.190
be using them more and
we've got the tools now.

01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:47.470
LARRY COX: Well, first of all, I think it's
clear to everybody that

01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:52.080
this is part of a larger struggle for women's
rights in general and I

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:56.779
think.
And I'm happy to be agreeing with Nick on

01:07:56.779 --> 01:07:59.099
this that this is a
particular moment in history where this battle

01:07:59.099 --> 01:08:03.770
really is ripe, can
really be -- there can be a sea change in

01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:06.609
the world.
I think FGM is part of that issue.

01:08:06.609 --> 01:08:10.170
I don't think it's the only one, but it's
a continuum of how we raise

01:08:10.170 --> 01:08:13.779
the status of women and how we just make intolerable
practices that

01:08:13.779 --> 01:08:17.759
have seemed tolerable.
And there's myriad ways for people to get

01:08:17.759 --> 01:08:21.920
involved and it's not only a
question of the west against the developing

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:26.150
world that it's also a
question of the fight within each country

01:08:26.150 --> 01:08:28.140
where these issues are still
involved.

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:31.460
So I think that's the first thing and the
second thing is that Amnesty

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:36.250
is involved right now in a campaign in Europe
to, to try to change the

01:08:36.250 --> 01:08:39.650
practices and policies of the European Union
to make sure that they are

01:08:39.650 --> 01:08:41.670
supporting the kind of approaches that we've
talked about here.

01:08:41.670 --> 01:08:43.580
It's very easy for people to get involved
in that.

01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:47.710
They can Google their local Amnesty website
for whatever country

01:08:47.710 --> 01:08:51.460
they're in.
And also to make sure that women who are trying

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:56.819
to get refuge in this
country or in countries in Europe because

01:08:56.819 --> 01:09:02.839
they have a legitimate fear
of being forced to be cut, that the laws are

01:09:02.839 --> 01:09:05.119
changed to make that
possible for them to do.

01:09:05.119 --> 01:09:08.400
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: And Julia, in case anybody
doesn't have your website

01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:09.400
down yet --

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:14.920
JULIA LALLA-MAHARAJH: Clearly, the website
but what I really think we

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:21.909
need to do is make FGM much more explicit.
The data, the porosity of the data is shocking.

01:09:21.909 --> 01:09:28.719
There is a lot that's out there.
But how can we ascertain the global scale

01:09:28.719 --> 01:09:32.509
of this issue if we don't
actually know what we're dealing with?

01:09:32.509 --> 01:09:35.869
The 3 million figure we're all quoting is
in Africa alone?

01:09:35.869 --> 01:09:43.679
It doesn't tackle Indonesia, Yemen, UAE.
It doesn't tackle Europe, where we know 500,000

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:45.790
women are living with
FGM.

01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:50.060
So we don't understand the scale.
We don't understand what needs to be done

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:53.710
on a country-by-country basis
to tackle the problem.

01:09:53.710 --> 01:09:57.710
A solution in Indonesia is completely different
to what we need in

01:09:57.710 --> 01:10:01.760
Cameroon, in Sierra Leone, as Ann has said,
in Senegal.

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:06.260
We need to be very, very cognizant of what
is the global action plan?

01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:13.190
Without that, we can't cost a solution.
If this is a matter of resources, then great.

01:10:13.190 --> 01:10:18.850
Let's just get on and fundraise.
But until we are much more aware about the

01:10:18.850 --> 01:10:22.889
global scale of this problem
and what needs to be done about it, we can't

01:10:22.889 --> 01:10:28.500
reach that target of 2015.
I think very kind offer from an NGO already

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:32.639
working in this field --
thank you, I'll be in touch -- but equally,

01:10:32.639 --> 01:10:37.429
all the NGOs working in
this area, please get FGM on your agenda.

01:10:37.429 --> 01:10:42.560
Do something more about it.
And I've run out of steam.

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:46.420
Go to my website.
There are five easy things that you can do.

01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:50.810
They may seem little things.
But lastly, do what you can.

01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:55.590
This is going out to the YouTube community.
They'll be people watching all over the world.

01:10:55.590 --> 01:11:00.060
I chose to enter a competition on Davos; you
may want to find out what

01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:03.600
is happening in your local community.
You may wish to fundraise.

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:08.130
You may wish to push your government on various
things or your MP.

01:11:08.130 --> 01:11:11.070
Know what your action is and what your agency
is.

01:11:11.070 --> 01:11:16.199
And please just do something.
It's international FGM day, sorry.

01:11:16.199 --> 01:11:19.869
International anti-FGM day on the sixth of
February.

01:11:19.869 --> 01:11:23.420
That's a week today.
Contact a journalist.

01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:25.910
Talk about FGM. Thank you.

01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:29.600
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Don't feel you have to contact
this journalist in

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:33.900
particular.
I'm already on board.

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:34.900
Ann?

01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:38.600
ANN VENEMAN: Well, certainly I would agree
with all that's been said.

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:44.210
But I think it's -- first of all, so important
to recognize that this

01:11:44.210 --> 01:11:49.300
is first and foremost a violation of the rights
of the girl child.

01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:53.940
Think about the fact that most of the people,
the children who are

01:11:53.940 --> 01:12:01.150
subjected to this are between about the ages
of 4 and maybe 12.

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:08.460
I mean, this is a human being that really
doesn't have the right to say

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:12.030
no.
It's imposed on her.

01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:15.920
The second thing I would say is that everyone
should look at those

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:20.929
organizations that are working in this arena.
It isn't a popular cause.

01:12:20.929 --> 01:12:26.550
These organizations can't generate lots of
resources for their work.

01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:30.150
And so support those organizations that are
truly making a difference

01:12:30.150 --> 01:12:31.700
in this area.

01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:37.260
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Um, let me just also say,
finally, that, you know,

01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:43.260
this is indeed just part of a broader puzzle.
And that quite aside from the simple moral

01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:47.179
issue, it's imminently
practical issue we're not going to make progress

01:12:47.179 --> 01:12:52.639
against global
poverty, against insecurity unless girls are

01:12:52.639 --> 01:12:56.000
brought into the picture
brought into the formal economy, educated,

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.800
and so on.
This is one facet of that larger picture.

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:03.520
And then we really hope that you whether you're
here, right here, or

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:10.199
watching on YouTube, you will get engaged.
And I think Julia really deserves our thanks

01:13:10.199 --> 01:13:15.760
and appreciation for
bringing this issue to Davos and to YouTube

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:19.139
to the Davos debate.
And please join me in thanking her and all

01:13:19.139 --> 01:13:29.410
of the panelists here today.

01:13:29.410 --> 01:13:31.459
[APPLAUSE]
