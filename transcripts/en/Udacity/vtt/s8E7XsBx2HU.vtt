00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's get some practice using these ratios. Here we have a right triangle.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This angle is 37 degrees and the sides are 3, 4, and 5.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I want to know what's the sine of 37 degrees, and it's the opposite

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
over the hypotenuse so in this case 3/5.

00:00:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
What about the cosine of 37 and the tangent of 37?
