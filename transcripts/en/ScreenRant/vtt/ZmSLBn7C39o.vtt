00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.720
There’s a lot of planning that goes in to
making a movie.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.670
It relies upon cooperation between dozens
of different departments, which can mean hundreds

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.110
of people working together.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.980
And despite having a daily call sheet that
tells everyone where they need to be and when

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.700
they need to be there, productions can still
go off the rails.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.120
So when tension is high, it can be nice to
have a team of funny people around to lighten

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.010
the mood.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.700
And for a comedian, the best time to crack
a joke is when everything’s going wrong.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.500
Thankfully, these ten productions had some
sneaky jokesters on hand who were waiting

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.140
to pounce at the right moment.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.910
Before we start, can you guess the movie from
these emojis?

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.280
Stay tuned for the answer, and for some fun
trivia questions along the way.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.090

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.559
Here are 10 Bloopers Comedy Actors Did On
Purpose!

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.559
Bridesmaids
When Paul Feig’s Bridesmaids was unleashed

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.540
upon the world, many people described it as
“The Hangover, but with chicks”.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.400
And while we can sort of understand where
that comparison comes from, it couldn’t

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.820
be less accurate.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.400
Written by Annie Mumolo and Kristen Wiig,
the movie craps all over the notion that women

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.580
must be ladies.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:23.030
Like, literally craps on it.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.271
So if you watched the scene and thought to
yourself “nobody would write this”, you're

00:01:26.271 --> 00:01:27.271
kind of right.

00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:30.810
The sequence wasn’t in the original draft
of the movie, but what else would you expect

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.189
from an entire team of improv heavy-hitters?

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.820
Shaun of the Dead
Have you ever heard of the Cornetto Trilogy?

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.650
How about the Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy?

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.369
Well, you might not recognize them by that
name, but we guarantee you’re familiar with

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.780
the movies it contains: The World’s End,
Hot Fuzz, and our personal favorite, Shaun

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:00.700
of the Dead.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.271
Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are talented on
their own, but two heads are better than one

00:02:04.271 --> 00:02:06.729
and these performers are made for each other.

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.590
Under the loose direction of Edgar Wright,
Frost and Pegg ad-libbed a lot of their dialogue

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:21.400
and cracked each other (and the crew) up throughout
the shoot.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:31.870
The blood may have been fake, but the laughter
wasn’t.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.730
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest
Johnny Depp likes to really get into the character

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.730
he’s playing.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.980
And if other people think he’s weird because
of it, well, that’s their problem.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:48.470
Captain Jack Sparrow is one of his most popular
roles, and the actor held nothing back.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.500
And while filming Pirates of the Caribbean:
Dead Man’s Chest, he kept everyone on their

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.500
toes.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.890
During a scene where Depp dances around with
a jar of dirt containing the heart of Davey

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.319
Jones, take a look at the other people in
the scene.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:08.680
The shock and confusion on their faces is
genuine, since the actor only told director

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:19.040
Gore Verbinski that he wanted to improvise
the ending, but didn’t say how.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.080
Tommy Boy
Before there were amazing comedy duos like

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.849
Poehler and Fey, Key and Peele, and Stiller
and Wilson, there was Chris Farley and David

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:27.849
Spade.

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:39.410
The two old friends and SNL alumni often shared
the screen thanks to their undeniable chemistry.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.880
And while some of their work was panned by
critics, fans gobbled it up.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.580
Perhaps their best collaboration comes in
the form of Tommy Boy, a 1995 comedy goldmine.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.430
By that point, the two actors had spent so
much time together that they had their own

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.050
little offscreen rituals — including ‘fat
guy in a little coat’.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.741
Apparently, that was a routine Farley would
do whenever Spade was feeling down, and they

00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:09.090
decided to throw it in to their performance.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:17.340
There’s no telling how many jackets they
went through to get the proper take, but it

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.079
was definitely worth it.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.909
Fast and Furious 6
If you were to just quickly glance at Dwayne

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:28.559
‘The Rock’ Johnson, your first instinct
might be to poop your pants.

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:33.669
He’s a hulking behemoth who could probably
throw a car the length of a football field.

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.979
So he’s probably someone you don’t want
to mess with.

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.990
In addition to being physically imposing,
the actor has a masters in trash talk from

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:48.560
WWE university.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.259
So not only could he tear us apart with his
muscles, but he could hurt our feelings while

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:53.259
he does it.

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:56.539
Audiences got a peek at Johnson’s quick
tongue during a scene from the sixth installment

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:04.189
in the Fast and Furious franchise, with a
quip that was so good even Ludacris did a

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:13.050
spit take.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.960
Dumb and Dumber
By this point, audiences are well-versed in

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.560
Jim Carrey’s comedic stylings.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.199
The actor got his start performing at Yuk-Yuks
and The Comedy Store, so he’s comfortable

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.930
in front of an audience AND he can handle
hecklers.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:35.119
But his talents don't stop there, he also
has a lovely singing voice.

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:39.789
To us, it sounds like the most annoying noise
in the world, but other improvisers hear comedic

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:40.830
gold.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.560
Carrey might have been sitting on that gag
for a while, but it was a surprise to everyone

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:51.869
else on screen, and their reactions are genuine.

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:55.389
Even though he’s been working steadily since,
we bet the actor still has some tricks up

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:59.940
his sleeve.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.190
The Wolf of Wall Street
Martin Scorsese is a cinematic genius, but

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.879
even he’s humble enough to get out of the
way and let his actors do their thing.

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:12.330
Especially when those actors are Leonardo
DiCaprio and Matthew McConaughey.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.339
Between takes, DiCaprio saw McConaughey doing
an odd-looking vocal warmup where he hummed

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:18.490
and beat his chest at the same time.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:24.619
The two performers schemed about including
the bit in the scene they were about to shoot.

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:33.779
And Scorsese is obviously great at recognizing
genius when he sees it, because even though

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:42.819
it wasn’t in the script, the gag thumped
its way into the final cut.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:47.199
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory
Willy Wonka is an eccentric dude.

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:51.639
In case you don’t know, the candy baron
stows himself away in his crazy candy factory,

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:55.889
and his daily social interactions are limited
to a gaggle of surly Oompa Loompas singing

00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:03.360
mean songs.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.539
When the golden ticket winners arrive for
their grand tour of the chocolate factory,

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:17.039
the gates open and Mr. Wonka greets them in
a way that only he could.

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:21.610
The somersault was a surprise to everyone
except for the man doing it, comedy legend

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:22.659
Gene Wilder.

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:26.999
He figured that an under-socialized character
would probably give an unconventional greeting.

00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:35.610
And honestly, it’s perfect.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.189
The Other Guys
When you’re working alongside someone as

00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:41.150
hilarious as Will Ferrell, it can be hard
to keep your composure.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.559
The actor is famous for his improvisational
skills, and when he’s riffing off the top

00:07:44.559 --> 00:07:54.650
of his head, his co-stars do their best to
keep up.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.669
So while the constant giggling creates a light
mood on set, it also results in a lot of takes

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:00.139
for the cutting room floor.

00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:04.589
While filming a dinner scene, neither Ferrell,
nor his co-stars Eva Mendes and Mark Wahlberg

00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:25.990
could hold back their laughter.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:29.869
Every take resulted in a different response
from Ferrell, and each one was funnier than

00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:38.820
the last.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.219
Anchorman
When a director trusts their cast with the

00:08:41.219 --> 00:08:44.959
material they’re given, they’re usually
okay with letting them mix it up a bit on

00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:45.959
set.

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:49.190
And when the casting is as brilliant as it
was for 2004’s Anchorman, you’d have to

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:53.129
be a crazy person to assume that the comedians
would follow the script one hundred percent

00:08:53.129 --> 00:09:02.459
of the time.

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:06.750
Thankfully for the audience, director Adam
McKay understands that the best things come

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.050
when you’re not expecting them.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:18.120
A huge percentage of the movie’s final dialogue
was the result of improvisation.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.449
And when your cast consists of Will Ferrell,
Steve Carrell, and Paul Rudd, it’s best

00:09:22.449 --> 00:09:26.500
to just step out of the way and let them do
their thing.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.500
What do you think?

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.959
Did we skip over any of your favorite intentional
bloopers from comedic actors?
