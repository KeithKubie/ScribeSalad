00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.140
This one is really tough, so don't worry if you struggled. The expression we

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.288
want is the quantity b divided by 2 squared. For this first example, our b was

00:00:09.288 --> 00:00:15.700
equal to 6. So if we do 6 divided by 2 and square it, we would get 9. In the

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.214
second case, b was equal to 12. So, 12 divided by 2 squared would be 6 squared,

00:00:20.214 --> 00:00:25.640
which is 36, the amount that we should add. In the third case, we had b was

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.996
negative 4. So negative 4 divided by 2 equals negative 2, and then, we square

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:36.148
it to get positive 4. Notice that in each case, we always added a certain

00:00:36.148 --> 00:00:40.686
amount. This is because even if b is negative, we end up squaring this value,

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:45.746
so that way it turns out positive. To complete the square, we'll always add a

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:50.526
positive amount, no matter if the b term is negative. And this also works for

00:00:50.526 --> 00:00:54.995
our last example. The b was negative 10, so we'll write that here, then we

00:00:54.995 --> 00:01:00.560
divided by 2, which gives us negative 5, and we square it to get negative 25.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.910
This is the powerful expression that we need in order to complete the square.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.173
If you found the expression, and that's pretty amazing. Again, this is a really

00:01:08.173 --> 00:01:12.335
hard pattern to find and generate on your own. Let's see how we can use this to

00:01:12.335 --> 00:01:15.670
solve some quadratic equations by completing the square.
