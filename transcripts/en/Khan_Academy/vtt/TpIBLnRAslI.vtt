00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:01.990
What I want to do
first is just show

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.100
you what the angle
bisector theorem is

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.520
and then we'll actually
prove it for ourselves.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.490
So I just have an
arbitrary triangle right

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.180
over here, triangle ABC.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.750
And what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.249
to draw an angle bisector
for this angle up here.

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.540
And we could have done it
with any of the three angles,

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.270
but I'll just do this one.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.290
I'll make our proof
a little bit easier.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.670
So I'm just going to bisect
this angle, angle ABC.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.900
So let's just say that's the
angle bisector of angle ABC,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.950
and so this angle
right over here

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.040
is equal to this
angle right over here.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.700
And let me call this point down
here-- let me call it point D.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:47.560
The angle bisector
theorem tells us

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.290
that the ratio between
the sides that aren't this

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.680
bisector-- so when I put
this angle bisector here,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.750
it created two smaller triangles
out of that larger one.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.410
The angle bisector
theorem tells us

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.360
the ratios between the other
sides of these two triangles

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.090
that we've now created
are going to be the same.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:12.620
So it tells us that
the ratio of AB to AD

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:19.310
is going to be equal to the
ratio of BC to, you could say,

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.820
CD.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.820
So the ratio of--
I'll color code it.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.310
The ratio of that,
which is this, to this

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.590
is going to be equal to
the ratio of this, which

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.970
is that, to this right
over here-- to CD,

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.020
which is that over here.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.799
So once you see the
ratio of that to that,

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.090
it's going to be the same as
the ratio of that to that.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.214
So that's kind of a cool
result, but you can't just

00:01:48.214 --> 00:01:50.680
accept it on faith because
it's a cool result.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.900
You want to prove
it to ourselves.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.620
And so you can imagine
right over here,

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.140
we have some ratios set up.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.920
So we're going to prove it
using similar triangles.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.120
And unfortunate for us, these
two triangles right here

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.599
aren't necessarily similar.

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:07.015
We know that these two angles
are congruent to each other,

00:02:07.015 --> 00:02:08.490
but we don't know
whether this angle is

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.735
equal to that angle
or that angle.

00:02:09.735 --> 00:02:10.318
We don't know.

00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:12.240
We can't make any
statements like that.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.690
So in order to actually set
up this type of a statement,

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.310
we'll have to construct
maybe another triangle that

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.440
will be similar to one
of these right over here.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.060
And one way to do it would
be to draw another line.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.545
And this proof
wasn't obvious to me

00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:31.170
the first time that
I thought about it,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.350
so don't worry if it's
not obvious to you.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.130
What happens is if we can
continue this bisector--

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.830
this angle bisector
right over here,

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.030
so let's just continue it.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.970
It just keeps going
on and on and on.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.860
And let's also-- maybe we can
construct a similar triangle

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.910
to this triangle
over here if we draw

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.660
a line that's parallel
to AB down here.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.070
So let's try to do that.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.070
So I'm just going to say,
well, if C is not on AB,

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.080
you could always find
a point or a line that

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.920
goes through C that
is parallel to AB.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.500
So by definition, let's
just create another line

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.190
right over here.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.770
And let's call this
point right over here F

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.990
and let's just pick
this line in such a way

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.570
that FC is parallel to AB.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.120
So this is parallel to
that right over there.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.550
And we could just
construct it that way.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.240
And now we have some
interesting things.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.614
And we did it that
way so that we

00:03:29.614 --> 00:03:32.680
can make these two triangles
be similar to each other.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.622
So let's see that.

00:03:33.622 --> 00:03:34.580
Let's see what happens.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.288
So before we even
think about similarity,

00:03:36.288 --> 00:03:40.640
let's think about what we know
about some of the angles here.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.160
We know that we have
alternate interior angles-- so

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.910
just think about these
two parallel lines.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.790
So I could imagine AB
keeps going like that.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.840
FC keeps going like that.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.000
And line BD right
here is a transversal.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.580
Then whatever this
angle is, this angle

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.226
is going to be as well, from
alternate interior angles,

00:04:00.226 --> 00:04:02.350
which we've talked a lot
about when we first talked

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.330
about angles with
transversals and all of that.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.540
So these two angles are
going to be the same.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.160
But this angle and
this angle are also

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.250
going to be the same, because
this angle and that angle

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.791
are the same.

00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:12.880
This is a bisector.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.790
Because this is a
bisector, we know

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.790
that angle ABD is the
same as angle DBC.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.730
So whatever this angle
is, that angle is.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.600
And so is this angle.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.490
And that gives us kind
of an interesting result,

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.180
because here we have
a situation where

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.400
if you look at this
larger triangle BFC,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.990
we have two base angles
that are the same, which

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.290
means this must be an
isosceles triangle.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.925
So BC must be the same as FC.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.670
So that was kind of cool.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.341
We just used the transversal and
the alternate interior angles

00:04:47.341 --> 00:04:48.715
to show that these
are isosceles,

00:04:48.715 --> 00:04:51.690
and that BC and FC
are the same thing.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.460
And that could be
useful, because we

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.890
have a feeling that this
triangle and this triangle

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:59.890
are going to be similar.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.050
We haven't proven it yet.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.520
But how will that help us get
something about BC up here?

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.110
But we just showed that BC
and FC are the same thing.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.730
So this is going to
be the same thing.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.140
If we want to
prove it, if we can

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.420
prove that the ratio of
AB to AD is the same thing

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.240
as the ratio of FC
to CD, we're going

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.240
to be there because BC, we
just showed, is equal to FC.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.030
But let's not start
with the theorem.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.446
Let's actually get
to the theorem.

00:05:25.446 --> 00:05:27.290
So FC is parallel
to AB, [? able ?]

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.910
to set up this one
isosceles triangle,

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.289
so these sides are congruent.

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.080
Now, let's look at some
of the other angles

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.180
here and make ourselves
feel good about it.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.320
Well, we have this.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.450
If we look at triangle ABD, so
this triangle right over here,

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.160
and triangle FDC, we
already established

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.930
that they have one set of
angles that are the same.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.310
And then, and then
they also both-- ABD

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.460
has this angle right
over here, which

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.630
is a vertical angle
with this one over here,

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.880
so they're congruent.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.490
And we know if two triangles
have two angles that

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.170
are the same, actually
the third one's

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.380
going to be the same as well.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.560
Or you could say by the
angle-angle similarity

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.917
postulate, these two
triangles are similar.

00:06:05.917 --> 00:06:07.000
So let me write that down.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.650
You want to make sure you get
the corresponding sides right.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.382
We now know by
angle-angle-- and I'm

00:06:11.382 --> 00:06:12.840
going to start at
the green angle--

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.530
that triangle B-- and
then the blue angle-- BDA

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.130
is similar to triangle--
so then once again,

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.270
let's start with the
green angle, F. Then,

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.652
you go to the blue angle, FDC.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.640
And here, we want to eventually
get to the angle bisector

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:39.090
theorem, so we want to look at
the ratio between AB and AD.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.740
Similar triangles,
either you could

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.820
find the ratio between
corresponding sides

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.890
are going to be
similar triangles,

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.040
or you could find
the ratio between two

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.630
sides of a similar triangle
and compare them to the ratio

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.820
the same two corresponding sides
on the other similar triangle,

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.052
and they should be the same.

00:06:55.052 --> 00:06:57.010
So by similar triangles,
we know that the ratio

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:03.130
of AB-- and this, by the way,
was by angle-angle similarity.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.980
Want to write that down.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.550
So now that we know
they're similar,

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:12.717
we know the ratio of AB to
AD is going to be equal to--

00:07:12.717 --> 00:07:15.050
and we could even look here
for the corresponding sides.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.610
The ratio of AB, the
corresponding side

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:23.553
is going to be CF-- is
going to equal CF over AD.

00:07:23.553 --> 00:07:28.120
AD is the same thing
as CD-- over CD.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.680
And so we know the ratio of AB
to AD is equal to CF over CD.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.790
But we just proved to
ourselves, because this

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.495
is an isosceles triangle, that
CF is the same thing as BC

00:07:38.495 --> 00:07:39.470
right over here.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.760
And we're done.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.030
We've just proven AB over
AD is equal to BC over CD.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:51.460
So there's two things we
had to do here is one,

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.930
construct this other
triangle, that, assuming

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:58.220
this was parallel, that gave
us two things, that gave us

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.010
another angle to show
that they're similar

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.820
and also allowed us
to establish-- sorry,

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.520
I have something
stuck in my throat.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.710
Just coughed off camera.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.630
So I should go get a
drink of water after this.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.090
So constructing
this triangle here,

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.080
we were able to both
show it's similar

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.660
and to construct this
larger isosceles triangle

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:24.380
to show, look, if we can
find the ratio of this side

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.670
to this side is the same
as a ratio of this side

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.710
to this side, that's
analogous to showing

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.510
that the ratio of this side
to this side is the same as BC

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:32.429
to CD.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.709
And we are done.
