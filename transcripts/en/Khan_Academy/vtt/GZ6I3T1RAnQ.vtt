00:00:00.183 --> 00:00:02.099
SALMAN KHAN: I'm here
with Dr. David Agus, who

00:00:02.099 --> 00:00:05.239
is a professor of engineering
and medicine at USC.

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:06.030
DAVID AGUS: Um-huh.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.400
SALMAN KHAN: And we're
looking at pictures here

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.340
of things that seem
very different to me.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.210
What is the
commonality right here?

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.420
DAVID AGUS: The commonality
is inflammation.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.570
So inflammation can be manifest
by a runny nose in a cold

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.190
or getting the flu.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.170
It could be manifest by
an infection in your toes.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.140
It could be hitting your
head playing football

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.130
or hitting your arm when
you fall playing a sport.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.055
All of those can
cause inflammation.

00:00:30.055 --> 00:00:31.430
SALMAN KHAN:
Because inflammation

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.780
has a certain meaning
in everyday language.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.280
At least when I
imagine it, it means

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.210
something that's
swollen and red.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.960
But here, we're talking
about inflammation

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.410
in more of the medical
or the scientific sense.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.960
Things are swollen and red
because of inflammation.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.710
DAVID AGUS: Right.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.510
SALMAN KHAN: And so
what is inflammation?

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.590
It isn't just
swollen and redness.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.060
I mean, the football player
isn't getting swollen and red,

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.560
or is he?

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.060
DAVID AGUS: So inflammation is
when your body senses danger.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.650
So when something
is wrong, whether it

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.510
be an infection, whether it be
trauma in the case of football

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.840
players, whether it be
a cold, your body senses

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.860
danger and sends in
its frontline soldiers,

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.840
which are the immune
cells, in order

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.890
to fight whatever's causing it.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.890
So if it's trauma, the
immune cells go in there

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.730
and they help rebuild the
tissue that's damaged.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.320
If it's a bacteria,
they go in there

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.210
and they try to take
away the bacteria

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.640
so you can get over
that cold or that flu.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.919
And so that whole process
we call inflammation.

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:23.710
SALMAN KHAN: I see.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.240
DAVID AGUS: It's
a danger process.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.390
SALMAN KHAN: So it's
the immune cells

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.931
going to the sign of danger to
either fight the danger itself

00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:29.094
or repair the aftermath--

00:01:29.094 --> 00:01:29.760
DAVID AGUS: Yup.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.630
SALMAN KHAN: --of the danger.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.250
So that sounds
like a good thing.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.666
DAVID AGUS: It's
an awesome thing.

00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:35.950
The problem is, your
body, all of us, we

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.149
care about what happens
today, not down the road.

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.940
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.565
DAVID AGUS: And this
is one of the take

00:01:40.565 --> 00:01:43.970
home points that astonished me
when I start to think about it,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.470
is that nature,
evolution, selects out,

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.710
for who has good kids.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.270
And that's what
evolution is about.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.480
It's about having children.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.230
We call progeny.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.980
SALMAN KHAN: Right

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.190
DAVID AGUS: It's not
about what happens

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.920
when you're 80 years
old or 90 years old.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.350
And so inflammation is
fantastic about dealing

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.260
with today's ramifications.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.460
The problem is if you
get the flu today,

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.820
your risk of cancer and
heart disease a decade

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.512
or two decades from now are up.

00:02:10.512 --> 00:02:11.970
SALMAN KHAN: If I
get the flu once?

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.280
DAVID AGUS: If you
get the flu once.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.820
SALMAN KHAN: Really.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.210
DAVID AGUS: So those
five, six days--

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.520
SALMAN KHAN: You're worrying me.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.061
DAVID AGUS: --when
you feel horrible,

00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:19.020
your inflammation
is through the roof.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.570
That's having ramifications
down the road.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.944
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:02:22.944 --> 00:02:25.110
I mean this is already
getting a little scary for me

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.050
because I've had the flu.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.180
So I already feel a little
worried about my cancer risk.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.015
DAVID AGUS: I can tell
by looking at you.

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:29.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.208
SALMAN KHAN: You can
tell by looking at--

00:02:31.208 --> 00:02:32.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.550
And the symptoms that we get
when we have the flu or a cold,

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.360
these are actually-- it's not
the virus that's-- the virus is

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.095
causing the inflammation,
which is causing the symptoms.

00:02:40.095 --> 00:02:40.420
DAVID AGUS: Yeah.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.378
And that's what's wild.

00:02:41.378 --> 00:02:44.130
Is that when you get a virus,
your immune system attacks it

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.730
and you get a fever.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.720
I still don't know
why we get fevers.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.020
It's one of those things
where the-- we call them

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.940
the cytokines, which are
proteins the immune cells make

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.160
to send out and get
more reinforcements

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.470
and tell the body what to do.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.860
It causes a fever.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.980
Is a fever good?

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.030
Is a fever bad?

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.870
I don't know.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.430
We take Tylenol
to lower a fever,

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.940
but is that a good thing?

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.460
Nobody really has looked at
the long-term ramifications.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.970
They look at short term.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.742
But how does it affect
a decade from now

00:03:11.742 --> 00:03:12.700
what's going to happen?

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.660
We just don't know.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.060
SALMAN KHAN: Wow.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.420
Wow.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.295
And what you're saying
is that the reason why

00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:18.960
we have inflammation
is, yeah, something

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.960
has happened to my body.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.366
I have some trauma, some injury.

00:03:21.366 --> 00:03:22.990
And you were saying
this to me earlier,

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.989
you might have to run
away from a lion tomorrow.

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.252
So fix Sal or fix
David up right now,

00:03:27.252 --> 00:03:29.210
so that he can run away
from the lion tomorrow.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.540
But in the wild, I might
only live to 40 anyway.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.109
So why even worry about whether
that person might get cancer

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.650
if they get to 40
or 50, once they're

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.510
past the age of reproduction.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.820
DAVID AGUS: Eactly.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.530
The body has to
choose priorities.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.580
And the priority clearly is
today rather than tomorrow.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.770
And so an amazing study
was done in that we

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.390
gave patients what
we call a statin.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.790
So statins were
drugs-- S-T-A-T-I-N.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.410
They were drugs that were
developed because they blocked

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.930
the synthesis of cholesterol.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:58.360
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.670
DAVID AGUS: And
we thought people

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.010
with higher cholesterol,
particularly the bad one called

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.000
LDL, those people have a higher
incidence of heart disease.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.810
So if we block the
synthesis, we're

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.060
going to affect heart disease.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.580
And what do you know, we did.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.220
A dramatic effect, we lowered
the death from heart disease

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.230
with these drugs.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.420
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.690
So it seems like they worked.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.050
DAVID AGUS: They worked.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.950
Then a company, or
a very clever group,

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.890
did a trial where
they gave people

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.740
with normal cholesterol
these drugs.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.630
And they had a dramatic effect
in that it delayed heart attack

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.860
and stroke by almost
a dozen years.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.600
SALMAN KHAN: Wow.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.683
DAVID AGUS: And it reduced
the incidence of cancer

00:04:31.683 --> 00:04:32.922
by about 40%.

00:04:32.922 --> 00:04:34.380
SALMAN KHAN: So
cancer, something--

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.530
I mean we don't
associate cholesterol--

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.540
DAVID AGUS: Totally different.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.920
SALMAN KHAN: Wow.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.836
DAVID AGUS: So it turns
out these drugs, which

00:04:38.836 --> 00:04:42.090
were the biggest drug in
terms of sales we've ever had,

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.660
worked by lowering inflammation.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.540
So their effect in heart disease
wasn't by lowering cholesterol.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.235
It was predominantly by
lowering inflammation.

00:04:49.235 --> 00:04:49.550
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.800
Right.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.300
DAVID AGUS: And the
effect on cancer

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.554
was by lowering inflammation.

00:04:52.554 --> 00:04:54.720
In fact, do you remember
when the swine flu came out

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.980
a couple years ago?

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.250
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.749
Right.

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:58.560
DAVID AGUS: So if you
got the swine flu,

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.737
the only thing that
protected you from your lungs

00:05:00.737 --> 00:05:02.820
collapsing and going on
what we call a ventilator,

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.450
a breathing machine, was
being on one of these statins.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.370
SALMAN KHAN: Because it
would stop the inflammation.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.630
Because the swine flu
people were dying from

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.921
is the inflammation going nuts.

00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:09.725
DAVID AGUS: Yeah.

00:05:09.725 --> 00:05:11.100
SALMAN KHAN: This
is fascinating.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.345
So the people who are
dying of heart disease,

00:05:14.345 --> 00:05:15.720
is it necessarily
the cholesterol

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.553
that's killing them?

00:05:16.553 --> 00:05:19.030
Or is the inflammation
that's causing cholesterol?

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.604
DAVID AGUS: Well, I think
it's this chicken and the egg

00:05:20.604 --> 00:05:21.104
phenomenon.

00:05:21.104 --> 00:05:21.630
That's it.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.870
The inflammation allows
cholesterol to deposit--

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:24.360
SALMAN KHAN: I see.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.080
DAVID AGUS: --and they together.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.360
SALMAN KHAN: I see.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.860
I see.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:32.550
So it's really the statin
affects inflammation, which

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.420
then reduces cancer by
stopping the inflammation

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.240
and stopping the--

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.585
DAVID AGUS: Exactly.

00:05:36.585 --> 00:05:36.700
SALMAN KHAN: --cholesterol.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.880
DAVID AGUS: One of those
problems we have a biology,

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.970
in medicine, it's
what you can measure.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.619
And so I can
measure cholesterol.

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:44.410
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.868
DAVID AGUS: I don't
really know how

00:05:45.868 --> 00:05:47.640
to measure inflammation well.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.340
So while we can make these
association in big studies

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.990
when we look back, if I had a
metric, if I had a blood test

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.320
or something to look
at for inflammation,

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.839
I can optimize things.

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:00.380
SALMAN KHAN: Can you not measure
just the amount of cytokines

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.260
and other inflammatory
type of things

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.219
that become increased in
your-- does it happen?

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:06.260
DAVID AGUS: You're right.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.220
But are different
types of inflammation.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.830
So some inflammation can
be good, some can be bad.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.630
Some can be really causal.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.490
Some could be a
little bit causal.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.390
And so we're putting
them all into one basket

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.040
now, which is inflammation.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.710
The key is to
start to tease them

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.360
out and be able
to modulate them.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.334
You can develop a drug.

00:06:23.334 --> 00:06:25.750
But then you have to optimize
it for a particular purpose.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.130
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.360
Right.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.734
DAVID AGUS: So these were
optimized to lower cholesterol.

00:06:28.734 --> 00:06:30.090
And they do that very well.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.130
They also lower inflammation
and they work beautifully

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.190
in that regard.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.682
But how do we optimize
that going forward?

00:06:36.682 --> 00:06:38.140
What it also means
is that when you

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.806
look at your lifestyle
and my lifestyle,

00:06:39.806 --> 00:06:41.730
we have to limit inflammation.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.810
So what are the easy
ways to do that?

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.120
One is, which I think
should be mandatory things,

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.274
like the flu shot.

00:06:47.274 --> 00:06:48.065
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:06:48.065 --> 00:06:50.060
DAVID AGUS: So
again, the flu shot

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.700
will certainly delay you
from having or prevent

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.690
from having bad flu.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.700
SALMAN KHAN: That's good today
and good today and tomorrow.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.046
DAVID AGUS: And tomorrow--

00:06:57.046 --> 00:06:57.392
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:57.392 --> 00:06:59.725
DAVID AGUS: --because it
limits heart disease and cancer

00:06:59.725 --> 00:07:00.660
down the road.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.870
That

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.000
SALMAN KHAN: I had no clue
that the flu-- I thought

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.410
it was just a nice thing,
avoid a week of sneezing,

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.350
and you know.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.460
But the flu shot, you can
actually reduce your cancer--

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.760
DAVID AGUS: And heart
disease down the road.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.110
And we have to think
long term as a society.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.443
SALMAN KHAN: What about statins?

00:07:16.443 --> 00:07:20.250
I mean it seems like-- these are
drugs like Lipitor and Crestor.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.030
I mean would you-- I mean no one
should take our medical advice

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.370
based on a thing in video.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:26.120
DAVID AGUS: Right.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.770
SALMAN KHAN: I mean are
people taking it just

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.250
for heart disease or are people
taking it more broadly now?

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.041
DAVID AGUS: Listen.

00:07:32.041 --> 00:07:34.390
I mean I'm a believer
that these drugs have

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.610
such a profound
effect on cancer,

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.530
heart disease, stroke,
potentially Alzheimer's,

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.610
that you should consider taking
it to prevent these diseases.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.930
And again, we're giving
no recommendations.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.997
But what I say is
you, your parents,

00:07:46.997 --> 00:07:48.830
they should talk about
it with their doctor.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.010
And so why shouldn't
I be on this drug?

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:51.225
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:07:51.225 --> 00:07:52.558
And there are some side effects.

00:07:52.558 --> 00:07:54.467
But they're easy to test for.

00:07:54.467 --> 00:07:56.550
DAVID AGUS: Test for, and
then they're reversible.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:57.060
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:57.135
OK.

00:07:57.135 --> 00:07:57.830
So you're not going too--

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.360
DAVID AGUS: So
with anything, you

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.810
got to do a risk and a benefit.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:00.320
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.095
DAVID AGUS: And you
have to look at you

00:08:01.095 --> 00:08:02.990
and say am I high
risk for X, Y, and Z?

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.820
If you are, what can
prevent or delay it?

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.000
The name of the game is
not treating disease,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.340
it's preventing disease.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:09.720
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.240
Right.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.899
Now, this is fascinating.

00:08:11.899 --> 00:08:13.690
Well, I might talk to
my wife about getting

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:14.990
some-- well, no advice here.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.234
Everyone should talk
to their doctor.

00:08:17.234 --> 00:08:19.390
DAVID AGUS: By the way,
another great medicine

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.390
to reduce inflammation
is called aspirin.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.276
SALMAN KHAN: Aspirin,
I've heard of that.

00:08:23.276 --> 00:08:23.630
DAVID AGUS: Yeah.

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:24.160
It's a hell of a drug.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.970
Again, there are side
effects to aspirin.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.370
It can affect bleeding.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.870
But at the same time,
it's a dramatic effect

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.119
by lowering inflammation.

00:08:31.119 --> 00:08:31.910
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.289
And that is its
main side effect.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:35.820
I mean it's this age-old drug.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:36.700
It's a blood thinner.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.526
So if you get a cut or you bleed
while you're taking aspirin,

00:08:41.526 --> 00:08:42.400
you might bleed more.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:42.820
DAVID AGUS: Right.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.919
Blood thinner is a funny term.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:44.830
I'm not quite sure
what it means.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.645
I keep taking paint
thinner when you see it.

00:08:46.645 --> 00:08:47.030
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.410
That's kind of how I imagine it.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.000
DAVID AGUS: It binds
to the platelets

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.640
and blocks them from activating.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.330
It stops them from
working really well.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:54.450
SALMAN KHAN: So it's
more anticlotting.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:54.940
DAVID AGUS: Right.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.620
And platelets are one of the
key components of clotting.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.140
And they certainly affect it.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:58.440
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.231
So your blood will have
the same viscosity.

00:09:00.231 --> 00:09:01.440
It just won't clot as easily.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.272
DAVID AGUS: Exactly.

00:09:02.272 --> 00:09:04.610
And you could certainly
paint a wall with either one.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.110
SALMAN KHAN: That's
a little morbid.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:06.610
All right.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:08.790
Well, thanks a bunch.
