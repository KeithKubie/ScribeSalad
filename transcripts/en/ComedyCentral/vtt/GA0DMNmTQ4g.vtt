00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:10.710
Today, we're going to talk
about Claudette Colvin.

00:00:11.777 --> 00:00:15.948
Guess what?
In Montgomery, Alabama in 1955,

00:00:15.948 --> 00:00:21.554
a young black woman became the
first person who was arrested

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:24.690
for not giving up her seat
to a white lady on the bus.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.160
That young woman's name
is Claudette Colvin.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.763
Claudette Colvin is a
15-year-old

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:32.932
bespectacled teenager.

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:36.268
Uh-oh, let me say it.
Bespectacled teenager.

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:38.638
It's a hard word.
Bespectacled.

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:40.840
She takes the bus home
from school,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.341
so her friends are like,

00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:44.444
"Hurray, we're having
a fun trip to home.

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:46.613
Uh-oh, white lady."

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:48.848
A white lady gets on the bus.
The white lady is like,

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:52.552
"Hey, you guys have to move
because I'm white."

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:56.022
Claudette's friends leave
but Claudette stays and is like,

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:57.857
"You know what?
I paid my fare the same

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.892
as this white lady
paid her fare,"

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:03.663
so Claudette's like, "... you.
I'm ... sitting. Have a seat."

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:05.865
White lady's like,
"I will not have a seat."

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:08.267
The bus driver's like,
"I'm going to get the cops."

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:09.836
The cops are like, "Move."

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:11.570
Claudette's like,
"I shall not be moved,"

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.274
and they dragged her
off the bus.

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:17.043
The only thing she knows
to do is to go,

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:18.978
"It's my constitutional right."

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:22.682
They're like, "It's 1955,
and we don't have to do ...

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:26.686
so ..."
Claudette's like, "... 1955.

00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:31.657
I'm sorry I burped,
but I'm not sorry."

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:32.959
Wait, what?

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:34.393
I was just saying like ...

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:36.963
The N.A.A.C.P. is flooded
with letters

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:38.898
saying Claudette Colvin
is so brave.

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:41.801
She's wonderful, and the person
who reads these letters,

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:46.072
the Secretary of the N.A.A.C.P.,
Rosa Parks, Rosa Parks

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:48.874
goes to Claudette Colvin's house
and is like,

00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:51.811
"Claudette, you're the ..."
Claudette's like, " I ... know.

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.079
I'm the one who got my ass
dragged to jail."

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.716
That's when they really
connected and become friends,

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:59.819
so whenever she's at
an N.A.A.C.P. meeting,

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:02.989
she spends the night
at Rosa Parks' house.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:06.025
Rosa Parks is like,
"You know what, you're great."

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.927
Claudette Colvin was like,
"You're great."

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:09.696
They really connect.

00:02:11.096 --> 00:02:14.367
Time passes and E.D. Nixon,

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.936
the president of their local
chapter of their N.A.A.C.P.

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:20.839
is like,
"We need to start a bus boycott,

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:23.609
and this bus boycott
will start a revolution.

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.212
We should use
Claudette Colvin's arrest

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:29.015
as a reason
to boycott the buses.

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:31.216
People will get behind her,"
but then they were like,

00:02:31.216 --> 00:02:35.054
"Oh, but not white people
because she has darker skin,

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:38.224
and we can't have a 15-year-old

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:42.227
as the face of the
anti-segregation movement."

00:02:42.227 --> 00:02:45.831
"But we can have Rosa Parks
as the face of this movement,"

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:51.170
so, it's at that time
that Rosa Parks sits down

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.409
in the white section of the bus
and gets taken off to jail,

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.679
but she had to act like,
"Oh, I was just tired.

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.781
Aren't I not threatening
white people?"

00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:05.218
Then, white people were like,
"Oh, she's just tired.

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:07.187
We're eating this up."

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:17.797
Our story starts in Arkansas.

00:03:18.297 --> 00:03:21.734
Little Rock, to be specific.
It's 1957.

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:24.403
The Supreme Court has just ruled
in the case of Brown

00:03:24.403 --> 00:03:27.673
versus the Board of Education
that separate is not equal,

00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:31.144
so their local NAACP went out
to the black community

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:35.014
and found nine kids to go
to Central High School,

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:38.117
the premier high school
in Little Rock, Arkansas.

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:41.320
These kids are like,
"We are the Little Rock Nine.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.058
We are fucking nine visions
of black excellence.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:48.627
We will go to school,
and we'll change the world.

00:03:48.627 --> 00:03:50.062
It'll be great."

00:03:50.062 --> 00:03:54.967
Then, the governor of Arkansas,
Orval Faubus,

00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:57.737
finds out that these kids
are planning to integrate,

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:01.173
and this bitch,
Orval Fartbus ...

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:04.276
You can fart all you want
on the Fartbus.

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:08.948
Anyway, Orval Fartbus was like,
"Hey, if these kids integrate,

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:12.352
the streets will run red
with blood."

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.855
Orval Fartbus is a bitch,

00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:23.329
so, then, the kids
show up to school

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:27.299
on September 4th, 1957,
the first day of school.

00:04:27.299 --> 00:04:30.202
The senior in the group
of the Little Rock Nine

00:04:30.202 --> 00:04:33.805
is Ernest Green, and he is like,
"Oh, my gosh.

00:04:33.805 --> 00:04:36.809
There is an ass load
of angry white people."

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:38.944
This angry white mob was like,

00:04:38.944 --> 00:04:41.547
"We don't like you.
You need to go away.

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:46.753
We are going to beat you up
and hang you from a tree."

00:04:49.354 --> 00:04:51.490
This is not funny.

00:04:52.024 --> 00:04:53.960
Meanwhile, on the other side
of school,

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.229
Elizabeth Eckford, the ninth
of the Little Rock Nine is like,

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.365
"Oh, fuck.
I'm here all by myself.

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:02.068
Oh, my God, there's a huge mob
of white people.

00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:04.637
This is terrifying."

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:06.839
They're yelling,
and they have signs,

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.641
and they're shouting shit.

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.642
They are like,
"Hey, you're white.

00:05:10.642 --> 00:05:13.546
I mean, I'm white
and you're black,

00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:15.982
so that means I don't like you."

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.619
She gathers herself,
and this girl is G'd up,

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.091
fucking face is stone cold
and walking through these people

00:05:26.091 --> 00:05:28.828
who want to pick her up
and break her in two,

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:30.329
just walking through like a G,

00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:34.800
and she sees the Arkansas
National Guard.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.403
"They must be here to help me,"
she thinks.

00:05:37.403 --> 00:05:38.904
She quickens her pace,
and she goes,

00:05:38.904 --> 00:05:40.773
"Hey, these white people
are trying to kill me.

00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:43.142
Please save me."
They blocked her entrance.

00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:46.545
They are letting other white
students in, and she's like,

00:05:46.545 --> 00:05:49.315
"What is the deal? You are
the National fucking Guard.

00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:52.084
If anybody needs to be guarded,
it's me here now."

00:05:53.018 --> 00:05:58.157
She leaves school.
She sits down at the bus stop,

00:05:58.157 --> 00:06:00.026
and the white people
are surrounding her,

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.428
and they're like,
"Uh, we don't like you.

00:06:02.428 --> 00:06:04.096
You are poopy."

00:06:04.096 --> 00:06:07.867
She waits several minutes
for the bus. The bus pulls up,

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:11.136
and she's like, "Thank God,
I can finally get out of here.

00:06:11.136 --> 00:06:16.008
This isn't the last I will see
of you but also fucking fuck.

00:06:16.008 --> 00:06:18.544
Can I just get
a fucking education?"

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.456
Dr. King is using the 16th
Street Baptist Church

00:06:30.456 --> 00:06:33.860
to try to organize protests.
Martin Luther King came in like,

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.528
"For real though, it's time
for us to do something,"

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:38.798
and the adults were like,

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:41.267
"Listen, it's not that
we don't agree with you

00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:42.601
but at the end of the day,

00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:44.370
I still have to put food
on table

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.038
and pay the rent in this hoe,

00:06:46.038 --> 00:06:47.940
and I don't want them
burning crosses on my lawn

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.909
or any shit like that so ..."

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:53.011
like, "Bitch, it's not
fucking safe. We can't do this."

00:06:53.011 --> 00:06:55.781
Dr. King was like, "If we can't
enact change in Birmingham,

00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:57.482
we can't do it anywhere.

00:06:57.482 --> 00:07:00.887
Who can join in the protest
and get arrested with us?"

00:07:02.454 --> 00:07:05.591
He was wort of shocked to see
Gwendolyn Sanders

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:08.527
and her sisters get up and say,
"You know what, we'll do it.

00:07:08.527 --> 00:07:10.396
We will do something
about this,"

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:13.599
and then more and more kids
stood up to volunteer.

00:07:14.233 --> 00:07:17.570
They decided to mobilize,
so that's exactly what they did.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.104
They went back to school like,

00:07:19.104 --> 00:07:23.142
"Listen, we know
you all is sick of the racism

00:07:23.142 --> 00:07:25.778
and there's something
we can actually do about it."

00:07:26.212 --> 00:07:30.082
On May 2nd,
the protest went down.

00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:31.784
Administrators started
locking the doors

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:33.485
to keep them from getting out,

00:07:33.485 --> 00:07:35.254
and kids would just straight up
jump out the window like,

00:07:35.254 --> 00:07:37.155
"Bitch, you're not
going to keep us here."

00:07:37.155 --> 00:07:40.960
Over 1,000 kids left school
to go to Kelly Ingram Park

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.797
to protest,
but then Bull Connor,

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:46.932
head of the Birmingham
Police Department was like,

00:07:46.932 --> 00:07:49.235
"Okay, well, all those
black asses can go to jail."

00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:52.037
They started carting these kids
off by the dozens,

00:07:52.037 --> 00:07:55.574
and over 1,000 kids
were arrested on that first day,

00:07:55.574 --> 00:07:56.775
which is insane.

00:07:56.775 --> 00:07:58.744
After a few days of protests,

00:07:58.744 --> 00:08:00.713
the Birmingham Jail were
totally overcrowded,

00:08:00.713 --> 00:08:02.914
and so as more kids
are arrested,

00:08:02.914 --> 00:08:05.484
others come back out
to take up their place,

00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:09.388
but on May 5th, that was
when shit got really real.

00:08:09.955 --> 00:08:12.824
Bull Connor was looking
at hundreds of black kids

00:08:12.824 --> 00:08:14.460
standing up to his bullshit.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.528
He's like,
"Let's bring out the hoses."

00:08:16.528 --> 00:08:20.066
These are high-pressure, knock
you the fuck out water hoses,

00:08:20.499 --> 00:08:23.002
but the kids realized
there's strength in numbers,

00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:26.605
and togetherness matters,
so those kids linked hands

00:08:27.038 --> 00:08:29.241
and said, "Not today, bitch.
Not today."

00:08:30.242 --> 00:08:34.513
Bull Connor decides,
"Oh, okay. Release the K9 units

00:08:34.513 --> 00:08:40.853
so that the dogs can ...
these kids up. Excuse me."

00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:44.323
At this point, there were
news crews

00:08:44.323 --> 00:08:47.026
there that caught
the entire situation on camera,

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:50.462
and these are now
some of the most infamous shots

00:08:50.462 --> 00:08:52.031
of the Civil Rights Movement.

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:56.135
After people saw children
on international TV

00:08:56.135 --> 00:08:59.204
being sprayed with hoses
and attacked by dogs,

00:08:59.204 --> 00:09:05.344 align:start position:0%
a mind shift occurred, and after
eight solid days of protests,

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:09.114
President Kennedy felt motivated
to come out and say,

00:09:09.114 --> 00:09:11.483
"You know what,
I didn't want to say it before

00:09:11.483 --> 00:09:13.919
because of the southern white
voters but them mother ...

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:16.388
are racists,
so it's time to just be real.

00:09:16.955 --> 00:09:18.490
The shit that you are
going out here

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:24.030
and doing to people in my name
is not the ... okay."

00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:29.569
Man, I love drinking.
How come I don't do this more?

00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:38.844
Anyway, who was I talking about?
The kids.

00:09:38.844 --> 00:09:40.245
Yeah, yeah.

00:09:40.245 --> 00:09:42.214
After the success
of the Birmingham

00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:45.151
Children's March, Dr. King
decided to ride that momentum,

00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:47.052
and he gave his
I have a Dream speech.

00:09:47.653 --> 00:09:51.090
Bull Connor was fired,
and the Civil Rights Act

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.025
was passed within a year
of all that,

00:09:54.025 --> 00:09:57.095
so it was monumental
that Gwendolyn Sanders

00:09:57.095 --> 00:10:00.066
and these kids were willing
to say, "This is not a ...

00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:03.268
game, and you won't treat us
and our people this way

00:10:03.268 --> 00:10:05.503
because we're here
and this is what's going on,

00:10:05.503 --> 00:10:07.640
and it's time for us
to stand up too."

00:10:08.708 --> 00:10:10.609
I don't have to worry
about that sort of thing

00:10:10.609 --> 00:10:13.746
the way those kids even did
or their parents even did.

00:10:13.746 --> 00:10:15.047
I don't take that for granted.

00:10:15.047 --> 00:10:16.415
Cheers to the kids.

00:10:16.415 --> 00:10:17.883
Cheers to the kids.
