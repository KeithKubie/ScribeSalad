Mawson: Hi, I'm Sven Mawson

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.067
and I'll be speaking
at Google I/O this year.

00:00:08.067 --> 00:00:11.067
I'll be discussing the evolution
of the Google data protocol

00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:12.834
and some new features
we're introducing

00:00:12.834 --> 00:00:15.334
to make it easier to build
efficient applications.

00:00:15.334 --> 00:00:18.267
The Google data APIs
are a great way to get data

00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:19.701
into and out of Google
applications,

00:00:19.701 --> 00:00:22.267
but they aren't very efficient
at the protocol level.

00:00:22.267 --> 00:00:24.534
This makes them less useful
than we'd like them to be

00:00:24.534 --> 00:00:27.701
for latency-sensitive tasks,
such as driving an AJAX UI.

00:00:27.701 --> 00:00:30.300
So we're introducing
some new ways to reduce

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.934
both the bandwidth
and the latency

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:33.367
when communicating
with Google services

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:34.801
through the data protocol.

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.200
And we're making
the programming model

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.567
easier while we're at it.

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:39.601
One of the new features
we're introducing

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:42.334
is a new JSON format
that is smaller, faster,

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:44.601
and simpler to use
than the existing format.

00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:47.968
This new format uses
many fewer JavaScript objects

00:00:47.968 --> 00:00:49.701
and much less room on the wire

00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:51.834
to significantly reduce
the amount of bandwidth

00:00:51.834 --> 00:00:53.501
and latency used
by the protocol.

00:00:53.501 --> 00:00:55.434
As we see in this example,

00:00:55.434 --> 00:00:58.767
in a feed of 500 photos
from the Picasa web albums API,

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:04.267
the existing JSON format
takes 770 kilobytes of space.

00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:06.067
Using the new JSON format,

00:01:06.067 --> 00:01:10.300
these feed only takes
385 kilobytes of space.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.634
And using the new JSON format
plus partial gets,

00:01:14.634 --> 00:01:15.901
another feature we'll be
introducing

00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:17.434
at Google I/O this year,

00:01:17.434 --> 00:01:19.234
it only takes 70 kilobytes
of space.

00:01:19.234 --> 00:01:22.100
That's just 1/10 the size
of the original feed.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.501
So I hope to see you
at Google I/O in San Francisco

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:26.033
and I look forward
to seeing you there.
