00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.768
The Alabama special election

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:04.404
between Roy Moore
and Doug Jones was last night.

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:07.206
It's a small, unimportant,

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:09.208
local election...

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:12.612
that we haven't really been
talking about that much.

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:16.315
The fake news, MSM and...
all media

00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:19.285
are claiming a victory
for the Democrat, Doug Jones.

00:00:19.318 --> 00:00:21.754
Just-just because
it's "technically" over.

00:00:21.787 --> 00:00:24.590
But the truth is
this race is still...

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:26.859
it still<i> feels</i>
 too close to call.

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:28.928 line:0%
When the vote is this close,

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:30.430 line:0%
then it's not over.

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.165 line:0%
I had a feeling
he wasn't gonna concede,

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.600 line:0%
because it just...
the numbers aren't adding up.

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:37.270 line:0%
That's what we've got to do,
is wait on God

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:39.839 line:0%
and let this process play out.

00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:42.241
Yes! You go, Roy!

00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:44.277
God takes his time.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.579
It took him two days
to build the earth.

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:50.416
He spent the other five days
building America.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.820
Drawing congressional districts
is surprisingly difficult.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:56.155
But it's fine.
This is not a loss.

00:00:56.188 --> 00:00:59.125
I mean, even in the extreme
long shot of Doug Jones

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:02.995
somehow winning, he has to face
another election in two years.

00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:05.698
He's already a lame duck,
which is the exact thing

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:09.569
that Roy Moore hunts with his
extremely alpha micro-gun.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:12.772
So... just to sum up,

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:15.875
the results of this election
are totally non-conclusive.

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:17.877
They barely even matter, anyway.
(short chuckle)

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.346
And I am in no way concerned
about what this means

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:23.316
for the future of the populist
Trump revolution.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:25.284
Well, nothing much left
to talk about.

00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:26.786
The fight continues after this.

Guys...

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:49.142
what the (bleep)
happened last night?

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.210
Look behind you--
do you see a liberal?

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:53.379
Good, we lost 'em.
This-- right here, this--

00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:55.014
is just between us.

00:01:55.047 --> 00:01:58.551
-Shh.
-KLEPPER (grunts): Oh.

00:01:58.584 --> 00:02:01.454
Guys, we lost, and I hate it.

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:03.189
In Alabama,

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:05.124
Alabama went to a Democrat.

00:02:05.157 --> 00:02:07.960
Are you (bleep) kidding me?

00:02:07.993 --> 00:02:10.830
The reddest state.
They're so red

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:13.867
they only recently
started using the pronoun "she."

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:18.804
It doesn't make sense.
I can't...

00:02:18.837 --> 00:02:21.941
I can't wrap my head around it.
How did this guy--

00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:23.609
the guy that I,
Steve Bannon,

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:26.579
and the president
got behind-- lose?

00:02:26.612 --> 00:02:28.848
Did we back the wrong guy?

00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:32.518
Do we take a moment and really
analyze the type of person

00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:34.487
we're hitching our wagon to?

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:38.291
No.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.559
I don't have time for that.

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:40.826
It can't be our fault.

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.496
The blame has to lie elsewhere.

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.831
Someone cost Roy Moore
this election.

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:47.667
But whom?
Or, even worse,

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.902
who?

00:02:49.935 --> 00:02:51.804
God gave me ten blame-casters,

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:55.641
and it's time
to finger some bad guys.

00:02:55.674 --> 00:02:58.044

Steve Bannon, the president's

00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:02.515 line:0%

00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:25.204
What? The president does not

00:03:25.237 --> 00:03:28.074
It's Egg McMuffin.

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:30.476
And it's technically
on his neck.

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:32.845
Steve Bannon engineered
Roy Moore's candidacy.

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:34.614
But blaming Bannon is too easy.

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:37.450
He's the only person
we<i> know</i> is innocent.

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:38.985
It's never the obvious suspect.

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:41.520
Haven't you seen
a Shyamalan movie?

00:03:41.553 --> 00:03:44.457
Bannon's been dead
this whole time.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.125
I mean, just look at him.

00:03:46.158 --> 00:03:47.460
Yeah.

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:49.829
Plus, Breitbart's
front page reports

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:52.999
<i> "Bannon Least Culpable!"</i>

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:55.468
You can trust that,
because that Web site

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:58.738
is run by Steve Bannon himself.

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:01.107
So... so, who sabotaged
Roy Moore?

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.075
Next suspect, the swamp.

Oh.

Country over party is not only
a dangerous 1700s sex position--

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:32.104
it's also a rallying cry
for wimpy moderates like Flake.

00:04:32.137 --> 00:04:36.242
Next suspect to blame for
Roy Moore's loss, Horse Twitter.

00:04:36.275 --> 00:04:39.245
Now, now,

00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:41.781
Roy Moore rode a horse
to his polling place,

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:42.782
which is standard.

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:45.451
And the mean world
of the Internet,

00:04:45.484 --> 00:04:47.453
specifically the horse Internet,

00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:49.722
decided to go all in on him,

00:04:49.755 --> 00:04:52.058
saying that his form sucks

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:55.528
and any horse person can see
he's a fake cowboy.

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:57.997
You know what,
maybe I'm overthinking it.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.267
Maybe this is just a referendum
on Trump.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.602
Wrong. I never overthink.

00:05:03.635 --> 00:05:06.205
I am an underthinker.
Am I right, Fox?

00:05:06.238 --> 00:05:08.074
This was not a referendum
on Trump.

00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:10.276
I feel like it was a referendum
on Harvey Wein-stein...

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:13.112
-Weinstein.
-Ah. Oh, okay. Oh.

00:05:13.145 --> 00:05:16.449
Okay, so that's
the alleged predator

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:18.184
everyone's been talking about.

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:20.653
Weinstein must have forced
his way

00:05:20.686 --> 00:05:23.122
into the Alabama election
without its consent

00:05:23.155 --> 00:05:25.725
and activated a cabal
of silence-breaking women

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:28.060
who mistakenly voted
against Roy Moore.

00:05:28.093 --> 00:05:31.397
But how could women keep
Roy Moore out of the Senate?

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.900
I mean, it's not a mall.

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:37.670
You know what,

00:05:37.703 --> 00:05:39.605
I think I found
the prime suspect,

00:05:39.638 --> 00:05:42.274
a secret group
that wields great power

00:05:42.307 --> 00:05:43.776
and hides in plain sight,

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:46.979
who works specifically on behalf
of mainstream Democrats

00:05:47.012 --> 00:05:49.648
to steal elections
and daytime talk shows.

00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:53.519
REPORTER:
<i> Black women, Jones won 98-2.</i>

00:05:53.552 --> 00:05:58.057
It was black women that, uh, put
Doug Jones over the hump.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.893
This victory was delivered to us
by black women.

00:06:00.926 --> 00:06:02.294
That's it.

00:06:02.327 --> 00:06:05.030
I know who sabotaged
Roy Moore's Senate campaign.

00:06:05.063 --> 00:06:06.899
Black women.

00:06:06.932 --> 00:06:09.902
In fact,
98% of black Alabama women

00:06:09.935 --> 00:06:12.772
voted against Roy Moore
last night.

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:14.974
-(cheering and applause)
-We're all shocked.

00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:16.142
We're shocked.

00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:18.544
They colluded to take him down.

00:06:18.577 --> 00:06:21.347
This is voter suppression.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.283
They voted
to suppress Roy Moore.

00:06:24.316 --> 00:06:26.952
This was a stinging rebuke
by black voters

00:06:26.985 --> 00:06:29.455
to someone who really would've
turned the clock back

00:06:29.488 --> 00:06:30.923
a hundred years in Alabama.

00:06:30.956 --> 00:06:32.525
That's not fair. No, no.

00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:34.927
Roy Moore didn't want to turn
the clock back a hundred years--

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.196
that is slander.
He specifically said

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:40.065
that the last time America
was great was during slavery,

00:06:40.098 --> 00:06:43.402
which was at least
200 years ago.

00:06:43.435 --> 00:06:46.605
Who looks stupid now?

00:06:46.638 --> 00:06:49.775
Opposers, I've stumbled
onto something big here.

00:06:49.808 --> 00:06:53.446
Black women came together
for Obama, against Trump.

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:55.514
And this Me Too movement
that targets

00:06:55.547 --> 00:06:57.650
innocent tiny cowboys
like Roy Moore,

00:06:57.683 --> 00:07:01.454
Google it--
scratch that, Bing it--

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:04.123
a black woman started that, too.

00:07:04.156 --> 00:07:05.958
Yeah, 20 years ago.

00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:07.760
Her name is Tarana Burke.

00:07:07.793 --> 00:07:09.929
And, here, I've been angrily
tweeting at Alyssa Milano

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:11.797
and Rose McGowan.
I mean, I take it back.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.266
<i> Charmed</i> was a fine TV series
with adequate special effects.

00:07:14.299 --> 00:07:15.668
Let's move on.

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:18.938
So, when it comes to what
happened in Alabama last night,

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:20.406
this much is clear:

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:24.410
powerful, organized black women
are coming for us,

00:07:24.443 --> 00:07:26.212
and we need to be prepared.

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:27.546
We need hard-core recon

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:29.548
to investigate
this emerging threat.

00:07:29.581 --> 00:07:31.050
But it will be challenging.

00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:34.053
There is surprisingly
little mainstream literature,

00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:36.722
TV or films about them,
like, at all.

00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:38.858
And, also, they don't live
in my neighborhood,

00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:40.192
because
my congressional district

00:07:40.225 --> 00:07:42.461
is shaped
like a spaghetti noodle.

00:07:42.494 --> 00:07:43.662
But here's the plan.

00:07:43.695 --> 00:07:46.866
If conservatives want
to retain power,

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:49.268
we need to find out
how black women managed

00:07:49.301 --> 00:07:50.603
this political coup,

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:52.271
find out what they want

00:07:52.304 --> 00:07:53.806
and what they don't want.

00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:56.075
Maybe I'll embed on one
of those girls trips

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:58.077
I've heard so much about.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.745
I'm going to wiretap
the movement.

00:07:59.778 --> 00:08:01.881
I'm going to use all
of my surveillance.

00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:04.884
Because if we want to make
America great again,

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:06.285
we need to listen
to black women.
