into cosmogony in general but it

cosmogony is do you need to know how the

cosmogony is do you need to know how the
 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.240

example is less interested in cosmogony

the origin of the universe than he is in

the origin of the universe than he is in

the origin of the universe than he is in
the origin of the gods and these are two

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760
the origin of the gods and these are two
 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.270
the origin of the gods and these are two
separate topics although presumably they

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280
separate topics although presumably they
 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.900
separate topics although presumably they
come in some sort of succession

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910
come in some sort of succession
 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.750
come in some sort of succession
you know the gods do not precede the

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760
you know the gods do not precede the
 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.979
you know the gods do not precede the
universe in most cosmic journeys

although you could argue that in the

although you could argue that in the
 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.380
although you could argue that in the
biblical cosmology no one God does

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390
biblical cosmology no one God does
 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.479
biblical cosmology no one God does
precede the universe because the

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489
precede the universe because the
 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.100
precede the universe because the
universe is created by that God

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110
 
 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.500

in and I'm not going to try and

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300
in and I'm not going to try and
 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.210
in and I'm not going to try and
anticipate for you what's in these

anticipate for you what's in these
 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.680
anticipate for you what's in these
readings because I'd like you to think

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690
readings because I'd like you to think
 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.570
readings because I'd like you to think
about them and discuss them in

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580
about them and discuss them in
 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.910
about them and discuss them in
discussion sections I would point out

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920
discussion sections I would point out
 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.770
discussion sections I would point out
that if you if you try and trace this

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780
that if you if you try and trace this
 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:33.010
that if you if you try and trace this
into into China you get a an interesting

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020
into into China you get a an interesting
 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:47.930
into into China you get a an interesting
figure named Pangu and in Chinese

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940
figure named Pangu and in Chinese
 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.160
figure named Pangu and in Chinese
cosmogony there was originally a chaos

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170
cosmogony there was originally a chaos
 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.440
cosmogony there was originally a chaos
and the chaos coalesced into an egg and

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450
and the chaos coalesced into an egg and
 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.470
and the chaos coalesced into an egg and
when the egg hatched out came Pangu and

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480
when the egg hatched out came Pangu and
 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.570
when the egg hatched out came Pangu and
the chaos was perfectly balanced between

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580
the chaos was perfectly balanced between
 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.920
the chaos was perfectly balanced between
yin and yang and so you get a immediate

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930
yin and yang and so you get a immediate
 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.960
yin and yang and so you get a immediate
conjunction of the notion of a cosmogony

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970
conjunction of the notion of a cosmogony
 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.880
conjunction of the notion of a cosmogony
but also the notion of a dualistic

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890
but also the notion of a dualistic
 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.610
but also the notion of a dualistic
balance of entities and then after

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620
balance of entities and then after
 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.890
balance of entities and then after
eighteen thousand years Han GU dies and

different parts of his body you know

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010
different parts of his body you know
 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.280
different parts of his body you know
initially he is sort of like atlas he

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290
initially he is sort of like atlas he
 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.110
initially he is sort of like atlas he
separates the heaven from the earth you

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120
separates the heaven from the earth you
 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.710
separates the heaven from the earth you
know he pushes up and put with his arms

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720
know he pushes up and put with his arms
 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.110
know he pushes up and put with his arms
and down with his feet and gradually he

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120
and down with his feet and gradually he
 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.820

heavens and the earth become farther and
farther apart but the the creation of

actual things comes from from his body
and as you'll see any other readings

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530
and as you'll see any other readings
 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.909
and as you'll see any other readings
this notion of a primal being whose body

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919
this notion of a primal being whose body
 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:19.180
this notion of a primal being whose body
gives rise to different material things

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190
gives rise to different material things
 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.879
gives rise to different material things
including living beings I believe it's

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889
including living beings I believe it's

on pongos body a give rise to animals

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960
on pongos body a give rise to animals
 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.360
on pongos body a give rise to animals
something like that low priority uh if

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370
something like that low priority uh if
 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.450
something like that low priority uh if
you if you look at cross cultures you

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460
you if you look at cross cultures you
 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.580
you if you look at cross cultures you
find that this notion of the the

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590
find that this notion of the the
 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.170
find that this notion of the the
division of this primal being is fairly

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180
division of this primal being is fairly
 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.050
division of this primal being is fairly
widespread but in a sense the

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060
widespread but in a sense the
 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.119
widespread but in a sense the
interesting part about the Chinese

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:53.129
interesting part about the Chinese
 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:55.820
interesting part about the Chinese
example is that it appears rather late

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830
example is that it appears rather late
 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:04.999
example is that it appears rather late
and various scholars have have guessed

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:05.009
and various scholars have have guessed
 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.450
and various scholars have have guessed
that maybe it's simply borrowed and then

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460
that maybe it's simply borrowed and then
 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.420
that maybe it's simply borrowed and then
it's not really a Chinese cosmology me

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430
it's not really a Chinese cosmology me
 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.969
it's not really a Chinese cosmology me
so much as a story that some Chinese

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979
so much as a story that some Chinese
 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:21.170
so much as a story that some Chinese
writers got from somewhere else and when

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180
writers got from somewhere else and when
 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.360
writers got from somewhere else and when
they speculate on that they say well

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370
they speculate on that they say well
 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.920
they speculate on that they say well
where would this story have come from

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930
where would this story have come from
 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.010
where would this story have come from
and then zap they're back in the Middle

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020
and then zap they're back in the Middle
 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.079
and then zap they're back in the Middle
East they're back to Egypt to

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:30.089
East they're back to Egypt to
 

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:33.019
East they're back to Egypt to
Mesopotamia and ancient Greece and so

everything else didn't appear to have
much cohesion so sometimes they get

much cohesion so sometimes they get
 

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:57.030
much cohesion so sometimes they get
