00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.393
Excellent work if you got these correct. When I expand each of these, I would

00:00:04.393 --> 00:00:09.118
have three 2s, three 2s, and three 2s, That would make nine 2s multiplied all

00:00:09.118 --> 00:00:13.963
together, so 2 to the 9th. For the second problem, I have 8 to the 4th raised

00:00:13.963 --> 00:00:18.843
the 3rd power, I multiply 8 to the 4th, 3 times then I can expand each 8 to the

00:00:18.843 --> 00:00:23.803
4th, so I have four 8s times four 8s times four 8s, So that's a total of twelve

00:00:23.803 --> 00:00:29.041
8s multiplied together, 8 to the 12th. We use the same reasoning on this third

00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:33.715
one, we have 5 to the 3rd three times, which means we would have nine 5s

00:00:33.715 --> 00:00:38.646
multiplied all together, 5 to the 9th. For the final problem, we have x squared

00:00:38.646 --> 00:00:43.388
to the 4th, our powers still apply to the variable. Remember, variables are just

00:00:43.388 --> 00:00:47.819
numbers, so it would work the same in this case, as it does in these three.

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:52.289
First I multiply x squared by itself four times, then I have x multiplied by

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.233
itself eight times, x to the 8th.
