COURTNEY: Hi everybody.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.670
Thanks for coming.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.250
Sorry that we're
starting a little late.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.840
I would like to take
this opportunity

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.600
to introduce my neighbors,
Ian and Donna Mitroff.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.140
They are the authors of "Fables
and the Art of Leadership:

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.010
Applying the Wisdom of Mr.
Rogers to the Workplace."

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.891
Thank you.

00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:23.199
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.490
DONNA MITROFF: Good afternoon
and thank you for coming.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.010
I'm Donna Mitroff.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.760
We're going to spend
some time telling you

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.530
about how we came to know
Fred Rogers, how we came

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.270
to work with him, how
this book came to be.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.050
But before we do, we have
a special surprise for you.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.800
So if you'll just
wait one moment.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.330
DAVID NEWELL: Speedy delivery.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.710
Hello everybody,
speedy delivery.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.700
My name is Mr. McFeely from
"Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood."

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.559
Hello.

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.725
Do you all remember McFeely?

00:00:50.725 --> 00:00:51.912
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:51.912 --> 00:00:53.890
Well, that's me.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.680
I have a special
deliveries today.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.050
In this suitcase, there are
some sayings on these papers.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.690
And I thought I'd bring them by
and pass them all out to you.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.690
So we'll start here.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.160
You can take those.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.830
And by the way, I started on
"Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood"

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.550
in 1967, before most of you
were born I think, right?

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.235
And it's been on
public television--

00:01:18.235 --> 00:01:20.240
do you have enough in this row?

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.770
Here you go.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.400
Here's two more.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.690
And it showed on KQED,
and it's online now.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.530
So I'm sure you know
how to get online.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.240
And it's all over the
United States and in Canada.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.700
And we have a new
show now called

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.980
"Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood,"
which is all animated.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.050
And it's carrying on
Fred Rogers' legacy

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.110
along with the
Mitroffs, who are also

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.017
carrying on Mr. Rogers'
legacy in a different way.

00:01:49.017 --> 00:01:50.350
But here I have more deliveries.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.140
Can you a pass those out?

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.080
I have more.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.230
And also, a little later,
I brought with me--

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.590
and the Mitroffs did a
special little addition.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.660
They put Google down here.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.080
And I can sign these.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.680
So we'll do that a
little later, too.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.360
And help yourself to
any of these cards.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.259
Let me get more deliveries here.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.690
I'll be right with
you, all right?

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.220
Oh, if anybody has any questions
about the Neighborhood just

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.600
ask me while we're doing this.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.920
Do you all remember seeing it?

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.420
Have you all seen it?

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.920
Yes?

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.610
AUDIENCE: Did Mr. Rogers do
all the voices for the puppets?

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.195
DAVID NEWELL: He did all
the voices for the puppets.

00:02:23.195 --> 00:02:24.810
DONNA MITROFF: Oh, we're
going to tell you all of that.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.185
DAVID NEWELL: Yes, you'll find
out more about that later.

00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:30.220
But yes he did, except
a lot of other people

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.610
helped him maneuver them.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.690
So, he only had two hands.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.580
Thank you all for coming and put
the extras right back in here.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.871
DONNA MITROFF: Are you going
to tell them to open them?

00:02:38.871 --> 00:02:41.070
DAVID NEWELL: And I
also have, don't forget,

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.959
after we're all done
here, and we have--

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.250
DONNA MITROFF: Actually we're
going to do it right now,

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.840
David.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.800
DAVID NEWELL: What?

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.450
DONNA MITROFF: Open
up your messages.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.390
DAVID NEWELL: Oh, yes!

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.630
Open up your messages
because Donna has,

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.200
besides doing Google, if
anybody has on their message

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.430
a little red dot.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.840
DONNA MITROFF: Red star.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.152
Raise your hand.

00:03:04.152 --> 00:03:06.670
DAVID NEWELL: Oh,
right off the bat.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.730
DONNA MITROFF: Come
on up because you

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.336
are the lucky winners of
a free copy of this book.

00:03:13.336 --> 00:03:19.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.350
We will be happy to
autograph these for you

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.960
after the session is over--
the presentation is over.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.720
And any of you who decide
to buy the book, let us now.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.124
We'll manage to get
the autograph to you.

00:03:32.124 --> 00:03:33.540
We're pleased that
you came today.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.400
DAVID NEWELL: And
then afterwards, I

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.030
can sign one of these,
or two of these,

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.820
or however many what
I have enough time.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.940
So I can sign when
we're done here.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.520
But I think you're ready
to do your presentation.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.300
I will sit here and take
it all in, all righty?

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.720
Speedy delivery.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.540
Oh yes, before we start, do
you think if I count to three,

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.210
you all can say speedy
delivery and that'll

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.450
be your cue to start.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.457
So here we go one, two, three.

00:03:58.457 --> 00:03:59.540
AUDIENCE: Speedy delivery.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.469
DAVID NEWELL: OK Donna.

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:02.760
DONNA MITROFF: Thank you David.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.259
Thank you.

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:05.380
David came all the
way from Pittsburgh

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.440
to share this with us today.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.970
Pittsburgh--

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.611
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:11.110
DAVID NEWELL: Where
it's minus nine.

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.610
DONNA MITROFF:
Pittsburgh is the home

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.120
of "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood."

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.740
It's also the home of WQED,
the Pittsburgh PBS station.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.810
And that's where this
whole saga began for us.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.960
Back in the 1970s--
actually it was in the late

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.070
'60s-- my husband and I moved
to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.650
where he took a job teaching at
the University of Pittsburgh.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.760
And I did other things,
went to graduate school,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.120
and did a Ph.D. in education.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.510
And then eventually
went to work for WQED.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.390
My first day on the job, I get
on the elevator and the person

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.290
riding up from the ground
floor to the third floor

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.640
with me is Mr. Rogers.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.800
And I was, as they
say, verklempt.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.670
So we started to talk and by
the end of riding three floors,

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.790
he invited me to come
over to his office.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.330
And he said, maybe
there's something

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.220
that we can do together.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.640
So I'm going to get into
telling you about that,

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.255
but that's my background
and how I met Fred.

00:05:18.255 --> 00:05:19.880
I'm going to ask my
husband to tell you

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.232
a little bit about
his background.

00:05:22.232 --> 00:05:24.670
IAN MITROFF: I have to
remember to talk through this.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.270
I was born and raised
in San Francisco.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.170
I did all my degrees
at UC Berkeley

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.760
when it was really,
really cheap.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.270
So I went there from
freshman to Ph.D.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.820
I got my Ph.D. In
engineering from Berkeley.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.610
But while I was
getting my Ph.D.,

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.320
I took a three and
a half year minor,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.280
which was unheard of, in
the philosophy of science,

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.400
never been done.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.900
And the man who
taught me philosophy

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.090
was in the business school
at Berkeley, a great man.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.920
And so he was a philosopher.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.280
So it was only natural
when I got through,

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.690
because I loved
engineering, but I

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.470
didn't want to do
engineering anymore.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.170
I went into a
business school where

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.120
I've taught
organization behavior.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.910
All the people stuff that
they don't talk about

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.400
in engineering school.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.040
So we were ripe
to do such a book.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.920
Anyway, Donna go on.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.610
DONNA MITROFF: So that's a us
back in the '70s, lots of hair,

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.560
fewer wrinkles, fewer pounds.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.320
And take the next slide.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.230
I moved over to
WQED the late '70s.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.680
And that's me standing out
in front of X the Owl's tree.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.460
How many of you watched
Mr. Rogers at any time?

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.656
Wow!

00:06:36.656 --> 00:06:39.870
That's pretty amazing.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:45.020
So anyway this show is one
of the longest running shows

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.410
on public television
ever, 35 continuous years.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.160
And it is still available.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.820
As David said, you can
still see it online.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.420
Lots of parents find it and
watch it with their kids

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.910
today because it's still
speaks to you today.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.200
So after my meeting with
Fred Rogers in the elevator,

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.850
I went by his office.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.190
And we started talking
about what we could do.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.310
I was an educator,
there as director

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.010
of educational services.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.620
And he said, I wish
we could do more

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.870
to help people-- parents,
caregivers, preschool teachers,

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.940
whoever's using it-- help
them understand that there are

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.610
some lessons, not just watch
the show, but something to do.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:32.310
So we set about developing what
we call the plan and play book.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.480
I was watching the shows
then writing lesson plans

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.490
for what to do after
you watch the show.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:44.530
And that book became sort of the
basis for Public Television's

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.240
Ready to Learn Project,
and started a relationship

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.300
with Fred and his
company, including

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:58.790
David, that has gone on since
the late '60s, '70s, and exists

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:04.540
even today where I'm still
involved with the Fred Rogers

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.560
company, and with the
Fred Rogers memorial

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.790
scholarship, which is
our effort to continue

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.140
with his legacy in
children's media.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:20.060
Who was Fred Rogers?

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.830
How many of you think you
know how Fred Rogers was?

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:25.390
What a unique person he was.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.910
Do you know that
he was a puppeteer?

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.270
He did most of the puppets.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:34.630
Do you know that
he wrote the music?

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.710
He played the music.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:41.080
Do know that he wrote
most of the scripts?

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:46.820
Do you know that he had advanced
degrees in child development?

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.480
So it didn't just come
from his imagination.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.960
It came from his heart, and
his soul, and his training.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.810
So there's so much
embedded in the stories

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:02.060
that he told, way beyond.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.455
He was not a typical performer.

00:09:04.455 --> 00:09:05.830
He wasn't an actor.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.850
In fact, David
will share with you

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.420
some of the stories
about how reluctant he

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:14.850
was to do things other than
keep building a great show.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:19.500
So the show went
on the air in '67?

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:24.490
DAVID NEWELL: It went on
air February 18, 1968.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.270
We started taping in '67.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.810
DONNA MITROFF: So on the
air five times a week,

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:35.900
every week, for an
entire 35 years.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:41.530
So there's a lot of Mr.
Rogers embedded in your minds.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:42.650
And its back there.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.660
And what we're
going to do is help

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:49.036
you bring those lessons
back forward to today.

00:09:49.036 --> 00:09:50.660
IAN MITROFF: Let me
just add one thing.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.060
Probably most people don't
know that Fred was an ordained

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.860
Presbyterian minister.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.890
And he looked at the state
of children's television

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.350
as it was at the time--
mostly like throwing pies

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.490
in people's faces-- and
his ministry literally

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:09.010
became to make
television for children

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.640
what it should and must become.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.350
And that really was
this lifelong goal.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.690
DONNA MITROFF: Now,
his major show was "Mr.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:24.130
Rogers' Neighborhood." and
"Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood"

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.760
was made up of these
two different segments.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.320
You remember how he would
come in, put on his sweater,

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.890
change his shoes.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.830
He did that because
kids like routine.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:36.250
It gets to be very
comfortable for you.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:41.310
But then he would go into
his own home, on the set,

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.700
and there would be
many experiences where

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.310
he would bring people
in and they would talk.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:48.940
He would take you
out to visit places

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.012
that people love, like the
visit to the Crayon Factory.

00:10:52.012 --> 00:10:52.970
Kids play with crayons.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.670
They want to know how
do crayons get made?

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.610
So he would take
people to real places

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:03.070
and do documentary
footage in a real setting.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.970
And one of the
highlights of his show

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.040
was always the Neighborhood
of Make Believe.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.780
He'd send that little
trolley around the track.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.680
And this was done
very deliberately.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.830
So you're leaving
the real world,

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.710
and you're going
into a neighborhood

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.230
of make believe where
anything can happen.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.230
And the Neighborhood
of Make Believe

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:27.450
was populated by puppets
that everyone came to know.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:31.020
Here's just a few of them King
Friday, Queen Sarah Saturday,

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.620
Lady Elaine Fairchilde, Lady
Aberlin, and Daniel Tiger.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:39.700
Daniel tiger, the one who is
now the star of the new show.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.360
Many others in the
Neighborhood of Make Believe,

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.600
and some live
performers, never Fred.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.930
You never saw him in the
Neighborhood of Make Believe

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:49.330
because he was real.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.400
But you saw some of the other
people as live performers.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.350
David was there.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:58.160
You would see David in the
Neighborhood of Make Believe.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.280
And in that Neighborhood
of Make Believe

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:09.400
is where we found this richness
of information and ideas

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.840
that we want to share with you.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:18.690
So what began to happen
as-- after Fred died,

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.640
I was involved with the
Academy of Television Arts

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.166
and Sciences, the ones
who do the Emmy's.

00:12:24.166 --> 00:12:28.640
And we decided there
that we give a tribute

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.730
to Mr. Rogers for the industry
in Southern California.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.430
So we set about-- I was
one of the producers

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.270
of that show--
putting this together.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.540
And in doing so, I was
re-reading Fred's materials,

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.350
looking at the shows, and I
kept coming home and telling

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.350
my husband, who was a professor
of management organizational

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:53.430
behavior, much of what goes into
making organizations work until

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.000
he said--

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.780
IAN MITROFF: When Donn a
was sharing the lessons,

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.580
the lessons were more
profound than you

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.920
get in most management books.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.960
I mean, they're not devoid
of lessons, but they're dry.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.430
They're didactic.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.460
And the idea that
took shape for Donna

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.880
and I is that we began
to go back and read

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.310
some of the major
fables the were

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.060
on the Neighborhood
of Make Believe.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.030
And the idea that
crystallized is

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:21.740
that the fables were in effect
little mini business cases.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.630
That King Friday, for
example, is the autocratic CEO

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.400
and you can begin to identify
the other characters.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.800
And the idea said, Look
let's try and teach

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.710
organizational behavior
through fables and stories.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:34.970
Why fables and stories?

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:38.040
Because that's the primary
way that human beings

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.560
have communicated
with one another

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.750
since the dawn of civilization,
not with formulas,

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.600
not with textbooks,
but with good stories.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.000
We were lucky to get to Palgrave
McMillan-- the next slide.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.220
DONNA MITROFF: But wait I
want to have the next slide.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.678
IAN MITROFF: We
were lucky to get--

00:13:51.678 --> 00:13:53.640
DONNA MITROFF: A
contributer to this idea

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.870
that there are lessons
here for grownups

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.260
was at this tribute
to Fred Rogers.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.690
One of the people who
spoke was Anne Sweeney.

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:05.430
Some of you might have heard--
Anne was here recently doing

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:11.340
a talk to women's leadership
in Silicon Valley.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.210
And you see she's got a
very high level position.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:17.380
And when Anne came
on to the stage

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.610
and talked about what she
learned from Fred Rogers

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.990
that she still uses as
a high level executive,

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.080
it helped to crystallize
our feeling that there

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.220
are other people out there who
learned things from Fred that

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:35.540
stayed with them, not just
as my husband always says,

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:40.080
he helped you as a child, he
can help you as a grown up.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:45.670
So we went on and
we found a publisher

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:50.620
and we pulled together
these three principles.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.262
Fred's lessons
were more profound

00:14:52.262 --> 00:14:54.470
than traditional methods of
management and leadership

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:55.290
training.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.640
He taught through
stories and fables.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.660
Those who watched
as children are now

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.120
in middle and upper
management positions.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.872
And here you are.

00:15:03.872 --> 00:15:05.330
You watched him
when you were a kid

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.818
and now you're advancing
through your careers.

00:15:08.818 --> 00:15:12.280
IAN MITROFF: Can we go
through to the next slide?

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.970
Let me tell you what
crystallized is we went back

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:18.750
and read the fables.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.382
Seven principles
emerged early on.

00:15:21.382 --> 00:15:22.840
And those are the
seven principles.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.160
Go to the next slide.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.410
And each of them is illustrated
through a direct quote

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.309
from Fred and an accompanying
fable in the book.

00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:32.600
And we're going to read just
through the fables because

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.780
of time later.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:34.970
So the first one, connect.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.510
You can read it.
"A person can grow

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:39.090
to his or her
fullest capacity only

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:42.000
in mutually caring
relationships with others."

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.490
Next please.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:45.070
Concern.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.940
One of the misperceptions
of Fred Rogers

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:53.820
is that he was thoroughly
no rules, anything goes.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.660
That's not true at all.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:59.130
I think one of the best sayings
that we culled out from Fred

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:02.990
is, "Setting rules," good
rules, not harsh rules,

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:05.480
"is one of the primary
ways in which we

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.470
show our love for others."

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:11.220
Now, in a good organization
you do it with your employees,

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.000
not didactically, not
necessarily autocratically.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.200
Next one please.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.290
"Play is the expression
of creativity,

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:23.160
and I," Fred believes, "is at
the very root of our ability

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.340
to learn to cope and
become whatever we may be."

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.470
Next please.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:29.540
Communication.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.210
"In times of stress,"
especially in stress,

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.010
"the best thing we
can do for each other

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:35.660
is listen with our
ears and our hearts

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.368
to be assured that
our questions are just

00:16:37.368 --> 00:16:38.880
as important as our answers."

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.470
I don't need to tell you that
it's obviously broken down

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:42.730
on our political life.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.760
One thing I ought to
say, we have no illusions

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.100
about what
organizations are today.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.140
We're talking about an
ideal, which if we practice,

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.500
it would hopefully improve
our organizations as they are.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.580
Next one please.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:57.730
Consciousness.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:00.860
"Take good care of that part of
you where your best dreams come

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:04.957
from, that invisible part
of you," Fred was spiritual,

00:17:04.957 --> 00:17:07.290
"that allows you to look upon
yourself and your neighbor

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.650
with delight."

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:10.220
Next one.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:14.630
Maybe go back to
the previous one.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:17.244
There is some growing
recognition, believe it or not,

00:17:17.244 --> 00:17:19.680
in business schools and
schools of management,

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.900
that spirituality at work
plays a core role in our lives.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.970
I was fortunate to write
one of the earliest

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.440
books on spirituality at
work, and I went around

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.170
and interviewed people
and what spirituality

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:33.810
meant to them during their day.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:35.280
For example, how
much of themselves

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.321
they could bring to work?

00:17:36.321 --> 00:17:38.620
Next one, please.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:39.660
Courage.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.620
"One of the greatest paradoxes,"
about life, "about omnipotence

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.350
is that we need feel
it early in life,

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.880
and lose it early
in life, in order

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:52.250
to achieve a healthy, realistic,
yet exciting sense of potency

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:52.960
later on."

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.560
Next one, please.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.880
Community.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.160
"All of us, at some
time or other,"

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.250
I might say even
constantly, "need help.

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.006
Whether we're giving or
receiving help, each one of us

00:18:03.006 --> 00:18:05.172
has something valuable
to bring to the world.

00:18:05.172 --> 00:18:06.880
That's one of the
things that connects us

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.350
as neighbors-- in
our own way, each one

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:10.600
is a giver and a receiver."

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.370
I mean if we could
summarize the book,

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:14.780
how could we turn
our organizations

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.180
at best into caring
neighborhoods.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.040
Next one, please.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.980
OK, here the seven
fables that we picked out

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.020
to illustrate each
of these principles.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:29.260
And the fables just ring.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.590
In fact, they're really
in your consciences.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:34.100
Now, we're just going
to talk about two

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.370
of them because of time.

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:39.690
So Donna you ah-- We're going
to start with "Planet Purple"

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:41.990
and we'll talk about "The
Bass Violin Festival."

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.615
DONNA MITROFF: So
I'm going to give you

00:18:43.615 --> 00:18:46.350
a brief reading
of the story just

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:49.280
to take you back
to remember what

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.950
happened in the story
of "Planet Purple."

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:57.620
And then you just think about
this as a mini case study,

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.880
but Ian's going to
break it down or you

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.230
tell how it teaches
lessons for management

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:04.730
and for organizations.

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:06.650
The story of "Planet Purple."

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.570
"On a space mission,
Lady Elaine Fairchilde

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.390
discovered a new planet.

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:14.350
A place where
everything was purple.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:16.620
Everyone had the
same purple home.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.160
The sky was purple.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.720
The cars, chairs, and
streets were purple.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.710
And there were the
same purple trees.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:25.800
In addition, all of
the boys and girls

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.210
were named Paul and Pauline.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:32.410
And every single panda
was call Purple Panda.

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:36.710
Everyone on Planet Purple ate
purple pumpernickel pudding,

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.980
and talked in the
same monotonous voice.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.270
And for years and
years, everybody

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:45.800
dreamed the same dreams
and had the same hopes.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.580
"When Lady Elaine Fairchilde's
bright green space

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.390
ship landed on Planet
Purple and she stepped out

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:55.080
in her white astronaut suit,
the Planet Purple people

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.815
ran and hid in fear.

00:19:56.815 --> 00:20:00.930
But one Paul, and one
Pauline, and one purple panda

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:02.390
didn't run and hide.

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:05.550
They stayed around to look
at this curious creature.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.000
Lady Elaine, whose favorite
color happened to be purple,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.580
was very intrigued
by this planet.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.550
She liked seeing
everything in purple

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:14.110
and she liked not
having to remember

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:15.960
a lot of different names.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.250
"After exploring the
planet, she decided

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.170
to fly back to tell
everyone back home

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:23.160
about this new planet.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.370
Lady Elaine didn't know that
Paul, Pauline, and Purple Panda

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:31.350
were watching her and
decided to follow her.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.840
"The Planet Purple
way to travel is just

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.310
by thinking and thinking alone.

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:38.780
All you have to do is
think that you're someplace

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.740
and instantly you'll be there.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.260
So Paul, Pauline,
and Purple Panda

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:46.510
thought about Lady Elaine, where
she was and immediately they

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:49.420
arrived in the Neighborhood
of Make Believe.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.290
"They could hardly believe
what they saw and heard.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:55.270
Everything and
everybody was different.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.000
Purple Panda was so
excited that he sat down

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.120
in the first rocking
chair he saw.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.710
He rocked, and he
rocked, and rocked,

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.880
and then he remembered one
of Planet Purple's laws.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.660
Anyone who rocks
on a rocking chair

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.210
may not live in Planet Purple.

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:11.590
But now it was too late.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.190
He could never go back.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:15.940
Paul and Pauline wanted
to explore this new place

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:16.880
before going back.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.410
So they went everywhere.

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:18.910
They looked.

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:19.430
They listened.

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:20.000
They smelled.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:20.620
They touched.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.170
They felt the colors,
They smelled the smells.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.690
And they felt the
different feelings.

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:28.820
"One day Paul fell
down and hurt himself.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.530
And he felt something wet
trickling down his cheek.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:37.300
A rabbit asked him
why he was crying?

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.830
Paul had to ask
what crying meant.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:42.340
No one ever cried
on Planet Purple.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:46.410
When the rabbit heard that Paul
had never cried before he said,

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.590
you've just started to live.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:50.560
"Finally, Paul and
Pauline decided

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.310
to return to Planet Purple.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:54.210
So they use the
Planet Purple way

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:57.620
to travel, thought about being
there and they were back home.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.640
They told the other Pauls
and Paulines about the place

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.020
where Lady Elaine lived.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.220
How everything is so
different and nobody

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.670
is exactly the same
as anyone else.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:09.470
They even told about
Purple Panda rocking

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.590
in the rocking
chair, and everyone

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:15.220
knew he'd broken the law
and could never come back.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.320
"The other Pauls and
Paulines didn't like the idea

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.240
that everything and everybody
should be different.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:25.580
Paul and Pauline helped them
imagine colors, sound, smells,

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:26.480
feelings.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.380
It took a long time to
change their planet.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.840
And some people didn't
like some things,

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.270
and other people didn't
like other things,

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:35.910
but everybody ended
up saying it was

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:39.020
still better than being
the same all the time.

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:42.050
They even changed the
law about rocking chairs

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:45.470
so Purple Panda could come
back any time he wanted.

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:48.070
"The citizens of Planet
Purple held a celebration

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.200
to announce that the
name of Planet Purple

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:54.060
would be changed to Planet
Purple Fairchilde in honor

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.510
of the one who helped
them become different.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:59.990
Both Lady Elaine and Purple
Panda came to the celebration.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:03.020
The End."

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:08.890
Now just think about it for
a minute as a business case.

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:10.650
I think you'll be surprised.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:11.880
Go ahead Ian.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.410
IAN MITROFF: Here are some
of the principal lessons

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:19.150
of Planet Purple translated into
the implications for business.

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:21.640
In many ways the fable
is about waking up

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.350
from an overly rigid,
hierarchical organization

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.910
to a more equitable
organization.

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.180
Let me give you some things that
aren't up there on the slide.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.850
Miss Fairchilde,
who could well be

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:38.530
an executive VP, her
challenging assignment

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:43.080
is explore different models for
the design of her organization.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.860
She comes across
Planet Purple, Inc.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:50.140
that has a beautiful simplicity,
but by just coming and asking

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:54.530
questions, she's disturbed
the status quo profoundly.

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:57.430
When she comes across the
organization, as I said,

00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:00.870
it's an old fashioned, overly
repressed organization.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:05.550
The employees are virtually in
a state of suspended, repressed

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:07.760
psychological and
emotional development.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.390
There's a lack of integration
between thinking and feelings.

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:14.760
That's one of the main
underlying themes of the story.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.310
In effect, the people
live in a cocoon.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:20.250
Planet Purple organizations,
as we well know,

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.660
virtually have a single
measure of performance.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:24.930
All that matters
is the bottom line.

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:28.880
In contrast, Planet
Prism organizations

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.210
are a model of diversity.

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:32.670
Everything is different.

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:35.140
The King even enjoys--
the King Friday

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.770
is the stand in for the
autocratic CEO-- even

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:39.740
enjoys talking with employees.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.730
Yes, he's still in
charge because we're

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.810
not against hierarchy, per se.

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:45.060
That's not the point.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:48.190
But the point about the
Planet Prism organization,

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:52.140
their primary goal is do
no harm to the planet,

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:56.360
and make products that serve
authentic human needs, not

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.980
false needs.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.916
Let's go on to the next fable.

00:24:59.916 --> 00:25:01.620
DONNA MITROFF:
OK, the Next story

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:06.300
is "The Bass Violin
Festival." and this story

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:11.610
we have paired with our topic of
one of our C's for creativity.

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:14.610
So listen to this
one and think of how

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:17.070
the lessons that this
has about creativity

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:21.106
in your organizational life.

00:25:21.106 --> 00:25:22.980
"One day in the Neighborhood
of Make Believe,

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.210
King Friday receives a
message from the mayor

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:27.950
of an adjoining locality
saying that she would

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:31.140
like to arrange a festival that
involves all of the surrounding

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.210
neighborhoods.

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:34.960
King Friday likes that idea
and immediately proclaims

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.770
that it'll be a bass
violin festival.

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:41.730
Chuck Aber, one of his subjects,
points out that he, the King,

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:46.000
is the only one who actually
plays the bass violin.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.860
Undaunted by this, King
Friday says, oh, so I am.

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.470
"King Friday's
subjects are pleased

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.610
at the prospect of a joint
neighborhood festival,

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:58.480
but quite taken aback that
it will be just a bass violin

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.960
festival, and that they
must all participate.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.730
Lady Aberlin is
especially disconcerted

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:09.380
when King Friday presents
her with a bass violin

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.240
and tells her it's
a fine instrument.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.840
It was made by an
excellent instrument maker.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.820
She acknowledges that it may
be a very special bass violin.

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:24.630
However, she says, I cannot
play the bass violin.

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:28.140
Just because a person
has a fine instrument

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.310
doesn't mean that he can
play that instrument well.

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:35.560
King Friday simply tells her,
go on keep on practicing.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.980
"Over the next few
days, the subjects

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.830
meet to share their frustration
about being required

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:43.290
to perform a skill
they do not have.

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:45.950
One day Lady Elaine Fairchilde
arrives and tells them

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:48.110
she has a solution
to the problem."

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:49.230
Remember Lady Elaine?

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:52.820
She's the outspoken, gutsy one.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.500
"She produces her
accordion, the instrument

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:59.870
that she plays very well, and
it is covered by a false front

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:03.260
to make it look
like a bass violin.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.770
She tells them that
now she's going

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:06.740
to play the bass
violin for them.

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.690
They watch and
listen in amazement.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.870
Lady Aberlin then points
out that, you're actually

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:14.400
playing your accordion.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.600
Lady Elaine acknowledges
it is an accordion.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.360
But since it looks
like a bass violin,

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.870
it could work for The
Bass Violin Festival.

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:25.640
"Lady Elaine's clever
solution gives the others

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.350
an important idea.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:31.290
They could all think of ways
to make what they do look

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:34.940
like bass violins so that could
contribute to the festival.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.890
Lady Aberlin knows how to dance.

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:40.180
So she decides to dance
with the bass violin.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:44.170
Miss Paulifficate puts
on a bass violin costume

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:47.790
and plays at being
a bass violin.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:52.620
Keith and Michael Jones
make bass violin puppets

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:56.140
who will perform a bass
violin conversation.

00:27:56.140 --> 00:28:01.620
Another neighbor dresses up as a
special flower, a bass vio-let.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:04.440
And yet another one
decides to write and recite

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.214
a poem about the bass violin.

00:28:07.214 --> 00:28:08.630
"In the midst of
their excitement,

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:10.480
they realize that
King Friday needs

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.590
to be told what
they're going to do.

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.990
They become a little worried
that he may not like the news.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:18.520
Lady Aberlin confides
to Daniel Tiger.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:21.160
And Daniel says,
the best thing to do

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.110
is tell the King the truth,
that not everybody can learn

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:26.180
to play the bass
violin so they're

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.490
going to do other
things with it, things

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:30.160
that they can do well.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.700
With the support
and encouragement

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:35.760
of all her friends Lady Aberlin
tells King Friday the truth.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.310
He listens to the
plan and concludes

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:41.830
that these are very clever
ideas and perhaps this festival

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:44.030
could turn out to be
something special.

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:45.700
And indeed it is.

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.640
The very, very
special Bass Violin

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.940
Festival where
everyone contributes

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:56.900
with his or her own
special talent."

00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.050
IAN MITROFF: OK, let me go over
the lessons briefly of "The

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:04.470
Bass Violin" and it is really
one of my favorite stories out

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:05.280
of Fred's.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.410
That number one, technology--
particularly talking

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:11.480
to a technology company-- is
never a substitute for skill.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.444
The fact that King
Friday is an expert,

00:29:13.444 --> 00:29:15.610
you can't assume that
everybody else will take to it

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:17.410
and become an expert.

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:20.310
Number two, technology
often increases our fears.

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:21.550
We all know that.

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:24.390
It makes us feel painfully
aware of our shortcomings,

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.450
so increases anxiety.

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:27.960
Three, often we're afraid.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.020
Indeed the more we are, we
project our fears on others.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:33.950
See for all we
know in the fable,

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:36.760
King Friday may have
given the assignment

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:40.330
to see if his employees-- take
the metaphor employees-- would

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:42.620
break out and become creative.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.780
Because the fable, in many
ways, is about re-framing,

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.020
taking the initial
assignment, which

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.710
may be impossible
to solve on its own.

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:53.910
Creativity forces us to
confront our deepest fears.

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:56.720
Will we be foolish and
laughed at if we expose

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.970
or ideas and feelings
to the world?

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:03.810
To be creative we
have to be childlike,

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:04.970
without being childish.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:06.760
Last thing let me
talk to you about.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:10.610
Those of you who've taken
courses in statistics

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:14.830
early on learn about two errors,
type one and type two errors.

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:16.130
I won't go through them.

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:18.650
If you've taken a class,
you know what it is.

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:21.840
There's an error that is
virtually never talked about,

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.080
which is most fundamental.

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.630
It's the type three error.

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:27.876
The type three error is solving
the wrong problem precisely.

00:30:27.876 --> 00:30:29.500
I'm sure you can all
connect with that.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.460
Solving the wrong
problem precisely.

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:35.620
To know that we're not solving
the wrong problem precisely,

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:39.070
what we have to do is have
at least two different ways

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:40.090
of looking at a problem.

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:42.000
If you have only
one alternative,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.800
that's really a
set up that you're

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.230
going to solve
the wrong problem.

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:47.420
And that's really what
the fable is about.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:49.720
And that's what we
talk about in the book.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.059
Let me go on to the next slide.

00:30:51.059 --> 00:30:52.850
DONNA MITROFF: You can
imagine that if they

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:55.960
had taken the
assignment directly

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.320
and all tried to learn to
play the bass violin in time

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.960
for the festival,
they would have

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.950
been very successful at solving
the wrong problem precisely.

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:08.090
They would have committed
the error of the third kind.

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:09.600
IAN MITROFF: OK,
we're near the end

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.808
here where our time with you.

00:31:10.808 --> 00:31:13.340
But I'm just going to
talk about very briefly

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.830
what the rest of the book does.

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:19.424
We apply the fables and we
bring in some topics that

00:31:19.424 --> 00:31:21.465
are both talked about and
really not talked about

00:31:21.465 --> 00:31:22.770
in business schools.

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:24.570
For example, life skills.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:27.030
Ellen Galinsky who has gone
around the country and talk

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:30.290
with investigators who
study young children.

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:33.510
What are the key skills that
kids need to learn early

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:36.410
and we need to emphasize them
throughout our whole lives.

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:40.300
I've worked with a friend
who's developed a marvelous

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.650
instrument for getting how to
help people handle conflict.

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:45.510
Defense mechanisms.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:47.560
One of the earliest
discoveries of Freud.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.940
If the defense
mechanisms are high,

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:53.610
like denial, you can't do any
of this in an organization.

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:54.700
Personality styles.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.330
We talk about the Myers Briggs.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:59.260
Number five, I've worked my
pretty much my whole career

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:02.190
as one of the developers
of crisis management.

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:05.420
Years ago, starting with
the first Tylenol poisoning,

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.860
I moved into the field
of crisis management.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.120
And lastly, I don't know
how many of you have ever

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.830
heard of attachment theory.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:15.410
But it's one of the most
profound theories about how

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:18.460
we build trust early
on in our lives.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.640
Attachment theory
provides really

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.650
the basic models of trust
that go back literally

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:25.020
from the day we are born.

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:29.010
The interactions with
our primary caregivers.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:31.930
So the point about
the book, I guess,

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:37.100
Donna said it before,
but let me say it again,

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.180
if we had to summarize
the book in one line

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:42.990
it would be that, Fred helped
you when you were a child,

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:44.950
he can help you when
you're an adult.

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:49.130
Because the lessons of Fred,
the stories, are so finely hewn,

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:51.850
they're so finely
crafted that they really

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:55.020
reverberate throughout
our entire lives.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:58.300
Now, we were lucky to find a
publisher, Palgrave McMillan,

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:04.010
an academic publisher, and
they started a new series

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.450
to teach organizational
behavior.

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:09.210
They had people,
such as us, write

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:12.050
books that would teach
organizational behavior

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:13.990
through stories and fables.

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:18.740
And we were lucky to be one of
the first books in the series.

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.080
DONNA MITROFF: Talk
about the book.

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.585
How they positioned
it and market it.

00:33:23.585 --> 00:33:25.250
And it is a textbook.

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:27.410
IAN MITROFF: It's a
supplementary textbook

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:29.700
because it's not out
of the mainstream.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.030
Hopefully, telling
stories in fables

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.700
will move more in
the mainstream,

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:34.685
how we teach business.

00:33:36.589 --> 00:33:38.130
DONNA MITROFF: But
I just want to say

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:42.930
what you'll see if you read
the book, it's in three parts.

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:46.255
Part one, is we just
tell you the stories

00:33:46.255 --> 00:33:49.510
and we ask you to
think about them.

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:54.700
Part two, we go back and analyze
each of these seven stories

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.310
in some detail.

00:33:56.310 --> 00:34:01.260
And then in part three, is
the real academic application.

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:04.930
And that's where we bring
in all of these other areas

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:07.170
and we provide exercises.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:10.510
And we know the book is
being adopted by some faculty

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.010
members around the
country and being

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:15.370
used in management
classes, but not enough.

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:17.670
And it's the kind
of thing that if you

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:21.350
wanted to start a group
of your own, read the book

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:25.850
and talk about it, the ideas
are there for how you can.

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:28.409
IAN MITROFF: But at this
point we need to stop.

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:30.080
We have a few questions for you.

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.730
And I'm sure you have questions.

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:36.710
One of Fred's, we think,
profound ways in which you

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:41.620
would end, even start a meeting
was said, close your eyes.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:44.330
So everybody close your eyes.

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:49.600
And think about who is
the person or persons that

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.699
were most impactful
on your career.

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:56.060
I think the way Fred put
it, willed you in to being.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.460
And the second thing we
would ask you to think about

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:03.550
is, what have you heard
today that you can carry back

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:07.770
directly into your
jobs to make your life

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:10.630
and the life of your
colleagues better.

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:12.130
We'll take a few seconds.

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:13.145
Keep your eyes closed.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:22.100
OK, floor is open for you.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.952
Any questions, comments.

00:35:23.952 --> 00:35:25.493
DONNA MITROFF: Any
thoughts that came

00:35:25.493 --> 00:35:28.280
to you during that
eyes closed moment.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.600
We'd like for this
to be a conversation.

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:37.590
So anyone who wants to
say anything about a story

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:42.680
like this being applied to your
organization, or any thoughts.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:43.330
Yeah?

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:44.040
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:47.930
I found it fascinating that
the Planet Purple people felt,

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:51.090
or believe, that they could
travel just by thinking.

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:53.370
And what I brought
back from that is,

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:56.110
I tend to be an ideas person.

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:58.180
But if you really want
to carry an idea through,

00:35:58.180 --> 00:35:59.721
you have to be
committed to the steps

00:35:59.721 --> 00:36:01.400
that it takes to
bring it to fruition.

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.446
You can't just think about
it and say, it's done.

00:36:04.446 --> 00:36:06.790
DONNA MITROFF: That's very good.

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:07.590
That's very good.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:09.000
Very interesting.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.280
IAN MITROFF: Well, I mean,
what you said-- yeah,

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.720
I'm primarily a
thinking person too,

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.110
going through engineering,
philosophy of science.

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:20.670
But the point is that we
don't sell ideas alone just

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:21.980
through the ideas.

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.195
We sell them through stories.

00:36:23.195 --> 00:36:27.190
I mean think about the leaders
who were most effective.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:29.280
Whether you like President
Clinton or Obama,

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.520
they have a story.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:34.340
Even George W. Bush, OK,
I didn't agree with him,

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.850
but he had a story.

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:37.600
And he was effective that way.

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.760
So the most effective
leaders have

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.565
a way of encapsulating
the lessons

00:36:42.565 --> 00:36:44.280
into something that moves us.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.930
Because ideas alone,
Yeah, they're necessary,

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:49.260
but they're not sufficient.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:52.014
And that's the point
why we did the book.

00:36:52.014 --> 00:36:53.430
DONNA MITROFF: And
the other point

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:58.320
of the thinking way of traveling
is that you only use your mind.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.370
You leave your body.

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:04.600
You don't use it.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.760
You can't do that.

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:09.010
You have to integrate
your mind, and your body,

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:12.241
and your spirit to really
accomplish anything.

00:37:12.241 --> 00:37:12.740
Yeah.

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.600
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering
about the process

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.496
of building stories.

00:37:16.496 --> 00:37:18.370
Because there's a very
creative aspect to it,

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:21.890
but there's also the taking
what you want to get across

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:25.320
and communicating
it effectively.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.250
And sometimes you can
be very, very creative

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:31.405
and no one understands
what you're talking about.

00:37:31.405 --> 00:37:33.530
Other times, you could be
very clear on what you're

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:39.180
talking about, but the story
is banal or are not compelling.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.990
And I'm wondering if you guys
have any insight in terms

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:46.920
of Mr. Rogers' process on how
he got from what he wanted

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.405
to get across and into a story.

00:37:48.405 --> 00:37:52.300
IAN MITROFF: David do you have
any idea what the process was

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:53.850
that Fred went through?

00:37:53.850 --> 00:38:01.560
DAVID NEWELL: It was based a
lot on letters from the public.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.710
This is not exactly
answering your question,

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:08.840
but the most requested topic
we ever had over the years

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:12.190
was from people
talking about Fred

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:15.060
helping their
families with divorce.

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:22.400
And we got so many-- and this
is going back maybe 20 years--

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.430
and Fred didn't
know how to do it.

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:29.160
And finally-- he had a
professional child development

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:32.190
expert with him all the
time-- and they finally

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:34.240
came up with a concept.

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.250
And we did a whole
week on divorce.

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.570
And the one thing
that Fred wanted

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:41.860
to get across to children was
that it's not their fault.

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:47.600
So it evolved like that.

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:50.390
Another time, much
more light hearted,

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:54.560
there was a time when we
did a week on superheroes.

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:59.260
I had seen an article where a
child thought he was Superman,

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:02.520
put a towel around his neck,
and jumped off a building,

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.360
and killed himself.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.920
And that was going on.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.770
And so we went to
"The Incredible Hulk,"

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:08.830
watching it being filmed.

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:10.390
Remember "The Incredible Hulk?"

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:16.160
We went to Universal Studios
and showed that this is pretend.

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.010
Here's this person
getting into his makeup.

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:19.760
He broke it down.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.000
And Fred thought that way.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.850
He wanted to demystify a
lot of different things.

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:27.420
But does that answer
your question?

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:31.870
The creativity came a lot
of times from the public.

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:36.050
But a lot, like "The
Bass Violin Festival."

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:38.140
it came from Fred's
love of music, too.

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:41.130
He used that as a metaphor of
sorts to get that point across.

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:43.054
So it came from many
different places.

00:39:43.054 --> 00:39:44.220
Do you have anything to add?

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:48.220
IAN MITROFF: One other
response, the kind of philosophy

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:51.240
I studied was really in the
school of pragmatism, William

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.530
James.

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:57.345
If you read the opening
pages of "Pragmatism", one

00:39:57.345 --> 00:40:00.640
of William James' key
works, he tells a story,

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.820
it's a brief story
about a working man, who

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.440
had been out of work for a year.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.300
He finally got a job
in physical labor.

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:09.210
But he was hurt.

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:10.670
He was weak.

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:13.080
He couldn't do it
so we came home.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:17.170
He killed his family
and he killed himself.

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:20.180
And William James-- you know it
was ripped from the headlines--

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:23.810
and William James asked
what does philosophy

00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:24.760
have to say to this?

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:28.090
If it has nothing to say,
it has nothing to say.

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:30.590
And so the point
is, you know, I mean

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:33.100
I've written scores of books.

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.720
You've got wherever you
find the story-- I'm

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.790
working on a book
with my in-law,

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:41.440
the father of my son-in-law.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:45.101
And he's a retired
bio-stat guy from Stanford.

00:40:45.101 --> 00:40:47.100
And we're talking about
writing a book on health

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.060
for the public, the kind
of concerns they have.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:54.290
He worked with Michael DeBakey
and I keep saying, Abe, we've

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:56.410
got to crystallize the stories.

00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:59.800
For every point that
we want to make,

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.240
there has to be an
accompanying story.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.210
See one of things they didn't
say earlier about fables

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:06.730
and why we went with fables.

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:09.760
The reason why
fables reverberate,

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:13.810
they're stereotypes, but
the good guys and bad guys

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:15.330
are clearly drawn.

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.720
That's why we were
drawn to fables.

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:20.790
And the moral lessons are clear.

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:22.340
Now you get into stereotype.

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:23.530
You can exaggerate.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:25.130
But that's what fables do.

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:28.180
So they cut through
all the stuff there,

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:29.930
and they make it come to life.

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:31.310
They're human.

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:32.705
And you don't get
that, you know?

00:41:32.705 --> 00:41:33.734
I mean come on.

00:41:33.734 --> 00:41:34.400
I'm an academic.

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.483
I've been in the academic
world for my whole life.

00:41:36.483 --> 00:41:40.240
You're not rewarded
for doing that.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:44.740
And there's so like all the
idea stuff, that's necessary.

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:47.870
But it's not sufficient to
get it out here to the world.

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:51.450
And that's why we wrote the book
because what a challenge for us

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:53.310
to do what you were asking.

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:54.060
Anybody else?

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:55.230
We have a few minutes.

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:58.015
Yes, sir.

00:41:58.015 --> 00:41:59.720
AUDIENCE: I think
it's a great concept

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.480
to apply these lessons
to the workplace.

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.510
Of course, you guys actually
shared the workplace

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:05.570
with Fred Rogers.

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:08.340
I'm curious what was
that workplace like.

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:09.890
Was it any different?

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:12.800
I loved your story of
actually closing your eyes.

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.290
Are there more
examples like that?

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:22.550
DONNA MITROFF: It was chaotic.

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:26.640
It was always
bubbling and jumping

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.420
and things were happening and
things didn't get done on time.

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:34.310
Some recognition up here.

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:37.990
But there was always that
underlying current of we

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:39.960
know where we're going.

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:42.480
This is about
something important.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.180
And that's the thing that kept
everybody coming back together.

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:48.410
Now the day-to-day stories?

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:50.510
David has piles of those.

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:52.510
DAVID NEWELL: I was in
every one of the tapings.

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:56.960
We did over thousands of
tapings and I was in them a lot.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.730
And the one time that you could
tell-- Fred was a musician--

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:04.790
and you could tell
when he was frustrated.

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:07.900
He would never yell or throw
a sneaker across the floor.

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:09.680
He would go to the piano.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.000
And when we sat
down at the piano

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.600
and would play the piano
that was his-- anger

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:18.490
came out through his
fingers or his frustrations.

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:19.860
And that's how he dealt with it.

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:21.510
And people would
follow that, too.

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:24.350
They knew that Fred
was saying something

00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:26.480
to them when the
piano would start.

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:30.470
And after every taping
Fred had a tradition,

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:32.350
he'd go to the piano
and-- you're all

00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:35.090
too young to know up it, but in
the movie theaters in the '40s

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:37.500
and '50s, they had newsreels.

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.820
And there was a news
reel that started out

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:41.670
with a rooster crowing.

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:43.900
It as the RKO Warner
Brothers News,

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:47.110
something that had a
very distinct theme.

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:48.530
Da, da, da dat da da.

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:51.770
It's like playing "And That's
All Folks" from Looney Tunes.

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:54.850
He would sit down and play that,
and we knew the day was done.

00:43:54.850 --> 00:43:57.510
But Fred talked through music.

00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:59.389
DONNA MITROFF: He talked
through music, yeah.

00:43:59.389 --> 00:44:01.180
IAN MITROFF: One thing
that I do remember--

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:03.670
I'll get the story a little
bit wrong, not exactly.

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:07.080
I remember watching Fred one
time on the old "Johnny Carson

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:07.580
Show."

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:10.390
I don't how many of you watched
the old "Johnny Carson Show."

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:13.530
And Fred was talking
about what he did.

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:16.010
Johnny, they were
engaged in conversation.

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:19.520
And Fred was talking about
the importance of children's

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.480
feelings, and somebody
in the audience guffawed.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.720
And Fred looked at that
person steely cold and said,

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:27.600
that's not funny.

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.420
And I remember that
because, again,

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:33.170
to think that OK, he was
bubbly and light all the time.

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:33.990
No way.

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:36.580
I mean, yes, this
was a spiritual,

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:38.360
a really good person.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.390
But the things that
he didn't have strong

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:43.220
values-- In fact, we
talked about that.

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:46.420
This was more than a
one time occurrence.

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:50.810
I know when I've
been involved-- I'm

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:53.400
in a research
center at Berkeley--

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:56.970
and we have people come in and
they'll talk about feelings--

00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:59.930
because it's a center about
crises and everything--

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:02.140
they'll talk about warm fuzzies.

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:05.380
I have to bite my tongue
and I can't always do it.

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:08.540
And say, don't you
insult feelings that way.

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:10.124
You don't do that with a kid.

00:45:10.124 --> 00:45:11.415
DONNA MITROFF: Or with anybody.

00:45:11.415 --> 00:45:11.690
IAN MITROFF: Or with anybody.

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:13.770
DONNA MITROFF: Because
you bring those feelings

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:16.860
with you no matter what.

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:19.200
And they have to be dealt
with no matter where you are,

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.230
no matter what age you are,
they have to be dealt with.

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:22.813
IAN MITROFF: One of
the things I found

00:45:22.813 --> 00:45:25.020
when I did my book on
spiritually was called

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.360
"The Spiritual Audit
of Corporate America,"

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:30.130
that one of the things
that people talk about what

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:32.760
spirituality meant
to them at work

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.330
was how much of
their whole person

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:35.371
they could bring to work.

00:45:35.371 --> 00:45:37.260
Could they only bring
their head, but not

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:39.780
your their feelings, their
heart, and their body.

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:43.190
And so the whole point is, we're
fragmented enough in our lives

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:45.560
that they didn't want to be
further fragmented at work.

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:48.180
Or to go home and repair
for all the beating

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.726
up that they took
during the week.

00:45:49.726 --> 00:45:51.850
And then go home and repair
so they could come back

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:54.230
and take another
40, 50 hours more.

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:57.870
So the organizations that quote
have a spiritual bent, whatever

00:45:57.870 --> 00:46:01.020
you want to call it, get
more of the whole person.

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:03.600
They don't exploit that person.

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:05.640
And they get more
of the creativity.

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:08.980
That's why all of these
fables really reverberate.

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:10.966
OK, I think we
have time for more.

00:46:10.966 --> 00:46:12.590
DONNA MITROFF: Do we
any time Courtney?

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:13.756
COURTNEY: One more question.

00:46:13.756 --> 00:46:17.010
DAVID NEWELL: Can I follow
up with what you asked?

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:19.070
This just shows
Fred's sense of humor.

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:22.190
He had a wonderful
sense of humor.

00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:23.130
The crew knew this.

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:25.950
You know how he changed
his shoes and sneakers

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:27.310
and put his--?

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:29.160
At the very end of
the program, they

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:32.800
snuck in a pair
of smaller shoes.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:36.170
And he put his shoe on
by talking and winding

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:37.010
his foot into it.

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:37.990
And he couldn't do it.

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:39.330
And he couldn't do it.

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:41.650
And you heard the
crew started to laugh.

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.470
He wore a size 10, and
they gave him size 8.

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:48.470
You can't tell just
by looking at it.

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:51.970
And he thought
that was so funny.

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:55.980
And it Dick Clark showed
it on his outtake reels.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.500
Just one other quicky.

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.110
You know those blow up dolls?

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:03.830
This is something that nobody's
ever told anyone, but I will.

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:06.347
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:06.347 --> 00:47:08.430
They said, OK, Fred, we're
going to start to show.

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:10.346
He came in, sang the
song, put the sweater on,

00:47:10.346 --> 00:47:12.480
went to the cupboard,
and there was a blow up

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:15.010
doll hanging in the closet.

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:16.550
And it startled him.

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:22.607
So he pulled it out and
started dancing with it.

00:47:22.607 --> 00:47:24.440
DONNA MITROFF: That was
a creative solution.

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:25.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.260
DAVID NEWELL: But
that was an outtake

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:29.730
that we never let
out of our hands.

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:31.170
But you now know about it.

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:37.250
But the point I'm saying is
that he had a sense of humor.

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:39.670
And it goes back
to feelings, too.

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:42.390
He wasn't mad and stomped
out and said, OK, you're

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:43.670
all suspended.

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:47.130
That didn't work with Fred.

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:48.380
AUDIENCE: Just a comment.

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:51.010
There's been a lot of
attention in the media

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:54.270
lately about women taking
on management positions

00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:57.100
and doing very well,
exercising more,

00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:59.920
kind of, masculine management
type characteristics.

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.490
But the thing that
I love about Fred,

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:03.281
and especially looking
back because I never

00:48:03.281 --> 00:48:06.290
would have picked this up as a
child, but as an adult, is he

00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:09.370
was one of the first men who
was comfortable exhibiting

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:11.010
more feminine characteristics.

00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:13.430
As a man, being in
touch with feelings.

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:16.730
DONNA MITROFF: And he also
created Lady Elaine Fairchilde.

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:17.305
And she--

00:48:17.305 --> 00:48:18.263
AUDIENCE: There you go.

00:48:18.263 --> 00:48:21.050
DONNA MITROFF: --was
that futuristic woman,

00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:23.210
who wasn't afraid to stand up.

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:25.740
There are other
stories in our book

00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:29.390
where she was the one
who stood up to the CEO

00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:32.640
and said, don't ask me to do
something if you don't tell me

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.850
why I'm going to do it.

00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:37.140
I mean that's pretty
masculine but that was--

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.190
IAN MITROFF: Suzanne,
I have to talk

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:42.070
about, you raised something
that's really important.

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:46.610
One of the things about
Fred, which is sad,

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:49.130
is that many men
are uncomfortable.

00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:51.330
So you have all
these urban legends

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:54.340
that underneath he was
tattooed, and he was a seal,

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.830
and all that kind of
stuff because the reason

00:48:56.830 --> 00:49:02.480
is you couldn't take that there
would be a man who would openly

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.280
talk about feelings, and
wouldn't be a effeminate--

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:08.090
or whatever the derogatory
term of the day-- and we

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:09.750
know all that kind of stuff.

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:16.030
So they had to project onto Fred
their fears and anxiety to make

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:18.710
him into something
that he wasn't.

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:21.100
He was masculine.

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:25.120
But I mean if you talk about,
if you go to Jung, where

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:28.540
you have both the feminine
and the masculine archetypes.

00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:30.750
They are in every one of
us, but they're not always

00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:31.690
equally developed.

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:34.430
And we're not always equally
comfortable in displaying

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:35.510
both of them.

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:39.270
That's another thing that
when you look at the story.

00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:44.270
The story was the whole feeling,
was the whole the persona,

00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:46.690
of Fred himself.

00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:49.854
DONNA MITROFF: I think
we need to wrap it up.

00:49:49.854 --> 00:49:52.550
We wanted to share with
you we have a website,

00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:53.920
you can learn more about it.

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:58.546
And also the next one
has our email addresses.

00:49:58.546 --> 00:50:00.900
IAN MITROFF: We also want
to thank our publicist

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:04.720
Rina Neiman, who helped
us put this together.

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:07.650
And our uh--

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:10.720
DONNA MITROFF: So you're
invited to be in touch with us

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:11.270
by email.

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:17.500
Nina has put together
the Twitter page for us.

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.060
Are you familiar
with this picture?

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:24.440
Of my, this picture is
just-- That's what happens.

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:27.730
And now it's happening to David.

00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:31.540
People who can't touch
Fred, will come up to David

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:33.960
and just grab this
face because they

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:35.684
want they want to get close.

00:50:35.684 --> 00:50:37.850
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you
so much Ian, Donna, David.

00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:39.820
David will be over
there in the green booth

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:42.147
to sign autographs
for his pictures.

00:50:42.147 --> 00:50:43.230
Thank you guys for coming.

00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:48.872
[APPLAUSE]
