1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,800
If you guys see that, I just
saw a commercial, um, uh,

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,490
for Kentucky Fried Chicken where the
parents are all excited because the two

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,390
bratty kids won't sit
still at the dinner table,

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,990
put the got 'em this fucking
chicken and they're feeding it too.

5
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:20,250
And they basically very subtly saying
that there's drugs in this chicken that

6
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:24,360
will make your spastic children chill
the fuck out and spastic. I mean like,

7
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:27,510
you know, not, not the way they
mean it over there in Great Britain,

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,910
you can't say that on the comedy or
you can say it in a comedy club over in

9
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:34,170
Scotland, but you'll have a rough,

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,740
you'll have a rough go of it if you
say the kid was spastic over there,

11
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:41,740
that means like severely
mentally challenged over here.

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,950
It just means you're not
going to get laid to you're 26

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,693
[inaudible]

14
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,780
when you were in Grad school looking
over a fucking cadaver, right?

15
00:00:52,781 --> 00:00:55,060
With some other fucking
nerve narrowed. Right.

16
00:00:55,061 --> 00:00:56,590
And you're just sitting
there going, you know,

17
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:59,440
the ankle bones connected
to the knee bone. Right?

18
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,010
Has any of this made any sense? What
shouldn't? It's fucking Sunday night.

19
00:01:03,011 --> 00:01:06,310
And I am spent and I got a whole
bunch of Shit I have to do tomorrow,

20
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:09,550
so I got to do it tonight.
All right, I'm off my game.

21
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,511
All right. You,

22
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:14,460
you cleanse your liver and like
42 43 days or something like that.

23
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:19,440
Every drunk I knows has told me that
every drunk I know that does not have a

24
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:23,880
medical degree has told me
that if you go 42 43 days,

25
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:28,860
you will cleanse your liver at least to
the booze. You know? Now if you fucking,

26
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,910
you start doing blow or a, you know,

27
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:36,510
eating a bunch of trans fat fucking
food or feeding your kids Kentucky Fried

28
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:40,110
fucking chicken, Jesus Christ.

29
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:45,260
What happened to parents that you got
drug your kids to keep them under control.

30
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,160
You know, you know what it is.
Kids don't respect their parents,

31
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,490
they respect them, but they don't
respect like, oh my God, this,

32
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:57,990
this person could ring my neck,
could pick me up by my hair.

33
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,160
Right. Could grab a paddle
and fucking, you know,

34
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,260
mostly hit my ass,

35
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:08,160
but also kinda hit my lower back
because I'm squirming right.

36
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,660
That doesn't exist anymore. So now
these kids is so fucking out of control,

37
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,400
these people have to go down and
Kentucky Fried Chicken. Okay.

38
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,270
And I, I,

39
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:23,270
I use the term chicken very loosely
to go down and whatever that is,

40
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,220
that's in that bucket. Okay?
It doesn't have a beak.

41
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,000
It doesn't have feet. If
it's fucking, you know,

42
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,400
chest, his breast is sticking out
like the cast on fucking uh, what was,

43
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:42,540
what was that show with the Italians?
They're on New Jersey shore. Jersey shore.

44
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,380
Right. My world. That's
not a fucking chicken.

45
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:48,810
You know,

46
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,250
you want the chicken that looked like
Mark McGuire in his rookie season.

47
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,210
You don't want to eat the chicken that
looks like Mark McGuire when he fucking

48
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:59,920
played for the cardinals. You know?

49
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,040
Do you eat a regular fucking
chicken? First of all,

50
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:08,610
it's gonna look like a pigeon to you
because you so used to seeing those roided

51
00:03:08,611 --> 00:03:12,900
up ones that they have murderer's row
that you got down there at your fucking

52
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:17,520
Shaws, right? Your
Vaughn's, you, JC Penney's,

53
00:03:17,521 --> 00:03:20,700
wherever the fuck you buy your
God damn chicken, you go down,

54
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:24,150
you go down to any one of the
main stream fucking supermarkets.

55
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,850
Okay. And I swear to God, when you get
to the chicken section, okay, if you've,

56
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,560
if you slept for the last 30 years, like
that Van Gundy guy under the bridge,

57
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:39,240
whatever his fucking name
is, Van Morrison, the hell's
his name, Rip Van Winkle.

58
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,740
Right. That was one of those
people, one of the vans. Um,

59
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,080
if you slept for the last 30
years and you went down, okay.

60
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,350
And they showed you what a chicken
was, you'd be like, ah. You'd be like,

61
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:56,030
that ain't no chicken. Okay. It's a
God damn Turkey. I know. Fucking die.

62
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,170
No fucking Turkey when I see one. Alright.

63
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,480
I ain't no such thing as
a mad fucking chicken.

64
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,850
Can't be done. No Sir. No Sir.
Get off my property. Okay. I'm,

65
00:04:08,851 --> 00:04:12,930
I'm done with your witchcraft. Okay.
Pass it. Get the fuck Outta here.

66
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,020
Fuck off my property.

67
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,103
Um,

68
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:26,360
honey, get the gun. Um, yeah,

69
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,500
you would think it was a fucking
Turkey. And the thing is,

70
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:31,370
is now it's a chicken. And I remember
I watched one of those food inks,

71
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,410
one of those fucking liberal
goddamn things, you know,

72
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:37,400
talking about flying carpets and electric
roads and all that bullshit somewhere

73
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:40,750
in there they were talking about, you
know, the food supply and are poison.

74
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:45,540
It is poisonous poisoning is is. Um,

75
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,790
so I fucking went down to a
farmer's fucking mock yet.

76
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,590
And um, I said, I wanna,

77
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:59,460
I wanna I want to all I want, I wanna
I want an all natural fucking chicken.

78
00:04:59,461 --> 00:05:02,970
I can't even talk. I'm so tired.
One an all natural chicken.

79
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,730
The guy goes, these are all natural.
And I said, all natural. And he goes,

80
00:05:08,731 --> 00:05:11,850
well, I'm like, come on, where is it?

81
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,530
And he had to walk around the corner
and sitting over there, lonely.

82
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,270
I swear to God,

83
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,570
looking like a dove look like in
somebody killed the fucking dog.

84
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,170
He goes right there. That one
right there is 100%, all natural.

85
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:29,700
Nothing's wrong with it. And
I was like, I was like, what?

86
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,180
That's what a chicken
supposed to look like.

87
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,300
And he raised his eyebrows and he,

88
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:39,420
he kind of put his lips together so
they were a straight line and then he

89
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:43,870
nodded, you know, that look
that people do like, like, yeah,

90
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:47,050
I'm in the Matrix. I realize
I'm in the Matrix, but you know,

91
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,710
I knocked the bitch up so I gotta be
selling these roided up chickens now.

92
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,710
Um, anyways, anyway, what
the I'm talking about.

93
00:05:57,711 --> 00:06:01,020
So basically that's what these people
are eating over there. Okay. They are,

94
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,280
they are drugging up. They're kids.

95
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,310
But I can't get mad at him because I
actually did that to Charlie Murphy and

96
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,040
Darnell Rawlings. I've told
this story before. Hey,

97
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,960
I'll tell it against my fucking podcasts.

98
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,830
I actually drug I the exact thing that
they're doing in their Kentucky Fried

99
00:06:19,831 --> 00:06:24,270
Chicken commercial where they're trying
to get their kids to sit still by just

100
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:29,100
feeding them so full of these fucking
transfats from these roided up beatless

101
00:06:29,101 --> 00:06:33,750
fucking checkins with their Dolly
Parton breasts diseases. Right.

102
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,000
I did that to fucking Darnell and Charlie.

103
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,600
I was hung over and we were taken a car
service from Chicago xannies up to one

104
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:46,770
of those, whatever the fuck it was.

105
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,590
Saint Charles was a three city run
and one of them was St Charles.

106
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:55,920
So we're getting in the fucking Limo,

107
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,700
Don L's and ray form
Charlie's and rare form.

108
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,050
They're fucking Gavin and trash and people
and me and everybody and I just don't

109
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:05,460
want to hear it. I'm like,

110
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,600
I don't want to listen to these fucking
guys running that Goddamn yaps in the

111
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:13,050
back of this car the whole fucking
way up. I want a nice quiet ride.

112
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,960
This is gonna suck. And I walked outside,

113
00:07:15,961 --> 00:07:19,710
hung over and I walked into
this Chicago where you know,

114
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,430
almost got hit by three
fat people. And um,

115
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:29,460
I looked up the street and I saw
it, I saw Popeye's and I was like,

116
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,330
oh, thank God.

117
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,760
And I fucking walked in there and I got
all this fucking Popeye's chicken with

118
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:38,790
biscuits and all of this shit food.

119
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,320
And I brought it back to the
car and as the car pulled up,

120
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:46,710
they came out and I said, hey guys, I
got itself some, I've got some food.

121
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,370
And they went, oh, that's fucking great.
You know, they were hungry or whatever.

122
00:07:50,371 --> 00:07:55,290
And they started showering that
fucking Popeye's food. And I sat back,

123
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,760
nibbling on drum stick,

124
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,890
and I swear to God, 10 minutes
later they were asleep.

125
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,400
I'm not lying. They were fucking asleep,

126
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,660
snoring the whole way up. And I
was just sitting there loving life,

127
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:15,900
the whole fucking writeup. And I, you
know what, I admitted to them later.

128
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,570
They thought it was funny, but
that's basically what it is.

129
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,340
They called it the Itis,

130
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,600
that's what they call it when you eat
that shit food and then you have to go to

131
00:08:24,601 --> 00:08:28,950
sleep. They call it the Itis, I guess.
And by they, I mean African Americans,

132
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,650
um, they call it the fucking itis
and that's what they got. They,

133
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:38,770
and I learned that from Don because I
don't know how that man stayed in shape,

134
00:08:39,991 --> 00:08:41,520
but he had the worst diet.

135
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,420
He's one of those guys who
like you stopped for gas
and he comes out of the gas

136
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:48,480
station with like one of
those gas station hotdogs

137
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:56,560
and he would eat it and then he
would immediately fall asleep. And I,

138
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,160
and I would say to Charlie, look
at this guy. Oh he's sleeping.

139
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,650
And Chad be like, yeah
man, he got the itis.

140
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,960
Let me explain that to me and what that
little bit of information it went into

141
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:11,961
my evil white brain and I drug my two
African American friends way back in the

142
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:17,970
year 2005. Um, and that's a
little chicken story for you.

143
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:19,230
What time did you like dad? Everybody.

144
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,470
So that's what the fuck
they're saying right there.

145
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:25,710
That's what Kentucky Fried
Chicken is allegedly saying.

146
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:27,090
I guess I have to say a legend.

147
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,560
So their lawyers on retainer don't attack
my fucking pop podcast as far as I can

148
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:36,270
tell. I'm asking you right now,

149
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,880
a Kentucky Fried Chicken hiding
behind your fucking letters, KFC.

150
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,740
Is that what the fuck you do?
Is that what you're saying?

151
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:51,050
If you got kids who are not stimulated
enough that they can't even sit down.

152
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:55,980
If you haven't read yet to have run them
around. You got to tie your kids out.

153
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:59,340
Open the door. You send them out in
the fucking yard, Gad God's side,

154
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,100
get outside and play. That's what you do.

155
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,100
Like a Goddamn one of
those fucking Irish dogs.

156
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,410
There was bread to have to to herd sheep.

157
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,640
You've gotta let that fucking thing
run around. Run around in circles. Guy,

158
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:13,710
get out there, take a ball.

159
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:16,380
You just fucking throw it out in
traffic and let the dog run around.

160
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:19,770
Dodgy cars that comes in,
it's going to lay down. Okay?

161
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,950
It's not going to jump all over. Company
sticking its cold nose right in there.

162
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:26,100
Fucking who has. That's what
you gotta do with your kids.

163
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,560
You've got to send them outside, right?

164
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,550
But to catch a Predator and all
these other fucking shows. You know,

165
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,390
all these shows on TV where people
forget their kids are in a car with the

166
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:40,410
windows rolled up and their kids are
too fucking dumb to roll them down or

167
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:43,320
they're too weak because they haven't
gone outside and climbed a fucking tree

168
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,490
and they stay in there and their,
their brains get cooked like a boxer.

169
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:52,650
You know, you know that dog boxes, they
don't, they don't do well in the sun.

170
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,430
Well will neither do fat kids if you
leave the windows rolled up, you know,

171
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,660
and they got those weak arms that all
like the most tedious things they ever did

172
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:05,340
was take a wrapper off of a
fucking a, an ice cream sandwich.

173
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,550
Right? You can't leave them in the car.

174
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,830
My mother left us in the car all the
fucking time. She would go to school,

175
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,090
she was going to school during the day
trying to further her education and she

176
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:22,620
left five fucking kids in the car with
the windows rolled up and money for

177
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:25,530
Burger King. And she would say
to us, just go into the Burger.

178
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,380
That's the only time you were
to leave this car over the left,

179
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,500
over the next three fucking hours when
I'm in class and she would disappear

180
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:39,640
around the corner after we said absolutely
mom. And she walked away. And uh,

181
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,430
we immediately would get out of the car,

182
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,590
start walking up and down
the streets in Boston.

183
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,850
We'd go into fucking burger king
and we, we'd have some to eat.

184
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,440
Do you know what, what happened nowadays,

185
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:52,470
if they just saw five fucking dirty
face kids walking up and down,

186
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,320
calm AV Boylston street
going into a burger king,

187
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,780
we're going to cast a fucking nanny.

188
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,530
Someone would have filmed it and
my mother would have been in,

189
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:06,460
they would have taken us away. No, but,

190
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:10,140
but they did cause there was no
cameras back then or video tape ones.

191
00:12:10,141 --> 00:12:13,590
I mean there was, but only
people add them on like the news

192
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:19,260
in a young Steven Spielberg. So we went
in there and we fucking got some food,

193
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,340
climbed bunk cars and fucking
yelled at people and Shit.

194
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,110
Ditto hanging on Platt parking
meters and all that. Hence,

195
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:32,160
we had the fucking forearm strength to
roll down the windows and none of us ever

196
00:12:32,161 --> 00:12:34,890
had an issue in the
car. And you know what?

197
00:12:34,891 --> 00:12:38,040
I think that's one to grow
on today. You go people,

198
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,270
I'm not saying KFC is food.
I'm not, I'm just kidding.

199
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,460
I'm not saying it's bad
food. Every once in awhile.

200
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,560
Who's kitting home every once a,
we don't go. Don't worry. Great.

201
00:12:46,561 --> 00:12:49,470
If he could just fucking do heroin,
the way you can eat McDonald's,

202
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:54,000
just like every once in a while he'd
just be like, you know what? Yeah,

203
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,340
let's just fucking tie off.

204
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,210
Not off for the rest of
the fucking day. And like,

205
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,240
the people at work understood it. Hey,
where were you yesterday? Od and yeah,

206
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,350
I've got this black tar
heroin came in, you know,

207
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:11,910
I hadn't done it like three months
away. I figured fuck it. Oh,

208
00:13:11,911 --> 00:13:13,800
is that what you did? How was
it? I wasn't, you know, like,

209
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,770
like you went to Aruba, you said
hot. I, it was awesome. Fucking,

210
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,410
I don't remember shit.
But you can't, you know,

211
00:13:22,411 --> 00:13:23,340
you get addicted to it.
