00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.470
- [Mark] The main dish that we came here

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.540
to eat is called huevos motulenos.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.460
Oh, the yolk, look at
that, the yolk is spilling.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.960
Oh, that's a beautiful thing.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.400
Okay, I'm just gonna
pick this up with my --

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.041
Carlos, huevos motulenos.

00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:11.935
- Huevos motulenos.

00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:15.084
(Mexican music)

00:00:15.084 --> 00:00:16.934
- It's a harmony of wonderful flavor.

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:20.849
Oh, it just sprayed.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.760
Good morning, I hope you're
having an amazing day.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.593
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:28.593 --> 00:00:30.110
I'm in Merida, which is the capital

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.650
and the largest city of the
Yucatan state of Mexico.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.920
This is a beautiful colonial city.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.530
Today, we're just gonna walk around,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.630
we're gonna explore, we're gonna eat

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.070
some incredibly delicious food,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.650
we're gonna visit some sites,

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.160
go to some heritage locations,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.790
and just fully explore Merida.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.780
I'm gonna share it all
with you in this video.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.210
Ying and Micah are here, and we're also

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.170
here with my buddy Carlos, and his wife,

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.730
and their baby as well, so it's gonna be

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.284
all of us exploring today.

00:00:53.284 --> 00:00:55.951
(Mexican music)

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.010
There's two places that we want

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.550
to check out for breakfast this morning.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.760
The first is a place in the market.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.580
After that, we'll go to a restaurant

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.063
for a different breakfast.

00:01:08.063 --> 00:01:11.700
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.840
(acoustic guitar music)

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.440
There is a lot of
amazing-looking food immediately,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.537
but we're looking for a
place called La Lupita.

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:22.204
(Mexican music)

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.330
This place is absolutely amazing.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.760
It's all market dining.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.300
There are stalls.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.500
We found the place, it's called La Lupita,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.420
and it's right next to,
they're selling fresh meat,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.700
they're selling fresh vegetables here,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.400
so all the ingredients
are quality, are fresh.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.800
Most of the dishes they have here

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.210
are all Yucatan specialties,

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.780
including a dish that I really want to try

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.980
which is called the relleno negro.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.620
We also got some cochinita pibil,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.640
which is also a very
well-known Yucatan dish.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.590
This is a great dining environment.

00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:11.913
(Mexican music)

00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:17.940
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.670
(Mark speaks in foreign language)

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.613
I'm gonna first grab one of the tacos,

00:02:22.613 --> 00:02:24.920
the cochinita pibil.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.870
These are little, wrapped,

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.340
they've wrapped them all the way up.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.060
I'll just open it to see what's inside.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.167
We can also add some
salsa in there as well.

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:34.500
(acoustic guitar music)

00:02:43.906 --> 00:02:46.092
(speaks in foreign language)

00:02:46.092 --> 00:02:47.921
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:02:47.921 --> 00:02:48.754
(speaks in foreign language)

00:02:48.754 --> 00:02:52.754
(man sings in foreign language)

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.670
This taco is absolutely awesome.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.100
The pork is just fall-apart tender,

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.530
very flavorful, very juicy.

00:03:03.937 --> 00:03:07.990
That salsa, it actually
has a vinegary taste to it,

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.840
which is very sour, which I
wasn't expecting, but I love.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.540
It's so juicy.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.380
Another dish that I
was very excited to try

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.380
is called the relleno negro,

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.880
which is a black chili stew.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.870
They actually burn the
chilis, they blacken them,

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.340
they mix it with their spices,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.760
and then it's usually with turkey.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.530
This is, there are some
big chunks of turkey

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.880
and an egg in there.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.893
Mmm.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.480
Oh, it's kind of mild in
flavor, but it's really good.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.800
It's a really harmonious
blend of ingredients.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.840
You can taste the roasted,
blackened flavor of it.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.923
It's not spicy.

00:03:57.923 --> 00:03:59.810
I think you can add your own chilis.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.730
Then that turkey is
just fall-apart tender.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.150
It's juicy, mmm.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.090
It's really an exquisite
blend of ingredients.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.340
For my next bite, I
don't know if you can see

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.750
up really close, but there's a little bit

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.520
of sausage in here, as well as egg,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.640
and the waiter told us
we're supposed to eat it

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.080
all together with a pavo negro.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.650
Get a little bit of all
of that in one bite,

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.630
and then stick this into
my tortilla with all that.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.985
Oh, that habanero is
gonna make it awesome.

00:04:21.985 --> 00:04:25.130
(Mexican music)

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.640
Let me add a little
bit more of that sauce.

00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:38.106
Oh.

00:04:38.106 --> 00:04:39.662
Mmm.

00:04:39.662 --> 00:04:40.495
Mmm.

00:04:41.418 --> 00:04:42.780
Mmm.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.040
Those chilis are not that hot.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.576
That's a great combination though,

00:04:46.576 --> 00:04:51.576
and those black chilis, it's mild,

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.450
but flavorful at the same time.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.390
Okay, another specialty
in Yucatan is panuchos.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.440
They're almost like tacos,

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.290
but it's a totally different shell.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.610
It's like a corn tortilla, but
it's stuffed on the inside,

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.870
so you can see those layers,

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.210
and you can see what's underneath it.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.540
I'm not totally sure what's underneath it.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.130
Then it's topped with a bunch of meat,

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.940
and there are some
onions on there as well.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.950
Then it's all fried and kind of greasy.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.270
It looks amazing.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.630
It is filled with beans, and then I think

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.640
the whole thing is deep fried
because it's all crispy,

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.620
but you can see that there,

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.480
a very thin layer of black beans in there.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.660
The meat inside is called pavo escabeche.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.750
I think it's turkey, and then also

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.070
topped with some sauteed onions.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.737
(Mexican music)

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:39.723
Wow.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.010
Oh, that's incredible.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.390
The shell is crispy, and then you've got

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.160
that thin layer of salty
black beans on the inside.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.400
Then it's fried and kind of greasy.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.630
The meat, the turkey, is
really fall-apart tender.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.750
Those onions are incredibly sweet.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.530
That's insanely good, but
I'm just gonna give it

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.160
a little squeeze of lime,

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:00.890
and maybe add on a little bit

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.210
of salsa for my next bite.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.830
This salsa is actually quite spicy.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.740
I'm loving it.

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.336
(Mexican music)

00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:17.125
Mmm.

00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:18.466
This is the best thing.

00:06:18.466 --> 00:06:21.960
Okay, the final dish that
we got is called mondogo.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.710
It's similar to menudo.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.260
There are some organ meats,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.730
and it came, the organ
meats, on top of the bowl.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.310
Then you just toss it
into the hot soup below,

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.310
so it's already been mixed, and we added,

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.310
what did we add, we added
some chopped green onions,

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.620
a little bit of lime in here.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.010
Normally, you would eat this on your own,

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.190
but we're all sharing it.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.780
You can see the big chunks.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.300
Oh, that looks like a
worthy chunk right there.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.050
This looks like a piece of a stomach.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.640
You can see that padding area.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.590
Oh, I love it.

00:06:56.137 --> 00:06:57.830
Mmm, mmm.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.840
It's a little bit chewy,

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.810
but really good flavor.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.760
Maybe a little bit tomato-y,
a little bit salty,

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.190
you get the crunch of those green onions,

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.793
and those pads of stomach.

00:07:15.793 --> 00:07:19.320
(electronic music)

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.153
I like that.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.450
We ate a little more
than we had anticipated

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:34.890
here at La Lupita, but the food was

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.130
so incredibly good, we couldn't resist.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.820
Everything was top notch.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.830
Everything was delicious.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.970
Everything was new to me as well,

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.270
but I think my favorite
thing was the panucho.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.650
It's absolutely delicious.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.730
The turkey just melts in your mouth.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.530
You've got that crunchy, oily
wrapper filled with beans.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.870
That gives it a different twist.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.580
You gotta try that, it's amazing.

00:07:56.842 --> 00:07:59.440
(speaks in foreign language)

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.970
We're walking next to the next
breakfast, number two spot,

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:04.100
but this is gonna be more of

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.270
a sit-down cafe style breakfast.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.110
There's one breakfast dish
that I wanted to try there,

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.020
but some coffee also sounds
incredible right about now.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.937
(electronic music)

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.648
Is this it?

00:08:21.648 --> 00:08:23.648
Maiz, Canela y Cilantro.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.950
The place is called
Maiz, Canela y Cilantro.

00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:37.370
It's so nice and friendly.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.160
They're doing all the cooking.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.050
It's just a family-run restaurant,

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:43.440
so yeah, this is just the family kitchen.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.815
They're cooking cafe.

00:08:44.815 --> 00:08:46.640
(woman speaks in foreign language)

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.350
I can't wait for the huevos motulenos.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.760
This is a dish I'm really
looking forward to trying.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.427
(Mexican music)

00:09:02.897 --> 00:09:04.790
This is a really nice place to relax,

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:08.980
and sit, and just to have coffee and food.

00:09:15.179 --> 00:09:16.012
- Americano?

00:09:16.012 --> 00:09:21.012
- Americano (speaks in foreign language)

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.200
Oh, that's a good coffee.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.550
Mmm, oh, this is perfect.

00:09:31.668 --> 00:09:32.501
Oh.

00:09:32.501 --> 00:09:33.940
The main dish that we came here to eat

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.540
is called huevos motulenos.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.270
Motul is a city.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:40.460
It's not too far away from Merida,

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.620
but they're famous for this dish.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.090
They invented this dish.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:44.410
There's tostadas on the bottom,

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:45.950
then a couple of fried eggs on top,

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.540
then tomato sauce, then it's sprinkled

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.420
with diced up pieces of ham and cheese.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.940
Then there's some bananas and
platino on the side as well.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.400
Let me break into the egg.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.280
Yeah, you can feel how crunchy it is.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.720
Oh, the yolk, look at that,

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.180
the yolk is spilling.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.204
Oh, that's a beautiful thing.

00:10:02.204 --> 00:10:03.590
Oh, there's (speaks in foreign
language) too on the bottom.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.640
There's beans, looks like
refried beans on the bottom.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.850
Oh, and there's peas in here too.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.540
Okay, I'm just gonna pick this
up with my fingers sort of.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.233
Carlos, huevos motulenos.

00:10:12.233 --> 00:10:13.066
- Huevos motulenos.

00:10:13.066 --> 00:10:15.733
(Mexican music)

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.003
Oh, that's amazing.

00:10:23.003 --> 00:10:24.070
The eggs are cooked perfectly.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:27.130
You got the runny yolk,
so creamy, it's so rich.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:29.270
Then you've got the crunchy
tostada on the bottom.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.600
You've got the light tomato sauce,

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.650
you've got the ham and cheese.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.520
It's a harmony of wonderful flavor.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.370
Let me try this habanero.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.211
Oh, it just sprayed.

00:10:40.211 --> 00:10:43.420
Mmm, not too spicy,
but really good flavor.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.280
Yeah, you know what, you
can tell that's a habanero.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.700
Oh, it's good, and a little habanero juice

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:48.900
shot up my nose.

00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:57.884
(Carlos speaks in foreign language)

00:10:58.732 --> 00:10:59.942
- She wants to be on the camera too.

00:10:59.942 --> 00:11:01.592
That's what I heard, she told me.

00:11:03.193 --> 00:11:04.843
- The platinos are delicious too.

00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:08.334
Oh.

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:09.167
- [Carlos] That habanero, man.

00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:11.475
- Yeah, that habanero.

00:11:11.475 --> 00:11:14.470
When you get to the seeds
in that habanero, wow.

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.160
It goes up into your head.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.460
That feels awesome.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.217
Yeah, that's a little bit spicy.

00:11:19.217 --> 00:11:20.113
(Electronic music)

00:11:20.113 --> 00:11:21.363
Come on, Micah.

00:11:22.998 --> 00:11:24.774
Come on, buddy.

00:11:24.774 --> 00:11:25.695
(woman speaks in foreign language)

00:11:25.695 --> 00:11:27.590
(speaks in foreign language)

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.239
- Bye-bye.

00:11:29.239 --> 00:11:31.130
(speaks in foreign language)

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:35.010
Charming place, really
friendly, really good food.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.900
Those huevos motulenos,
that was delicious.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.890
Also, the coffee was fantastic.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:43.780
Micah and Armando loved
walking around that courtyard,

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.420
and they're so friendly there as well.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.320
From here, we're walking,

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.940
it's not too far of a walk to Centro,

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.446
which is the central area of Merida.

00:11:51.446 --> 00:11:54.363
(electronic music)

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:02.960
We're on our way to Centro,

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.204
but we're doing a little shopping.

00:12:04.204 --> 00:12:05.910
We're looking at the clothes.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:09.870
We're thinking about buying this shirt,

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:13.040
or that shirt for Micah.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.980
I'll let you know what decision we make.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.630
We decided to go with the blue.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.860
Micah chose it himself.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.570
That looks extremely comfortable.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:21.393
I do sort of want one too.

00:12:21.393 --> 00:12:24.310
(electronic music)

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.330
We walked over to Plaza Grande.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.160
This is the Centro, the center of Merida,

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.990
but walking through the
streets is so beautiful here,

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:46.560
the colors, the history,

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.020
the well-preserved colonial architecture.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.530
It's a charming place.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.070
Yeah, right to my left-hand side,

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.360
this is the Catedral de Merida.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.050
Then you have Plaza Grande over here,

00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.750
which is just an open, public space

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.800
where people are hanging
out, and relaxing,

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.250
and just enjoying the beautiful weather

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.150
and the culture here.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.635
This is fantastic.

00:13:07.635 --> 00:13:08.468
I feel great.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.550
We're thinking about taking a horse ride

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.400
in the horse carriage
because it's perfect,

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.140
it's nice, this is a perfect environment

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:17.973
just to stroll around.

00:13:17.973 --> 00:13:20.940
We've got two boys, and they
want to ride the horses.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.360
Okay, let's take it.

00:13:25.245 --> 00:13:28.109
(horse hooves clop)

00:13:28.109 --> 00:13:31.026
(electronic music)

00:13:32.735 --> 00:13:37.735
- Take a picture of (speaks
in foreign language)

00:13:39.939 --> 00:13:42.856
(electronic music)

00:13:48.055 --> 00:13:50.150
Right now, we're passing
through Paseo de Montejo,

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.102
which is a historic street in Merida.

00:13:53.102 --> 00:13:57.435
(guide speaks in foreign language)

00:13:57.435 --> 00:14:00.352
(electronic music)

00:14:03.072 --> 00:14:04.322
- [All] Cheese.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.440
- We made it back to Plaza Grande.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.850
That was about a 45-minute ride,

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:20.980
and it cost 300 pesos for all four of us.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:21.813
That was well worth it.

00:14:21.813 --> 00:14:25.040
It was a great way to roll
around and see Merida.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.810
They have these chairs
that are facing each other.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:31.577
They're a little too romantic.

00:14:31.577 --> 00:14:32.610
(Carlos laughs)

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.584
But great for having a conversation.

00:14:34.584 --> 00:14:37.501
(electronic music)

00:15:04.402 --> 00:15:06.060
- Mangos.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.156
- Are you getting a mango?

00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:10.906
(speaks in foreign language)

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.810
We're walking towards
Mercado Lucas de Galvez,

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.560
and we're getting there, but
stopped to have a quick mango.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.870
This is a green mango, and I think

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:20.820
there's a bunch of chili, and probably,

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.970
maybe some salt and
sugar in there as well.

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:27.283
Mmm.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.410
Oh, yeah, it's salty.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.020
You can taste the chili on it.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.440
Maybe a little bit of sugar too.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.420
Then, the mango itself,
very, very sour and crunchy.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:42.690
That's delicious.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.850
Great snack, but it's so sour.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.410
It's the type of sour that
will start to hurt your teeth

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.990
if you eat a lot of it.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:58.980
- Ooh.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.680
- There's lots of toys and flowers,

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.710
but for sure, there's gonna be

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:07.032
a lot of delicious food here.

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:09.470
That's what we're looking for right now.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.137
(Mexican music)

00:16:19.852 --> 00:16:24.102
(woman speaks in foreign language)

00:16:33.769 --> 00:16:34.602
(Mark speaks in foreign language)

00:16:34.602 --> 00:16:35.456
- Mondongo.

00:16:35.456 --> 00:16:37.946
- Mondongo, oh, okay, mondongo.

00:16:37.946 --> 00:16:40.924
(woman speaks in foreign language)

00:16:40.924 --> 00:16:41.949
(Mark speaks in foreign language)

00:16:41.949 --> 00:16:45.707
(woman speaks in foreign language)

00:16:45.707 --> 00:16:47.393
(Mark speaks in foreign language)

00:16:47.393 --> 00:16:51.643
(woman speaks in foreign language)

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:57.400
We found some stalls at the market,

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.250
and this is upstairs.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.410
They also have a lot of stalls

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:01.080
to eat at within the market downstairs,

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.300
but the upstairs is a little quieter.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.500
You have a little more space.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.030
She looks like an amazing chef.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.430
She has all sorts of different dishes.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.170
Actually, it's quite a task

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:10.332
to figure out what to order, but we got

00:17:10.332 --> 00:17:13.110
a couple of different dishes to try.

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:14.870
We got a plate of mole
that we're all snacking on.

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:16.560
I'm gonna try some of that mole.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.390
With chicken drumsticks in here.

00:17:27.988 --> 00:17:28.821
Mmm.

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:32.440
It's kind of a sweet mole, but it is good.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.310
It's like a rich chicken.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:36.230
We got another plate of relleno negro.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.280
I guess relleno negro's very, very popular

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.860
in Merida and throughout Yucatan.

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.230
They recommended we try it,

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:43.490
so I don't mind having another plate

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.140
of relleno negro for lunch today.

00:17:50.423 --> 00:17:51.256
Mmm.

00:17:53.152 --> 00:17:58.110
Oh, that little piece of
sausage, that's amazing.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.920
Again, those burnt, blackened
chilis in there as well.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.640
We just got a melon shake,

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.100
and they pack it to go like this,

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.480
in a cup, with a plastic bag,

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.658
with that giant air bubble at top,

00:18:07.658 --> 00:18:08.850
but the straw is still in there

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.910
so you can't spill it.

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:11.780
That's pretty cool.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.890
That is a packaging I haven't seen before.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.180
That's zero spill.

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:17.840
Oh, yeah, and that air will,

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.990
oh, you can just leave
that air pocket in there.

00:18:24.435 --> 00:18:25.295
Mmm.

00:18:25.295 --> 00:18:26.495
It's just blended melon.

00:18:29.908 --> 00:18:32.575
(Mexican music)

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.310
A dish that I was very excited to try

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:52.550
is called sopa de lima.

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.940
It has just arrived.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.090
It looks really good.

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:55.923
It's a soup.

00:18:55.923 --> 00:18:58.460
You can see there's some
tostada shells underneath,

00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.880
or maybe some chips.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.640
Then there's shreds of chicken on top.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.630
There are slices of lime.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.020
There's onions, there's slices of tomato,

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.630
and some cilantro sprinkled on top.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:10.870
This is gorgeous, it looks beautiful.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.270
Shreds of chicken, there's some skin

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.520
in this bite, some onions.

00:19:18.784 --> 00:19:20.070
Mmm.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.940
Oh, it's really sour.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:29.050
Those fried tortillas, they've
soaked up all of the juice.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:30.150
The main thing that stands out,

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:32.220
it's like a really thick chicken soup

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:37.130
with a really refreshing lime taste to it.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:38.510
This is an all-in-one dish because

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.820
you've got your fried
tortillas in the bottom,

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.020
and then you got the soup,
then you've got the chicken.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:43.990
This is an all-in-one dish,

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.960
so you can just eat it as
is, and it's delicious.

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:56.143
I love it.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.170
This is a delicious dish.

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:01.100
We were just talking with the auntie here,

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.040
and she said that there are many different

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.330
styles of sopa de lima,

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.860
but she makes a version that
her grandmother taught her,

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.640
which is a traditional version.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.870
That's what we're eating,

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.260
and you could just see how she made it

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.950
with such love, with such expertise.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:16.450
They do have some salsa
that I need to try though.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.320
Oh, with the tomato in this bite.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.223
Oh.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.760
Oh, that salsa is amazing.

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.280
It's a little bit spicy.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.610
It just has wonderful roasted
chilis, smokey flavor to it.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.200
This is the best dish of
lunch without a doubt.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.830
Just a family-run little
stall in the market.

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:51.950
Yeah, that's just like home cooking,

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:55.170
and the best dish for me was
definitely that sopa de lima.

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:56.450
I absolutely loved it.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:00.270
That's a recipe I want to make
again, I want to have again.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:02.850
Wow, it was so flavorful, so good.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.810
We've been walking around
this park for a little while,

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:14.330
and just ultimately relaxing.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:18.910
Micah is taking a nap,
but there's one more dish

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:22.530
we want to try, a Yucatan Mayan dish.

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:23.770
We're trying to search.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.670
It's really actually
hard to find in Merida,

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:28.240
in the town center, so there's one place

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.690
that I think serves it,
but we're gonna have to

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:31.690
jump in a taxi, and we're

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:35.200
going there right now.
(electronic music)

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.320
That was about a 20-minute taxi ride.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.153
We made it.

00:21:52.153 --> 00:21:53.660
The restaurant is called El Tikinxic.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:56.750
They're known for seafood,
including a special type

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:58.930
of fish dish that I wanted to try.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:00.610
This is one of the only
places that we could find it,

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.260
so I hope it's gonna be good.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.870
It's really in the neighborhood here.

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:06.450
It's a residential area.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.690
It looks like just somebody
has opened their home,

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:12.380
and they put chairs and tables
around the courtyard area.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:13.874
I'm excited.

00:22:13.874 --> 00:22:17.780
(waiter speaks in foreign language)

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.010
We're ordering a bunch of seafood,

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:21.240
including some ceviche,
and also the main dish

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.590
that we want to try,
which is called tikin xic.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:26.600
As we're waiting for the food,

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.810
they brought us some little appetizers.

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:29.870
There's some ceviche, there's some kind of

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.240
shredded something, and some beans.

00:22:35.898 --> 00:22:36.731
Mmm.

00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:39.040
Oh, that's amazing.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.778
Carlos is just telling
me this is cahuamanta.

00:22:41.778 --> 00:22:43.650
It's like a type of stingray.

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:46.450
Mmm, shredded, it's almost like chicken.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:48.890
It's delicious, really, really tasty.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:52.810
Sea snail ceviche with
onions and tomatoes.

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.943
Mmm.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:01.010
Black pepper flavor in there is fantastic.

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:04.790
It's very limey, very
fresh with those onions.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.680
We got fried shrimp with coconut.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.130
Then we also got this unique dish,

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.740
it's a fish filet which is stuffed

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.280
with a variety of things and then

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.090
wrapped up into a roll-up.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:17.250
Then it's deep-fried so it's
all crispy on the outside.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:18.580
Then we also got a plate of ceviche.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.310
I'm gonna go in with a piece of tostada.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:22.390
Oh, this is just loaded.

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.420
Look at those shrimp,
look at that octopus.

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:25.840
Oh, yeah, look at that bite.

00:23:30.828 --> 00:23:31.661
Mmm.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.820
Ceviche never gets old for me.

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.460
Main dish that we came here
to eat has just arrived,

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.140
and it's called tikin xic.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.660
It's a Mayan Yucatan dish,

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:51.100
and you can typically order
a full fish made like this.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.610
We would've, but they said
it takes an hour to cook,

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:55.540
and with the kids, we don't
really have that much time,

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.450
so we got the filets, and
it comes in banana leaves,

00:23:58.450 --> 00:23:59.960
so it's roasted in banana leaf.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.353
Let's see what's in this packet.

00:24:02.353 --> 00:24:05.240
Oh, that puff of steam
immediately comes out.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.350
That smells incredible,
the roasted flavor.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:09.810
Those banana leaves are charred

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:11.964
and steamed below here.

00:24:11.964 --> 00:24:14.020
Oh, it's so hot and fresh.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.420
You can see the filets of fish down there.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:17.680
The redness, I think, is
coming from that achiote,

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:22.680
which is a commonly-used
Mayan fruit herb spice.

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.280
Then there's a bunch of peppers,

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.090
onions, and tomatoes on top of it.

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.260
Oh, it's just baked and steamed

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.610
inside of here, and it's juicy.

00:24:35.472 --> 00:24:36.972
Mmm, mmm, oh yeah.

00:24:39.323 --> 00:24:40.563
Mmm.

00:24:40.563 --> 00:24:41.820
It's so smokey.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:43.250
The fish is kind of neutral-tasting,

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:48.250
has a little bit of,
like, sour and smokey.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:49.980
Those are the flavors that I taste.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.690
It's delicious, it's really good.

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:52.980
He said we could add some of these onions

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.880
and cilantro to our fish as well.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.370
I'll try it with some onions.

00:25:03.663 --> 00:25:04.496
Mm-hmm.

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:08.710
That's just a great, solid dish.

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:11.120
Next up for the seafood crochet.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.430
It's loaded with almost
all the different seafoods.

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.110
It's all the same
seafood from the ceviche,

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:17.160
just in totally different shape and form.

00:25:20.321 --> 00:25:21.800
Mmm.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.540
It's wrapped in fish which is deep-fried.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:25.940
Then you've got little pieces of squid,

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.970
and I think that same sea snail in there,

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:29.249
as well as onions.

00:25:29.249 --> 00:25:31.916
(Mexican music)

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.150
Final dish is the coconut shrimp.

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.820
They're battered, but even
the batter is coconut.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:49.020
That's kind of a sweet
coconut milk dressing.

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:50.630
The sauce isn't my favorite.

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:52.710
It's a little on the sweet side,

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:53.820
but the actual shrimp are awesome.

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:54.730
We just finished with dinner,

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:57.120
now waiting for a taxi to go back home.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.590
Oh, man, it's been quite
a lot of food today.

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:02.080
I'm pretty full, and it's been a long day,

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.350
but such a good day.

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:05.790
Merida, it's a beautiful city.

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:06.730
It's well-preserved.

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:07.910
It has so much culture.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:10.770
The people are friendly,
the food is awesome.

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:12.670
I pretty much enjoyed and loved

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:14.060
everything we ate today, but I think,

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.910
probably, if I could
choose the best things,

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:19.670
it would be the panuchos
and the sopa de lima.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.010
What else did we eat today?

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.090
But really, everything
has been outstanding.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.770
Oh, those huevos motulenos
was also excellent.

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:29.120
Everything was really good.

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:33.320
Merida is an amazing little city to visit,

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.100
and it has so much to offer.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.150
I hope you enjoyed this
