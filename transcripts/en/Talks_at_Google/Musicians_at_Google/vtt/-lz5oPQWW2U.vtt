[MUSIC - GORDON CHAMBERS,
SONGWRITING MEDLEY"]

00:02:00.292 --> 00:02:02.250
GORDON CHAMBERS: So I am
the common denominator

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.085
of all those songs.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.130
But it's music lovers like you
that made them all number ones.

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.890
So right now, I'm
going to do a song.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.420
On every album,
I cover something

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.090
that I've written in
my own special way.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.140
Tonight this one goes
out to a dedication

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.730
to two very important ladies
in my career-- my first two

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.290
mentors, the late,
great, Phyllis

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.580
Hyman, and a lady
that I wrote for,

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.840
who told me that it was
time for me to also go solo

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.880
as an artist.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.492
Give it up for-- it's one
year since she went to glory.

00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:43.115
Give it up for the
beautiful, incomparable,

00:02:43.115 --> 00:02:45.130
and forever in our hearts,
Ms. Whitney Houston.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.279
Last but not least,
for my beautiful,

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:52.820
the matriarch of
our family, recently

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.830
gone home, Aunt
Barbara, Barbara Powell.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:36.180

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.470
GORDON CHAMBERS: Thank you.
