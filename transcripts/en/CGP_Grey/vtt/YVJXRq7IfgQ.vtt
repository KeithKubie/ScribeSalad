00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.240
The President can veto Congress' budget,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.320
but Congress, with enough votes, can override that veto.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.400
So while negotiations may happen between the two branches if Congress can't get enough votes to override a veto,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.760
ultimately the responsibility for government spending

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.687
lies with Congress. They alone have the power to specify taxes and spending,

00:00:16.687 --> 00:00:18.960
while the President has the power to say no,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.580
but can be overruled.
