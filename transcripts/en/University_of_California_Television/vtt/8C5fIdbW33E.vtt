00:00:05.884 --> 00:00:08.467
(upbeat music)

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.450
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.750
Bipedal, naked, large brain,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.570
long the master of fire,
tools and language,

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.910
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.730
Aware that death is inevitable

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.680
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.550
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.030
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.110
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.670
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.540
of the past.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.180
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.240
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.530
and how we got here.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.950
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.530
of humans like you.

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:24.584
(upbeat music)

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.160
- Thank you Tim and thank you to CARTA

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.750
for their vision in sponsoring
these wonderful symposia.

00:01:45.364 --> 00:01:48.730
I want to start with one picture here

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.370
which is a picture of what was intended

00:01:54.374 --> 00:01:58.880
to inculcate into the
readers of this magazine,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.880
Time magazine, that DNA did everything

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.743
that you would want in a car.

00:02:06.743 --> 00:02:07.576
(audience titters)

00:02:07.576 --> 00:02:11.520
And unfortunately for this ad, of course,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.540
Volvo was taken over by Ford.

00:02:14.872 --> 00:02:18.650
So there's been a cultural
change since this ad came out.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.730
We don't know yet what the cultural change

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.300
actually will bring about.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.650
It hasn't been long enough.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.856
But the general problem that we face

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:31.970
is how important are the genes,

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.380
relative to the other things
that go on in the human life?

00:02:37.465 --> 00:02:39.770
And what I'm going to do

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.140
is to start quite a bit of time ago

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.260
with a picture that tells you about

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.160
what my colleague, Cavalli-Sforza,

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.370
who just died four weeks' ago,

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.890
and I called the serial founder effect

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.930
of people leaving Africa

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.530
between 50 and 100 thousand years ago.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.660
And what you see here

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.740
are the people who are the most variable.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.290
They have the most variation

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.604
in terms of colors and genes

00:03:10.604 --> 00:03:12.650
and when they leave Africa,

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.280
a small number of those individuals

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.680
approach this area here,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.660
probably the Levant

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.950
and then they diverge into groups

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.300
that go to Africa and Asia.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.460
Some go down into the Oceanic area

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.040
and the final group to move,

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.820
moves across this varying bridge here

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.920
into the Americas

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.600
and you can see the
pattern of variation here

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.310
is much less variable than here.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.150
Now, some economists,

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.941
and I'm referring to
these particular ones,

00:03:50.941 --> 00:03:54.110
think that there's something else going on

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.110
and they claim that the
pattern of human variation

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.150
has been associated with
economic development.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.960
And they did it by doing
the following picture

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.960
which is this infamous
paper by Ashraf and Galor

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.620
where if you look at this graph here

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.430
which is essentially population
density in the year 1500

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.376
which the economists chose,

00:04:23.376 --> 00:04:28.376
and this is a pattern of
lack of genetic variation.

00:04:29.267 --> 00:04:34.267
So the people who lack most
of the absent variation,

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.410
or the people who are the most variable

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.260
are the Africans and the people
who are the least variable

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.060
are the indigenous Americans.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.570
And they concluded that
having an intermediate

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.560
amount of variation was conducive
to economic development,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.220
and this is just one,

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.560
population density was just
one of the silly things

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.220
that they did.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.210
But the idea behind bringing
this to your attention

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.690
is that this is published
in the most eminent

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.177
economic journal in America,
in the world in fact

00:05:09.177 --> 00:05:12.030
and not only is it silly, but it's wrong.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.330
They claimed that a one
percentage point decrease

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.230
in diversity for the most diverse society

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.830
would be associated with a rise

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.130
in its population density by 64%.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.320
So this kind of misuse of numbers

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.340
not only was it in that paper

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.630
but it also was brought
over into another paper

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.650
they wrote about cultural fragmentation.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.396
And it's the trying to point
out the genetic diversity

00:05:41.396 --> 00:05:45.900
actually is a cause of
these social phenomena.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.550
Not only were they silly,
but they were wrong

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.020
and there were a series
of papers published

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.151
shortly after this one came out

00:05:56.151 --> 00:06:00.280
that addressed that their
population estimates were wrong,

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.070
their time of getting
agriculture was wrong,

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.690
whether there was
cooperation in the societies

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.900
they were looking at was wrong,

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.989
and of course, how much
genetic diversity was related

00:06:12.989 --> 00:06:17.260
to innovation was wrong too,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.480
because fruit flies have

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.720
a lot more genetic diversity than humans.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.239
Their innovation is not nearly
as great, as far as we know.

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:27.090
(audience laughs)

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.720
So in the human genome
diversity cell line panel,

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.710
which Luca Cavalli-Sforza and I

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.980
started to develop in the early 1990s.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.150
We looked at genomic variation

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:45.150
in people from around the
world, 52 populations,

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:50.190
and where they're located is
marked with these red Xs here

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:57.260
and those peoples we would
love to have a lot more

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.860
in the human genome diversity cell line.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.085
And people now have in their laboratories

00:07:03.085 --> 00:07:06.130
hundreds of populations
from around the world

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.070
where the DNA is currently
available for analysis.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.540
Our idea was to have this
panel available in Paris

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.220
and any lab in the world
could just get the DNAs

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.270
and do their studies.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.786
And this was the first study
that we did on those people

00:07:21.786 --> 00:07:23.330
in that study.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.780
These are indigenous Americans,

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.550
these are indigenous Africans
and these are Europeans

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.670
but the interesting thing about this slide

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.500
is how many of these
populations around the world

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.790
have ancestry in more than one place

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.870
including these people who
have ancestry in three places

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.610
and the Uyghurs in China
have ancestry in three places

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:49.680
and Hazara in Pakistan and Afghanistan

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.210
have ancestry in three
different continents.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.720
So, ancestry is a much better idea

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.410
about describing populations than is race.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.820
Now, if we go back to
that silly economic slide,

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.170
when you look at the
data that we've produced

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.410
from that study, they were using my data,

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.198
that's what made me so mad.

00:08:12.198 --> 00:08:13.818
(audience laughs)

00:08:13.818 --> 00:08:17.970
And these were the data they were using.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:22.970
We plotted mean diversity
as a function of distance

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:26.400
from Addis Ababa and what you can see here

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.550
is that the Africans have
the highest diversity

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.790
and the indigenous Americans
have the lowest diversity

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:34.430
and we can ask why.

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:37.250
Well I showed you why
in that migration trait.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.317
It was a property of
prehistorical migrations

00:08:41.317 --> 00:08:44.510
that the African population
was the population

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.620
from which everybody else was derived.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.400
They have the most variation,

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.570
they've been there the longest,

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.131
accumulated the most mutations

00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:56.440
and the indigenous Americans
have been in their small group

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.452
that came across from the varying bridge.

00:08:58.452 --> 00:09:03.390
That group's only been there
in position for 15,000 years

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.360
as opposed to the 100,000 years

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.060
before the indigenous Africans left.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.130
Now to prove that, we looked at the DNA

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.150
of these peoples around the world

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.790
to find out how long the stretches of DNA,

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.680
without any variation, should be there.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:25.410
And what we see is that there
are two kinds of reasons

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:29.080
why people lack variation.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.930
One is the historical phenomenon
that I told you about,

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.580
of small population size,

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.159
that these are the
indigenous American people.

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:40.119
And the other one is a cultural phenomenon

00:09:40.119 --> 00:09:44.230
and these are all the Islamic
populations in our study

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:48.070
and they have the same
level of homozygosity,

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.960
lack of variation, as
the indigenous Americans

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.130
and the reason is,

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:57.232
these populations practice
first cousin marriages.

00:09:57.232 --> 00:10:01.070
These are highly inbred
populations from Pakistan,

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.550
Afghanistan and the Middle East.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:07.529
So the cultural explanation is
the explanation for this part

00:10:07.529 --> 00:10:09.450
and the historical explanation

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.460
is the explanation for that part.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.240
That's the demography side.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.560
Now, since that study,

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.242
there's been a 189 populations studied

00:10:20.242 --> 00:10:23.740
and I'd ask you to focus on this list.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.850
What we see here are
the indigenous Americans

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.880
and what we're looking at
here is having 5 million

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.272
nucleotides without any variation

00:10:32.272 --> 00:10:35.440
and you will see mostly
that the populations

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.040
in the Americas have a very
high rate of homozygosity.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.910
The populations of Islamic extraction

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.086
have a very high rate of homozygosity

00:10:47.086 --> 00:10:51.700
and these populations here
are really interesting,

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.690
these are the Jewish populations.

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.858
And one of those populations,
particularly interesting,

00:10:57.858 --> 00:11:02.020
this one here, that's
a population in Israel

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.760
called the Samaritans.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.060
And most of you have
heard of the Samaritans

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.806
'cause there was a good one.

00:11:07.806 --> 00:11:10.639
(audience laughs)

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.420
Now, the Samaritans are
an interesting group

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.910
because they don't believe
that they should be separated

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.814
from the other Israelites.

00:11:20.814 --> 00:11:22.970
They have a very interesting history.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.550
This is the high priest of the Samaritans.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.490
Currently there are about 850 of them,

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.310
half live in the center of Tel Aviv

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:34.640
and half live in a
village in the West Bank.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.600
But in 1917 there were
150 Samaritans left.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:45.370
They spoke Aramaic and
they did not believe

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:49.360
in any of the Bible, except
the five books of Moses.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.480
The rest of it, the
prophets and the writings,

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.050
they didn't care about.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.250
And part of the reason is their history.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:01.260
This is the Assyrian Empire
between 900 and 607 BC

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:04.820
And this is the history.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.276
Everybody can read this for themselves.

00:12:07.276 --> 00:12:09.565
(audience laughs)

00:12:09.565 --> 00:12:12.607
This is called the Nimrud Prism
in which Emperor Sargon II,

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.770
who conquered the
Northern Kingdom of Israel

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:20.560
in the year 722 BC,
wrote down what he did.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.290
And this is the story.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.630
Now if you want an easier bit,

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.108
you can read the translation here

00:12:27.108 --> 00:12:30.800
that he tells that he took out the people

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.530
as was his custom, from
the Northern Kingdom,

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:35.960
moved them to what is now Iraq

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:40.450
and replaced them with people
who he already had conquered.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:41.790
And this was his pattern.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:46.869
However the Samaritans
believe that they descend

00:12:46.869 --> 00:12:48.990
from people who never left,

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.460
that they are the
descendants of the children

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:55.380
of Manasseh and Ephraim, two
of the children of Joseph,

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.310
two sons of Joseph, and they never left.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.190
Now the Bible actually has a contradiction

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.400
about these people because
if you look at the big

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.858
Book of Kings, it says exactly
what the Nimrud Prism says,

00:13:05.858 --> 00:13:10.230
that the king of Assyria
brought men from Babylon

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.490
and these other places

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:14.040
and placed them in the cities of Samaria

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.740
instead of the children of Israel.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:20.080
Unfortunately, the Chronicles
says exactly something else

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.930
because Hezekiah is the
king of the Solomonic Empire

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:28.330
and this is in the year 700,

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.400
this is after the conquest.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.130
So if the Israelites had
been taken over and left

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:35.220
and there were none there,

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.960
why would he would be
writing to Israel and Judah

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.910
and the children of Ephraim and Menassah

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:45.050
and asking them to come to
Jerusalem to keep The Passover?

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.640
So there's a contradiction there.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:48.940
And the scholars say,

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.250
oh Chronicles is written
a lot longer after,

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:55.830
it goes to about 400 BC
and the Book of Kings

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.630
is really kosher, we've
gotta believe that one,

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:01.769
so either way, there's
something to explain here

00:14:01.769 --> 00:14:05.890
and so we tried to explain it.

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:09.929
Being a Samaritan is passed
down along the male line.

00:14:09.929 --> 00:14:12.680
Male Samaritans can marry anybody,

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.760
and the children is a Samaritan.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.300
There are only four families.
Cohen, Joshua-Marhiv,

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:22.740
Danfi and Tsedaka and they are endogamous,

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.873
they marry within the line.

00:14:24.873 --> 00:14:27.840
So it's not unexpected

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.340
that they have the highest
inbreeding coefficient

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.180
of any population in the world.

00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:35.180
They're the only population that I know of

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.930
where a 1/4 of the mothers and sisters

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.690
of colorblind men are also colorblind.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:43.390
Because as you know,
colorblindness is usually in males.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.110
So the Samaritans are
really quite interesting

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:50.370
but as a consequence of
this cultural phenomenon

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:53.300
of preferring to marry within the line,

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.780
within the marriage line, they
have these genetic properties

00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.560
which we can get at by
looking at the Y chromosome

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.400
because the descending gene
which defines you as a Samaritan

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.270
is your Y chromosome,

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:11.165
because only males can pass
being a Samaritan down.

00:15:11.165 --> 00:15:12.380
So we did that,

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.870
we looked at the Y
chromosomes of the Samaritans

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.360
and compared them to all
the other populations

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.928
of Jewish people in Israel

00:15:20.928 --> 00:15:25.928
and in addition to Palestinian
and to Ethiopian Jews

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:29.690
and to Druze and Bedouins
and low and behold,

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:34.140
they're the closest by
far to today's Cohens

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:39.140
and Cohens are the high
priests of the Jewish religion.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:44.190
So it turns out that
Samaritans are actually related

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:48.670
closer to the Jewish people
and they're Israelites.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.850
They must be Israelites to
have this close relationship

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.580
on the Y chromosome.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.924
If you study mitochondrial DNA,

00:15:55.924 --> 00:15:59.070
it's a totally different
story because the women

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:02.700
are coming from everywhere,
they're not from Samaritans.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.730
So you won't see anything
like this, which we did.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.290
Which is an interesting phenomenon.

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:10.773
So the culture has again
defined the pattern

00:16:10.773 --> 00:16:12.730
of genomic variation.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:14.920
Why did this happen?

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:19.080
Well, this guy, Josephus,
an interesting fellow

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.690
who was hated by the
Jews at the time because

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.700
he was a turncoat.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.200
He joined the Romans and became a writer

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.300
and reporter for the Romans.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.470
And the Romans who were in
Israel and destroying the temple,

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.392
and particularly attached
himself to Vespasian

00:16:35.392 --> 00:16:38.570
who destroyed the temple in the year 70.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.850
And he writes about a time of history,

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.910
300 or 400 years before him

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:49.560
and he mentions Sanballetes
who is that Persian governor

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:54.360
of Samarian Judea and
Manasses who was the brother

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.950
of the high priest in Jerusalem.

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:58.570
Now he'd have to be a Cohen

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:01.870
because only Cohens were high priests.

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:05.770
And Josephus says that
Sanballetes gave Manasses

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:10.370
his daughter and along with
other of the high priests,

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:15.370
they converted to become
essentially Jewish Samaritans.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.140
So they were Cohens.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.530
So the male lineage descends,
according to Josephus,

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:24.540
from that line.

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.180
So we don't know whether
there's any truth to this.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:32.790
This is the only evidence that
I and my religious scholars

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:36.370
have been able to find
to say why the Samaritans

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:38.800
should be related to the Cohens,

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.840
the high priests of the Jewish religion.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.810
Now my final example of
how culture affects genes

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:51.810
concerns the Canadian fur
trade and tuberculosis.

00:17:51.917 --> 00:17:55.920
This is a pattern of the global
incidence of tuberculosis

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.170
rates from the United Nations documents.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.210
It hasn't changed much since then.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:03.470
Maybe gotten a little
worse down here in Africa,

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.030
southern Africa with the advent of HIV.

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:11.110
This is a story from the famous book

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:14.000
written by Ferguson in 1928

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.880
about how many deaths occurred from TB

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.642
in indigenous Canadian populations.

00:18:20.642 --> 00:18:25.642
And these two peaks which
tell you over 10%, maybe 14%

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:31.676
of indigenous Americans in
Canada died in those times.

00:18:31.676 --> 00:18:35.760
They died because they
were put into reservations

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:40.415
and the reservations were
extremely badly designed.

00:18:40.415 --> 00:18:45.329
The people were dying like
flies, of infectious diseases.

00:18:45.329 --> 00:18:47.790
They had no blankets, no ventilation.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:52.673
So the question is, if these
people had that problem

00:18:52.673 --> 00:18:57.440
then why is it the case that
so many indigenous Americans

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.130
in that part of Canada died?

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:02.100
This lady who's pictured here

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.440
in the canoe of the fur traders

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.700
going down this long river here,

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.493
this river zone here, from Quebec,

00:19:09.493 --> 00:19:13.620
we found out that if we
actually looked at the DNA

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:18.420
of the bacterium that was in
the Canadian indigenous peoples

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.410
it was exactly the same DNA

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.900
that was in the people from Quebec.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.540
Those people, the French Canadians,

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:31.120
were in the North West fur trading company

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.570
and the French had a different
culture from the British.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:37.050
The French cohabited with
the indigenous people

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.650
and they passed on their TB bacteria.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:41.230
The British never homesteaded,

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:43.660
they never passed on anything,

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.550
they were hands off the indigenous people.

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:50.470
So what we see is this
culture of cohabiting

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:51.790
with the indigenous people,

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:54.960
that the French Canadian fur trappers did,

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.690
was the reason why that bacterium

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:02.690
passed these 1,500 kilometers
into the indigenous people.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:07.140
So in conclusion, it's obvious

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.003
that if you look at the cultural

00:20:09.003 --> 00:20:12.940
context around these human behaviors

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.840
and the variation of the DNA,

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.710
you can see that you can't
say that it's the DNA

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.470
that's causing these variations.

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:22.745
Thank you.

00:20:22.745 --> 00:20:25.745
(audience applauds)

00:20:28.991 --> 00:20:31.574
(upbeat music)
