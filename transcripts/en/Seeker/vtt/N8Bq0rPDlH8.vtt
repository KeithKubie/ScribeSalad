00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.430
What might aliens look like?

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.980
Nothing like us, possibly.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.140
Hey guys, Amy here with DNews.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.139
We haven’t found extraterrestrial life just
yet, but that might be because we’re looking

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.830
for entirely the wrong thing.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.560
Let’s start with a recap of life as we know
it on Earth.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.250
Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus
and sulfur are the six basic building blocks

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.619
of all life forms on Earth, at least that
we know of.

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.960
Phosphorus is an integral part of DNA and
RNA, the structures that carry all the genetic

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.189
instructions for life.

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.579
Carbon, meanwhile, is the main component of
sugars, proteins, fats, DNA, muscle tissue…

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.730
pretty much everything that makes up your
body.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.330
Life on Earth also requires something called
a phospholipid bilayer membrane, a strong,

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.829
permeable, water-based membrane that houses
the organic matter inside every cell, vesicles

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.170
made of which are called liposomes.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.070
So these are the things astronomers look for
on other planets and in alien environments

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.070
to find life.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.450
And because all life on Earth needs water,
we tend to look for water in the search for

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.620
extraterrestrial life.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:07.630
But there’s increasingly more research to
suggest that life on other worlds won’t

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.270
necessarily have the same makeup as life does
here.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.159
In 2010, a team of researchers released a
study saying they’d discovered the first

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.170
known microorganism able to thrive and reproduce
using arsenic, a toxic chemical.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.189
In a laboratory setting, researchers successfully
grew a strain of Gammaproteobacteria microorganisms

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:29.399
on a diet lean on phosphorus and heavy on
arsenic before removing the phosphorous entirely.

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:30.700
The microbes didn’t die.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.170
Instead, they thrived, with later generations
substituting arsenic for phosphorus in its

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.130
DNA and other cellular components.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.889
The arsenic became a building block for a
new strain of cells.

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:44.049
When this news came out it was massively exciting
for the astrobiology and space world, but

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.819
the discovery was eventually debunked.

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:49.630
The phosphate-free medium in which the microbes
thrived with arsenic in their DNA turned out

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.700
to have just enough phosphate in it to support
life as we know it.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.789
But it didn’t turn out to be the nail in
the coffin of finding interesting alien life.

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.450
Just last month, scientists at Cornell University
modeled a cell that could exist on Saturn’s

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.450
moon Titan.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.329
Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, has a thick
atmosphere, liquid ethane and methane seas,

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.799
and organic-rich chemistry somewhat reminiscent
of a frozen early Earth.

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.280
Titan couldn’t support organic cells as
they exist on Earth, but it could support

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.450
methane-based, oxygen-free cells.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.140
The researchers theorized a cell membrane
called an “azotosome.”

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.390
It’s a membrane analogous to the liposomes
we know exist in Earthly life; it has the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.120
same stability and flexibility.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.299
But these azotosomes are made from nitrogen,
carbon and hydrogen molecules, molecules we

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.850
know exist in Titan’s seas.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.090
So it’s possible that carbon-free life could
exist on Titan, or else on some exoplanet

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.950
or exomoon with a similar structure.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.920
So, to be fair, the arsenic-based bacteria
was eventually disproved and the possible

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.299
cell that could exist on Titan is only a model.

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.950
But still, the definition of life keeps expanding
and that makes the ongoing search for extraterrestrial

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.790
life that much more interesting.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.630
And switching gears just a little, we are
really happy that our new channel Seeker launched

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.630

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.299
Here on DNews, we take a look at the news
from a science angle, and they take a look

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.090
at the news from a human side!

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:12.239

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.230
So what do you guys think about non carbon-based
life forms?

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.749
Cool science fact or unlikely science fiction?
