00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.302
The next childhood disorder we'll discuss is Autism spectrum disorder. Formally

00:00:05.302 --> 00:00:10.102
known simply as Autism. Autism Spectrum Disorder or ASD is characterized by

00:00:10.102 --> 00:00:14.449
severe language and social impairment in combination with repetitive habits and

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:20.819
inward focused behaviors. Autism behaviors vary on the continuum from severe

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:25.640
disability to high-functioning. For example, children with a high-functioning

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.550
type of autism may have social impairment and skills impairment. But they may

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.559
also have more advanced speech capability as well as an above-average

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.402
intelligence. Hanz Asberger was the first to describe his high functioning type

00:00:38.402 --> 00:00:44.010
of autism and it was since termed Asberger's Syndrome. However, under the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.530
current DSM, Asberger Syndrome is no longer under it's own diagnostic criteria.
