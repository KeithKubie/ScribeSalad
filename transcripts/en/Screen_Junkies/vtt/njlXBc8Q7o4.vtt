00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.440
The following trailer is rated 'S' for spoilers.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.160
From Ridley Scott, one of the best directors working today,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.120
And also, one of the worst,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.040
comes the sixth film in the franchise that makes it official,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.740
there are now more bad Alien movies than good ones.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.260
Wah-wah.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:38.580
When Ridley Scott wanted to wank about the meaning of life for two hours, he gave us Prometheus.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.780
Now, he's back with a good old fashioned Alien flick, that returns to its sci-fi horror roots.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.360
Until it takes a sharp left turn into the same wank job territory as the last one.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.840
"My name is Ozymandias. King of kings. Look up my works, ye mighty and despair."

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.220
Save the android poetry for Blade Runner, damn it.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.700
I want the short-hair girl, in a tank top, fighting a xenomorph, who kills it by sucking it in the vacuum of space!

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.000
Now that's the Alien I remember!

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.300
In a franchise, full of unforgettable characters, experience a chapter where no one stands out.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.160
Except maybe Kenny Powers.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.040
"Let's party."

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.260
'laughs"

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.720
And meet the crew of the Covenant, married couples who you completely forget are married, until someone says "My wife."

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.460
"Never heard my wife scared before."

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.120
"Behave yourself with my wife."

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.200
"I'm good with my wife's tits."

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.300
Cheer, as this gaggle of idiots, are picked off one by one for their terrible decisions.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.280
Like, aborting their mission, because they heard a John Denver song.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.560
(singing) "Take me home.."

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.780
"That's f**king John Denver!"

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.320
Not wearing protection on a foreign planet.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.580
Opening quarantine rooms with killer aliens in them.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.120
Shooting at your own fuel tanks.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.060
Having shower sex in a horror movie.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.060
Slipping in the same blood puddle,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.940
(screams)

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.560
twice.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.840
(screams)

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.680
Trusting a robot who clearly loves aliens.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.260
"NOOO!"

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.360
And sticking your face over an alien egg, because that same robot told you to!

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.340
"Take a look."

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.720
Why would you look in the egg??!!

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.980
You know, maybe these aren't colonists.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.300
Maybe Earth has a secret program to deport the world's biggest morons.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.340
Forget the humans, as you spend most of your time in freshman philosophy class,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.520
with the androids Walter and David.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.040
Michael Fassbender, jacked and josed, as both characters,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.720
playing two slight variations on a pretentious literature professor.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.640
"Who wrote Ozymandias?"

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.980
"Byron."

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.340
"Shelley."

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.260
Who are both so full of themselves, they literally can't keep their fingers off each other's flute.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:58.560
(flute playing)

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.140
Wow, this is a long flute sequence.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.320
(flute STILL playing)

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.180
Seriously, so much flute.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.680
(DO YA LIKE FLUTE?)

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.420
I did not expect to associate the Alien franchise with flute playing, but, well, here we are.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.660
Might as well enjoy it.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.080
"Watch me. I'll do the fingering. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.300
(laughs)

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.880
Experience a bad sci-fi script in the hands of a visual genius.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.100
As you soak up, shot, after epic shot.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.460
While ignoring how all the tech looks way more advanced in this prequel.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.660
And thrill as CGI lets you finally see the xenomorphs move around..in full daylight.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.900
Which just looks..wrong.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.120
It's like seeing Batman at the beach.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.040
What's next, CGI Ripley?

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.160
NOOOO!!! (not another Rogue One, please)

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.020
So enjoy a film, that wants you to ask questions, like,

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.800
Who are we?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.560
And, why are we here?

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.860
But will have you asking questions like, why should I care?

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.300
Why are critical plot scenes on YouTube and not in the movie?

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.460
And, wait, how many more of these are they gonna make?

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.380
As this latest installment, gives Alien the same prestige as The Terminator franchise.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.760
In that the first two are classics, and it's all been downhill from there.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.240
"Nice to see you."

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.820
(ALIEN 6: MORE DAMN FLUTES)

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.360
I'll say it, best sci-fi flute work since Picard.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:05:00.420
(Flute playing, yet again)

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.520
