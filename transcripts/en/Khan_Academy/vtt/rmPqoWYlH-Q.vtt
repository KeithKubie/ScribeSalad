00:00:00.285 --> 00:00:02.483
- [Sal] I'm here with Eman El-Sheikh,

00:00:02.483 --> 00:00:05.204
Khan Academy's World History Fellow.

00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:07.232
The question I have, Eman, is,

00:00:07.232 --> 00:00:10.208
history often focuses on men,

00:00:10.208 --> 00:00:13.091
but clearly, women were
playing a significant role,

00:00:13.091 --> 00:00:16.914
but how much can we know about
women, say, 2,000 years ago?

00:00:16.914 --> 00:00:18.579
- [Eman] So, when we talk about the lives

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:21.710
of women in the Classical Period,

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.957
sometimes we're tempted to
compare it to the modern day,

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:26.419
and that can cause some problems

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.447
because that's not
really a fair comparison.

00:00:28.447 --> 00:00:31.328
So it's more useful to
see how different women

00:00:31.328 --> 00:00:32.912
living in different societies

00:00:32.912 --> 00:00:35.885
in the same time period
compare to one another.

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:37.959
That can make their
differences a lot more salient

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:40.071
and give us a better idea.

00:00:40.071 --> 00:00:42.141
Of course, it's hard to know the history

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:43.887
of women back then in general.

00:00:43.887 --> 00:00:46.452
We don't necessarily have
all the best sources.

00:00:46.452 --> 00:00:49.136
But we can try to piece
together some understanding

00:00:49.136 --> 00:00:51.412
of what their daily lives were like.

00:00:51.412 --> 00:00:52.796
- [Sal] We have two
points of reference here;

00:00:52.796 --> 00:00:56.764
one from Rome as it transitions
from republic to empire;

00:00:56.764 --> 00:00:58.470
and another from Han China.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.108
Let's look at the reference from Rome.

00:01:01.108 --> 00:01:02.517
Just for a little bit of context,

00:01:02.517 --> 00:01:03.978
this speech that we're gonna talk about,

00:01:03.978 --> 00:01:06.376
this occurs in 42 BCE.

00:01:06.376 --> 00:01:09.467
People might remember
that in 44 BCE you have

00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:12.720
Julius Caesar getting
assassinated on the Ides of March,

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.335
and it throws the Roman
Empire into a civil war.

00:01:16.335 --> 00:01:19.103
And so, this speech is
given during that civil war.

00:01:19.103 --> 00:01:21.622
Because civil wars,
they're not just bloody,

00:01:21.622 --> 00:01:24.425
they're also expensive,
and to fund that civil war

00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:29.232
the triumvirs decide to tax
the 1400 wealthiest women.

00:01:29.232 --> 00:01:31.177
Hortensia, who gives this speech,

00:01:31.177 --> 00:01:34.084
is one of those wealthy women.

00:01:34.084 --> 00:01:37.283
- [Eman] Hortensia says:
"Why should we pay taxes

00:01:37.283 --> 00:01:39.724
"when we do not share
in the offices, honors,

00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:41.714
"military commands, nor,
in short, the government,

00:01:41.714 --> 00:01:43.084
"for which you fight between yourselves

00:01:43.084 --> 00:01:44.468
"with such harmful results?

00:01:44.468 --> 00:01:46.702
"You say 'because it is wartime.'

00:01:46.702 --> 00:01:48.331
"When has there not been war?

00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:50.284
"and when have women paid taxes?

00:01:50.284 --> 00:01:52.237
"By nature of their sex women are absolved

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:54.755
"from paying taxes among all mankind.

00:01:54.755 --> 00:01:56.786
"Our mothers did once
rise superior to their sex

00:01:56.786 --> 00:01:58.864
"and made contributions
when you faced the loss

00:01:58.864 --> 00:02:00.941
"of the empire and the city itself

00:02:00.941 --> 00:02:02.931
"through the conflict
with the Carthaginians.

00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:05.287
"But they funded their
contributions voluntarily

00:02:05.287 --> 00:02:07.768
"from their jewelry not
from their landed property,

00:02:07.768 --> 00:02:09.953
"their fields, their
dowries, or their houses,

00:02:09.953 --> 00:02:13.326
"without which it is impossible
for free women to live...

00:02:13.326 --> 00:02:15.565
"Let war with the Celts or Parthians come,

00:02:15.565 --> 00:02:17.316
"we will not be inferior to our mothers

00:02:17.316 --> 00:02:19.512
"when it is a question of common safety.

00:02:19.512 --> 00:02:22.439
"But for civil wars,
may we never contribute

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.230
"nor aid you against each other.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.156
"We did not pay taxes
to Caesar or to Pompey,

00:02:27.156 --> 00:02:29.230
"nor did Marius ask us for contributions,

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.696
"nor Cinna, nor Sulla,

00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:33.219
"even though he was a
tyrant over this country.

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.760
"And you say that you are
reestablishing the Republic!"

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.305
- [Sal] Wow, that was quite powerful.

00:02:38.305 --> 00:02:40.993
And there's a lot of richness here.

00:02:40.993 --> 00:02:42.743
What's your takeaway?

00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:46.682
- [Eman] So, it's interesting
that she is saying that

00:02:46.682 --> 00:02:50.410
by nature of their sex women
are absolved from paying taxes.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.077
It might seem like she's
saying that women are weaker;

00:02:53.077 --> 00:02:57.244
but she's sort of speaking
back to this requirement

00:02:58.162 --> 00:03:00.927
that they should use their property.

00:03:00.927 --> 00:03:03.977
Because they're normally using
jewelry and they're normally

00:03:03.977 --> 00:03:06.375
using things that they
don't necessarily need

00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:08.408
in order to fight off foreigners.

00:03:08.408 --> 00:03:11.337
Here she's really taking issue with having

00:03:11.337 --> 00:03:14.699
to use her livelihood
to support a civil war,

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:16.733
and she's sort of taking
them to task on this,

00:03:16.733 --> 00:03:20.189
that they're worse than
tyrants for asking this of her.

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:21.568
- [Sal] The other thing
that jumps out of this,

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:22.761
it comes outta the first few statements,

00:03:22.761 --> 00:03:24.581
"Why should we pay taxes
when we do not share

00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:26.493
"in the offices, honors,
military commands,

00:03:26.493 --> 00:03:27.674
"nor, in short, the government."

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:30.226
She's making very clear, women
don't get to participate.

00:03:30.226 --> 00:03:32.328
Why should we fund this war?

00:03:32.328 --> 00:03:33.838
I also like this part.

00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:35.542
"You say 'because it is wartime.'

00:03:35.542 --> 00:03:36.765
"When has there not been war?"

00:03:36.765 --> 00:03:38.591
That's a really good point, because Rome,

00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:41.313
especially at that point,
was continuously conquering

00:03:41.313 --> 00:03:43.010
other peoples, continuously at war,

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.409
sometimes a civil war,
sometimes an external war.

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.610
- [Eman] Sure, and I
think it's interesting how

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.965
she's pointing to that disparity between

00:03:49.965 --> 00:03:51.917
the things that men have
and women don't have.

00:03:51.917 --> 00:03:53.889
And she's just trying to say:
"Well, if that's how it's

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.144
"going to be, then we should
also be exempt from taxation."

00:03:57.144 --> 00:04:01.382
I think that's an interesting
way to voice concerns.

00:04:01.382 --> 00:04:04.024
While this might seem very primitive

00:04:04.024 --> 00:04:05.687
to our modern sensibilities,

00:04:05.687 --> 00:04:07.644
it's really powerful that a woman

00:04:07.644 --> 00:04:10.630
is taking these government
officials to task

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.473
and being so outspoken

00:04:12.473 --> 00:04:14.796
and quite scathing in
the way she does this.

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:17.351
- [Sal] I also like the
second part right over here,

00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:21.333
where she is citing that our
mothers once also stepped up.

00:04:21.333 --> 00:04:24.330
She's referring to, during
the Second Punic War

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.216
and Hannibal was running
amuck on the Italian Peninsula

00:04:27.216 --> 00:04:30.873
and even threatening Rome
itself, that the women of Rome,

00:04:30.873 --> 00:04:32.622
especially the wealthy women of Rome,

00:04:32.622 --> 00:04:34.792
did step up and pay taxes.

00:04:34.792 --> 00:04:37.637
- [Eman] So, based on this,
Sal, what do you think we can

00:04:37.637 --> 00:04:41.804
learn about Roman women and
their lives at this time period?

00:04:43.161 --> 00:04:46.582
- [Sal] Well, as we pointed
out, even in this speech

00:04:46.582 --> 00:04:48.248
she cites some direct reference

00:04:48.248 --> 00:04:50.772
to not having equality to men.

00:04:50.772 --> 00:04:52.264
But on the other hand,

00:04:52.264 --> 00:04:54.619
she has stormed the triumvirs' tribunal.

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:56.660
I think this is the first
time that women were,

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.871
they weren't even allowed
there, they just went there,

00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:02.487
and she's sticking it to the
triumvirs pretty strongly.

00:05:02.487 --> 00:05:05.214
She's saying: "Let war with
the Celts or Parthians come,

00:05:05.214 --> 00:05:06.745
"we will not be inferior to our mothers."

00:05:06.745 --> 00:05:10.403
"We're willing to step up if
it's war with external parties.

00:05:10.403 --> 00:05:13.086
"But for civil wars,
may we never contribute

00:05:13.086 --> 00:05:14.292
"nor aid you against each other."

00:05:14.292 --> 00:05:16.153
They're saying: "Hey, if
you wanna fight yourself,

00:05:16.153 --> 00:05:17.446
"that's your problem."

00:05:17.446 --> 00:05:19.194
And she's even telling 'em: "And you say

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:20.934
"that you are reestablishing
the Republic!"

00:05:20.934 --> 00:05:22.373
She's questioning the three most

00:05:22.373 --> 00:05:24.427
powerful people in the Roman Empire.

00:05:24.427 --> 00:05:26.825
She's questioning their very intention.

00:05:26.825 --> 00:05:28.326
So it does show, at least culturally,

00:05:28.326 --> 00:05:30.915
even if officially women
do not have a strong role,

00:05:30.915 --> 00:05:35.709
at least these elite women
do have enough comfort

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:37.901
to be able to go to
the three most powerful

00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:40.015
in the Roman Empire and stick it to them.

00:05:40.015 --> 00:05:42.248
- [Eman] Yeah, and while this
may not seem like a big deal

00:05:42.248 --> 00:05:45.629
to us now, we have to avoid
that comparison, like I said.

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:47.397
If we compare it to some other societies

00:05:47.397 --> 00:05:49.635
around the same time,
this is quite remarkable

00:05:49.635 --> 00:05:51.830
for a woman to enter a public institution.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.748
Again, she is an elite woman,
but let's compare it to,

00:05:54.748 --> 00:05:57.750
say, Athenian women, even
elite woman in Athens,

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.799
were not likely to have any involvement

00:05:59.799 --> 00:06:01.304
in the political institutions,

00:06:01.304 --> 00:06:05.354
were a lot more likely to just
remain in the private sphere,

00:06:05.354 --> 00:06:07.678
were not likely to be as
educated as Roman women.

00:06:07.678 --> 00:06:10.765
And so, the fact that
Hortensia can actually

00:06:10.765 --> 00:06:13.281
enter into the space and be so outspoken

00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:16.115
is sort of evidence of
the fact that Roman women

00:06:16.115 --> 00:06:19.366
had a degree more freedom than other women

00:06:19.366 --> 00:06:21.762
who were their contemporaries
in other societies.

00:06:21.762 --> 00:06:22.857
- [Sal] Absolutely.

00:06:22.857 --> 00:06:24.383
Let's continue that comparison.

00:06:24.383 --> 00:06:27.145
We can go about 100, 150 years further

00:06:27.145 --> 00:06:29.019
in the future from Hortensia's speech.

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:31.591
Let's also go to the other side of,

00:06:31.591 --> 00:06:32.889
almost the other side of the world,

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:34.559
we'll go to eastern Asia,

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:37.404
where we are in the Eastern Han Dynasty.

00:06:37.404 --> 00:06:41.305
So here we have some text from Ban Zhao,

00:06:41.305 --> 00:06:45.292
who was a female historian,
astronomer, mathematician,

00:06:45.292 --> 00:06:49.006
Confucian, philosopher, coauthor of

00:06:49.006 --> 00:06:51.521
the official history book of Han.

00:06:51.521 --> 00:06:54.641
It's from her Lessons for Women.

00:06:54.641 --> 00:06:56.464
- [Eman] So, Ban Zhao says:

00:06:56.464 --> 00:06:58.539
"Let a woman modestly yield to others;

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:01.668
"let her respect others;
let her put others first.

00:07:01.668 --> 00:07:03.209
"Herself, last."

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:05.732
"Lay the (girl) baby
at birth below the bed

00:07:05.732 --> 00:07:08.574
"to plainly indicate that
she is lowly and weak,

00:07:08.574 --> 00:07:10.525
"and should regard it as her primary duty

00:07:10.525 --> 00:07:12.677
"to humble herself before others."

00:07:12.677 --> 00:07:16.333
"A husband can marry twice, but
his wife must never remarry.

00:07:16.333 --> 00:07:17.998
"Just as Heaven cannot be disobeyed,

00:07:17.998 --> 00:07:20.838
"so the wife cannot keep
away from her husband."

00:07:20.838 --> 00:07:22.672
"Man is honored for strength;

00:07:22.672 --> 00:07:25.714
"a woman is beautiful on
account of her gentleness."

00:07:25.714 --> 00:07:28.233
- [Sal] So what's your take on that?

00:07:28.233 --> 00:07:30.791
- [Eman] So, this is very much inline

00:07:30.791 --> 00:07:33.671
with the Confucian ideal of womanhood,

00:07:33.671 --> 00:07:35.851
and that's very much about a woman being

00:07:35.851 --> 00:07:40.849
very submissive to her male
relatives, and for her to stay

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:44.628
very modest within the power
framework of her society,

00:07:44.628 --> 00:07:47.184
and to stay pretty much
within her own household,

00:07:47.184 --> 00:07:51.351
and to cultivate a life that
is meant to create comfort

00:07:52.267 --> 00:07:54.459
for the men in her
family and her children,

00:07:54.459 --> 00:07:56.722
and not much more than that.

00:07:56.722 --> 00:07:59.195
- [Sal] Yeah, I could not
imagine anyone who read this

00:07:59.195 --> 00:08:02.074
and took it seriously as
doing a lesson for themselves

00:08:02.074 --> 00:08:04.105
and storming the triumvirs' tribunals,

00:08:04.105 --> 00:08:07.561
even if they are an elite
woman in imperial China.

00:08:07.561 --> 00:08:09.637
- [Eman] Certainly, but I think
there's an important thing

00:08:09.637 --> 00:08:12.446
to remember, and that this
kind of document shows

00:08:12.446 --> 00:08:15.184
a prescriptive approach to women's lives.

00:08:15.184 --> 00:08:16.982
And that doesn't necessarily mean

00:08:16.982 --> 00:08:18.702
that women did live this way.

00:08:18.702 --> 00:08:21.537
The fact that Ban Zhao
herself is writing this

00:08:21.537 --> 00:08:24.015
is sort of ironic
because she's a woman who

00:08:24.015 --> 00:08:26.740
is putting herself out
there and writing things

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.285
and not staying in the private sphere,

00:08:28.285 --> 00:08:30.967
so that's sort of a strange
contradiction there.

00:08:30.967 --> 00:08:33.890
But also, women who had a lot of wealth

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.165
were likely to become educated like her.

00:08:36.165 --> 00:08:40.142
And also, it sort of
depended on their generation.

00:08:40.142 --> 00:08:43.273
Older women were likely
to have inheritances,

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:45.668
property, just like
their Roman counterparts,

00:08:45.668 --> 00:08:48.098
and they were more likely
to engage in trade.

00:08:48.098 --> 00:08:50.413
We can find this out by
looking at other documents,

00:08:50.413 --> 00:08:52.036
like wills and so forth.

00:08:52.036 --> 00:08:54.429
So we can sort of see a tension between

00:08:54.429 --> 00:08:57.359
the prescriptive Confucian ideals

00:08:57.359 --> 00:08:58.988
and how women actually lived.

00:08:58.988 --> 00:09:02.651
In a lot of ways, having
wealth allowed women

00:09:02.651 --> 00:09:05.988
to buy their way out of these constrictive

00:09:05.988 --> 00:09:08.549
practices and ideas about women.

00:09:08.549 --> 00:09:09.933
- [Sal] I definitely
agree with that irony.

00:09:09.933 --> 00:09:13.650
It's quite thick here, because
she's telling other women

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.900
to indicate that she is lowly and weak,

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.378
but Ban Zhao herself, as I
mentioned, she's a historian,

00:09:18.378 --> 00:09:20.939
astronomer, mathematician,
Confucian, philosopher,

00:09:20.939 --> 00:09:23.906
she co-wrote one of the official histories

00:09:23.906 --> 00:09:27.719
of the Han empire, she's more
prominent and has done more

00:09:27.719 --> 00:09:30.891
than the great majority
of men in her time,

00:09:30.891 --> 00:09:33.002
so she's clearly not lowly and weak.

00:09:33.002 --> 00:09:34.700
So the irony is quite thick.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:35.533
- [Eman] Certainly.

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:38.233
It's interesting to look
at these things because,

00:09:38.233 --> 00:09:43.207
like you said, it gives us
a sense of the difference.

00:09:43.207 --> 00:09:45.482
There seems to be quite
a different culture

00:09:45.482 --> 00:09:48.691
at play between Rome
and China at this time.

00:09:48.691 --> 00:09:50.842
And so, making that
kinda comparison gives us

00:09:50.842 --> 00:09:53.122
a lot more information about women's lives

00:09:53.122 --> 00:09:56.330
than simply saying that
there's a single history

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.198
for all women of this time period,

00:09:58.198 --> 00:09:59.460
and that's simply not the case.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.734
As we can see, there are
huge differences between

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:04.292
the civilizations; certainly,
even within civilizations

00:10:04.292 --> 00:10:05.974
there can be huge differences.

00:10:05.974 --> 00:10:06.807
- [Sal] Yes.

00:10:06.807 --> 00:10:07.780
Both of the examples we looked at

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.563
have been very elite women.

00:10:09.563 --> 00:10:12.321
We're talking about women
well within the top 1%.

00:10:12.321 --> 00:10:14.311
If you went to more average women,

00:10:14.311 --> 00:10:15.932
their situation would
have been very different.

00:10:15.932 --> 00:10:16.765
- [Eman] Certainly.

00:10:16.765 --> 00:10:18.505
So, this idea that women
are supposed to have

00:10:18.505 --> 00:10:22.345
a nice home full of family
and stay within that,

00:10:22.345 --> 00:10:24.388
only wealthy women could
really live up to that;

00:10:24.388 --> 00:10:27.419
because if you have to leave
the house to make a living,

00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:31.076
you might not be able to
create this idyllic household

00:10:31.076 --> 00:10:33.923
full of children and spend
all your time managing that.

00:10:33.923 --> 00:10:35.830
So that's an important
difference, as well.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:36.945
- [Sal] Thanks, Eman.
This was really valuable.

00:10:36.945 --> 00:10:37.778
- [Eman] Thanks, Sal.
