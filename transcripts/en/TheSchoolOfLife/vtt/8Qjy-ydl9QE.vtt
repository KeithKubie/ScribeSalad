00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:08.100
It happens pretty much all the time: a small jabbing comment, a joke at our expense amidst a group of old friends,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.280
a line of sarcasm, a sneering assessment, a provocative comment on the Internet.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.200
These things hurt a lot, more than we're ever allowed to really admit.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.780
In the privacy of our minds, we search for explanations, but anything satisfying and soothing is usually hard to come by

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.660
which is left a puzzle at the casual in humanity that circulates all around us

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.480
and suspect that perhaps it's we who are somewhere deep down

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.120
to blame for falling victim to it.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.480
Here is what we should actually think:

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.800
a truth as basic as it is inviolable. Other people have been nasty because they are in pain.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.460
The only reason they have hurt us is because they are somewhere deep inside hurting themselves.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.720
They've been catty and derogatory and foul because they are not well.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.200
However outwardly confident they may look, however virile and robust they may appear,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.800
Their actions are all the evidence we need that they cannot in truth be in a good place.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.760
No one solid would ever need to do this.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.160
The thought is empowering because nastiness so readily humiliates and reduces us.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.320
It turns us into the small damaged party. Without meaning to, we begin to imagine

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.680
our bully as potent and even somehow impressive.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.320
Their vindictiveness demeans us.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.200
But the psychological explanation of evil at once reverses the power dynamic.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.760
It's you who has no need to belittle, who is in fact a larger, steelier, more forceful party.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.480
You, who feel so defenseless, who is all along actually in power.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.280
The thought restores justice. It promises that the guilty party has after all been punished along the way.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.120
You might not have been able to write the scales personally,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.960
they left the room already or kept the conversation flowing too fast for you to protest

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.480
and in any case, you're not a sort to make a fuss.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.960
But, a kind of punishment has been delivered cosmically already.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.280
Somewhere behind the scenes, their suffering of which their needs to inflict suffering on others

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:18.240
is simply incontrovertible evidence, is all you need to know that they have been served their just desserts.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:25.540
You move from being a victim of crime to being an audience to an abstract form of justice.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.820
They may not be apologizing to you but they haven't escaped freely either.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.880
Their suffer is proof: they are paying a heavy price.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.020
This isn't merely a pleasant story. A person who feels at ease with themselves can have no need to distress others.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.140
We don't have the energy to be cruel unless and until we are in inner torment.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.540
Along they way, the theory gives hints at how we might when we're recovered

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.780
from the blow deal with those who dealt it.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.860
The temptation is to get stern and cruel back

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.940
but the only way to diminish the vicious cycle of hate is of course to address its origins which lie suffering.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.040
There is no point punching back.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.580
We much as the old prophets always told us:

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.300
Learn to look upon our enemies with sorrow, pity,

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.660
and, when we can manage it a forgiving kind of love.
