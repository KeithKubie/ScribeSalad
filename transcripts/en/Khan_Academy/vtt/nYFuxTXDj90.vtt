00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:05.170
We finished off the last
video in the Hadean Eon.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.120
It was named for Hades or
the ancient Greek underworld.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.900
Hades is also the
name of the god that

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.970
ran the Greek underworld,
Zeus's oldest brother.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.210
And it was an appropriate
name, although the idea of,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.960
the ancient Greek
notion of the underworld

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.160
isn't exactly the more
modern notion of Hell.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.450
But it was a
hellish environment.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.090
You had all this
lava flowing around.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.840
You had things impacting
the Earth from space.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.570
And as far as we
can tell right now,

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.110
it was completely
inhospitable to life.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.570
And to make matters worse,
even though the Earth started

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.120
to cool down a little
bit, maybe the crust

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.850
became a little bit more solid.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.510
Maybe the collisions started
to happen less and less,

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.120
as we started to go a few
hundred million years fast

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.740
forward.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.110
After the Theia rammed
into the early earth

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.350
and formed the moon, there was
something called the Late Heavy

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.180
Bombardment.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.880
And right now, the consensus
is that life, whatever

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.470
we are descended
from, would have

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.190
had to come about after
the Late Heavy Bombardment.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.847
Because this was a time where
so many things from outer space

00:01:06.847 --> 00:01:09.430
were hitting Earth, that it was
so violent, that it might have

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.820
killed off any kind of
primitive, self-replicating

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.550
organisms or molecules that
might have existed before it.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.500
And I won't go into the physics
of the Late Heavy Bombardment.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.040
But we believe that it happened,
because Uranus and Neptune--

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.450
so if this is the sun right
here-- that is the sun.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.970
This is the asteroid belt.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.730
That's outside the orbits
of the inner, rocky planets.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:41.282
That Uranus and Neptune,
their orbits moved outward.

00:01:41.282 --> 00:01:42.990
And I'm not going to
go into the physics.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.270
But what that caused
is, gravitationally, it

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.070
caused a lot of the asteroids
in the asteroid belt

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.640
to move inward and start
impacting the inner planets.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.570
And of course, Earth was
one of the inner planets.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.645
And I should make the sun like
orange or something, not blue.

00:01:59.645 --> 00:02:01.270
I don't want you to
think that's Earth.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.430
And it also impacted the moon.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.846
And it's more
obvious on the moon,

00:02:03.846 --> 00:02:06.270
because the moon does
not have an atmosphere

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.320
to kind of smooth
over the impact.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.070
So the consensus is that
only after the Late Heavy

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.440
Bombardment was Earth
kind of ready for life.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.770
And we believe
that the first life

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.400
formed 3.824 billion years ago.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.549
Remember, g for giga,
for billion years ago.

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.340
And when we talk about
life at this period,

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.450
we're not talking about
squirrels or panda bears.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.830
We're talking about
extremely simple life forms.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.470
We're talking about prokaryotes.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.700
And let me give you a little
primer on that right now,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.050
though we go into much more
detail in the biology playlist.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.210
We're talking about prokaryotes.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.443
And I'll compare
them to eukaryotes.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.850
Prokaryotes are,
for the most part,

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.340
unicellular organisms
that have no nucleuses.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.259
They also don't have
any other membrane-bound

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:05.675
what we call organelles or
these little parts of the cells

00:03:05.675 --> 00:03:08.860
that perform specific
functions, like mitochondria.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.340
So their DNA is just
kind of floating around.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.030
So let me draw this
character's DNA.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.880
So it's just floating
around, just like that.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.820
And prokaryote literally
means before kernel

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.570
or before a nucleus.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.460
Eukaryotes do have a nucleus,
where all of their DNA is.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.690
So this is the nuclear membrane.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.480
And then all of its DNA is
floating inside of the nucleus.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.470
And then it also has other
membrane-bound organelles.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.054
Mitochondria is kind of
the most famous of them.

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:42.720
So it also has things
like mitochondria.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.340
We'll learn more about
that in future videos.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.170
Mitochondria, we
believe, is essentially

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.130
one prokaryote crawling inside
of another prokaryote and kind

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.390
of starting to become
a symbiotic organism

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.212
with each other.

00:03:55.212 --> 00:03:56.670
But I won't go into
that right now.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.461
But when we talk about
life at this period,

00:03:58.461 --> 00:04:00.010
we're talking about prokaryotes.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.860
And we still have
prokaryotes on the planet.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.600
Bacteria and archaea are
examples of prokaryotes.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.800
And just to give you a little
bit of a tidbit right here,

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.160
this kind of shows our
current understanding

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.990
of where we think things
branched off from.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.260
So at this point of the
tree is some common ancestor

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.019
to prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.550
So these are the
prokaryotes right

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.510
over here, the bacteria
and the archaea.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.720
And here is the eukaryote.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.890
And this first living
thing, or this first set

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.780
of living things, we
think might have just

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.280
been some type of
self-replicating molecules.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.800
And slowly, some membrane
might have come around,

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.900
and it became a little
bit more organized.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.670
DNA, RNA-- maybe RNA was that
original self-replicating

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.310
molecule-- became
the method of kind

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.159
of transmitting information
from one generation to the next.

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:52.700
So it's really still
an open question

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.100
of exactly what
that first life is

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.180
or even how do you
define that first life.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.930
But based on studying the
genetic makeup of molecules

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.830
of current organisms, this is
how we think the tree of life

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.640
came about.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.890
So we have one common ancestor.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.130
Then they broke apart.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.900
And then the archaea
and eukaryotes

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.215
have a common ancestor that's
different from the bacteria.

00:05:15.215 --> 00:05:17.090
And we'll talk more
about that in the future.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.173
And this right here, just
so you can visualize it,

00:05:19.173 --> 00:05:20.970
this is an example of bacteria.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.465
This is E. coli Or
Escherichia coli.

00:05:23.465 --> 00:05:24.840
It's just an
example of bacteria.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.506
It comes in a bunch
of shapes and forms.

00:05:26.506 --> 00:05:29.670
But it's a
prokaryotic life form.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.260
And the earliest life forms,
we also think were anaerobes.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.070
These are things
that did not-- one,

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.400
that they did not need oxygen.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.920
And they, for the most part,
found oxygen poisonous.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.400
And the earliest life
forms also probably

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.320
did not perform photosynthesis.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.480
They might have gotten their
energy from other sources,

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.470
chemically, from this kind of
extremely volatile environment

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.786
that they were in at that time.

00:05:54.786 --> 00:05:57.160
So if we fast forward a little
bit-- and this is actually

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.750
a major event in the
history of Earth.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.230
And these are huge time
scales we're talking about.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.370
Remember, I'm kind of
just nonchalantly saying,

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.880
oh, 4.6 billion years
ago to 3.8 billion.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.340
Oh, that's just
800 million years.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.850
Remember-- and I'll
talk about this.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.720
Grass has only existed
for 50 million years.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.770
This is 800 million years.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.770
Humans and chimpanzees only
diverged 5 million years ago.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.950
This is 800 million years
we're talking about,

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.650
from ancient Greece
to now, we're

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.390
only talking about 2,500 years.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.000
You multiply that
times 1,000, you

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.840
get 2 and 1/2 a million years.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.890
And this is 800 million
years we're talking about.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.846
So these are extremely
huge periods of time.

00:06:46.846 --> 00:06:48.220
And that's why we
call them eons.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.510
Eons are 500 million
to a billion years.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.760
Now, the dividing line between
the Hadean Eon and the Archean

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.860
Eon-- and it's kind of
a fuzzy dividing line,

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.500
but most people place it
about 3.8 billion years ago.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.380
It's kind of the earliest
rocks that we can observe.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:13.071
And so we have rocks from, that
are roughly 3.8 billion years

00:07:13.071 --> 00:07:13.570
ago.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.747
So we kind of put that as the
beginning of the Archean Eon.

00:07:16.747 --> 00:07:18.080
And so there's two things there.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.300
One, rocks have survived from
the beginning of the Archean

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.960
Eon.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.190
And also, that's
roughly when we think

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.790
that the first life existed.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.310
And so we're now
in the Archean Eon.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.760
And you might say,
oh, maybe Earth

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.290
is a more pleasant place now.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.400
But it would not be.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.150
It still has no to little
oxygen in the environment.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:39.870
If you were to go to
Earth at that time,

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.578
it might have looked
something like this.

00:07:41.578 --> 00:07:44.240
It would have a
been a reddish sky.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.251
You would have had nitrogen
and methane and carbon dioxide

00:07:47.251 --> 00:07:48.000
in the atmosphere.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.120
There would have been
nothing for you to breathe.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.882
There still would have been
a lot of volcanic activity.

00:07:52.882 --> 00:07:55.090
This right here, these are
pictures of stromatolites.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.104
And these are
formed from bacteria

00:08:04.104 --> 00:08:05.770
that are bringing in
sediment particles.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.270
And over time, these
things get built up.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:12.130
But the most significant
event in the Archean period,

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.300
at least in my
humble opinion, was

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.120
what we believe
started to happen

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.760
about 3.5 billion years ago.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.690
And this is prokaryotes,
or especially bacteria,

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:28.760
evolving to actually
utilize energy from the sun,

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.030
to actually do photosynthesis.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.490
And the real fascinating
byproduct of that,

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.940
other than the fact that they
can now use energy directly

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.299
from the sun, is that it
started to produce oxygen,

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:48.100
so starts to produce oxygen.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.270
And at first, this
oxygen, even though it

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.960
was being produced
by the cyanobacteria,

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.760
by this blue-green
bacteria, it really

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.260
didn't accumulate
in the atmosphere.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.810
Because you had all
of this iron that

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.460
was dissolved in the oceans.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.390
And let me be clear.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.120
All of the life that we're going
to be talking about for really

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.480
the next several billion years,
it all occurred in the ocean.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.610
We had no ozone layer now.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.130
The land was being irradiated.

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:15.810
The land was just a completely
inhospitable environment

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:16.680
for life.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.770
So all of this was
occurring in the ocean.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.340
And so the first
oxygen that actually

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:25.460
got produced, it actually,
instead of just being released

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.360
into the atmosphere,
it ended up bonding

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.172
with the iron that was dissolved
in the ocean at that time.

00:09:30.172 --> 00:09:31.630
So it actually
didn't have a chance

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.280
to accumulate in the atmosphere.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.180
And when we fast forward
past the Archean period,

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.190
we're going to see, that once
a lot of that iron was oxidized

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.650
and the oxygen really
did start to get released

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.784
in the atmosphere,
it actually had--

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:46.450
it's funny to say--
a cataclysmic effect

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:51.707
or a catastrophic effect
on the other anaerobic life

00:09:51.707 --> 00:09:52.790
on the planet at the time.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:53.670
And it's funny to
say that because it

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:54.797
was a catastrophe for them.

00:09:54.797 --> 00:09:57.380
But it was kind of a necessary
thing that had to happen for us

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.050
to happen.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.080
So for us, it was a blessing
that this cyanobacteria

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.460
started to pump
out a lot of oxygen

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.182
and eventually oxidized
all of the iron

00:10:05.182 --> 00:10:07.640
and eventually released a lot
of oxygen into the atmosphere

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.220
and killed off all of
this anaerobic bacteria,

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:14.840
so that eventually we
could-- us oxygen-breathing

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.966
organisms could come about.

00:10:15.966 --> 00:10:17.756
But that's not going
to happen for a while.

00:10:17.756 --> 00:10:19.200
We still have a
few billion years

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.020
before things start
flopping around on the land.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.560
Anyway, see you
in the next video.
