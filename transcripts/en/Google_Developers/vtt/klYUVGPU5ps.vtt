TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.056
for "The Developer
Show," and this

00:00:04.056 --> 00:00:06.570
is your update on the coolest
developer news from Google

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.690
in the last week.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.090
Chrome 69 Beta has added several
new CSS features, including

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.079
conic gradients, CSS scroll
snap and display cutouts.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.560
Also included are updates to
Canvas, the DOM, and more.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.530
Take a look at the post
for all the details.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.110
You can now use Google
Cloud Services and APIs

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.960
right from JetBrains' integrated
development environment

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.510
with the Cloud Tools
for IntelliJ plugin.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.120
It lets you discover
APIs, consume them,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.850
and test against them
locally, all without having

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.200
to leave your IDE.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.730
Check out the post
for screenshots

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.560
and a link to the plugin.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.470
We recently introduced
Shielded VMs in beta,

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.480
so you can be confident
that workloads running

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.630
on Google Cloud Platform
haven't been penetrated by boot

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.569
malware or firmware root kits.

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:53.610
Head on over to the post
for more on the security

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.980
features they provide,
and how to get started.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.070
The Istio open source
project recently

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.810
reached the 1.0 milestone.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.960
Now, this is a key step toward
delivering the cloud services

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.810
platform that we discussed
at Google Cloud Next,

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.990
helping you manage your
services in a hybrid world where

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.830
some of your infrastructure runs
on VMs and some on Kubernetes.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.940
Some services run on the
cloud and some on premises.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.450
More about Istio and a link to
the project are on the post.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.460
The Nvidia Tesla P4 GPU
is now available in beta

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.410
for accelerating
virtual workstations

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.910
and ML inference
on Compute Engine.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.630
They provide a good
balance of price

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.240
to performance for remote
display applications

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.670
and real-time machine
learning inference.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.610
More details and examples
are on the post linked

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.404
in the description below.

00:01:43.404 --> 00:01:45.320

I am Timothy Jordan for
"The Developer Show."

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.820
Thanks for watching, and
we'll see you next week.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.570
Yeah, that's what I
used to say, is that--

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.890
one-take Timothy, with
five rehearsal takes.
