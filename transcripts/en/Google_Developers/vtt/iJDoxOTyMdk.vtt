ALEX FAABORG: All right,
good afternoon.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.720
Thank you coming.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.300
This is Advanced Design for
Engineers, and really glad to

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.200
have you here.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.700
Design's often broken into two
components, form and function,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.940
and this talk is no different.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.680
We're going to have Christian
Robinson presenting on form,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.200
and he designed the
Roboto typeface.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.630
And I'm going to present
on function,

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.730
on interactive design.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.410
And I got to work on Google Now,
which launched yesterday.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.660
So as you can imagine,
I'm incredibly tired.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.580
Being engineers, you guys know
how launching software isn't

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.600
making sure everything's
perfect in the end.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.050
But while I am physically
incredibly tired, I am

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.090
extremely excited to be able
to give this talk.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.230
The thing I love more than
actually doing interactive

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.030
design is teaching it, so it's
really exciting to get a room

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.240
of incredibly smart people and
to provide all of this

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.370
information to you So let's
dive into interactive.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.230
Now this is a room of engineers,
I'm assuming?

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.209
Raise your hand if you're
an engineer.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:05.840
Yep, OK.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.140
So often engineers don't have a
tremendous amount of respect

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.130
for design, and it's
not that they don't

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.960
think design's important.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.950
They realize it's critical
to the success of their

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.600
application, but the reason they
disrespect it is it's not

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.900
controllable in the way that
software is normally

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.460
controllable, and hardware,
because you're dealing with

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.420
people, and people can
be kind of random.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.150
So because you can't control
the people, you feel like

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.960
well, I'll spend more attention
on the things that I

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.410
can control, the execution time,
the amount of storage

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.970
being used, if it's crashing or
not, if it's reproducible.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.020
And it's not entirely true
that people aren't

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.010
controllable because really,
what we're fundamentally

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.820
dealing with is two

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.850
information processing machines.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.610
And that's of course, the
CPU and the brain.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.090
And in some ways, they're very
similar, they're both doing

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.830
computation, one parallel
processing, the other one

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.310
massively parallel.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.680
One's base2, the other one's
based on action potential, so

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.960
you have dramatically more
computational power.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.300
But where they start to be
different is we know exactly

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.570
how computers work.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.280
We can go back and talk to a lot
of people that were kind

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.380
of instrumental in the field,
it hasn't been that long.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.730
So computer scientists, there's
things they're still

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.990
discovering about how to make
things efficient, but it's not

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.520
like there's any part
of the machine we

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.110
don't understand yet.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.160
Whereas if you talk to someone
doing neuroscience or

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.560
cognitive science, you say,
how does the brain work?

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.960
They have to kind of shrug and
say, we're still trying to

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.440
figure that out.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.450
And that's OK.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.720
We don't have to have a complete
knowledge of how the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.370
brain works to still have
predictable results.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.900
There's enough that we
understand about it that we

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.390
can rely on to get those
predictable results.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.740
So for the purpose of this
talk, it's really kind of

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.680
dehumanizing where we're going
to treat people like

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.490
information processing
machines.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.530
You might think, well no,
I'm a special snowflake.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.520
And yes, you are.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.260
But you're also, for the
purpose of this talk, a

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
uniform snow processing
machine.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.220
So three aspects of
a great interface.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.340
First, it needs to be
self-describing.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.710
Secondly, you need to prevent
errors, and then third, make

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.500
users fast.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.070
So we're going to dive
into each of these.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.520
So starting out,
self-describing.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.540
The first thing I want to talk
about is this notion of mental

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.330
model, and a mental model is
basically a simulation of

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.200
reality inside of your mind.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.730
So to pose a question, how many
instances of this talk

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.400
are happening right now?

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.690
And of course, the
answer is one.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.910
It's right there.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.350
The photons are bouncing
off the screen at you.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.980
And when you're in a big room,
you've got the talk there, and

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.500
that's reality.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.840
But then on another side, you
have the fact that everyone is

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.280
interpreting the talk in a
simulation of the room inside

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.330
their own head.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.920
So you have all these
simulations going on, and

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.980
these are the mental models
they're building of the

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:45.610
reality around them.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.506
So this is very sort of
dystopian movie, maybe we're

00:03:48.506 --> 00:03:51.020
all in our little pods
and we don't know it.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.220
But what's important about this
is when you're dealing

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.120
with interface design, you're
not necessarily designing

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.300
reality as much as you're
designing the simulation.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.420
You're designing how people are
going to think about your

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.770
application, and how they're
going to interpret it, and if

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.980
they're going to understand
things.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.440
So looking at this just in terms
of a quick diagram, you

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.620
have the implementation, which
of course you're incredibly

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.670
familiar with, then you have
the interface, which is how

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.560
that implementation
manifests itself.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.119
What's really important is the
mental model, the simulation

00:04:18.119 --> 00:04:20.140
of the interface inside
the user's head.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.150
This is something Alan Cooper
writes a lot about in his

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.170
early work.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.160
And of course, you have
this fourth component,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.940
which is the manual.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.880
And often, the manual likes to
take the blame in email lists

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.110
or talking engineers, it's not
uncommon to run into, read the

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.610
fracking manual as kind of the
explanation of why this

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.860
doesn't work.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.890
And just passing the blame
forward if you don't want to

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.410
blame the manual, you can always
blame the users, which

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.400
maybe they're stupid, maybe
they didn't get it,

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.420
that's why it failed.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.220
And I would argue that it's
really not about the

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.250
intelligence of the user.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.780
So to quickly make that
argument, let's say we take

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.010
four geniuses, we'll just select
Einstein, Turing, Eric

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.440
Schmidt, and you.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.940
And we're going to run a lot of
experiments, so we're going

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.150
to need clones.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.790
So we start cloning all these
guys and we put them in our

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.100
deep underground lair, and now,

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.880
clones are really expensive.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.180
So we're going to have to keep
them safe, so we're going to

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.550
put them in a room like this.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.300
And the rooms are to protect
them, because clones are

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.020
expensive, but it's also to
protect them from any external

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.820
information.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.920
We want to have total control
over this experiment, right?

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.430
So every day, we bring
them into a testing

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.330
chamber, looks like this.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.930
We start to teach them,
we start to teach

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.610
them about the world.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.330
We go over various things like
traffic lights, common things

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.480
people are going to encounter,
turtles, you

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.160
get the general idea.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.760
And then once we've got that
baseline knowledge of what we

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.880
expect them to have encountered
in the world,

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.270
we're not going over any
theoretical physics or

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.170
anything, just baseline
knowledge, then we start

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.240
running our experiments, and
here's where it gets fun.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.580
So we show them a screenshot
and we say, looking at this

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.470
thing you've never seen before,
what does that button

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.580
do, and can they get it?

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.190
Can they get it right, even
though they don't have access

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.830
to anything other than what
they're seeing right here?

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.860
And they're starting to think,
well, the curvature is very

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.300
similar to the arc of the thing
that's next to it, it's

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.850
visually lighter so it feels
like it's sort of not there

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.760
like the other thing is there.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.900
There's only one of these,
and it's just the side.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.160
So they might not know for sure,
but they might start to

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.030
guess, I bet it creates
another one.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.510
Just the way that it's shaped,
the way that it's placed,

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.400
conveys those types of things.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.160
Or another example,
this one harder.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.040
You say, OK, what does
HTTPS stand for?

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.990
And there's no way they're
going to get this right

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.160
because we didn't tell
them, right?

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.410
It's jargon.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.450
It's an acronym they're
not going to get.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.570
But it's green, we did teach
them about traffic lights, and

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.110
next to a lock, a metaphor.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.230
So even if they don't get it
totally right, its sort of

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.830
placement and the various things
that it conveys, they

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.490
might get close enough to say,
well, it probably means that

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.660
this is better somehow.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.900
So they're able to bootstrap
conceptually just up enough.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.860
Or another example, this
one more visual.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.630
We bring them in and we say,
what does this application do?

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.840
And they're going to say,
it's very pretty.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.610
And then they're going to say,
I don't know, because while

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.700
this icon is pretty, also
I think, did you

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.300
work on this one?

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:30.790
MALE SPEAKER: No.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:31.930
ALEX FAABORG: All right.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.720
For the designer in the room who
worked on this, I'm sorry.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:39.090
It's a great icon, but it does
not convey to the user in this

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.490
test chamber with access to no
other knowledge, what it

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.780
actually does.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.040
It is a great application,
though.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.400
It's shipped on all the devices
you guys have, you

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:46.970
should check it out.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:47.540
I use it everyday.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.620
This is Currents.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.680
So what does this app do?

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.780
They're not going to know.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.280
So I would argue that success
in these situations, it

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.310
doesn't have to do with their
intelligence, it has to do

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.970
with access to information.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:01.680
Is that information embodied
in the thing

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.120
that they're using?

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.590
So quickly you're thinking,
all right, well, what if I

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.490
don't have this underground
testing facility?

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.200
That sounds really expensive.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.360
And that's true, and this is
controversial, it's especially

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.210
controversial for any user
researchers in the room, or

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.050
user researchers
watching later.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.970
But I would argue while it's
really, really useful to have

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.000
access to user researchers, you
don't absolutely have to

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.520
rely on them.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.590
You could just start running
user tests in your own head,

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.200
basically short-term amnesia.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.960
What you have to do is you have
to kind of encapsulate

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.909
your mind, you have to start
thinking, forgetting the

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:38.720
things that you know about your
interface, try to look at

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.000
it with fresh eyes, try to
think, OK, I've never seen

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.220
this thing before, which is hard
because you have seen it

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.620
before, really, really hard.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.080
But if you can do that, if you
can look at it with fresh eyes

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.420
and try to have all the
assumptions fall away that

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.900
you've already built up, then
you're able to do that kind of

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.180
user test just on yourself
quickly right then.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:56.950
And if you're just regularly
doing that, it's going to

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:57.935
really improve your
applications.

00:08:57.935 --> 00:08:59.830
I think this is one of the most
important things that I

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:01.040
can convey.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.860
But obviously, you're going to
be more familiar with the

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.690
underlying implementation
because you are literally

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:06.550
building it.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.620
In the case of a clock, you
are probably intimately

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.130
familiar with each of the
gears and how they fit

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.830
together and all of these
details, but you have to just

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:13.780
let that fade away.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.440
You have to think about,
OK, just the interface.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.860
Is the interface conveying
the right things?

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.190
And then beyond the interface,
the mental model.

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:21.760
How is the user simulating
this in their head?

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.140
What information are they
getting out of it?

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.920
So back to the diagram,
letting that

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.280
implementation fade away.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.130
So that's self-describing.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.790
At least, that's talking about
if something should be

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:36.230
self-describing, but how
do you pull that off?

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.743
It's one thing to say it's
important, it's another thing

00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:39.440
to tell you literally
how to do it.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.800
So there's at least five ways.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:48.840
The first one is consistency,
and this

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.760
is cheating, basically.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.960
It works great, but it's also a
kind of a tautology to say,

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.100
hey, if I design something
that's things that the user

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.420
already knows, they're going
to know how to use it.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.750
That is true.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.950
You do not have to rely on
this entirely, though.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.050
In fact, Google products are
often very different from

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.980
what's already in the
marketplace, and they still

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.820
are able to bootstrap knowledge
from users and have

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:10.390
them figure it out.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.235
I mean, in the case of Gmail,
it was sort of a radical

00:10:12.235 --> 00:10:15.380
reimagination of how email
interfaces worked, but it

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.050
still worked.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.600
And also, if everyone did
consistency all the time, we

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.320
wouldn't see dramatic innovation
in interfaces.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.560
So we're not going to focus
on this one too much.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.530
Basically, it's really useful,
and you can guarantee that

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.790
users are going to understand
your application if you focus

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:33.570
on consistency, but it's
not the only way.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:35.280
So the second one
is affordances.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.120
Let's go back to the test
chamber, and let's say one

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.510
day, they encounter this, and
they've never seen it before,

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:46.240
and they're thinking, whoa,
that's really interesting.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.720
This might actually be a way
out of the test chamber.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.240
And how are they going
to figure that out?

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.430
Everything about this design
is designed to

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.210
convey what it does.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.260
The way that the door is
recessed from the frame, the

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.350
curvature of the handle, the way
that you can just imagine

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.270
the handle rocking in.

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.990
You might not know on which side
of the door it's going to

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:09.750
open, and you might not know
what the words mean, but the

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.650
picture sure looks like yourself
and it seems to be

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:12.415
going through it.

00:11:12.415 --> 00:11:13.740
But that's sort of cheating.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.570
Just the physical design of this
has been very carefully

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.800
crafted so that when you look
at it, you understand what

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.800
it's going to do.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.340
You understand that you
need to push on it.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.270
And this is a type of thing that
we do just throughout the

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:27.780
day, constantly, where you
encounter stuff and you have

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.670
to look down and say, I'm
going to push on that.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.280
It's just this kind of thing
that cognitively, you're just

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.120
constantly doing without really
even thinking about it.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.380
And that's called an affordance,
and that's not

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.770
just in the real world, but also
in the physical world.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:42.500
All these various widgets have
these physical properties that

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.220
are baked into their
visual design.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.450
When you look at one of these,
you can very quickly infer how

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:48.930
you are going to interact
with it because of those

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:50.150
properties.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.700
The way that the circle's
slightly larger makes it seem

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.930
grabbable, the way that it's
brighter on one side implies

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:57.490
that it's been sort of filled so
it feels like a track that

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.830
you can grab this thing
and move it on.

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.360
Seeing a check box, a square
in the presence of one that

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.620
has a check box, is going to
convey that that one could

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.850
also have a check box.

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:12.200
On and off, literally writing it
on the switch is going more

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.220
towards the direction of writing
your manual on top of

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.940
it, but the visual design
conveys what it does, the same

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:17.830
with the button.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:19.010
So these are all affordances.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:22.020
Basically, an affordance is
implied physics from the

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.040
visual appearance.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.310
Moving on to the third
one, natural mapping.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.400
So let's run a quick experiment
on the audience.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.980
Say we're looking at a stove.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:37.620
So the second dial, which
burner does it control?

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:42.390
And silence, you don't know,
because there's no way to

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:42.990
figure it out.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.390
We could literally write the
glyphs on top of it, that

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.290
would help.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.730
But the thing is, writing your
manual directly on the product

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.480
is cheating.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.910
Then what if it wears off?

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.710
That's definitely one way of
doing it, but it's not a

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:56.860
natural mapping.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.910
A better UI, and this is
something that Alan Cooper

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.280
likes to talk about, is if the
dials were in that same

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.800
configuration as four things,
then it just naturally affords

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.360
which burner they control.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.420
This is also always true
of light switches.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.310
So light switches only are
frustrating when they don't

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.210
actually map in order to the
lights in the room, and if

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.840
they do map in order, you
usually just flip the right

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.240
one without even thinking
about it.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.530
If they don't, then you start
randomly hitting them to try

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:20.780
to figure it out and
getting frustrated.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.300
So this is a natural mapping.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.210
Another example, controls
in a car.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.640
I love this one, because it's
actually two natural mappings

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.210
at the same time.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.940
The first is it's directly below
the window, so it's a

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.280
sort of natural orientation to
where the window is, and also

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.960
the four controls map to the
four windows in the car.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.890
Sometimes, these are placed on
the center console, which is

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:40.390
really weird.

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:42.130
So that's in the
physical world.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.400
In terms of the virtual world,
we have things like this where

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.120
the Full Screen control has a
natural mapping to the window

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:48.940
becoming larger.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.160
It's placed on the edge.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.340
It seems to afford expanding.

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.120
In this case, the Account
Selector has a mapping to the

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.070
window, because the account
controls the window as a

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.280
whole, not an individual tab.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.170
So that's natural mapping.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:05.490
Basically, natural mapping is
correctly abstracted layout.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.340
But even better than natural
mapping is direct

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.580
manipulation.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.990
So especially in touch
interfaces, you don't want to

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:13.200
have abstraction if
you don't need it.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.380
You don't necessarily need
little Close buttons on things

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.970
because you're able to literally
directly touch the

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.090
interface, whereas in the world
of mice and keyboards,

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.310
you had to have this type
of abstraction.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.850
So for instance, closing an open
application on Android,

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:29.930
you're just swiping it away,
just as you would get rid of

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.730
something in the real world,
and that's a consistent

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:36.260
affordance throughout
platform.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.300
So going back to the stove
example, what would direct

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.060
manipulation of a stove
corner look like?

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:44.830
This is, of course, kind of
curious because now the dial

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:49.355
is the burner and it's going to
light on fire, but you can

00:14:49.355 --> 00:14:51.800
imagine maybe some kind of
gesture, or like, you create

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.932
fire, or you put it out.

00:14:53.932 --> 00:14:56.790
It would be at least very
exciting, and you'd never be

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.350
confused over which dial,
because you'd have direct

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.700
gestural control over
the burner.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.110
So that's the fourth one,
direct manipulation, no

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.220
abstraction, you actually act
on the objects themselves.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.150
Then the fifth one
is metaphor.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:12.330
So metaphor shows up a lot
in application icons.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:13.610
Basically, what you're trying
to do is you're trying to

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.640
bootstrap off of something the
user's seen, either in the

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.280
real world or in the sort of
introductory phase of our

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.720
crazy experiment.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.590
So things like telephones,
maps, various real world

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:28.130
objects, helps kind of frame
them and ground them in

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:29.435
something in reality
to explain what

00:15:29.435 --> 00:15:32.830
the application does.

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:34.690
And you don't have to go
too far with this.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:38.170
It's enough to just kind of give
them the cue as opposed

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.300
to having stitching or something
in your application,

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:41.370
unless you want to do
that because you

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:42.590
think it looks nice.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:45.590
You don't have to be super
literal, but at least draw

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.130
that kind of distinction of,
this is the object that I'm

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:49.390
conveying to you.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:52.600
And it's not just application
icons, but also it's sometimes

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.310
more fundamental things, like
we're just used to having a

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:59.670
light source which is above us,
the sun just shining in

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.620
the sky all the time, and the
way that conveys light.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.470
So when you see a button, that
light source is conveying to

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:09.930
you that this thing is convex
and you can make it concave.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.510
It looks like you
can push it in.

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.860
So it's just that kind of quick,
interactive affordance

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.920
that you're getting through your
experience with the real

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.030
world through that metaphor.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.395
And also not just small widgets
but larger ones.

00:16:21.395 --> 00:16:22.760
You know, a tab.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.620
If you have that sort of same
curvature and angle, people

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.260
are going to be immediately
thinking of physical folders

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.530
they've seen in the
real world.

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:32.310
So major structural components
are going to be part of your

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:33.820
interface as well.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:38.040
So metaphor is basically
abstract consistency.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.860
So those are the five parts
about making it

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.790
self-describing.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:42.930
So let's move onto the
next one, which

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:45.320
is preventing errors.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.940
So the first one I want to talk
about is mode errors.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.080
Obviously, engineering audience,
so how many people

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.705
think vi is better than Emacs?

00:16:53.705 --> 00:16:54.970
Actually not that
many, all right.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:56.610
Emacs versus vi?

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:57.690
Better?

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:02.830
So vi has a tremendous number of
mode errors because you are

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.400
in either insertion mode
or command mode.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.150
And I say it has the mode
errors, because you could

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.710
blame the user.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.520
I mean, it is their job to
maintain state in their head

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.970
of what's going on.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:15.780
But maybe they got an email
or something, things are

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.869
distracting them, they're
thinking about their day.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:19.670
Next thing you know, they're
entering commands when they

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:21.030
want to be entering text.

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:22.740
It's a classic example
of a mode error.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.650
Another example, you're in
your car, put the car in

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:30.530
reverse, it checks on messages,
then floor it.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:33.460
You don't have that mental state
of what mode the car was

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.380
it right then, or even just if
your garage door is up or

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:39.210
down, the occasional
mode error.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.540
So to avoid these, you want
to make sure that your

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:45.130
application doesn't have modes
unless absolutely necessary.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.850
And if you do have
a mode, there's a

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:48.960
couple ways to fix it.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.340
If you have a mode where the
user is actually actively

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.990
doing something, it's
considerably more useful.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:56.340
So like keyboard shortcuts, you
have that muscle memory of

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.650
sort of pushing the key in, as
you're in the Command mode,

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:02.490
once the keyboard shortcut
accelerator is invoked, so

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.070
you're not going to have mode
errors because you're actually

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:05.070
doing something.

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:08.220
If you have a very strong visual
change on the screen

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.100
during a mode--

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.020
imagine there was something
obvious to indicate this was

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.610
in Command mode--

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:14.450
that would help.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:16.360
But generally speaking, you want
to try to avoid modes as

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.890
much as possible, because
otherwise you're going to have

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:19.810
mode errors.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:23.320
Next one, reasonably
obvious, data loss.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.070
It's often the user's fault, you
want to protect them from

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.320
themselves.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.590
Google Docs does a really good
job with preventing data loss

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:33.730
where it's reasonably hard to
lose data with Google Docs.

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:36.090
You have to sort of type the
most important thing in the

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.390
world, pull the ethernet cable,
and knock the computer

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:42.350
off a cliff all in one gesture,
and it's hard.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:46.930
Android phones, also really
useful, where all the data on

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:48.860
the phone is going to be backed
up into the cloud and

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.920
secured in your account, so
you're not going to lose all

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.170
of that really important
information.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.290
So that's just some examples
of preventing data loss.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:00.076
Also really important as people
move between devices is

00:19:00.076 --> 00:19:02.590
to have access to information.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:03.510
And those are major cases.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.810
Also, you have to worry about
minor data loss, which is, you

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:07.630
did a change and you
want to undo it.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:10.110
It is really important to
support undo across all the

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.730
various actions in your
application to help prevent

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.830
users from making
these mistakes.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.360
So that covers preventing
errors.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.210
Now finally, making
users fast.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:23.260
Obviously, speed is something
Google cares deeply about, and

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.860
it's not just true of how things
operate, but also how

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.580
the user operates.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:28.420
So the first thing
I want to talk

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.140
about is visual hierarchy.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:33.000
Computer science obviously
focuses a lot on trees, the

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.180
various algorithms you can apply
on trees, and B trees,

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.830
and [? black ?] trees and binary
trees, and all these

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.300
various things, and breath for
a search versus depth for a

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.460
search, and actually, it
doesn't just apply to

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:43.120
computation.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:47.020
Like obviously, if you're
caching data, you want data

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:50.480
that users access the most to be
higher in the hierarchy, so

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.540
you have the least number of
hops to get to it, a very

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:54.620
common thing with computing.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.460
But also in terms of the
interface, in terms of the

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.510
visual search that people
are going to do.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.860
So Gmail's actually a really
good example of this.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:04.570
Let's look at your average Gmail
inbox where the first

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:07.150
thing, right off the bat, the
first branch point is read

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:08.380
versus unread.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.570
Now in this case, all the unread
messages are grouped

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:13.370
together, but even if they were
kind of scattered, you

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:17.610
can easily visually select on
how dark it is, and just

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.530
immediately at a glance, just
kind of parsing it, you

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:22.860
immediately know which ones are
read versus unread, versus

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.170
some little tiny glyph that
was indicating it.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:26.790
So that's the first branch
point, which is a good one,

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.700
because it's one of the branch
points that people often want

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.230
to branch on, knowing if they're
looking for something

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.300
new that they thought might have
come in versus something

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.600
they know hasn't come in.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.490
The next branch point in the
visual hierarchy is author

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:42.110
versus message, and this is
achieved not through contrast

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.270
but through spacing.

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.270
So because you have a lot of
space here, it's really easy

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:48.670
to look at the Author field
versus the Message field, have

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:50.350
another branch point there.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:53.840
Then the final branch point is
the subject versus the body of

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.620
the message, and here this is
less obvious because it's less

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.790
important, because we want
to build that hierarchy.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.470
But you can also quickly
differentiate the subject line

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.040
versus the body, because
of that visual

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.250
difference in the hierarchy.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:07.570
So here it's just spacing and
contrast are being used to

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:10.280
literally create this tree in
terms of the order in which

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.430
you're going to be able to scan
stuff and how easy you're

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:13.830
going to be able
to scan things.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.610
So if you know you're looking
for an unread message from a

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.750
particular person, you have two
hops, and you can get to

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:19.520
it really fast.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.130
So that applies to the
messages coming in.

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:23.760
Also in terms of the
interface itself,

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.400
you have visual hierarchy.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.720
It's reasonably obvious looking
at this what the most

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.020
common control is, but just
dropping the color and the

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.410
contrast a little bit, let's
overlay some user metrics.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:38.740
I should note, these are
entirely fictional.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:42.080
I just made them up, but you can
imagine user metrics look

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.280
something like this.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.430
Where you see more common
controls, like Compose, being

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.940
interacted with a lot, and
also their placement

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.380
reflecting that.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.390
Then least common things, like
More Labels, rarely being

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:56.000
interacted with.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.760
And this type of user metric,
you can almost sort of see it

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.210
when it's not there, in terms of
the spacing and the order,

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.260
and the visual dominance
of various controls.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:11.580
On mobile as well, you want
to have in primary UI, the

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.830
controls that people are
interacting with a lot, then

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.040
in secondary UI, the controls
that they might occasionally

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.210
interact with.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.320
So you can just pretty quickly
look at the user metrics and

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.920
create the visual hierarchy,
but it's not just that.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.950
Also, from the visual hierarchy
you create, you can

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.720
actually kind of create the user
metrics, because people

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.010
are going to use stuff
more if they find it.

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:31.360
So it's really kind of circular,
where you're both

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.700
designing it and influencing
them in their usage, and then

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.950
their usage is influencing you
as a designer in terms of how

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:38.360
you want to expose stuff.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.230
So it's not purely like you
could just have an algorithm

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.150
that's just going to feed the
data in and stuff gets bigger,

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:46.260
because you can actually
influence the data itself.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.850
So diving into a couple other
things, Fitt's law.

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:51.580
Basically, this is solving
for time, given

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.080
target size and distance.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.560
It's pretty straightforward.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.660
You have your target time, you
have your distance, device

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.000
speed is like mouse speed, or
if it's a touch interface,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.870
literally the speed of
the person's arm.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.770
Device lag is if there's any
number of milliseconds to

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:05.340
actually process the event.

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.990
Based off of this, you can find
out that larger things

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:09.400
that are closer, you can
click on faster,

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.850
which is pretty obvious.

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:12.310
Hick's law is more
interesting.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:14.580
It's about solving for time
based off of the number of

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:15.830
choices and probability.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:21.230
It's been proven that if you
simplify the UI, people are

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:22.520
going to be able to click
on things faster.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.440
So the argument of, why don't
we just introduce

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.180
a button for that?

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.340
It's because it has cost.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.585
It literally makes interface
less efficient if people have

00:23:29.585 --> 00:23:31.080
to search against it.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:35.390
So equation here, you have the
number of equally probable

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:37.290
choices, which first of all, no
interface is going to have

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.800
equal probabilities,
so this form's bad.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.810
What you actually want is
summation with the probability

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:44.240
of each one individually.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.200
And based off of that, you can
determine when you have

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.895
something lined up with others,
what the access time

00:23:49.895 --> 00:23:52.650
is going to be as people try to
locate the one that they're

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:54.280
looking for and choose.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.600
So the combination of things
like Fitt's law and Hick's law

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.200
goes into the field of
cognitive modeling.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.800
And basically what this is, is
predicting a performance

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.700
assuming highly trained users.

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.710
So unlike the self-describing
section, here you're assuming

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:09.370
that people know what
everything is.

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:12.210
And it's purely about access
time and how quickly they can

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:14.150
target the control
and get to it.

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:16.420
So a lot of this work
is actually done.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.375
At NASA Ames, there's a really
good group doing it right next

00:24:19.375 --> 00:24:21.970
to the Google campus, and
they're primarily doing it for

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:23.560
fighter pilots, actually.

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.560
This is a simulator of the F35,
and in this case, you

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.780
obviously have really highly
trained users because they

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.190
know what every control does,
and it's purely about visual

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.660
access time and small controls
and proximity

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:36.390
to other small controls.

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:38.390
But even for a standard
interface, a mobile

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:40.950
application or a desktop
application, you could do this

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:43.430
type of modeling to try to make
sure things are super

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.390
efficient, looking
at the metrics.

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:47.170
So that's how to build
great interfaces.

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:50.950
But the things we talked
about, self-describing,

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:54.420
basically the user building
a mental model and sort of

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.930
simulating in their head how
stuff works, preventing

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:02.580
errors, making users fast, the
idea of cognitive modeling.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.690
That's how to make something
really easy to use.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:07.240
Show an example.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.030
This is really easy to use.

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:11.550
If you know you have to get to
the other side, we talked

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.820
about doors a bit, you know
how to get there.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:15.990
You can assume the
thing rotates,

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:17.490
being inside a circle.

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:19.540
There's no mode errors, because
it only rotates in one

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.680
direction, and it's
easy to use.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.440
It also looks like a human
cheese slicer.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.580
It is not a happy door.

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:30.080
So that leads us to the second
part, which is visual design.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.330
Here's Christian Robinson.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.350
CHRISTIAN ROBINSON: So not to
contradict you, but I think

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:44.230
that the design of that is
actually really quite

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.690
appropriate.

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:47.890
It communicates perfectly, don't
even think about going

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:49.120
in me backwards.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.340
I will hurt you and
mess you up.

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:56.810
So Alex started out talking
about users and how we can't

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:59.500
blame users because it's
not the stupid users.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:03.330
I'm going to argue that users,
in fact, are very smart.

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:07.250
It's actually a hard problem to
design a system that people

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.950
can't figure out.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:13.000
Even think about things like
cryptography, or DRM, or even

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.390
code obfuscation, where it's
difficult to create something

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:22.050
that people can't reverse
engineer.

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:25.090
So if this is also true of
UIs, then why are we here

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:26.460
talking about making
things easier?

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:41.520
The reality is that people just
don't care that much.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.072
If they care enough, they
can figure things out.

00:26:44.072 --> 00:26:46.500
But in reality, they have a lot
of things competing for

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.860
their attention, whether it's
all of the other apps in the

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.250
App store, all of the other
sites that are going on, all

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:54.790
the TV shows, they're watching
Game of Thrones, The

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:59.900
Bachelorette, both, and
comparing, I don't know.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:05.060
So if something is really easy
to use and people don't care,

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:05.870
then it doesn't matter.

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:10.530
So my argument is, if we do
things to help people to care

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:14.700
more, move over to the right,
then even things that are very

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.970
difficult, like learning how
to drive a car, people are

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:18.410
going to do it.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:20.210
Things that are really difficult
like riding a

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:22.620
unicycle, and I know that some
people care a lot about this,

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:25.740
but in my case, I haven't cared
enough to learn how to

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:30.600
use it yet, or something that's
both easy and care a

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.530
lot about, like eating a
sandwich, that's going to

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:34.810
happen all the time.

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:43.670
So the tricky part about this
is that a good portion of

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:46.350
these decisions that we make
as what we're going to care

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:48.930
about, what we don't care about,
actually happen a lot

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:52.940
below the conscious level, and
this plays out in the kind of

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:53.900
research that we do.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.410
It's actually pretty hard to
find out what people care

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:00.240
about, and if you ask them
questions like, why do you

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:04.540
like that, or even, what do you
like, people are really

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.620
bad at giving answers.

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:08.010
You get kind of garbage data
back because we're not very

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:11.710
good at even introspecting
and knowing these things.

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:17.500
So as designers, our job is to
understand this and help

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.870
people to make choices.

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:23.770
Now, there's a lot that happens
in this process from

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:27.940
when something hits our
eyeballs for the small

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:31.000
percentage that it reaches
the top of our brains.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.320
So you may have had this
experience in elementary

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:37.050
school where the teacher told
you that the eyes are not, in

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:40.620
fact, at the top of the head,
that the eyes are in the

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:43.100
center of the head, and there's
probably people in

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.330
your class that argued.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:48.440
Or in my case, I remember being
the artist in the class,

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:52.600
thinking that my eyes had
betrayed me, or how could I

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.550
have not seen this?

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:56.330
It's so clear, once you
get the ruler out.

00:28:56.330 --> 00:29:00.340
And as it works out, there's a
special unit of processing in

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.890
our brain for facial
recognition, and this is

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:06.440
speculation on my part, but
I think it's probably less

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.510
important, the information from
the eyebrows to the top

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:14.090
of the head, and so our brain
just kind of squishes it, and

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:15.500
what we think we're
seeing isn't

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.650
really what we're seeing.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:24.590
This idea that design and these
ideas of perception

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:27.890
happen below consciousness
aren't new.

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:31.600
In fact, there are many people
that have made this made this

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.830
point that sometimes the best
design is invisible design.

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:37.270
A very famous essay
on typography--

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:43.370
famous for those of us who are
really into typography, so

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:46.720
famous for a small subset--

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.670
where Beatrice Warde makes the
case that good typography

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:52.910
should be like a
crystal goblet.

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:55.110
It's transparent, that
you can't see it.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:59.110
You see the content inside, but
the glass is doing its job

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.600
best when it's almost
not there.

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:07.070
So a bunch of psychologists
at the

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:10.056
beginning of the last century--

00:30:10.056 --> 00:30:13.990
I see a lot of people doing
this, recognizing a failure in

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:16.700
my position of the text there.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.980
A bunch of scientists at the
beginning of the last century

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:20.940
wanted to figure this out.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.580
They were a bunch of Germans,
they wanted to figure out how

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:25.780
to order things and group
things, and how we do that.

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.830
They call this idea of order,
they considered it order or

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:30.080
rightness, they called
it gestalt.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.790
Here's an example of some
gestalt principles at work.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:39.680
You can see here how some very
simple changes in the

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.990
structure of the data make
it so much easier to

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:43.800
process on the right.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.570
Alex talked about these
hierarchies of information and

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:49.700
how, since we can't change the
algorithms in people's brains,

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.600
we have to speed things up
by structuring the data.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.700
Well, these gestalt principles
are how we structure the data.

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:57.970
Now, I'm not going to
go through all of

00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:59.470
the principles here.

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:02.000
I'd recommend that you read the
Wikipedia article on the

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.970
topic, it's great.

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:06.660
I could have just read
it and done well.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:12.680
But I've distilled some of these
ideas into two practical

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.230
principles that you can put to
work immediately when you're

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:17.370
evaluating designs.

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:18.470
Here's the first one.

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:20.440
This is the thing that I wish
that people had told me on the

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.500
very first day of
design school.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.470
It's line stuff up.

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:26.380
That's it.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.320
Everything should be lined up
with something unless it has a

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.830
good reason not to.

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:33.710
So even if elements are at the
very opposite sides of the

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:41.650
screen and they're almost
aligned, line them up.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:44.640
If we don't do it, then our
subconscious brains are

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.310
spending precious cycles trying
to figure out, why are

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:48.120
those things not lined up?

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.170
Does it mean something?

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:50.310
Does it not mean something?

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:53.920
It's almost like I'd compare
it to a memory leak in your

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.520
software, where something's
going on, you're not exactly

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.895
sure, but you're wasting
your resources.

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.005
Let's line that back up.

00:32:05.005 --> 00:32:06.255
That's better.

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:12.720
So even stuff that isn't on
the same screen, let's say

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.320
three or four screens later,
you've got something that's

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.130
maybe in this case,
a little bit above

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.230
halfway down the page.

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:22.800
Line it up.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.920
Even though it doesn't seem like
people will be able to

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.220
make that association, and
consciously they certainly

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:32.740
won't, our visual processing
systems are using that

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:35.110
information to know how
to decode this.

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:40.710
Now I might also point out, if
you do want to bring emphasis

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:44.470
to something, then not lining
it up is a really

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:45.190
great way to do it.

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:50.930
You can see in these suggested
paragraphs right here how just

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:53.160
pulling one line out of
alignment gives you a bunch of

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.790
information about what's
the most important

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:58.280
and a lot of structure.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.800
Here's the second big idea.

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.390
Design the spaces.

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:04.270
Now, this is a little bit hard
to do because again, our

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:07.520
conscious brain is really good
at examining objects in the

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:08.770
foreground.

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:13.100
Backgrounds tend to be less
important once we've actually

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.840
picked out the objects.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.250
But if we're designing the
experience, it's important for

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:24.400
us to help people do that, pick
out the groups in the

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.060
foreground.

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.340
One of the ways we do that is
by looking at the spaces in

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:28.970
between things.

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:31.970
Our subconscious brains are
constantly parsing our field

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:35.440
of view, looking at the spaces
between things, and when have

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.810
the same amount of space between
them, we very easily

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:39.960
and very quickly just rest.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:40.710
We check that off.

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:42.300
Those things are grouped
together,

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.380
those things make sense.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:47.790
In the case where every element
on the screen has

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:50.610
slightly different spacing,
again, our subconscious brains

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:52.890
are wasting cycles.

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:56.430
In our massively parallel
processing brain, there's

00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:00.490
billions of threads that are
just in infinite loops trying

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:02.950
to figure out what's going on,
and in the best case, maybe

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:04.560
we'll still be able
to parse it.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.800
In the worst case, we'll just
discount it as noise and we

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.840
won't understand the
intended structure.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:09.949
So design the spaces.

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:18.340
Likewise, using bigger spaces
is a great way to

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.130
break things up.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:21.380
We could talk about
white space.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:30.360
So this is especially
true in typography.

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.070
This is kind of a typographer's
curse.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:35.989
Once you see kerning, you kind
of can't unsee it and you'll

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:38.679
constantly be looking at, every
time you see a v and an

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:39.929
a, you're like, did
they kern that?

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:49.239
The idea is, just the squares
of the letters are drawn and

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:53.960
don't naturally fit together, so
you have to sometimes push

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:54.909
them together.

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:57.130
In the case of type designers,
spend many hours looking at

00:34:57.130 --> 00:35:01.000
all of the possible
combinations and

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.250
straightening them out.

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:10.860
So the very last gestalt
principle says something like,

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:14.820
people can also order things
based on past experience,

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:19.800
which is a very short way of
kind of discounting the whole

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:20.890
rest of design.

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:22.950
It turns out that this is really
one of the biggest and

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:23.560
hardest parts.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.590
All of style and culture and all
of these things fit in as

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:27.750
the very last principle.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:29.670
If you look at this right here,
you can see some of

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:33.600
these spacing and grouping
principles, and help me to

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:39.240
understand, maybe make this
number easier to parse.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.370
But if you've ever called
somebody in the US or looked

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:45.530
up something in an address book,
you know immediately

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:48.690
that this is a format
for a phone number.

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:52.020
It's not because of the spacing,
it's because of these

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.620
kind of learned ideas.

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:56.200
We have a lot of these, and
they're hard to deal with

00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:00.680
because they're kind of vague.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.070
The associations aren't super
crisp always, and here's an

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:04.430
example of that.

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:08.360
Let's consider for a moment
a grocer that wants to

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.590
communicate to everybody
that her produce

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:12.210
is extremely fresh.

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:14.980
And wanting to put her best foot
forward, she commissions

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:18.430
a sign, and she hires an
expensive designer, and they

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:22.470
may make it out of chrome and
neon, and she thinks, good,

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:24.590
now people will always
know that the

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:27.160
produce here is fresh.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.930
Now contrast that with the
grocer across the street who

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:32.740
doesn't really think about it
too much, but all of her

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:34.800
produce that comes fresh from
the farm, just like the one

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.630
across the street, comes in
these cardboard boxes.

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:41.610
She cuts out pieces of the boxes
and just scrawls "Fresh

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:42.460
peaches" on it.

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:45.380
Now, which of these
two design systems

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:46.630
conveys, fresh peaches?

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:55.600
This is a good example of
the idea that better

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.710
isn't always better.

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:59.670
When you're communicating
something, these vague

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:07.550
associations that people have
been can be a very strong cue.

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:10.050
So as product designers, we
always have to be asking this

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:13.890
question, what associations are
people going to make from

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:15.240
what they're looking at here?

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:19.520
Sometimes it seems absurd
looking at a simple web form

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:22.190
thinking, what associations are
people going to make with

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.590
this thing?

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:23.840
What does this look like?

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:30.160
So in these design processes,
this is one exercise that we

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.910
do, and I would highly
recommend it.

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:35.090
It's not hard to get started.

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:37.900
Just pull up a whole bunch of
imagery and start sorting out

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.110
on the table, start making
these associations.

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:41.370
What should our product
feel like?

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:43.450
What does our product
feel like right now?

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:45.540
What do our competitors'
products feel like?

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:49.580
What associations do we
need to evoke in the

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.085
minds of our users?

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.390
So now we're talking about
how to make people care.

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:02.740
There's one last idea I want to
put out there, that one of

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:07.010
the best ways to make people
care about our products is to

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:10.270
show people that we care
about our products.

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:15.390
Now, this is a reality about
perception that's hard wired

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:19.220
into our brains that sometimes
very small things can make a

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:22.660
really big difference in
how we see something.

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:29.940
Now, I don't know whether, if
I download an app that has a

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:32.630
poorly-executed app icon,
whether it's going to be more

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:33.990
flaky or whether it's going
to crash on me.

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:37.300
I haven't necessarily seen the
data with that correlation.

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:40.180
But I do know that that's the
association that users are

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:41.980
going to make based on

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:43.330
millions of years of evolution.

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:46.410
When you see something that's
not quite the right color or

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:49.970
that has a hole in the wrong
place, you bite that fruit,

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:52.170
you might be seeing the
second half of a worm.

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:58.720
So also, we need to do not miss
the opportunities to do

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.340
the things that we
don't have to.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.300
Those little pieces of design
in places where they're not

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:08.820
needed, where they're uncalled
for, tell the user that hey, a

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:09.750
designer was here.

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:11.615
Somebody thought about this.

00:39:11.615 --> 00:39:15.030
They're like little love
notes for our users.

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:19.560
It's the interactive doodle on
the home page, or the mint on

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.830
the pillow, what you
put on the back of

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:25.350
the box in the package.

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:28.570
It's the hidden extra
level of the game.

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:32.000
There's value in doing these
things that don't have an

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.250
apparent commercial purpose,
where we're showing people

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:38.730
that we care so they'll care
enough to use our products.

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:41.710
In this case, PacMan didn't help
people to finish their

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:42.355
searches faster.

00:39:42.355 --> 00:39:44.990
It probably actually
got in the way for

00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:48.250
some people, me included.

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:50.240
But people loved it, and why?

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.390
Because we didn't
have to do it.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:53.710
It's like a note or flowers.

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:56.590
It's these intangibles that
show people that we care.

00:39:56.590 --> 00:40:00.110
Here's another small example
that comes from Google Now,

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:02.476
where the Context Header changes
based on your time of

00:40:02.476 --> 00:40:03.740
day or your location.

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:07.930
And when we were making these,
during the process people

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:10.465
said, this is going
to be hard.

00:40:10.465 --> 00:40:12.100
We're going to have to draw a
lot of things, we're going to

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:13.350
have to draw a lot of states.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.820
That's kind of difficult.

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:19.160
And the answer was yes.

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.940
That's the point.

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:25.490
It's these little pieces and
these little touches that

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:28.350
don't necessarily have a
practical purpose that

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:31.320
demonstrate to people that hey,
if they thought that much

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.500
about this, then think about
how much work they put into

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.530
the actual search results.

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:39.550
Now, you have to be careful with
this because it's a very,

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:41.770
very strong message to send.

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:43.610
You have to make sure that
your product backs it up.

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.940
So how do we apply this to
thinking to products?

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:52.650
Well, it doesn't have to
be the large things.

00:40:55.950 --> 00:41:00.040
The Pac-Man example, the effort
to actually make the

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:04.090
game was a lot smaller than to
produce the search results.

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:06.170
But simply ask yourself
this question.

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:08.470
What are the things that I can
do that I don't have to?

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:18.290
So that said, here's a couple
pieces of reading that we

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:21.810
recommend that you look into to
find out more about some of

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:26.280
these topics, like affordances
and natural mapping, an in Don

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:30.030
Norman's book, or the mental
models in Alan Cooper's

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:31.920
classic, About Face.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.940
And for typography and layout,
one of my favorites is The

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.790
Elements of Typographic Style.

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:48.950
Tomorrow, there a number of
design sessions relating to

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:52.540
Android development, so take
advantage of those.

00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:58.440
ALEX FAABORG: Let's move
onto questions.

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:08.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.850
And it was supposed to be on
the slide, but tomorrow at

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:15.490
5:30 PM at the W Hotel in the
living room, we're going to be

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:18.270
having drinks with the
Android Design Team.

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:19.500
So if you guys want
to stop by, that

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:20.580
should be a lot of fun.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.040
And we're really eager to
take your questions.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.230
We've got quite a bit of time.

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:25.410
So go ahead.

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:26.910
AUDIENCE: I don't actually have
a question, I just want

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:29.220
to say that was the best
presentation I've had since

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:30.854
I've been here, so
thank you guys.

00:42:30.854 --> 00:42:31.822
ALEX FAABORG: You're welcome.

00:42:31.822 --> 00:42:32.306
CHRISTIAN ROBINSON: Thank you.

00:42:32.306 --> 00:42:37.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:38.190
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:41.000
I have a question about
lining stuff up.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.320
So in Android, I would try to
put an image next to a text

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:50.800
view, and then there would be
this little bit of space from

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.690
the top of the text view until
the text actually shows up, so

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:55.950
it does not line up.

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:59.560
The top of the image does not
line up with my text, and it

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:01.550
bothers me.

00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:04.900
I try to fix it, but there
doesn't seem to be

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.430
a way to fix it.

00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:09.300
Should I even try?

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:10.900
CHRISTIAN ROBINSON: Yes.

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.150
Please try.

00:43:17.592 --> 00:43:20.260
I am reminded again and again
that that's a little bit

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:26.640
difficult right now because the
reality is top of the text

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:29.560
as we perceive it is the top of
the caps, it's usually the

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.050
place where we want
to measure from.

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:34.830
And in this case in a lot of the
systems, it measures from

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:36.160
the clipping bounds.

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:39.210
So measuring from the very top
of the text, if you're

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:41.780
building these kinds of systems,
measuring from the

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.720
cap height and the baseline
is where you

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:44.540
want to measure from.

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:47.220
So you may have to
do some kind of--

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:49.590
people always hate negative
margins, or I don't know how

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:52.140
to technically achieve it.

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:54.470
AUDIENCE: I mean, I guess the
next question is, if I decided

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:58.170
to do it, how do I figure out,
what is the amount to shift

00:43:58.170 --> 00:43:59.140
for my font?

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:01.100
Is there a computational
way to do it?

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:04.510
I don't want to just trial and
error, one pixel, two pixel, I

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:07.190
do it until it lines up.

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:08.340
CHRISTIAN ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.960
We can talk a little
bit after.

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.090
ALEX FAABORG: It's an important
limitation.

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:14.870
CHRISTIAN ROBINSON: Em height
times 0.23, I think.

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:16.296
ALEX FAABORG: But thank you
for trying to line it up.

00:44:16.296 --> 00:44:18.960
That's great.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.740
AUDIENCE: This is something I've
been really curious ever

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.480
since Google started rolling out
the new design, because in

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:26.505
Android, the basic theme is
always black, the background,

00:44:26.505 --> 00:44:28.440
whereas iPhone is
always white.

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:31.010
So I'm wondering if you can
speak to that, or why you guys

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:34.000
decided that kind of design?

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.660
ALEX FAABORG: There's a
few functional things.

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:38.680
The OLED screens consume less
power when they're not

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:39.780
illuminating.

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:41.590
Also, they're occasionally very
bright, so you don't want

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:43.720
to just burn the retinas
of the user.

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.700
Those are very literal things.

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:47.510
Christian can speak to
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:50.470
CHRISTIAN ROBINSON: Particularly
when we first

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:53.820
launched Nexus 1, the OLED
screen on that device is

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:57.100
amazing, and some of these
design decisions were made

00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:00.050
based on that.

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:00.310
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:04.290
So you talked a little bit
about how people have

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:07.950
assumptions that they've made
based on a world that we've

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:11.220
all got, and how that's not
always that important.

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:13.280
And like a good example of
that is that designers, I

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.320
think, try and do a lot with
color where green is a

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.920
positive action and
red is generally

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.710
error, warning, whatever.

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:25.150
And so in Gmail, the Compose
Mail button is a bright orange

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:28.920
red, and I've always wondered,
what is some of the thinking?

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.610
I don't know if you guys worked
on that, but what is

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:34.510
the thinking that makes you
break that really, really firm

00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:37.800
color association model
that most of us have?

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:42.360
CHRISTIAN ROBINSON: So first
off, I won't put words in your

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:46.190
mouth, but when we're talking
about the design process,

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:49.180
sometimes it's really important
to get those

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:51.720
associations out of our mind to
make sure that we can work

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.000
on that more fundamental
level.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.300
But those associations are
extremely important.

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:59.750
And so once we've kind of worked
out, how do we make it

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:03.460
work without these kind of
elements of style and trends

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:06.470
and all that stuff, it is really
important to layer that

00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:10.050
stuff back on to evaluate
the work.

00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:13.460
In terms of the specific choice
of that color, I can't

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:18.320
speak to it, except for
the fact that red is a

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:21.200
signal for, look here.

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:23.400
ALEX FAABORG: Also, I didn't
work on it either, so I don't

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.860
want to put words in the mouth
of the designers that did, but

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:28.540
one thing you can see from the
design is that the colors,

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:31.910
they have external consistency
meanings, but they also have

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:33.460
really good internal consistency
meanings, where

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:36.390
blue is always representing
Search, green is always

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:39.450
representing Share, and red
is representing Create.

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:40.890
And that's not the kind of
thing that you have to

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:43.525
actually know, or on a conscious
level know, but it's

00:46:43.525 --> 00:46:45.890
the kind of thing that on a
subconscious level, as you're

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:47.420
trying to find the Search
button, or you want to quickly

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:49.860
share something, you start
to pick up those color

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:51.630
associations as you're
doing your targeting.

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:52.995
So I thought that was a
really nice touch they

00:46:52.995 --> 00:46:54.940
did with the design.

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:56.190
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:03.310
AUDIENCE: I work at a fairly
large media company, and many

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:07.420
projects I end up working on
tend to have five or six

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:11.410
design cooks in the kitchen, and
I'm primarily an engineer.

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:15.160
I was wondering if you had any
suggestions on ways to

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:18.760
influence the design when I see
something bad or that I

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:22.570
disagree with from
that position?

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:24.490
ALEX FAABORG: So the first thing
is, you want to always

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:28.170
speak in terms of the user
base as a whole.

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:32.430
If you immediately go in and
say, I find this bad for my

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:35.160
usage, the designer is going
to be like, I don't care.

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:38.050
You are statistically
insignificant.

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:40.930
Even if what you're saying is
identical to the mainstream

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:43.270
views, it's just the phrasing.

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:44.570
So that's really key.

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:47.556
Also, if you can back up any of
the things you find wrong

00:47:47.556 --> 00:47:49.620
with it with irrefutable
principles, then you're

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:53.260
actually having a debate on the
actual design, as opposed

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.770
to opinions.

00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:57.720
We don't see opinion debates in
engineering as much because

00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:59.810
you have these irrefutable
principles like, something

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:01.710
shouldn't crash, or it shouldn't
use too much memory,

00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:02.860
or it should be fast.

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:06.310
So if you start grounding things
in mode errors, or

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:11.040
consistency, or the user being
able to find help if they need

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:15.490
it, things that everyone agrees
should be right, then

00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:17.920
it's not really a debate as much
as you just pointing out

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.880
a bug that they need to fix.

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:22.130
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:26.120
AUDIENCE: I've worked on
projects with dedicated

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:28.610
designers, and then I've also
worked on projects that are

00:48:28.610 --> 00:48:31.020
just a bunch of engineers
making something that

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:33.350
inevitably ends up
looking horrible.

00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:37.390
Do you have any suggestions when
you have just engineers

00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:40.910
working on a project, and any
things that they could do,

00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:42.770
when they know they're making
something that's not

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:47.340
well-designed, what to do to
help improve the design?

00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:51.470
ALEX FAABORG: Well, hiring an
agency is always an option.

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:54.390
People often discount that as
too expensive, or they haven't

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:56.680
done it before so they
haven't tried it, it

00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:57.450
works really well.

00:48:57.450 --> 00:49:00.540
And also, you often see a lot
of the return in having a

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:02.400
[INAUDIBLE] designed thing
if you're selling the

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:03.440
application.

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.320
If you're just doing it
yourself, trying to isolate

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:09.570
your mind and look at it from
the perspective of a user.

00:49:09.570 --> 00:49:13.680
If you are able to, show it to
other people that haven't seen

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.390
it before, and do sort
of quick tests.

00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:17.910
I Ask them to think out loud as
they're interacting with it

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:20.010
so you can hear their
thought process.

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:22.460
Sometimes everyone's so secret
about their stuff that you

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:24.120
can't do that.

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:26.212
So that's really important.

00:49:26.212 --> 00:49:27.800
Do you have other suggestions?

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:31.600
CHRISTIAN ROBINSON: Another
thing for independent

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.650
developers that don't have a
very big staff is that for a

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:37.520
lot of these platforms, there
is a lot of work that's done

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:40.420
into making the platform and
making those pieces so that

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:44.520
they work and do the
right thing.

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:48.390
So looking at the platform
itself and kind of figuring

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:50.920
out the standard way that the
platform does things is a

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:54.100
really good way to get
oftentimes a good portion of

00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:55.020
the way there.

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:56.130
ALEX FAABORG: Also reading
the style guide, I

00:49:56.130 --> 00:49:57.070
should mention that.

00:49:57.070 --> 00:49:59.320
Android has a great style
guide that we both

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.760
worked on, so biased.

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:03.440
But what's nice about it is it
doesn't just give you the

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.840
various principles, but it also
gives you kind of the

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:06.810
thinking behind all of them.

00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:09.890
And it's not like a rule book
as much as guidelines so you

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:12.130
can understand, this is why
this will make your

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:13.770
application better as you
follow these various

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:14.020
guidelines.

00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:15.820
CHRISTIAN ROBINSON: It's some
kind of another instance of

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:17.070
line stuff up.

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:23.280
Don't reinvent a new way to do a
list unless there's a really

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.530
good reason to.

00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:31.080
Unless it really changes the
character of your thing and

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:34.960
there's a purpose, there's no
reason to invent a new kind of

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.210
scroll bar.

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.120
AUDIENCE: For the Android design
style guideline, I was

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:48.420
wondering what you guys foresee
in terms of how its

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:51.320
evolution is going to be over
time, especially with phone

00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:52.800
devices, mobile devices.

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.640
The screen size is getting
larger, and a lot of times

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.630
I've heard that you want to
keep things closer to your

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:59.000
thumb, but with things like the
Action Bar Menu and the

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.280
Overflow Menu, it's so far away
on a large device that

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:03.330
you no longer have the
ability to easily

00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:04.970
do single hand actions.

00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:05.320
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah.

00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:07.140
Well, on large devices you
have the radius of

00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:08.400
thumbs on the edges.

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.800
You want to definitely
think about that.

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.780
And the style guide, it's
evolving as fast as the

00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:15.290
ecosystem and the devices are.

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:17.690
We're constantly pushing out
updates, considering new

00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:18.730
patterns, things like that.

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:21.440
So it's not like this sort of
fixed thing that everyone has

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:25.580
to adhere to as much as a kind
of organic living document as

00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:26.990
we all collectively
learn more.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.340
AUDIENCE: Thank you for the
phone number slide.

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:34.440
I really like that.

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:39.060
It reminded me of one of the
horrible failures of iTunes

00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:42.340
that I've just been
annoyed by.

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:47.200
If you have a date, and you
format it with four numbers, a

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:52.100
dash, two numbers, a dash, and
two numbers more, that should

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:56.340
be in ISO format for
year, month, day,

00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:58.540
and no other order.

00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:02.950
If you're having sort of the
other random orders that some

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:07.220
locales like, then use the
slashes or whatever is sort of

00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:09.080
standardized for that.

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:11.300
And it helps users so much.

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:13.150
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah and
especially thinking about your

00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:15.530
users, because you're going to
have your own date format that

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:17.455
you're familiar with, but
knowing who you're designing

00:52:17.455 --> 00:52:18.705
for is really important.

00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:23.760
AUDIENCE: I do have a
question this time.

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:25.780
Can you talk about tools
a little bit?

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:28.360
I mean, Photoshop is the obvious
one, but what other

00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:29.880
tools can you talk about?

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.940
ALEX FAABORG: So I really
like Fireworks.

00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:33.790
It has more direct manipulation
of the objects,

00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:36.712
you can actually do nine
slice symbols in it.

00:52:36.712 --> 00:52:38.510
A lot of people use OmniGraffe
or Keynote.

00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:44.570
For OmniGraffe and Fireworks,
we have stencils.

00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:49.600
We also have a Photoshop stencil
for Android design.

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:52.490
Really, the granularity of your
mock-ups has a lot to do

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:56.240
with how final you want people
to think they are.

00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:59.020
So if you show someone a
full-fidelity mock-up and ask

00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:00.870
their opinions, they're going
to start commenting on the

00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:02.800
colors and those types
of aspects.

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.620
If you show them a wire frame,
they're going to start

00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:07.850
commenting on the organization
of the information, how you

00:53:07.850 --> 00:53:09.230
flow through the application.

00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:11.350
So it's important to create the
mock-up at the level of

00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:14.870
fidelity of the feedback
that you want.

00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:18.350
Otherwise, really just sketching
stuff on paper is a

00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:21.440
very quick, fast way
of conveying ideas.

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:23.270
Early in the process, it's
about how many different

00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:25.840
designs you can come up with
as opposed to creating a

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:30.600
perfect one, so that's also
important to consider.

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:34.540
AUDIENCE: A little bit taboo,
but a lot of us have apps that

00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:37.650
are on multiple platforms,
like iOS as well.

00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:42.200
I just wanted to see what
comments you might have on

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:46.606
like where I work,
there's like a--

00:53:46.606 --> 00:53:49.750
to try to get it completely the
same on both, and there's

00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:52.960
a lot of directions that
designers want to go to

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:54.330
consistency versus [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:55.150
for the platforms?

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:56.370
So I just kind of wanted
to see what your

00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:58.250
comments are there.

00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:01.020
CHRISTIAN ROBINSON: This is one
that comes up quite a bit

00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:03.020
for designers in
this industry.

00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:09.160
And the way that I think about
it is, from the product to

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:13.730
designer's point of view, what
we're dealing with is all of

00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:16.760
these products across the
different platforms.

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:19.700
And so the first instinct is to
design everything exactly

00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:22.340
the same because, and yes, it
works the same across all the

00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:23.440
different platforms.

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:26.480
But from the user's point of
view, there are some users

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:29.350
that have three different
phone platforms in their

00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:32.260
pocket at all times,
that's uncommon.

00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:35.100
More often, users will have
one platform, and they're

00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:37.740
using all of these different
parts of the platform.

00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:40.870
And so when they're looking
for something to hang onto

00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:43.250
from a consistency standpoint,
they're expecting things to

00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:44.910
work like the platform.

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:49.430
So when you create an app that's
consistent for you but

00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:54.845
not consistent for your user,
then it's maybe not making the

00:54:54.845 --> 00:54:55.900
right choice.

00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:58.620
So designing for the specific
platforms and designing for

00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:03.440
those conventions, it's a
challenge to find a way to

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:06.980
express your brand across all
those platforms, but--

00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:08.180
ALEX FAABORG: Also, your brand
should be stronger

00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:09.130
than just the UI.

00:55:09.130 --> 00:55:10.710
It's kind of silly if the
UI is your brand.

00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:13.120
Your brand is about the
emotional connection people

00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:14.775
have to your application, and
your colors, and watermark,

00:55:14.775 --> 00:55:16.230
and things like that.

00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:19.030
And then also, Christian
concluded his talk with

00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:22.680
showing users that you care, and
also talking about how a

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:25.620
poorly-designed icon, does that
application crash more?

00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:27.680
Your application, you could care
a lot about it, but if

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:29.950
it's identical to the other
platforms, it kind of looks

00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:31.370
like it was quickly
ported over.

00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:34.600
It doesn't convey that level
of effort, and people are

00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:36.980
going to see that and make
judgments off of how much

00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:38.230
effort you put into it.

00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:45.540
It's kind of a negative
note to end it on.

00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:46.790
All right, well thank
you for coming.
