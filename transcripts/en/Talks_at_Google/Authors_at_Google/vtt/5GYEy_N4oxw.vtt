[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.058 --> 00:00:10.700
So this is "The Diamond Setter,"
published tomorrow in the US.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.740
So this is the first event.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.060
Translated wonderfully
by Jessica Cohen.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.830
I'll start by reading a
paragraph, the prologue.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:22.910
Well.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.350
"One day in the summer
of 2011, a Syrian citizen

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.820
sneaked across the border into
Israel, not far from the town

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.100
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.130
In his pocket was a
piece of a blue diamond

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.900
that had once belonged, so I
was told, to European royalty,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.030
as well as to the Ottoman
Sultan Abdul Hamid II.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.100
After entering Israel, the young
man took a bus to Tel Aviv.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.190
He had not told anyone
in Syria of his plans,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.510
and almost no one in Israel
knew where he'd come from.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.500
Who was this man, and what
was the purpose of his trip?

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.140
All we know is that
he was 20 years old,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.620
the scion of two families
divided by national conflict

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.470
yet bound by
passion and secrecy,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.800
back in the days when
the Middle East was

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.620
steeped not only in
blood, but also in love.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.970
This is his marvelous story
and the story of many others

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.000
who live in this land."

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.320
Well, this is the beginning.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.710
Now how shall I introduce
a book in which you

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:41.180
find one century, two families,
three cities, and four

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.500
generations?

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.460
I'll start with a scene
which is not in the book.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.570
That is me standing in northern
Israel a couple of years ago.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.400
There's a famous poetry
festival there every year.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.250
I've been there with my
boyfriend, the poet Dory Manor.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.300
And then I got a
call from my father

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.620
saying that my grandmother
had passed away.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.380
And then I was standing there.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.730
I saw Lebanon.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.800
This is the north
side of Israel.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.990
I saw Lebanon, Beirut.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.070
I was looking towards
Damascus, which

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.440
is not very far from there.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.960
Hometown of my grandparents.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.230
And I knew, I sadly
knew that I would not

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.680
get there maybe any day.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.620
I mean, maybe never.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.590
So this yearning,
this longing for years

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.950
for this homeland
of my ancestors

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.160
was the seed of this book,
"The Diamond Setter."

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.280
Well, as you can
already tell, my family

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.790
is from Damascus, the
side of my father.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.330
In fact, my father was the only
one not to be born in Damascus.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.800
He was born in Tel Aviv,
but all his elder sisters

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.100
and brother and his parents
were born in Damascus.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.780
And my father, Moshe Sakal--

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.280
I am named after him--

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.390
he was a teacher.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:25.100
He taught Arabic and French
at [INAUDIBLE] in Damascus.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.920
And he wrote prose in Arabic.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.830
And ever since he settled
down in Tel Aviv in '49,

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.720
he stopped writing.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.550
Now you can say that this is
the tragedy of any immigrant,

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.250
right?

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.230
Immigrants go to another
country and they lose track

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.490
with their former
place, hometown.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.710
But this case is a
little bit different,

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.280
because unlike other people
who came from the Holocaust

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.830
to Israel from Europe and they
had very difficult stories,

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.600
all I was told were beautiful
stories about the life

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.140
that they left in Damascus.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.330
And they came to Tel Aviv.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.240
They were pretty much wealthy.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.029
They weren't-- lack anything.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:22.060
But there was one thing missing,
and that thing was their story.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.240
My father always told me,
you know, we are Sephardic.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.770
We are Syrians.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.090
Of course, it's not a shame.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.210
You should be proud of it.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.850
But I didn't know what it meant.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.200
And he said to me, son,
always know that we

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.510
were never discriminated.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.680
Never.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.640
And then one day, I
told him, yes, of course

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.640
we were discriminated,
because you were not

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.340
allowed to have your own story.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.710
What I mean by
saying that aloud,

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:57.850
I mean that what meant being
Israeli in the '40s, '50s

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.410
in 20th century, that
meant not being anything

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.770
else, because the
country was very young.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.540
So in order to create its
identity, you were not Polish,

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.730
you were not Syrian,
you were not French,

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.560
you were not all these things.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.290
That meant that
you were Israeli.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.760
Now as a part of the
third generation,

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.076
I can allow myself--

00:05:22.076 --> 00:05:25.630
I have the privilege of
going back to these places,

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.040
to these stories.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.940
And not by being
sentimental, but to find my--

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.480
if you wish, my roots,
to know who I am.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:43.940
But all this was missing, and
that's why at the age of 22,

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.300
I left for Paris, France.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.600
I felt that I needed to be
a stranger, not to be local,

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.040
not to belong.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.380
And there I found my diaspora.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.740
Also I found the love of my
life, who is Israeli as well.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.360
And we met in France
in the city of lights.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.810
And then six years after, I
came back to Israel with my--

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.940
felt that I had the
diaspora in my suitcase.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.160
Well, back to my family story
and to "The Diamond Setter."

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.170
So I'm telling a story
about a place and time

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.350
which is not very far from
where we are sitting now.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.900
I mean, not sitting,
but I mean the time.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.270
It's less than a century ago.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.480
I'm talking about
the '30s, the '40s.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.840
And this Middle East
that I'm talking about

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:45.070
had open borders, which is
a thing that is unbelievable

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.180
nowadays.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.600
Back in the days where my
grandfather, Moshe Sakal,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.870
was living in Damascus,
he could go and do

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.260
shopping from Damascus
in Baghdad, Iraq.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:03.560
Then he could go and meet a
friend in Anjafa, Palestine.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.390
And then to go to Cairo,
Egypt, and so on and so on.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.520
You could have
friends everywhere.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:16.580
You can be in love with
people from other countries.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.000
You could just walk freely.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.130
And I understood while
trying to write this book,

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.810
because in the beginning, I
only had the Jewish-Israeli side

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:29.310
of the book.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.510
But I was sure that
this was not it.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.790
Something was missing,
and what was missing

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.390
was this open borders situation.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:43.690
And as a writer, you know,
[INAUDIBLE] you can write about

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.430
everything, but you don't.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.900
Because you have-- you need
to have the courage to do so.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.720
And I had to open these borders.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.520
I didn't know how.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.320
And then one day I read in
the newspaper about a teacher,

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.250
30 years old from Damascus,
who just crossed the border.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.700
He went from Damascus to
Tel Aviv and then to Jaffa

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.970
to see the house of
his grandparents.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:15.130
And I was shocked
by his courage.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:19.060
He did an incredible thing.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.690
It was not as a part of a
movement, a political movement.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:23.260
No.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:27.930
He just went by his
own decision to see

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.870
the house of his
grandfather and grandmother

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.539
who had left Jaffa in
'48 before the war,

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.419
and then afterwards
were not allowed

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:42.100
to go back to their home,
and they stayed in Damascus.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:47.350
And that gave me first the
idea and then the courage

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.840
to write about this.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.520
And my character
is named Fareed.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.440
He's inspired by this act
of this Syrian teacher.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.910
He's 20 years old.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:06.640
And one day, just
as I read, in 2011

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.320
he crosses this
well-protected border,

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.790
and he goes first to Tel
Aviv and then to Jaffa.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:20.890
Bride of the sea, as this
town is called in Arabic,

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:23.110
to see the house of
his grandparents.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:33.220
And before he does that, he has
a friend, a pen pal in Jaffa,

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.730
which he finds on Facebook.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:44.420
And he says to him, I'm going
to Jaffa to explore my roots.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.540
And his friend in Jaffa
says, "'Are you crazy?

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.270
They'll shoot you at the border.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.740
They have no qualms.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.100
You think they don't have
enough Palestinians in Israel?

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.040
They don't want another one.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.810
And anyway, nothing
scares the Israeli army

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.050
more than an unarmed Arab.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:06.290
If you went at them
with a submachine gun,

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:07.590
that would be one thing.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.630
But to just walk
over and with the way

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.980
you look, with your curly hair
and your pale skin, no way.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.300
Forget it.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.130
Very bad idea.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.070
You won't make it here alive.'"

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:27.440
Of course, Fareed doesn't
listen, and he goes to Jaffa.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.830
And with one little
step of his, he just

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:37.640
opened literally the border,
as if it doesn't exist.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:42.320
Well, that was one way
of opening these borders,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.790
these boundaries.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.480
The second one was by digiti--

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:54.160
the second one was by
digitization and by Grindr.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.880
I wouldn't say Tinder, because
my characters use Grindr.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.940
And you know, I talk
about these borders.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:06.110
If you go to Northern Israel
and you look at Beirut,

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.270
you can't go there.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.510
But you can go on Grindr.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:13.250
And then you can find someone
you like, and you can tell him,

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.150
you know, if there was no border
here, I would be in your arms

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.820
in, like, 15
minutes, 10 minutes.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:24.020
Well, it's not always possible,
but in my book, it is.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.370
I won't tell you how.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:36.180
But I will read a paragraph
about my character, Honi,

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.650
in Tel Aviv.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:41.560
"For months now,
Honi's gaze had been

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:46.000
fixed not on trees or people
or sidewalks or the road,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.120
but on his phone,
which offered up

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.540
an entire world,
countless opportunities,

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.920
unrealized desires,
disappointments foretold,

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.250
and dreams that would never
come true unless he suddenly

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.820
discovered an extraordinary
reserve of courage

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.920
within himself.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.010
He did not believe for a
second that could happen.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.280
He was location-based.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.680
Everywhere he went,
someone out there

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.890
knew he was here and not there.

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.370
That someone was not God
or an invisible entity,

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.870
that someone like
a voice from ahigh,

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.820
making anonymous pronouncements,
was merely an algorithm

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.520
programmed to do one thing.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.490
To know.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.280
The algorithm knew
everything about Honi,

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.040
or at least the most
important thing.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.650
The precise point in
space where he was

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.530
located at any given moment.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.330
It was always
hovering above him,

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:50.940
and could always testify when
needed that he was here and not

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.740
somewhere else.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:57.060
The algorithm was his alibi
for a little sin he had not yet

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.030
committed, but it was
also the guarantee

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:05.070
that this little sin
would one day come to be.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:06.330
When?

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:07.750
Maybe today.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.270
Maybe next week.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:12.350
Maybe never."

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:18.360
Well, once you open the
borders, very interesting things

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.450
can happen.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:24.170
That's when I started
fantasizing or recreating,

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:28.250
one may say, the love
life of my grandparents.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:33.920
As you can maybe already
tell, my fiction involves--

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:39.410
as you can already tell,
my fiction has a very--

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:41.990
a strong element of truth in it.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:47.390
Maybe more than in ordinary
novels and fiction.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.280
A few years ago,
I was interviewed

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.790
in the most popular
newspaper in Israel.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.880
And I had, like, four
pages of coming out

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.010
in this most popular newspaper.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:02.390
And I didn't dare telling
about this to my grandmother.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.800
Nevertheless, she found it.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.090
Because I wasn't afraid.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:08.330
I knew that she wasn't reading
any newspapers in Hebrew,

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:13.340
even though she was living for
60 years in Israel by then.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:14.690
Anyways, she found it.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:17.060
And she didn't say anything.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:22.130
But the next time I was at
her place, all of the sudden,

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.100
she said, you know,
I read the article.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.630
And I said, you did?

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.690
And she said-- she was very
severe, and she said, yes.

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:33.680
Did you really say everything
that was in the paper?

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.820
And I said to her, well, yes.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:41.010
And then she said,
bravo, my son.

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:45.260
You did very well, because I
believe that everything in life

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.010
should be told.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.160
You should have no secrets.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.670
Well, it was then that I
permitted, allowed myself

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:57.210
to recreate my
grandparents' love life.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.680
And then one day, I came to the
editor of "The Diamond Setter."

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.510
And I told him,
you know, I'm going

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:06.230
to have a love triangle
between Rafael and Adela,

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:09.890
the Jewish couple from
Damascus, and Layla,

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:13.910
the younger, beautiful,
Palestinian woman from Jaffa.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.650
And then he looked at
me and he said, yeah,

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:20.810
you mean love triangle
like they are both in love

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:22.610
with her or someone--

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.660
two characters are in
love with the same person?

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:25.350
I said, no.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:27.380
I mean a real love triangle.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.640
And he said, like a real one?

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.190
Like-- and I said, yes.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:32.490
And then he loved the idea.

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:34.520
The first, he was scared.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.120
He loved it.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.170
And unlike what
people may think,

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:42.620
I find the love
triangle a very severe

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.990
and strict model
or a convention,

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:48.950
and not at all free.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:53.330
Because just imagine
like-- just imagine,

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:59.460
like any other triangle,
once you move one part of it,

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.090
all the other angles,
like the two other angles,

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:03.800
they also change.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.340
Like, this is very strict.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.650
Not free at all.

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:12.080
And this gives a place to
incredible and very interesting

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.320
things that can
happen, I believe.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:20.180
And I'll read a short
paragraph about Adela

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:25.120
and Rafael's love
triangle with Layla.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.780
And no spoilers, but I will
say that she's related closely

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.100
to our Fareed.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:36.250
I told you this was a family
saga with lots of secrets.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.690
Well, Adela.

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.870
"She did not dare discuss
Layla with Rafael.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:46.060
She loved him now even
more than before."

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.280
I read again.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.490
"She did not dare discuss
Layla with Rafael.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:54.340
She loved him now
even more than before,

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.280
and felt she had enough
love inside herself

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.700
for both Rafael and Layla.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.220
Neither of them was deprived.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.290
And in fact, quite the opposite.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.220
The more she loved, the
greater her capacity

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.290
to contain the love.

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:14.290
And she filled up
with love as one can

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:18.510
become filled with memories."

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:26.730
So this book is about
yearning, it's about regret,

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:30.090
it's about longing,
it's about return.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:37.680
And the big question in
this book is, can we return?

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.290
Do we have a place to return to?

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:45.830
Of course, I also speak
about the Palestinians' right

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.770
of return, which is
the biggest Israel--

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:54.590
biggest taboo in Israel
nowadays and before even.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.930
So I speak about that return.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:59.990
And we know that
Fareed is going to see

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.600
the house of his
beloved grandparents

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.460
in Jaffa, in Israel.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.070
But also of other returns.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:18.260
So I'll read a short dialogue
between the narrator, Tom,

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.370
and his boyfriend Honi.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:25.860
They both are going to fall
in love with our Fareed.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.130
So they speak about this
return, and Tom says,

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.430
the narrator says, "'I'm
not only talking about

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:35.260
the political issue with the
Palestinian refugees and all

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:35.760
that.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.910
I mean return in
a broader sense,

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:43.920
in every sense.'" And then Honi
says, "'I'm not following you,

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:44.650
Tommy.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:45.580
What's the question?'"

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:49.600
And then Tom says, "'The
question is, can you go back?

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:55.600
The question is, can
you really go back?

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.870
What really interests me
is not the return itself,

00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:59.620
but the place.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.946
You know.

00:19:00.946 --> 00:19:04.270
People always fantasize
about a time machine

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:08.110
that can transport you back
to a different time and place.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:15.220
But my question is, do we even
have anywhere to go back to?

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:20.590
Look, I started writing "The
Diamond Setter--'" he's writing

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.410
this own book, my narrator--

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:25.060
"'and I got stuck.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.900
One day, I read in the paper
about that Syrian guy who

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:33.580
crossed the border and went
on a roots journey in Jaffa.

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:37.120
And that little act of his
made all these other things

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.650
come together for me.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:44.590
I realized that for us, the
third generation of immigrants,

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:48.070
we can't do anything to change
the political situation.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:49.720
Our hands are tied.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:55.160
But we can tell a story,
and that's a lot.'"

00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:00.880
So I write about return.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:06.310
I may say in the book that
we cannot really go back,

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:10.360
but we can tell a
story by trying to.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:15.310
And I will finish
this introduction

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:22.960
by reading a short paragraph,
what was told by Aunt Gracia

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:27.010
to the jeweler, the diamond
setter in person when

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:28.780
he's a child.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:31.090
He's called Menashe.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:37.810
And I think that this summarizes
quite well all that I was just

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:38.870
talking about.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:44.140
So this is what this aunt
of his, born in Damascus,

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.070
who had met the Turkish
sultan Abdul Hamid,

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:52.090
and who got this blue
diamond from him,

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:54.780
from the Turkish
sultan, she says that

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:58.570
to her beloved nephew in
Tel Aviv when he's a child.

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:03.160
She says, "'I always tell
you everything that happened,

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.950
Menashe, because you
are a very sweet boy.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:08.890
And it's thanks to
you that I remember

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:13.150
things that happened long
ago, in another world,

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:15.280
in another life.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:21.130
Do you think we can hold onto
everything that happens to us?

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:25.810
You grow up and discover
that your body changes,

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:28.510
and you change on
the inside too.

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:30.850
And all the things
that happen to you,

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:37.190
there is no proof that
they really did happen.

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:40.730
Every memory does
not always last.

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:46.130
You turn your face up to
the sky, inhale and exhale,

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:50.480
you close your eyes, and some
little things come back to you

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.460
for a quick second.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:57.320
But do not believe that
moment will truly return.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:01.080
Everything you do in life
happens for the first time

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.840
and for the last time.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:09.290
There is nothing afterward, and
there won't be anything left.

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:14.390
But if you understand that, you
will be able to genuinely enjoy

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.700
the things you do.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:21.190
You will be able to hold onto
them as tightly as possible

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.980
before they escape you forever.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:29.274
Do you understand, Menashe?'"

00:22:29.274 --> 00:22:34.154
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:34.154 --> 00:22:39.140
AUDIENCE: So there's a famous
quote by an English poet, Percy

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.440
Bysshe Shelley.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.140
Not sure if you're
familiar with him.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:47.640
But he has a quote to
the effect that poets

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:52.670
are the unacknowledged
legislators of the world.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:56.770
So I know you said that
there's nothing you can do

00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:00.990
or that we can do regarding
the political situation,

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:04.600
but you can tell the story.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.290
So my question for you
is, when you set out

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.870
to write this story, I
know you sort of described

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:15.940
that moment where it sort came
to you, I guess, so to speak.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.770
Did the sort of
political element

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:25.810
or that situation, did
that factor in-- like,

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:29.260
was that in your head when you
were sort of devising the story

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.400
or coming up with it?

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.630
Or do you think
that was, I guess,

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:38.680
like the political element just
shaped the story to begin with,

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.310
I guess?

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:42.980
Or like, I guess another
way of putting it would be,

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.310
did you sort of design
the story with some sort

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:46.660
of political message in mind?

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:50.350
Or was it just the story, and I
guess that's something that, I

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:51.642
guess, was ancillary to it?

00:23:51.642 --> 00:23:53.850
MOSHE SAKAL: That's a good
question, and a tough one.

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:54.850
[LAUGH]

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:57.680
Because you know,
writing about politics,

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.520
I think it was the Stendhal,
the French writer, who

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.430
said that putting
politics into a novel

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:06.430
is like a shotgun in an opera.

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:10.110
Like, this is the
worst thing to do.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:11.260
Nevertheless, I did it.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:16.390
And it took me six
years, writing this book.

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:17.650
Six long years.

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:21.070
Lots of crisis.

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:24.040
And I didn't quite
know in the beginning

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.110
how to refer to the
political situation.

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:28.600
But of course, obviously,
I knew that I would,

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.210
because this is the story.

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:32.980
The story is about people
from different countries

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.980
that come to each
other, that connect,

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.980
that they feel passion
for one another.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:49.030
And sometimes I let my narrator
deal with things that maybe I

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:51.330
as a person wouldn't.

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:55.320
And he lets himself say
things and acting the way

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.810
he does, and all the
other characters.

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:06.760
I was trying to give all
the angles of the story.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.180
And one thing is sure.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.800
I did not have a message.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.180
Not because I'm not political.

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.500
I am very political.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.530
I write for Haaretz
daily newspaper,

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:21.020
for example, about the
political situation when

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.700
I have things to say.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:25.310
But as a writer,
I think that it's

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:27.410
terrible to have a message.

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:34.780
I think that literature
can and does change people,

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:38.580
but differently
than in an article.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.590
In a more profound way.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.130
And I think that
if a book is good,

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:47.580
people are becoming better.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.950
But it's not ignoring
your question.

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:54.370
I think-- as a person,
I am very political.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:57.240
But in this book, I
just told a story.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.820
And of course, I'm
not being naive

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.240
and saying, just told a story.

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:05.160
Because you know, when I
started doing the research,

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.290
I found very little books--

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:14.216
I mean, I found very few
books about, for example,

00:26:14.216 --> 00:26:17.460
the Palestinian
refugees in Hebrew,

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:25.320
about Jews from
Damascus even in Hebrew.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.500
Most books you find are about--

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.660
they deal with the
Shoah, the Holocaust,

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.930
with European cultures,
Jewish cultures.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:36.345
And now it's becoming
more and more familiar.

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:44.460
And people from my generation
and from other generations,

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.980
they find these stories.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:50.390
I came to my grandmother
a few years ago

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:52.560
when she was still alive.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.690
Her Hebrew name
is [? Oa, ?] which

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:56.580
is, it's coming from light.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:00.250
And her Arabic name
was [? Sopia. ?]

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:03.570
And I asked her
about these stories

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:06.240
and about these places
that she came from,

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.280
Damascus and then Beirut.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:13.030
And then she was flattered,
but she was not at all content,

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:16.380
and she was even
slightly furious at me.

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.230
And she said,
[SPEAKING ARABIC]---- in Arabic,

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:20.380
that means my son--

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:24.300
[SPEAKING HEBREW],, in Hebrew,
which means, what for?

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:25.980
Why going back to these stories?

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:29.000
And I told her that for
me, it was very important,

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.660
and that I was ashamed of
not knowing these stories,

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:37.660
not knowing where
my family came from.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:43.140
So I guess that if there was
one political main thing,

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:47.280
main purpose, and main goal in
this book for me, it was this.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:51.000
Telling the stories, writing
about these people coming

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.620
from Palestine, from
Israel, from Syria.

00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:00.660
Knowing that they had normal
life, that they loved,

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:06.000
that they felt passion, that
they were yearning, just

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.150
like us.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:09.150
AUDIENCE: So I noticed
on the inside of the book

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:12.101
that it was originally published
in Hebrew four years ago.

00:28:12.101 --> 00:28:14.100
And I was curious about
the translation process,

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.060
if you could talk about
that a little bit.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.910
Like, how deeply
were you involved?

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:19.080
How did it feel if you
were involved to come back

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:23.190
to the story you'd written many
years prior during translation.

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:25.830
And being an English speaker
yourself, like, was there

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:28.830
anything you felt like was lost
in the translation of the book?

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:29.670
MOSHE SAKAL: Yeah.

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:32.330
OK, thank you.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:36.090
I'll say a strange
thing, but it came true.

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:38.820
From the beginning, I thought
that this book would interest

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.722
the American public readers.

00:28:40.722 --> 00:28:41.430
I don't know why.

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:42.513
This is not my first book.

00:28:42.513 --> 00:28:44.580
But I knew that this
would be the first one

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.470
to be translated into English.

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:48.750
And then I met Jessica Cohen.

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:52.530
She's a great translator.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:59.180
She has just won with David
Grossman the year's Man Booker.

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.550
But that was five years
ago when I met her.

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:07.410
And she read the manuscript
even before it was published

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:09.900
in Hebrew, and she loved it.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:13.860
And then we started
working on this book.

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:17.130
Now the fact that I am an
English speaker, by the way,

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:19.140
like every Israeli--

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.460
it is not very rare in Israel.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:26.710
So I knew that for
her, it could be--

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:28.140
how you say, a pain in the neck.

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:31.410
I would say this
very delicately.

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:34.650
Because you know, I guess
the translators are always

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:37.170
afraid of writers
coming to them, saying,

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:38.940
why did you choose
this and not that?

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:41.580
And we had dilemmas.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.140
We never fought.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.240
It was very fruitful.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.796
I felt in very good hands.

00:29:48.796 --> 00:29:52.180
We surely had some discussions.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.230
Interesting,
complex discussions.

00:29:55.230 --> 00:30:00.840
For example, the name, the
right of return in Hebrew,

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:06.030
you have one word for return
of Jews, which is Shiva,

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:10.650
and one word for Palestinians,
which is [? Shavut. ?]

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:15.360
Or the name of
the City of Jaffa.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.850
In Arabic, you call it Yafa.

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:20.010
In Hebrew, you call it Yafo.

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:28.070
So I put in the book, when
a Jewish person says names

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:31.120
the city, he says
the Hebrew word,

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.810
and the Palestinian
says the Arabic word.

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:35.460
And what should we do?

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:39.300
And a lot of very
interesting discussions

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:47.040
that involved both mentality
and culture and language.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:51.510
But in the end, I
said to her always

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:58.233
that her word would
be the final word.

00:30:58.233 --> 00:31:04.980
And when she finished the
translation and I read it,

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:09.300
I told her that if I would have
written this book in English,

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:13.590
that is exactly the way that
I would have been writing it.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:16.200
And then [INAUDIBLE] writing it.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.470
And she said that this
was the biggest compliment

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.720
that a translator can have.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:29.940
So I'm very happy and excited
about this translation

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:33.190
and edition in the
States of the book.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.250
Thank you.

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:40.310
AUDIENCE: So I know you said
that you spent almost-- was it

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:41.372
five years?

00:31:41.372 --> 00:31:42.080
MOSHE SAKAL: Six.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.550
AUDIENCE: Six
years on this book.

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:49.220
Is that-- like, I you've
written five novels now.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:52.700
Is that pretty normal
across the board?

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.010
Or was there something
special about this one

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:58.645
that really drew you in?

00:31:58.645 --> 00:32:01.010
MOSHE SAKAL: It was
the most difficult one.

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:02.510
Afterwards, I wanted to retire.

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:03.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.000
But I started young.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:12.010
I wrote short stories when I
was 16 years old, because I

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:13.450
knew a guy who
was older than me,

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:16.780
and he gave me very good
books, and I wanted to give him

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:19.220
something in return.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.210
And I didn't read anything.

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:25.900
I mean, adult books
when I was 16 yet.

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:30.400
So I just wrote a short
story, and I gave it to him.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.530
And he was very
enthusiastic about it.

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:37.660
And he said that I
should write more.

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.420
And then the first
book of short stories

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:41.950
was published when
I was very young,

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:46.300
when I was 21, in a
well-established publishing

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.670
house in Tel Aviv.

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:52.180
And then I wrote several novels
in Paris and in Tel Aviv,

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:54.190
and that was the
most difficult one.

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:59.260
I wrote more than 1,000 pages.

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:04.400
And with my editor,
author [INAUDIBLE],,

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.940
he writes crime books.

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.620
I mean, [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.366
How would you say--

00:33:10.366 --> 00:33:11.710
yeah.

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:12.660
Crime books.

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.900
And he's very
elegant as an editor.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.910
And I said to him, OK, listen.

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:21.310
We have 1,000 pages here.

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:25.450
We have to turn them
into 200 in Hebrew.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:29.200
And that's the book in Hebrew.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.670
So I told him, how do we do it?

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:38.200
And then we decided about
making chapters and, like,

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.060
having chapters,
and each chapter

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.750
would have a name
of one character.

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:46.960
Because you think, how
would you tell a story

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:52.600
about a century in,
like, 200 pages?

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.420
That was too difficult.

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:57.026
And we had to move.

00:33:57.026 --> 00:33:58.150
Like, change the apartment.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:00.730
And I told my
boyfriend, I can't move.

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:04.940
I can't do anything now in my
life until I finish this book.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.500
I had this feeling
that he would--

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:12.429
like, I should finish this
book or it would finish me,

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:13.600
like we say in Hebrew.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.120
Like, it would kill me.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:21.670
But in the end, it was done
and published a few years ago.

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:23.920
And then I retired
for six months

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:28.750
before I wrote a book
within six months that

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:30.560
was published two years ago.

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.260
So that was like a
smooth creation process,

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:37.719
and I felt like I
really deserved it.

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:40.040
DAVID: Thank you Mr. Sakal.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.290
MOSHE SAKAL: Thank you, David.

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:42.555
DAVID: Thank you,
everyone, for coming.

00:34:42.555 --> 00:34:44.440
Let's give one more
round of applause.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.398
MOSHE SAKAL: Thank you.

00:34:45.398 --> 00:34:49.800
[APPLAUSE]
