00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:14.780
Calvin Graham was the youngest of seven children
of a poor Texas farm family and because of

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.700
his abusive stepfather, he and one of his
older brothers decided to move out.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.380
Calvin supported himself by selling newspapers
and delivering telegrams on weekends and after

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.380
school.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.699
He was just eleven when he first thought of
lying about his age to join the Navy.

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.750
The world was in the midst of the second world
war and some of his cousins had recently died

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.750
in battles.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.030
Graham made his decision.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.280
The question was how to do it.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.650
He started by shaving, as he thought it would
ultimately make him look older.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.469
(And, note: Contrary to popular belief, shaving
has no effect on hair growth rates or thickness)

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.930
More effectively, he had his friends forge
his mother’s signature for consent, stole

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.080
a notaries’ stamp, and told his mom he was
going to visit relatives for a while.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.359
Graham later recalled that the day he showed
up to enlist, “I stood 5’2 and weighed

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:03.469
125 pounds, but I wore one of my older brothers’
clothes and we all practiced talking deep.”

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.970
Despite all his efforts, there was one problem-
a dentist who helped screen the new recruits.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.940
Graham stated, “I knew he’d know how young
I was by my teeth… when the dentist kept

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.060
saying I was 12, I said I was 17.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.500
Finally, he said he didn’t have time to
mess with me and he let me go.”

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.280
On August 15, 1942, Calvin Graham was sworn
into the Navy.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.670
He was twelve years, four months and twelve
days old, the youngest individual to enlist

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.130
in the U.S. military since the Civil War and
the youngest member of the U.S. military during

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.210
WWII.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.000
After spending time in San Diego for basic
training, he sailed aboard the USS South Dakota

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.689
as a loader for a 40 mm anti-aircraft gun,
a “green boy” from Texas who would soon

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.390
become not only the youngest to serve, but
the nation’s youngest decorated war hero.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.380
The South Dakota, known also as “Battleship
X” during the war, was a destroyer under

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.260
the command of Captain Thomas Leigh Gatch
that was heading to Guadalcanal, one of the

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.200
Solomon Islands in the South Pacific.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.439
On the night of November 14, 1942, during
the Battle of Guadalcanal, the battleship

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.450
was hit forty-seven times by Japanese fire.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.880
One explosion threw Calvin down three decks
of stairs.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.180
He was seriously wounded by shrapnel that
tore through his face and knocked out his

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.180
front teeth.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.300
Additionally, he suffered severe burns, but
in spite of his injuries he tried to rescue

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.750
fellow sailors from danger.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.540
I took belts off the dead and made tourniquets
for the living and gave them cigarettes and

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.880
encouraged them all night.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.949
It was a long night.

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:26.949
It aged me…

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:29.700
I didn’t do any complaining because half
the ship was dead.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.480
For his efforts during the battle and aiding
other soldiers, despite his own injuries,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.440
he received the Bronze Star as well as a Purple
Heart.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.770
However, the distinction did not last long.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.500
A year after serving in the Battle of Guadalcanal,
while his battleship was being repaired, Graham’s

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.520
mother learned of what her son had been up
to and informed the Navy of his real age.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.190
Rather than simply releasing him from his
service, Graham was thrown in the brig for

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.570
almost three months.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.019
It would seem the plan was to keep him there
until his service time was up, but he was

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.250
ultimately released when his sister threatened
to go to the media and tell them about her

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.060
brother’s imprisonment, despite his distinguished
service.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.989
Graham was released, his medals stripped from
him, and then dishonorably discharged, which

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.160
is significant as it made it so he couldn’t
receive any disability benefits, despite his

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.160
injuries.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.570
At only thirteen, Calvin Graham was a “baby
vet” who quickly found he didn’t fit in

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.630
at school anymore.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.700
Once again he chose a life of an adult, getting
married and fathering a child at fourteen,

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.970
while working as a welder in a Houston shipyard.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.199
At seventeen, he got divorced and enlisted
in the Marines.

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.150
Three years later, he broke his back when
he fell from a pier.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.859
This unfortunate event ended his service career
and left him selling magazine subscriptions

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:35.859
for a living.

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.070
For the remainder of his life, Graham fought
for both medical benefits and a clean service

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.070
record.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.440
In 1978, he was finally given an honorable
discharge (approved by President Jimmy Carter),

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.380
and all his medals except the Purple Heart
were reinstated.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.600
He was also awarded $337 in back pay but was
denied health benefits except for disability

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.650
status for one of his two teeth he lost during
WWII.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.130
In 1988, his story came to public attention
through the TV movie, Too Young the Hero.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.699
The publication of his story pushed the government
to review his case and President Ronald Reagan

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:09.100
signed legislation that granted Graham full
disability benefits, increased his back pay

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:16.370
to $4917 and allowed him $18,000 for past
medical bills incurred due to injuries sustained

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.759
while a member of the military.

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.459
However, this was contingent on receipts for
the medical services.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.010
Unfortunately, some of the doctors who treated
him had already died and many medical bills

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.490
were lost, so he only received $2,100 to cover
his former medical expenses.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.260
Calvin Graham died of heart failure in November
of 1992, at his home in Fort Worth, Texas.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.310
At the time of his death, all of his decorations
were reinstated with the exception of the

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.310
Purple Heart.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.690
Two years later, his Purple Heart was reinstated
and presented to his widow at a special ceremony.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.870
He also received the National Defense Service
Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with

00:04:48.870 --> 00:05:06.220
bronze Battle Star device and the WWII Victory
Medal.
