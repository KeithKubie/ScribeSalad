00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.920
Let's try to subtract
9.57 minus 8.09.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.890
So try to pause this video
and figure this out first

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.411
before we work
through it together.

00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:10.910
All right.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.700
Well, let's just rewrite it.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.200
Let's rewrite it.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.836
And when I rewrite it, I
like to line up the decimals.

00:00:17.836 --> 00:00:19.210
This one it's a
little intuitive.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.800
We have 8.09.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.000
Just like that, and now
we're ready to subtract.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.729
And we want to subtract 9
hundredths from 7 hundredths.

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:31.270
Well, we don't have
enough hundredths

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.640
up here so let's move over here.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.150
Let's see if we can do some
regrouping so we always

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.060
have a higher number on top.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.210
So over here we want to
subtract 0 tenths from 5 tenths

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.970
so we have enough
tenths over here.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.460
So let's regroup.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.840
So instead of 5 tenths,
I'm going to have 4 tenths,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.630
and then I'm going to give
that other tenth, which

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.120
is the same thing as 10
hundredths over here,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.250
so this becomes 17 hundredths.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.830
17 minus 9 is 8.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.600
4 minus 0 is 4.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.970
And then I have 9 minus 8 is 1.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.330
So this is going to be 1.48.
