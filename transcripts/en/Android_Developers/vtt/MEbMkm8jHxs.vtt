00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
Developers have
strong opinions when

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.440
it comes to things like
performance and optimization.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.770
So when it came time for
me to launch a series,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.660
I wanted to get involved in
something non-controversial,

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.130
something that we, as
programmers, all agree on,

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.550
without hard feeling or rancor.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.180
Now if I know anything, it's
that like operating systems,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.890
"Star Wars" versus "Star Trek,"
and how to pronounce GIF,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.800
you'll never find
two engineers arguing

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.790
over the ideal developer tools
and development environment.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.660
Take Colt and Ian here.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.240
When using C++, Colt likes
vi and Ian uses Emacs,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.380
but they're still great friends.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.700
In Android Tool Time, I'll
be exploring the world

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.310
of Android developer tools.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.510
I'll focus on Android
Studio, checking out

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.970
new tools, undiscovered
features, pro tips,

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.780
and get expert advice directly
from the Android Studio team.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.600
And of course, we'll go
in-depth into each new release

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.300
of Android Studio,
including finding out

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.710
what's in this entirely
nondescript and non-ominous

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.620
box.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.520
I'm Reto Meier.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.879
Join me on the Android
Developers YouTube channel

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.110
as we talk developer tools,
the least controversial topic

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.760
in computer science.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.300
It's Android Tool Time time.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.850
