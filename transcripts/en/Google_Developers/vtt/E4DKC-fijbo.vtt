00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.990
KEVIN CHIAO: So I
translated some of these

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.050
so that they're more English
friendly for you guys,

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.230
so they might sound
kind of weird.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.730
The first question--
and this is for more

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.830
of the games in Korea and
Japan and the United States--

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.750
is, what are the characteristics
of a successful game for you

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.170
guys?

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.740
Anyone can start.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.590
KH?

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.090
Kho?

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.350
KOH KIM: You want me to start?

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.830
I'll start.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.990
Successful game.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.492
Ultimately, it needs
to be fun, right?

00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:34.450
KEVIN CHIAO: Basically.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.123
KOH KIM: Hey, people over there.

00:00:37.123 --> 00:00:38.537
I'm kidding.

00:00:38.537 --> 00:00:39.870
Well, it needs to be a fun game.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.760
I think a lot of it is
that games, especially

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.590
on our mobile platforms,
have definitely been-- I

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.670
mean, you've seen
the explosive growth.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.210
You've seen how it
has evolved and how

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.240
it's evolved very quickly.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.150
I still remember
three, four years ago

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.220
when "Angry Birds" was
the game, but now you're

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.830
seeing a lot more complicated,
a lot more complex, deeply

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.890
immersive games that you thought
you would see on PC five,

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.690
six years ago, and
it's possible now.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.650
So just the strength
of the hardware,

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.980
mobile broadband penetration,
and in general, just

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.860
people's ability to
develop all these

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.300
really interesting and
high quality experiences

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.560
for a mobile device, but in
the end, a game has to be fun.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.180
Match 3 is nothing new.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.800
Strategy is nothing new.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.210
RPGs are not new.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.540
They've existed
20, 30 years ago.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.260
It's ultimately,
how do you present

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.010
that in a way that's deeply
engaging and fun to the users

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.660
and players of today?

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.380
KH MIN: I agree with Kho that
definitely, high quality,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.810
great content is the number one.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.920
But I would like to mention
that the [INAUDIBLE] games,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.240
I think it needs to be local.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.670
Hard corers, I think the local
event is much more important,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.400
rather than having some
local specific characters.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.470
For example, [INAUDIBLE], when
they launched their games,

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.180
they're really focusing on
doing some local events,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.605
so they really want to
engage with hard core users

00:02:22.605 --> 00:02:25.890
after they install the games.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.880
That event was very
successful, and now

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.060
they still continue to
invest in that local event.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.080
HIROTAKA YOSHITUGU:
And also, adding

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.820
the new functions to the mobile
users from the user perspective

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.030
looks like 3 Match
games in the market,

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.130
there are tons of
the 3 Match games,

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:57.790
so how they decided to use the
3 Match game is just IP stuff.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.130
Or it's more like it looks
fun or something like that.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.860
But once the game
has unique functions,

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.070
like a match player
near the friends,

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.580
then that makes it more unique
in the market in the game side.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.600
That's making it fun,
making the users,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.880
and making revenue as well.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.322
That's the things, I guess.

00:03:24.322 --> 00:03:26.530
KOH KIM: Another thing you
have to really think about

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.480
is it's all about
your community.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.564
Your players are your
biggest advocates,

00:03:30.564 --> 00:03:32.980
are the ones that are going
to go tell their other friends

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.800
to play this game.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.081
I think it's probably
even mandatory.

00:03:39.081 --> 00:03:40.580
I don't think it's
a characteristic.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.871
I now think it's a requirement.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.040
How do you build a game
that's a service, that's

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.010
something that's kind of like
will build that relationship

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.020
with the player?

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.660
If you look at some
of the top games that

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.430
are in any of these
markets, probably outside

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.540
of more of the emerging
and newer markets,

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.800
is that a lot of these
games have been around

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.970
for multiple years.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.740
And that success has been
built upon their ability

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.250
to really understand who their
players are and what they want

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.100
and to actually iterate
and update the games

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.860
and optimize it based on what
the players are asking for.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.350
So that sense of community
and building a community

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.937
is going to be very important.

00:04:21.937 --> 00:04:23.020
KEVIN CHIAO: Thanks, guys.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.840
This next question is for Tony
on Google Play Game Services.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.970
What kind of things
do we need to look out

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.300
for in terms of a successful
Google Play Game Services

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.416
integration?

00:04:36.416 --> 00:04:38.915
You could talk about more the
technical API stuff or you can

00:04:38.915 --> 00:04:41.780
also talk about just in general
for Google Play Game Services,

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.520
too.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.500
TONY CHAN: [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.620
KEVIN CHIAO: Play Game Services.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.780
HIROTAKA YOSHITUGU:
One good example

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.340
from the Japanese market is
[INAUDIBLE] using crowd saving.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.090
It's not actually a
Play Game Services,

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.460
but they are using
crowd saving for saving

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:41.270
the data on the Android,
as well as on the iOS.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:48.520
So users actually are using the
data on the Android and iOS,

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:54.950
so that's a good example of
the Play Game Services as well.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:59.280
KH MIN: And again,
[INAUDIBLE] is

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.690
one of the successful
cases of a going

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.650
global project from Korea.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:08.080
They gave us very
interesting numbers.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.710
They are implementing two APIs.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.470
One is their own API,
and the other one

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.250
is Google Play Game Services.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.420
And they're saying
that actually, they're

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:26.250
very successful globally,
and more than around 80%,

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.350
they are using Google
Play Game Services.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.919
To make users interact
within their games,

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:35.820
I think that Google Play Game
Service is very effective.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:40.010
I think with a global
market, and if you

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:43.580
think of more than
a billion Android

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.960
users as your
customers, then you

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.560
need to think about
Google Play Game Services.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.360
KEVIN CHIAO: KH, this
one's more for you.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.250
Could you talk about
like opportunities,

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.665
because you talk about Com2uS
a lot, and a lot of developers

00:08:59.665 --> 00:09:01.040
are probably
wondering, how do we

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.000
get the same type
of opportunities

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.770
to work with Google Play?

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:10.640
Like in Korea, they
use Com2uS and Japan,

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.670
we work very closely with Mixi.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:15.840
If you want to go
into detail about how

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.310
they go about being able to
have these opportunities to work

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.590
so closely with Google Play.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.820
KH MIN: [INAUDIBLE] marketing?

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.330
KEVIN CHIAO: On the marketing
side, those kinds of things.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:26.810
HIROTAKA YOSHITUGU:
Relationship side.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:27.935
KEVIN CHIAO: Relationships.

00:09:27.935 --> 00:09:28.590
Yeah.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:32.660
So you could talk about the
co-promotion with gift cards

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.740
and stuff like that.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.580
KH MIN: Everyone is talking
about featuring games,

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:41.250
featuring applications
within the Google Play Store.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.490
I think that is one of
our in store marketing,

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:53.210
but we are also helping our
great content at Google Play

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.987
to be shown out of store.

00:09:56.987 --> 00:09:59.070
For example, when we
launched the Google Play gift

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:05.180
card in Hong Kong,
we worked with Com2uS

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.100
and then our marketing teams.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:12.000
And then actually, we
wrapped the CVS in Hong Kong.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.090
We featured our Google Play gift
card and their games offline.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.210
Actually, the campaign
was super successful,

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:24.180
and then we launched our
Google Play gift card in Korea

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.050
in November.

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:29.880
And then actually, we wrapped
the pillars of the major subway

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:36.270
stations with Google Play
gift card and game titles.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:40.295
Actually, we really want
to try to provide some out

00:10:40.295 --> 00:10:45.120
of store marketing
opportunities for our developers

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.030
once you develop really,
really great content.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.430
HIROTAKA YOSHITUGU: It's
almost the same in Japan, too.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.380
Good contents bring
in the good users,

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.740
and we like to encourage
those contents to expand

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.540
to more users.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.840
KH MIN: Same in Taiwan
and Hong Kong as well.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.130
We also do a lot with Six Waves,
we did a promo code campaign,

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:11.490
where they went to Ocean
Park and handed out.

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:15.240
Tony, you can probably talk
more about that if you want.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:48.427
TONY CHAN: [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:11:48.427 --> 00:11:50.010
KEVIN CHIAO: This
question is for Koh.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.560
What are common strategies
for successfully launching

00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:01.990
a game in a Western market?

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:05.430
We call EUAME, which is
a combination of Europe

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:06.140
and America.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.780
KOH KIM: Well, it's really
not that much different.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:21.280
Here in Japan, in
Korea and Asia,

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.790
you see a lot more out of
home and all that stuff,

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.820
and actually, I'm slowly seeing
a lot of that in the United

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:27.446
States as well.

00:12:27.446 --> 00:12:29.278
A lot of these game
companies are coming out

00:12:29.278 --> 00:12:30.880
with much bigger
marketing campaigns

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.610
that's largely online.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.350
But it ultimately is
really finding out

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.240
and getting user feedback
directly because a lot

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.450
of these users do live online.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.970
And so it's just finding
the right communities,

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:49.100
the right sources and channels
to touch in and figure out,

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.480
hey, how am I going to get
the users to install the game,

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.800
and also how am I going to
continue to engage users

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.110
in a way to get them to
feel empowered to talk more

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.120
about my game?

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.520
So looking at what your
social mechanics are

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.310
within the game in
terms of orality

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.020
and how people are
going to share content

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.480
and their progress
to other players,

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.780
also hitting the
right communities,

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.760
whether it's on Reddit
or if it's on YouTube,

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.926
or whether that's on Twitch.

00:13:14.926 --> 00:13:17.440
There's tons of other,
all of these video game

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.932
focused communities that a
lot of these players are on.

00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:21.890
So it's just really
understanding your own game

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:22.710
genre [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.920
Clearly, you want to make sure
that whatever your users are

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.260
going to share is going to
be very relevant to the game

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.960
but also is going to be engaging
or attractive to other users.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.730
Within the US, a lot of
it's online marketing.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.000
I've seen some interesting
things done with video

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.480
in terms of video sharing,
live streaming, also

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.840
work with more of the YouTube
stars and celebrities.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.350
So a lot of it is just
understanding just

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:49.160
like any user, the
users live online.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.300
It's just finding out
where online they see,

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:55.595
and then making sure your
game is in that channel.

00:13:55.595 --> 00:13:56.970
HIROTAKA YOSHITUGU:
Video sharing

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.852
is getting bigger in the US?

00:13:58.852 --> 00:13:59.560
KOH KIM: Oh yeah.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.530
It's very big in the US.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:01.200
HIROTAKA YOSHITUGU:
Is it common?

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.440
KOH KIM: It's pretty common.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.330
HIROTAKA YOSHITUGU: Do you
have to implement video sharing

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:04.829
functions?

00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:06.920
KOH KIM: It's not
have to, but videos

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:13.130
tend to convert users a lot
higher than still images.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:14.770
HIROTAKA YOSHITUGU:
How about Korea?

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.805
KH MIN: The YouTube
creators, actually they

00:14:16.805 --> 00:14:19.920
are developing
their own content.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.207
Individual content creators,
they're introducing games,

00:14:23.207 --> 00:14:24.790
and they're playing
games, and they're

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.970
sharing that video clips.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.780
It's getting super,
super popular.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.700
So actually, the
YouTube creators,

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.090
they are becoming celebrities.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.070
We figured out,
many gamers, they

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:43.905
are watching that kind of
video, and it's a great way

00:14:43.905 --> 00:14:47.410
of engaging with the users.

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:51.380
HIROTAKA YOSHITUGU: In Japan,
YouTube is getting popular,

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:56.160
and also, video sharing function
is getting popular, too.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.840
Some top level players implement
the share function or the share

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.710
videos, playing videos.

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:10.110
There are two popular
SDKs in Japan right now,

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.220
one domestic and one overseas.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.470
KEVIN CHIAO: That kind of
leads into my next question.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.136
This will probably
be our last question,

00:15:17.136 --> 00:15:19.520
but this is one from the
audience that was in the box.

00:15:22.042 --> 00:15:23.500
We talked about
AdMob, and everyone

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.083
knows about user
acquisition, but they

00:15:25.083 --> 00:15:28.220
are asking, what are
some non-paying ways

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.560
to promote your
apps on Google Play?

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.750
So without spending money
on user acquisition,

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:38.182
what are some ways to promote
your app on Google Play?

00:15:38.182 --> 00:15:39.890
Video sharing can be
one of those, right?

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:41.931
KOH KIM: Video sharing,
building out communities.

00:15:41.931 --> 00:15:44.820
Social media has actually been
a very interesting channel

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:48.290
for organic user acquisition,
mostly because it's

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:54.570
a lot closer to-- I think
video gamers tend to be very,

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.680
very engaged fans.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.110
They like to share
their content,

00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:59.950
they like to talk
about it, they like

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.489
to tell other people that
they should play their game

00:16:02.489 --> 00:16:03.280
and a lot of stuff.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.363
So social media becomes a
very interesting aspect,

00:16:05.363 --> 00:16:07.090
and we're not just
talking video.

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:10.260
We're talking about all the
common places-- Twitter,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:15.110
Facebook, even to some
extent G+ and all that stuff.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.470
But really, it's knowing where
these users are congregating

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:19.770
and talking about your game.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.200
And a lot of them
are just talking

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.840
about-- you see people
create their own fan sites

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.005
on the web about these games.

00:16:27.005 --> 00:16:28.380
You see this with
"Call of Duty."

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.630
We see this with a lot
of the big console games.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:33.950
I'm seeing a lot of this even
happening on the mobile side

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:34.660
as well.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.780
And so building out
these communities,

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.320
building out your brand so that
people can interact with it,

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.550
but then they have
a forum and a place

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.062
to interact with
other players that

00:16:44.062 --> 00:16:45.645
also enjoy the game
is going to become

00:16:45.645 --> 00:16:48.687
a very powerful way to engage
users and empower them to talk.

00:16:48.687 --> 00:16:50.270
KEVIN CHIAO: Do you
guys have anything

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:54.345
to add, non-paying ways?

00:16:54.345 --> 00:16:55.470
KOH KIM: Besides featuring.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:56.720
KEVIN CHIAO: Getting featured.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.270
This is something we
didn't talk on a lot.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:04.769
I think I drew about 10 of
these questions that said,

00:17:04.769 --> 00:17:05.560
[SPEAKING CHINESE].

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:15.550
There is no definitive answer.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.200
There is no, if
you do everything,

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.819
you will get featured list.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:22.119
However, we do urge
everyone-- Tony touched on it

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:25.960
earlier in his core app quality
on developer.Android.com.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.710
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.320
Best practices.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.940
So that's all we have for today.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.600
Is Summer going to
come up and tell us

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.805
what's going to happen next?

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:31.630
Summer?

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:35.230
I think we're going to break the
wall down and have some drinks.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:38.170
SUMMER: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
