problem that interests you and taking

problem that interests you and taking
 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.530
problem that interests you and taking
one component of that problem and going

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540
one component of that problem and going
 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.710
one component of that problem and going
into it a great depth so for example on

focuses only on color and simplifies the

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770
focuses only on color and simplifies the
 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.820
focuses only on color and simplifies the
color pattern and yet we get a powerful

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830
color pattern and yet we get a powerful
 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.820
color pattern and yet we get a powerful
response to it and this is yeah correct

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830
response to it and this is yeah correct
 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.350
response to it and this is yeah correct
me if I'm wrong but the way I'm thinking

of your work with sea snails you know

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180
of your work with sea snails you know
 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.210
of your work with sea snails you know
you are trying to understand the complex

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220
you are trying to understand the complex
 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.390
you are trying to understand the complex
phenomenon of

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400

by looking at a relatively simple
nervous system but your goal is to

nervous system but your goal is to
 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.930
nervous system but your goal is to
understand that phenomenon whereas the

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940
understand that phenomenon whereas the
 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.749
understand that phenomenon whereas the
artists that you describe what they're

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759
artists that you describe what they're
 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.040
artists that you describe what they're
trying to do seems to be less about

speak to that of it yes I mean you
 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.029
speak to that of it yes I mean you
described it perfectly reductionism need

the whole artistic capability critically
 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.350

creative experience that parallels in a
 

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.630
creative experience that parallels in a
very modest way the creativity of the

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:33.640
very modest way the creativity of the
 

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.610
very modest way the creativity of the
artist and why is that interesting I

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:35.620
artist and why is that interesting I
 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.480

don't know whether you've had that
 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.450
don't know whether you've had that
experience but certainly I find when I

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:39.460
experience but certainly I find when I

people who respond to it is that it

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:51.820
people who respond to it is that it
 

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.060
people who respond to it is that it
gives you lots of room for your own

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:54.070
gives you lots of room for your own
 

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.220

he said I'll give up anything else but

he said I'll give up anything else but
 

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:11.710
he said I'll give up anything else but
the speed of light and by doing so he

the speed of light and by doing so he
 

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.199
the speed of light and by doing so he
gave up on the absolute nature of space

00:11:14.199 --> 00:11:14.209

well I mean in in a sense it isn't quite
 

00:11:38.199 --> 00:11:39.749
well I mean in in a sense it isn't quite
a reductionist approach but it's

00:11:39.749 --> 00:11:39.759
a reductionist approach but it's
 

00:11:39.759 --> 00:11:42.150
a reductionist approach but it's

the whole progress of physics is to

the whole progress of physics is to

the whole progress of physics is to

start with our everyday experience and
 

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.630
start with our everyday experience and
to analyze it and look at it and look

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640
to analyze it and look at it and look
 

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.659
to analyze it and look at it and look
for deviations from it so the very

were coming up with theories but they

were coming up with theories but they
 

00:30:48.529 --> 00:30:50.409
were coming up with theories but they
were not testing them right this has

right I mean they had all these theories

00:30:58.510 --> 00:30:58.520
right I mean they had all these theories
 

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.220
right I mean they had all these theories
that they weren't able to test without

that they weren't able to test without

science it was a little bit different

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:11.720
science it was a little bit different
 

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.510

because they could test it but they

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:13.520
because they could test it but they
 

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.250
because they could test it but they
didn't think of doing it they didn't

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:15.260
didn't think of doing it they didn't
 

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:17.529
didn't think of doing it they didn't
think it was necessary I say to test the

think it was necessary I say to test the
 

00:31:17.539 --> 00:31:19.240
think it was necessary I say to test the
theory but the fact is we can develop a

theory but the fact is we can develop a
 

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.549

now this is a prediction let's run an

now this is a prediction let's run an
 

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.139
now this is a prediction let's run an
experiment to test that prediction which

00:31:26.139 --> 00:31:26.149
experiment to test that prediction which
 

00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:28.180

science you talked a little bit about

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:30.130
science you talked a little bit about
 

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:32.460
science you talked a little bit about
but in your book about how brain science

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:32.470
but in your book about how brain science
 

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:36.150

these people coming along developing
molecular biology and so the approaches

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:45.820
molecular biology and so the approaches
 

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.520
molecular biology and so the approaches
of molecular biology cloning gene

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:47.530

get rid of this particular protein so
 

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:03.450
get rid of this particular protein so
this put brain science and a completely
