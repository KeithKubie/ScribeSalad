00:00:10.252 --> 00:00:11.710
Today we're going
to talk about how

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.790
one goes beyond the basic
education and college degree

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.440
into the world of
lifelong learning.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.740
In the past, with a good
education under your belt,

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.950
you could hope that
your employer would

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.990
take responsibility
for providing more

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.040
training and ongoing education.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.150
But in today's world
of work, there's

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.110
less training that's
provided by employers.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.430
So it's more important
for individuals

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.540
to think about what
they need to do

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.430
to take care of their
lifelong learning needs.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.370
That means you have
to have a strategy.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.390
So let's start with
those in high school.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.360
In high school the
message that we emphasize

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.680
is that it's important to
stay in school, to work hard,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.750
to graduate in good standing.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.040
Nothing is more
important than that.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.620
If you can while you
are in high school

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.630
get internships, co-op jobs,
part-time jobs in the summer

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.220
or even during the school
year if that's possible

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.280
so that you can begin to see
what the world of work is like.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.460
Maybe you can meet some
people who are good role

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.760
models in the workplace.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.060
Maybe you can test whether you
are really interested in one

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.660
kind of a job or another.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.730
Maybe you can get
some technical skills

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.720
that will help you identify
what you really are good at.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.510
Let me give you the
advice of Dr. James

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.730
Fico, an industrial
psychologist who

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.410
works with employers to match
good, talented young people

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.110
with the jobs that
are available.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.000
Dr. Fico says, "There are plenty
of good jobs in my sectors--

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.030
manufacturing and
law enforcement.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.910
Retirements are creating
lots of opportunities.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.790
Employers expect much more
of their employees today

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.380
than at anytime in my memory.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.180
They want technical skills, and
they want a much higher caliber

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.620
of job readiness and character.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.750
Students' best bet
is to find mentors

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.870
for whom they can learn from
over a longer period of time."

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.150
And employers want a great
deal of the following.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.140
They want courage.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.190
They want integrity.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.090
They want a devotion to
the job and a commitment

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.580
to really doing a great job.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.240
They want a vision
for the future of what

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.660
the work might look like.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.320
They want a commitment
to working in teams.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.840
And, yes, of course, they
want technical competence.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.600
The first four of these are
the most desired and maybe

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.020
the hardest to find, according
to Dr. Fico, regardless

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.280
of the age of the applicant.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.400
But then he goes
on to say that "I

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.550
find that the most critical
language of the workplace today

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.570
is the language of math."

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.160
A thorough knowledge of
arithmetic, he says, yes,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.280
he means basic math--
algebra, geometry,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.210
basic adding and subtracting--

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.840
would do more for
business success

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.410
than any other single discipline
outside of the character

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.010
features mentioned earlier.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.670
Remember that "the best
mathematicians in the United

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.100
States led us into this
recession a few years ago

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.770
because they didn't
understand the numbers

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.539
they were working with and
how to really calculate risk."

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:18.080
What about those of
you who are going

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.140
to go on for technical
degrees in community colleges

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.170
after high school?

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.920
Well, here the key, from all
kinds of research and evidence,

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.280
is that the most
important thing to do

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.720
is to look for programs that
are well-linked to the employers

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.850
in your region and in the
industry you want to work in.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.140
Employers working with
community colleges

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.750
and vocational schools,
designing the curriculum

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.680
together, providing advice
and mentoring for students,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.930
and then helping to make
sure that the skills that

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.110
are being taught are the modern
skills needed on the job.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.720
The second feature
is to make sure

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.350
that these programs that
you choose mix classroom

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.680
experience in teaching with
on-the-job opportunities

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.970
to apply those skills and to see
the relevance of the material

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.420
that you are learning in
the classroom first hand.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.680
The third feature of a
successful community college

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.910
and vocational
school is that they

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.899
have success in
placing graduates

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:20.140
not only in that first
job but with employers

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.530
who have career pathways,
that is job ladders that allow

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.000
people to continue to learn
and to advance over time

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.440
and maybe to come back for
refresher courses as needed.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.120
How about college graduates
and college students?

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.280
Well, the thing to do here
is to make sure again,

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.110
like in high school, one gains
experience while in school,

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.980
looking for those summer
internships or co-op

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.250
placements in schools
that provide that,

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.300
so that you can really start to
build your professional network

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.680
while you're still in school.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.170
And again, test
whether you are really

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.370
well-suited for
different kinds of jobs.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.250
Then it's important to seek
out mentors on your first job.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:09.030
The evidence is very clear that
having a supervisor or a mentor

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.430
from somewhere else in
the organization that

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.770
helps you learn the
ropes and can then

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.280
vouch for you for other
jobs as they come along

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.210
is really critical to
your future success

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.080
in that organization.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.870
It's important that
you pursue outside

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.460
educational opportunities.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.710
Take advantage of
all the universities,

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.090
like MIT and other great
schools, that are now providing

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.840
online learning opportunities
so that you can deepen

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.870
your knowledge and broaden
out your professional base

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.220
over time.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.730
It's also important
that you maintain

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.710
your professional networks
and your contacts over time.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.760
Make sure that you are
interacting with your peers.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.590
Ask your employers to make sure
that you have opportunities

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.960
to go to professional meetings
and to stay current in what

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.270
is going on and
build those networks

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.700
so that you have others who are
sharing the same experiences,

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.520
and you are learning together.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.950
And then finally, it's
always important to keep

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.130
that resume up to date.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.710
Keep one foot in the
external labor market

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.570
because you never
know when you will

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.790
have to draw on it for looking
for your next opportunity.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.310
So I believe we are in a world
where lifelong learning now

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.750
becomes critical to
long-term career success.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.730
Start by picking an
occupation, a profession that

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.020
is of interest to you.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.190
And then keep working on
your career over time,

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.960
testing yourself.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.370
Am I staying current?

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.960
Can I find a job in
my profession outside

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.320
of my current employer?

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.900
And do I keep my network
strong and up to date

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.750
so that I can draw on the
assistance of other people as

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.300
needed?
