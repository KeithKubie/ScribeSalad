00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.660
Hi I'm Jules
And I'm Julian

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.800
And I've been growing my beard for 8 hours (months).

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.800
What?!

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.000
Minutes!

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.160
Hi there follicly challenged friends, Jules
here for Dnews.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.220
Its 2016, and beards have become ubiquitous.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.920
Forcing hundreds of hairs out of the bottom
of your face has almost become a prerequisite

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.510
in hip cities like Brooklyn, Portland, or
San Francisco.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.832
But that’s not really fair to everyone who
isn’t like me, and physically can’t grow

00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:29.390
a full or thick beard.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.020
As pre-pubescent boys, we lived to hope that
one day we’d be able to rock a giant face

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.020
warmer.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.520
We were even counterintuitively told to shave,
so that the hair would come in faster and

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.520
thicker.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.100
There are a lot of obvious reasons that’s
not in any way true, but we still optimistically

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.100
did it.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.370
Sadly, the fact is, not everyone can grow
a beard, and even those that can have varying

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.510
levels of success.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.260
So, is there some trick, or medication, or
just a dang explanation to make up for the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.510
beard variety?

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.780
Your first inclination may be to say, “Well,
it’s testosterone and men with more testosterone

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.039
grow better beards”.

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.100
But that’s not quite right.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.130
Testosterone is part of a group of hormones
called androgens, which regulate sexual development.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.540
Specifically, testosterone regulates, among
a ton of other things, what we call, “male

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.370
secondary sex characteristics”.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.580
That covers physical attributes usually associated
with men, but which are not directly involved

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.580
in reproduction.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.620
Sure, beards are sexy, but you don’t have
sex with them.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.950
So, testosterone is the reason men (and some
women) have facial hair, more muscle mass,

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.600
deeper voices and so on.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.390
But that’s NOT the reason some men can’t
grow beards.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.600
Here’s the tricky part: testosterone levels
on their own don’t predict hair growth;

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.950
in fact, the chemical you’re really looking
for is called dihydrotestosterone, or DHT,

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.650
which is basically a super potent form of
testosterone that induces both beard growth

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.140
and also… hair loss.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.640
And the trickier thing?

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.860
Whether or not you can grow a beard, and whether
or not your hair falls out, is determined

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.020
almost entirely by the number of androgen
receptors in the upper layer of your skin.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.810
The more androgen receptors you have, the
more DHT will bind to them, and more hair

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.420
will appear on the lower half of your head,
and less on the upper half.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.840
The reason that the same chemical causes exactly
opposite results is because there is different

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.470
gene expression based on the different types
of hair follicles.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.480
Unfortunately for my beardless or balding
buddies, the number of androgen receptors

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.030
you have seems to be ultimately decided by
genetics.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.260
And while there are medications that can lower
the amount of DHT in your body, which is how

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.950
some people fight male-pattern baldness, there
is little you can do to boost your number

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.870
of androgen receptors to the point where you
turn a baby-face into a lumberjack.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.670
That’s not to say you can’t increase them,
studies show it is possible, it is just unlikely

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.050
to have a serious effect on beard growth.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.630
But of course, there are exceptions.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.550
Men with plenty of androgen receptors and
DHT can end up developing alopecia areata,

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.700
a skin disease that attacks hair follicles,
and results in large bald patches on the beard

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.700
or scalp.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.090
Luckily, it’s treatable.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.130
There are also some women who are able to
growth dark, thick facial hair as a result

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.540
of a condition called “hirsutism”.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.280
Just as in men, this can occur if the woman
has too many androgen receptors along with

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.750
higher levels of testosterone, which women
already naturally produce in small amounts.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.480
And female facial hair is not uncommon; roughly
5% of women in the US have hirsutism.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.150
But in the end, I’m sorry to say, if you’re
a man in your 20s, and you’re still struggling

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.710
to complete the lumberlook, then you’ll
likely be struggling for the rest of your

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.710
life.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.319
At least be happy that you probably won’t
go bald anytime soon.

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.959
And for those of you who are both scraggly
AND balding, my deepest condolences.

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.770
Write your parent’s genetics a strongly,
stronly worded letter.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.930

your beach bod looks.
