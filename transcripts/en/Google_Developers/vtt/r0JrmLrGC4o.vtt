KORY JEFFREY: Hello, everybody.

00:00:01.305 --> 00:00:04.070
We are in San Francisco
at Founder World.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.120
I'm joined in the studio by
Kevin Holmes, the founder

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.537
and CEO of Founder Network.

00:00:08.537 --> 00:00:09.870
Kevin, thank you for joining me.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.860
KEVIN HOLMES: Thanks
for having me.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.318
KORY JEFFREY: So let's start
with, what is Founder Network?

00:00:13.318 --> 00:00:14.310
KEVIN HOLMES: Sure.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.890
So Founders Network is a peer
mentorship organization of 500

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.780
plus tech startup founders.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.040
In three words, it's
founders helping founders.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.957
KORY JEFFREY: So what
does that entail?

00:00:25.957 --> 00:00:27.540
KEVIN HOLMES: Well,
like I said, we're

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.020
a peer mentorship organization.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.690
So the way I unpack
that is advice

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.290
based on experience, warm
introductions, and then

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.190
moral support.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.550
And so the way we facilitate
that is we have a platform.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.790
We have a custom platform
that we push weekly updates

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.140
to-- a very engaging platform
with 90% monthly active users.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.395
People are using
the forum there.

00:00:49.395 --> 00:00:52.160
It's email based interactions.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.940
And they're asking for help and
receiving help all the time.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.730
And then in addition to that,
we do over 100 events a year,

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.590
mainly in San Francisco,
Silicon Valley, and New York,

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.230
but also in Vancouver and
other emerging markets.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.750
And then the third thing is we
have a staff of eight people.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.124
So we're always
looking at how we

00:01:10.124 --> 00:01:13.681
can facilitate the network for
the members of the community.

00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:16.830
KORY JEFFREY: And
these are founders,

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.220
so they have started their
own full time company.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.760
They have founded it themselves.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.593
KEVIN HOLMES: Right.

00:01:22.593 --> 00:01:25.700
So one of the aspects
of Founders Network

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.617
is if you're going to
receive peer mentorship,

00:01:27.617 --> 00:01:29.783
you want to make sure that
it's from people who know

00:01:29.783 --> 00:01:31.000
what they're talking about.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.190
So there's a ton of
great resources out there

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.500
and a lot of great information
about how to do things.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.120
"The Lean Startup" is a
really well known book

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.690
that's often quoted
chapter and verse, almost.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.670
But what we're really focused on
is actually creating liquidity

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.710
around the expertise of
the members in the network.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.960
And so we want to make sure
they have good experience.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.440
So we basically have
three membership criteria.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.240
You have to be a founder.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.190
It has to be a tech startup that
you're working on full time--

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.160
so you've taken
the leap and you're

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.000
committed to making it succeed.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.940
And then the third
thing is that you're

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.190
invited by a current member.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.764
So we are invite only.

00:02:09.764 --> 00:02:11.120
KORY JEFFREY: Very cool.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.730
So the membership base
probably centered around

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.760
where you do events,
but sounds like it's

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.544
international as well?

00:02:17.544 --> 00:02:18.710
KEVIN HOLMES: Good question.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.211
Most of our members are
based in the tech hubs--

00:02:22.211 --> 00:02:24.210
sort of what you do if
you're in Silicon Valley.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.043
You start a company.

00:02:25.043 --> 00:02:27.370
That's kind of the
expected route in life.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.730
You don't buy a home.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.190
We also have probably
20% of our membership

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.776
that's located all over.

00:02:33.776 --> 00:02:35.150
And because we
have the platform,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.880
they can engage online.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.580
They don't have to jump
in a car or a plane

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.820
and fly to Silicon Valley.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.340
They can get help
from other members

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.307
without leaving their
screen, basically.

00:02:47.307 --> 00:02:48.140
KORY JEFFREY: Right.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.140
So do you have any favorite
stories about things

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.110
that have happened
on the platform

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.909
that you're really proud of?

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:55.700
KEVIN HOLMES: Yeah.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.640
So one of my favorite
stories is we

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.480
have a feature called
anonymous posting,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.350
where you can post
to the network

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.500
without revealing your identity.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.919
And by and large,
we don't use it,

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.710
because it's a closed
community, and people

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.160
feel comfortable sharing
how they're feeling

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.340
and what they're working on
and those types of things.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.800
But in this case, a member
was dealing with depression.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.070
And so it was sort
of an edgy topic.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.670
And people aren't always
open about talking

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.064
about those things.

00:03:23.064 --> 00:03:24.730
More and more they
are, and that's good.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.563
That's a good thing.

00:03:25.563 --> 00:03:27.720
There's been a lot of talk
about founder suicide.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.259
And Brad Feld of Techstars
has talked about that a lot.

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:32.800
But this member
talked about the fact

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.310
that he couldn't get
out of bed for five days

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.950
and had to tell his team.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:38.829
Do I tell my team?

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:39.620
Do I not tell them?

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.420
They're going to
know something's up.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.030
What do I do?

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.070
We have 500 members.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.550
At least 50 people
replied on that thread.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.140
And when you reply there,
you can't reply anonymously.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.940
You have to come out
and say who you are.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.110
And so many members said,
hey, I have depression, too.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.530
I treat it like a handicap.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.410
Here's how I deal with it.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.220
It was my favorite moment
in four years of doing this.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.900
It was so cool to see the
support and the community

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.060
and the realness of that, that
potentially saved this person's

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.440
life.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.340
But also, everybody
else that had that

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.740
and is struggling with that
was able to talk about it.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.870
So by far, that was my favorite
moment in four and a half years

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:21.480
of doing this.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.271
KORY JEFFREY: That is
a pretty good moment.

00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:24.890
I think that's an
awesome moment.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:25.750
So Founder World.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.500
KEVIN HOLMES: Yes.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.583
KORY JEFFREY: Besides
sharing the name of Founder,

00:04:28.583 --> 00:04:30.240
what has attracted
you to this event?

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.240
KEVIN HOLMES: Well, it's
a relatively new event.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.530
I think it's the
first year doing this.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.285
And when we saw
the opportunity, we

00:04:36.285 --> 00:04:38.730
thought, what a
great way to connect.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.369
Founders Network, our members
are founders of startups.

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:42.910
In fact, many of
them are here today.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.860
So other people
that exhibited today

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.270
are members of Founders Network.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.340
We have over 500 members.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.390
This year, they're on
track to raise $250 million

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.470
in funding as a community.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.310
So all stages, but also
really experienced.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.660
So some of them are up on stage.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.050
Some of them are exhibiting.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.752
Some of them are just attending
very early stage as attendees.

00:05:02.752 --> 00:05:04.210
So it's sort of a
no brainer for us

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.647
to be here and be part of it.

00:05:05.647 --> 00:05:06.980
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah, makes sense.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.310
So obviously, with having
that strong of a network,

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.496
you're going to have an awesome
cross section of technologies

00:05:12.496 --> 00:05:14.270
that you kind of
get insight into.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.740
Is there anything in particular
that excites you right now?

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.550
KEVIN HOLMES: Yeah.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.790
One of the things I think is
cutting edge and exciting,

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.020
and also a little bit
potentially scary,

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.580
is this Knightscopes Technology.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.860
And this is a member of Founders
Network, William Li, Bill Li.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.370
He's a former automotive
industry executive.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.925
And he started post-9/11, he
wanted to enhance security.

00:05:37.925 --> 00:05:42.860
And so he's built sort
of an R2D2 mobile robot.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.200
And it's awesome to see.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.580
It's really friendly and cool.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.450
And I think if
anybody's going to help

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.790
bring robotic
security to market,

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.555
it's going to be Bill Li.

00:05:53.555 --> 00:05:55.310
So it's very exciting to see.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.810
Of course, there's always
the tinfoil hat conspiracy

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:59.310
theories.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:00.170
KORY JEFFREY: But
it's cool to see, too.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.965
Because they're actually
out front right now, right?

00:06:01.965 --> 00:06:02.710
KEVIN HOLMES: Yeah.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.001
They're securing the perimeter.

00:06:04.001 --> 00:06:06.060
KORY JEFFREY: They're
securing the perimeter.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.420
That's awesome.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.244
Favorite Google technology?

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:10.910
KEVIN HOLMES: You
know, that's something

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.080
that I could debate,
I suppose, for hours.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.420
But I'd say Gmail by far and
away is what I use the most.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.480
I had an argument or
a debate with someone

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.920
about-- they would say Calendar
is more important than Gmail

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.650
and is the anchor for
stickiness for Gmail,

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.714
which I thought was
an interesting case.

00:06:31.714 --> 00:06:34.620
And then, of course, there's
search, which you almost

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.537
don't even think of it.

00:06:36.537 --> 00:06:37.620
KORY JEFFREY: That's cool.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.720
Well Kevin, thank you very
much for joining me here.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.340
KEVIN HOLMES: Thanks
for having me.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.690
KORY JEFFREY: Awesome.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:40.980
KEVIN HOLMES: Pleasure.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.854
KORY JEFFREY: And thank
you guys for joining.

00:06:42.854 --> 00:06:47.080
We're at Founders World in
San Francisco, and I am Kory.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.830
