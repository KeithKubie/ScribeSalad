00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.180
IKAI LAN: All right.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.840
Eric is leaning over
right now.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.770
Good morning, everybody, or
afternoon, or evening, or late

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.700
night, wherever you're
calling in from.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.650
My name is Ikai Lan.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:13.970
ERIC KOLEDA: And I'm
Eric Koleda.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.120
IKAI LAN: And we are here today
to talk about Google

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.180
Apps Script.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.100
This is a series of live
broadcasts that we're doing,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.870
and you'll see that we've got
this fancy new studio now.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.520
We announced it last time, and
I'm so thrilled to be here

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.060
every single time.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.760
So Eric, what's new?

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.570
What's the word?

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.080
ERIC KOLEDA: It's been another
week in Apps Script.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.160
I'd say the exciting revelation
of this week has

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.180
been there's been a blog post
out on using Apps Script with

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.300
Google Analytics combining the
two into a super awesome

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.410
mashup, which has really
gone viral.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.180
I've seen tons of post about
it on Google+, on Twitter,

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.140
blog posts about it.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.220
I think we're really meeting a
big demand here, which is that

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.070
people use Analytics, love
it, and they want to do

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.500
even more with it.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.250
They want to automate it.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.415
They want to do scripting
around it.

00:00:55.415 --> 00:00:56.240
So that's been really huge.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.820
IKAI LAN: I feel like this is
one thing we're totally

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.890
piggybacking off the
Analytics, because

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.730
Analytics is huge.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.290
ERIC KOLEDA: Oh, yeah.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.300
IKAI LAN: It's one of the
largest properties we have, I

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.370
would say, in the world.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.285
And by pushing out this blog
post, we realize that a lot of

00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:10.890
people want to do a lot
more with Analytics.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.905
They want to take the product,
and they want to integrate it

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:14.720
with spreadsheets because you
might want to do custom

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.010
formulas and things like that.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.730
And as soon as you get into Apps
Script world, suddenly

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.690
you can integrate with a whole
variety of Google APIs.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.140
And I think that what we're
seeing with the blog posts is

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.630
really just the beginning
of a lot of what

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.570
developers can do with that.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.060
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.000
I mean, Analytics, I use
it a personally.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.070
There's like a million and one
options of reports you can

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.940
generate, ways you can
segment data, right?

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.470
But even still, people are
mining even more information

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.870
out of there.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.040
And with Google Apps Script, it
really allows you to build

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.320
custom dashboards.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.570
We have dashboard functionality

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.060
and charts and graphs.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.210
You can email out reports.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.600
You can generate PDFs.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.060
So really, it allows for people
to kind of customize,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.080
down to the very nitty gritty,
exactly the data that they

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.260
want to see.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.300
IKAI LAN: I really want to
encourage all of you out there

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.150
to take a look at this blog post
because we're trying to--

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.700
we'd love to see more Apps
Script applications in the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.570
Chrome Web Store.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.639
And I have a gut feeling that
tells me if you were to build

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.240
a really compelling application
on top of Google

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.340
Analytics, that you would
suddenly skyrocket to the top.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.180
ERIC KOLEDA: That's
a good point.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.490
I mean, building something just
yourself, that's great.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.320
And it's going to
help you out.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.780
But now with the Google Chrome
Web Store, you can really take

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.200
the work you've done, package
it up, and deliver it to the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.080
whole world in a way that they
can just, one, click install,

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.000
and then get going with it.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.770
I think the blog post this week
just showed how important

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.060
analytics are and how using Apps
Script in analytics can

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.770
really be a path to success.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.510
IKAI LAN: So we've got a good
show for you guys today.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.860
What we're going to do is we're
going to talk a little

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.640
bit about what's going on.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.460
We've got a couple of questions
in the live

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.640
Moderator queue, so we're going
to go through those.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.540
And after that, we're going to
take some questions from the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.230
audience and just discuss a few
things that are going on.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.540
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.350
IKAI LAN: What do you
think about that?

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.180
ERIC KOLEDA: Sounds great.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.270
IKAI LAN: We're acting as if
we hadn't planned this out.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.476
But let's go ahead
and get started.

00:03:01.476 --> 00:03:02.320
ERIC KOLEDA: All right.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.570
So do you want to jump
to the questions?

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.790
I mean, I think we showed the
blog post already and talked

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:06.280
about that.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.941
I don't know if you had
any other comments.

00:03:08.941 --> 00:03:09.360
IKAI LAN: Not me.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.940
ERIC KOLEDA: That was kind
of the big news.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.100
So we normally have a release
every week, and part of this

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.500
show is talking about
the release notes.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.440
But this week, quiet.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.710
The release didn't really
have anything in it.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.960
So we don't have anything, new
features to discuss or bug

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.870
fixes, but keep staying on top
of the issue tracker, looking

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.630
out for any bugs that you
reported, or new features

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.140
you'd like to see.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.712
And hopefully next week we'll
be back with more

00:03:27.712 --> 00:03:29.950
news on that front.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.230
Let's jump into the Moderator
then and take some questions.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.850
IKAI LAN: So I've done a little
bit of preparation.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.710
I've looked at some of these
questions ahead of time.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.260
So I've answered them in the
comments, but we're going to

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.700
go through these live anyway,
just if we want to elaborate a

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.115
little bit more about
some of the answers,

00:03:45.115 --> 00:03:46.785
and stuff like that.

00:03:46.785 --> 00:03:48.350
ERIC KOLEDA: Let me just get
that queued up over here.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.750
IKAI LAN: While we're pulling
that up, I want to encourage,

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.180
if you get a chance to watch
our live Hangout, and we do

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.660
invite developers into
joining our Hangout.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.640
But what we need to do
is on Google+ we

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.730
need to encircle you.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.430
I think that's the
verb now, right?

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.210
We encircle you?

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.010
ERIC KOLEDA: Encircle, yes.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.730
IKAI LAN: That's not
creepy at all.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.100
It's not an official term.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.650
It's just one that
we've been using.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.640
But after we add you, let us
know that you're a Google Apps

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.980
Script developer, and
we will add you.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.899
And when we do have these
Office Hours,

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:20.680
we can invite you.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.459
You can jump on.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.450
You can say hi.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.180
We've got a couple of regulars
that jump on.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.840
We love seeing you guys, and
we love talking to you guys

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.710
about what you're up to.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.120
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.805
I mean, obviously, if you jump
on, you're going to need a web

00:04:28.805 --> 00:04:29.430
cam and a mic.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.550
So if you don't have that or
you're not comfortable, the

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.200
Moderator page that we have set
up allows you to at least

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.120
get your questions out there.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.850
IKAI LAN: Right, right.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.280
ERIC KOLEDA: So we've got them
up here on the local machine.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.275
We can't stream them live right
now, but let's go over

00:04:40.275 --> 00:04:40.750
the first one.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.120
So top here of the list. "Google
Apps Script describes

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.170
itself as working across
Google products and

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.210
third-party services.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.640
But I don't see anything
concerning Reader." I guess

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.500
that's Google Reader. "Does
Google Reader support Google

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.540
Apps Script, or are there better
ways to augment this

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.930
service?"

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.250
IKAI LAN: So I was looking at
this, and we don't provide

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.300
Google Reader integration
at the moment.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.940
I went looking to see
if we have a Google

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.830
Reader API, and we don't.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.590
There are a couple of unofficial
ones on the web,

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.220
but the Google Reader API
is not really published.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.380
So it seems like it's going
to be a little bit more

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.510
difficult, but I would encourage
you to file a

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.280
feature request in our issues
tracker, because we do want to

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.170
see what the demand is.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.160
I mean, is it one person
asking for this?

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.180
Is it 200 people?

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.500
Is it 2,000 people?

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.360
That can really help us gauge
how important this is to our

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.630
developers.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.170
I mean, in my perfect world, we
would have every single API

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.940
under the sun.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.580
But unfortunately, there is a
limited amount of time, and we

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.470
want to get a few things.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.180
We want to get the most
important things out there

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.070
before we start tackling a lot
of these other things.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.620
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.970
I think one of the things
about Reader is that it

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.800
doesn't have a lot of inputs
and outputs, right?

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.550
You subscribe, and
then you read it.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.801
IKAI LAN: You mark as read.

00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:45.500
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.450
Short of that, I mean, I think
the API wouldn't be too large.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.020
I mean, what is great about
it, and I actually just

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.690
reshared on my Plus stream today
something that someone

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.150
did, which is that using the
Google Apps Script content

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.230
service, you can now generate
your own RSS feeds.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.840
And so someone today actually
created a very creative one

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.380
where they took the Apps Script
release notes page in

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.190
HTML, parsed it, and made
an RSS feed out of it.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.130
So it's not interfacing with
Reader, but they did

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.020
create an RSS feed.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.880
So it's kind of you can use
Google Reader as almost the

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.480
front end of some of your data
using Apps Script to

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.743
generate that feed.

00:06:18.743 --> 00:06:20.070
IKAI LAN: I don't know.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.070
I'll ask around.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.016
I mean, the tech lead of the
Google Reader team is somebody

00:06:25.016 --> 00:06:25.860
I used to work with.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.190
They're based out of Sydney.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.000
And every time I visit them, I
put in my feature request,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.300
because Google Reader's a
product that I use many, many

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.530
times every day.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.480
And I think Eric
feels the same.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.780
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.080
Wait?

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.680
You got to go to Sydney?

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.546
That's awesome.

00:06:38.546 --> 00:06:39.914
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:06:39.914 --> 00:06:41.940
Well, you just have to
ask if you can--

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.960
they've got a couple of
interesting teams out there.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.772
They've got--

00:06:44.772 --> 00:06:46.455
I don't know the teams
right now.

00:06:46.455 --> 00:06:48.340
But they've got a huge
section of the cloud

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.346
engineering team out there.

00:06:49.346 --> 00:06:50.160
ERIC KOLEDA: We'll have to
check that out, yeah.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.120
IKAI LAN: And we had
a guy who was on a

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.510
site reliability rotation.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.490
So one thing that you can do
when you work for Google is

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.950
that they have these
rotations.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.620
And you'll see these
advertised.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.130
And one of the rotations is a
site reliability engineering

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.870
rotation that you could do
for six months or a year.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.540
And it's a very cool thing to do
if you're in an engineering

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.560
or tech role, because you can
learn a lot about what keeps

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.150
Google up, and how the pager
system works, and all that

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:17.930
good stuff.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.710
So I would encourage you, if you
ever consider working for

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.030
Google, I mean, we are hiring.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.976
So there is my plug
right there.

00:07:24.976 --> 00:07:26.990
Now Recruiting can
get off my back.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.710
But there's so many cool
programs here, and that's just

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:30.070
one of them.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.085
And you get to meet a lot of
really great people when

00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:33.200
you're doing that.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:33.830
ERIC KOLEDA: That's great.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.770
So next question we had
here was "Why does

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.490
contactsApp.getContact,
passing in an email,

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.135
why is it so slow?

00:07:39.135 --> 00:07:41.160
It takes more than 10 seconds
to respond," this person's

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.560
saying. "Is there any way of
fixing this or working around

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.070
this issue?"

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.900
IKAI LAN: I took a look
at the specific issue.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.590
Not his specific issue,
but I tried

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:48.570
reproducing this behavior.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.700
Now granted, I spent about 10
minutes on this, but I could

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.860
not reproduce this,
unfortunately.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.020
So my guess is that there's
something-- oh.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:56.350
Hold on.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.550
We've got a response
coming in.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.500
This might be live.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.830
Here we go.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.270
This looks like--

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:04.870
OK.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.900
So there's a couple of
things going on here.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.210
This is not necessarily just
the Contacts application.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:11.670
It looks like you're doing
something with

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.420
spreadsheets as well.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.920
I don't know why this takes so
long, but I'll take a look at

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.850
this when I get a chance.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.730
ERIC KOLEDA: I think I looked
into this previously when

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:19.510
someone else brought it up.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.040
And for some of our APIs,
it matters how

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.890
much data you have.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:25.360
So if you have a ton of
contacts, you may see

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.470
different performance
than other ones.

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:28.510
And I think it's just
a limitation.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.632
And sometimes the way that we
fetch data, we kind of fetch

00:08:30.632 --> 00:08:32.230
it all at once, and
there's not the

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:33.580
ability always to filter.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.849
So I think we'll have to see.

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:37.970
It depends maybe on how many
contacts you have.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.360
And perhaps letting us know
how many contacts you have

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.789
could let us better gauge what
the performance is like.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:42.159
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:45.900
I'm looking at this
code sample.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.470
One thing that would be really
interesting, really good for

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.900
us to do, is first off, I want
to completely separate

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.140
spreadsheets out of this, so
create a test application that

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.200
takes the spreadsheet out
and just uses Logger.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.560
Because Logger is never
going to be slow.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.830
But take it out and use this,
use this example, and use only

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.810
the line of code where
use getContact.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.110
And furthermore, you want to
isolate whether it's this

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:13.060
specific contact, this specific
user, or your

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.170
specific domain.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.220
There's any number of issues
that this could be.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.720
I mean, we could just
have a data

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.280
corruption, which I doubt.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:19.810
It's very rare.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.150
But we want to narrow it down.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.520
ERIC KOLEDA: That's
a good point.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.610
I mean, we do a lot of work
on the issue tracker.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.700
We're out there all the time,
and it's paramount that when

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.190
you do provide us with an issue
that you try to isolate

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.650
it as much as possible.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.230
People give us their 100 lines
of code that touches a ton of

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:34.090
different services.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:35.430
It's really hard for
us to figure out

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.200
where the problem is.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.880
So take the time.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.240
You're experiencing the error,
so you already have the

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.515
reproduction case.

00:09:41.515 --> 00:09:43.440
A great way that we talked
about in the past--

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.480
copy your whole script, just
start removing parts until you

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.680
can still get the error, but
it's as small as possible.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.160
That really helps
us out a lot.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:50.240
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.610
I mean, I think that it's one
of these what we call n

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:56.400
squared problems, where it's
usually not any particular API

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.910
that's slow or bad.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.690
I mean, if it is, it's very
easy for us to figure out

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.370
what's going on, because like,
whoa, there's one thing

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.220
happening, at least from an
external perspective.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:07.560
But a lot of times when you have
two APIs interacting with

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.540
one another, this can cause

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.120
unpredictable things to happen.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.580
And the more APIs we add, and
we're always adding more APIs,

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.520
the more kind of combinations
that we can have of things

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.110
that are going wrong.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.390
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.680
In some cases, there's best
practices around batching up

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.660
your request or batching up your
work that we can maybe

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.380
help with, too.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.090
IKAI LAN: In this case, this is
a pretty simple call, so I

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:30.290
suspect it has to do with the
account or the contact that's

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:30.730
being fetched.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:31.570
ERIC KOLEDA: That's
a good point.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.080
IKAI LAN: But won't
know for sure.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:33.820
ERIC KOLEDA: All right.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.900
So the next one we've got on
here is "Is there a way to

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.240
iterate through all the comments
in a document object

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.400
and pull out only the unresolved
comments?"

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.290
IKAI LAN: I did not see
this question once.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.630
This just came in.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.950
ERIC KOLEDA: Well, I do know
that today, you're not able to

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:51.360
access these kind of
document comments.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.180
These are the new ones that you
see in Google Docs that

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.650
they pop off to the side.

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:59.000
You can add new replies
as you go along.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.550
It's got your little
face next to it.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.640
So these kind of new dynamic
comments have only just been

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.750
added recently to Google
Spreadsheets as well, and we

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.380
currently don't support access
to them in either

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.680
Spreadsheets or Docs.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.600
So I don't think that's going
to work out for getting the

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.330
unresolved ones.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:13.520
At least not in Spreadsheets,
we don't support

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.920
them, I know for sure.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.080
IKAI LAN: So I see a question
come in. "Any update on the

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.960
annoying empty logs issue?"

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.760
ERIC KOLEDA: That is
a popular one.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.010
IKAI LAN: Which annoying
empty logs issue?

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.340
No, I know which one you're
talking about, the one about

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.360
logs on callback.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.720
Yes, this is one of the top
priorities right now.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.400
And I want to say that there's
good news, which is that there

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.630
are two things happening
in parallel.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:38.280
One is that we are addressing
this particular issue because

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.350
this is stopping a lot of
developers, and this is

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.290
causing a lot of
misfired bugs.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.680
I'm looking-- when I look at
issues in the issue tracker, I

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.990
see people say things like,
well, this API's not working.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:49.550
I do a log, and it
doesn't work.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.070
And well, it's working,
but it's not logging.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.880
So I chase this down, and then
I go, and I'll follow up, and

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.880
I'll say, guys, please
fix this.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.720
The second thing that's
happening is that we are

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.390
looking at overhauling the
logs infrastructure.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.090
So that's going to be really
cool when it comes out.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:08.860
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, they're
definitely working on

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:09.750
short-term fixes.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.000
People want their logs today,
but we're also stepping back

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.990
and saying--

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:14.960
especially in the world of web
apps where maybe you have tons

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.440
of users using your
application and

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.510
you want to get data.

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.430
So we're stepping back and
rethinking a little bit about

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:20.275
how logs are done.

00:12:20.275 --> 00:12:20.640
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.820
Right.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.510
ERIC KOLEDA: And I guess in the
meantime, I think all we

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.730
can recommend, since the logs
aren't working in some of

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.450
these scenarios, is putting
your data somewhere else--

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.890
logging it to a spreadsheet,
logging it to a file.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:31.430
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:35.380
It's really annoying, but there
are some people that

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.570
we've found out use this as
the workflow, and this was

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:42.040
part of the impetus to
overhauling the way we do

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.290
logging and the dashboard.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.280
Because we found out in last
week's Hangout that we have

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.450
developers that, what they do is
instead of logging, they've

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.470
wrapped a class, and it's like
a log method, and they'll

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:53.560
email logs to themselves.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.020
Because the nice thing about
this is that you get the logs

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.310
in semi-real time.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.310
Whereas right now, there is a
bit of a delay between when

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:03.270
objects are flushed
to your log.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.115
In most cases, it seems like it
happens after the script is

00:13:06.115 --> 00:13:08.230
finished running, but I've
personally seen situations

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.390
where it's like a very
long running script.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:11.450
It will be flushed
periodically.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:12.010
ERIC KOLEDA: Oh, interesting.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.250
IKAI LAN: So maybe I'm wrong,
and totally observed it wrong,

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:16.645
but I'll do follow
up about that.

00:13:16.645 --> 00:13:16.990
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.510
The email system is great too,
because the logs go away the

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:20.650
next time the script is run.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.420
So sometimes people want to
persist that log information.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:27.560
IKAI LAN: And to me, that's
telling us that there's lots

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.660
of places we can improve that.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.930
ERIC KOLEDA: Room
for improvement.

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.310
And then we've another one
here, I think the last--

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.370
no, wait.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.240
IKAI LAN: "Is there a way to
iterate through a contact in

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.300
the Contacts App Service for,
let's say, non-empty fields?"

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.560
So I tried a few things
to make this work.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.570
I tried a couple of little
hacks, and I was unsuccessful.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:52.280
So I would suggest that please
put this feature request in.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.810
And I see why you would
want to do this.

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:56.710
Because I looked at the API,
and the API contains things

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.740
such as get emails, get
IMs, get phones.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.650
But let's say you don't
want to exhaustively

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:02.460
go down that list.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.310
You want to say, well, I want
to list these things out.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:06.250
ERIC KOLEDA: Everything
I do know.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:06.650
Everything that is populated.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.120
IKAI LAN: Yes, exactly.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:12.320
So please, by all means, file a
feature request, and we will

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.938
try to get that triaged.

00:14:13.938 --> 00:14:14.866
ERIC KOLEDA: Sounds good.

00:14:14.866 --> 00:14:16.060
All right.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.715
So I think that pretty much
wraps up everything we have on

00:14:17.715 --> 00:14:18.260
the Moderator.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.190
Feel free, if you're watching
and not in the Hangout, to add

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:21.780
some more on there.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.320
We'll keep going back to it.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.276
But I guess now let's cut to our
Google Hangout, and see if

00:14:26.276 --> 00:14:28.270
we have any live questions.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.280
Hello and welcome.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.220
LUCIANO: Hello.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:30.820
Can you hear me?

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:31.210
ERIC KOLEDA: I can, yes.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:32.080
IKAI LAN: Yes, we can.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.545
Hi, how are you?

00:14:34.545 --> 00:14:35.830
LUCIANO: That's great.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:36.790
I'm fine, thank you.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:40.190
That's my first time
in the Hangout.

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:43.070
I want to thank you all
for these sessions.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:44.840
They are very helpful for us.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:51.310
I have an issue where
I have created my

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:54.450
first dashboard script.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:58.040
It is currently shared with
my friend who has

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.730
edit access to it.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:06.530
This dashboard script, which is
owned by me, uses data from

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:10.140
a spreadsheet owned
by my friend.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:14.070
I have edit access to it.

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:14.680
I tried--

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:19.150
I published the dashboard script
shared with my friend.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:23.390
But every time he tries to
access it, he gets that page

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:28.780
where he has to request
sharing.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.790
He's not able to see
the dashboard.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.980
I have tried various
publish modes,

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.330
different publish modes.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.030
Any ideas?

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.520
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.580
One initial thing that jumps out
at me, which is I've made

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.900
this mistake a lot, which is
when you publish something as

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.910
a web app, there's two
different URLs.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.860
There's the dev URL, and
then there's the

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.200
fully published URL.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.660
So the dev URL ends in /dev,
while the publish URL that

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:56.620
everyone can access is /exec.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.750
So the dev URL is great when
you're building your script in

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.000
your web app, because you can
make changes and then

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.590
immediately see them
reflected.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:05.780
However, for everybody else in
the world in the published

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:08.980
URL, it only serves
a certain version.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:12.140
And so we have this concept of
versions now in scripts, where

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.550
you define a version, and then
set your web app to publish

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:16.310
with that version.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.830
So I've made the mistake of
actually emailing out my dev

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:20.880
URL, which nobody
else can access.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.235
That would be one thing
to check for.

00:16:22.235 --> 00:16:23.743
Do you know if that's
the case, or if

00:16:23.743 --> 00:16:24.474
you've ruled that out?

00:16:24.474 --> 00:16:34.880
LUCIANO: Well, the URL I am
sharing is the URL that shows

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.930
on the pop-up box right
after I publish it.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:44.680
I choose the latest version,
click Share, and it just shows

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.560
me the checkout.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:50.640
This is the link for your
published script.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.955
IKAI LAN: That's tends
to be the prod URL.

00:16:53.955 --> 00:16:56.010
ERIC KOLEDA: There's a text box
that has the prod URL, and

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:57.870
then there's a link underneath
it that says click here for

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.285
your latest code.

00:16:59.285 --> 00:17:00.230
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:01.430
LUCIANO: Yeah, that's the
one that I'm using,

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:02.660
the latest code link.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.410
ERIC KOLEDA: The latest code
link is the dev URL.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:05.140
IKAI LAN: Oh.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:05.710
Yeah.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:09.490
So the nice thing about the
dev URL is that it always

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.540
reflects your latest changes,
whereas a prod URL only

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.599
reflects whatever you pushed
out as the latest version.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:18.349
So one thing to try is look
at the URL and see

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:20.130
if it ends in /dev.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.470
And if it does, that's
the issue.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:23.690
So look--

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.260
there's a text box, I
think, that has the

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.510
full URL with /prod.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:31.040
Now, copy paste that, and
send that one out.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.340
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, we should
probably clarify the language

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:35.140
on that page, because it's not
exactly clear that that latest

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.350
code link only works
for you, I think.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.430
But, yeah, you want him to use
one that's in the text box,

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:40.310
not the one that's
in the link.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.550
IKAI LAN: Right And to--

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:42.290
LUCIANO: Yeah.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:43.880
That was the problem, then.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.450
I will just try it right now
and see if it's solved.

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:51.240
But I was using the wrong
shared link then.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.420
It definitely could
use a little

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.800
improvement in the writing.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.460
IKAI LAN: So do you have a
separate account that you use

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.770
that you can share to test it
out, so you don't ask your

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:03.600
friend to open the script?

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.930
That would let you verify
it right away.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:08.960
LUCIANO: Yeah.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.510
I'm just doing that right now.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:10.890
IKAI LAN: OK.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:12.140
Cool.

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:16.420
LUCIANO: I'm very excited
about Dashboards.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.130
I've dreamed about them.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.760
ERIC KOLEDA: Google Apps are
making dreams come true.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.340
IKAI LAN: I'm just really
glad that, you know--

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.000
LUCIANO: Well, yeah.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.120
It's working.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.742
It's working.

00:18:29.742 --> 00:18:30.200
IKAI LAN: There you go.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.040
I think that deserves a
high five right there.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.670
And we'll give you a virtual
high five through the internet

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:35.380
right there.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:36.436
Boom.

00:18:36.436 --> 00:18:36.830
LUCIANO: Thank you.

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:37.580
Thank you so much.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:38.053
IKAI LAN: That's probably
a terrible idea.

00:18:38.053 --> 00:18:40.420
We should probably never
do that again.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.310
LUCIANO: Can I just go ahead
and ask another question?

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.000
IKAI LAN: Absolutely.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.530
I mean, I don't think--

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:46.995
LUCIANO: If someone else
has another question?

00:18:46.995 --> 00:18:48.980
IKAI LAN: There's someone who
has a camera turned off or

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:49.740
doesn't have a camera.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.553
I want to make sure that
this person doesn't

00:18:51.553 --> 00:18:52.770
have a question first.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:53.400
ERIC KOLEDA: Is that
our producer?

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:53.960
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah?

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:54.370
IKAI LAN: Oh, is--

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:58.600
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, um, I just
have a question about maybe--

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.100
Let Luciano continue
and I'll--

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.050
IKAI LAN: You're a
little bit quiet.

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:03.818
Can you speak up or speak closer
to the microphone?

00:19:03.818 --> 00:19:05.072
MALE SPEAKER: OK, I'll try.

00:19:05.072 --> 00:19:05.910
Is this better now?

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.180
IKAI LAN: Hello.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:07.960
ERIC KOLEDA: No, he's there.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.930
MALE SPEAKER: Hello.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:09.855
IKAI LAN: I hear him.

00:19:09.855 --> 00:19:10.860
It's just-- hold on.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.558
I have to turn our volume
up a little bit.

00:19:13.558 --> 00:19:14.004
ERIC KOLEDA: OK.

00:19:14.004 --> 00:19:16.330
MALE SPEAKER: OK, maybe I'll
try to plug in some

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:16.760
microphone--

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.060
IKAI LAN: Oh, we can
hear you now.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.595
We just have to be
very, very quiet.

00:19:19.595 --> 00:19:20.270
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah,
we can hear you.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:20.580
Go ahead.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.870
Go ahead and ask
your question.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:23.121
We'll see what we can do.

00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:23.540
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.760
I posted my question
on the Moderator.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.660
And it's about the annoying
empty logs issue.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:31.860
IKAI LAN: We just
answered that.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:32.890
We are working on it.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.210
It's a top priority.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.600
So we have a little bit of a
longer answer, but yes, we are

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.526
working on this.

00:19:39.526 --> 00:19:39.952
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:19:39.952 --> 00:19:40.380
Thanks.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.076
I would wait, but I
couldn't hear it.

00:19:43.076 --> 00:19:43.680
ERIC KOLEDA: Oh, no problem.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.404
IKAI LAN: No problem.

00:19:45.404 --> 00:19:46.790
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:49.260
LUCIANO: OK.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.610
My other question--

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:52.550
IKAI LAN: And before you ask
your question, is there

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.850
something we can call you by,
because otherwise, I'm just

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:58.000
going to call you guy,
or man, or person.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:58.940
LUCIANO: I'm sorry.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.450
My name's Luciano.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.465
IKAI LAN: Luciano,
nice to meet you.

00:20:02.465 --> 00:20:03.273
Welcome to the Hangout.

00:20:03.273 --> 00:20:03.980
LUCIANO: From Brazil.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.370
ERIC KOLEDA: Oh, great.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.190
LUCIANO: OK.

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:11.490
So it's not really an issue.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:17.640
It's just I want some tips on
how should I approach that.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:24.020
I would like to have my
Dashboard to have--

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:33.000
when I change something in the
Dashboard, it would show some

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.250
new charts and hide other
charts, so I could have a

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:40.230
different perspective
on my Dashboard.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:46.570
I didn't really go search that
on the web currently, but

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:49.500
since I'm in the Hangout,
I thought I'll ask how.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.060
IKAI LAN: Sure.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.080
So do you mean that--

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.030
what exactly are you
looking to do?

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.550
You're saying that you would
like some controls on your

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:58.970
Dashboard to change the views,
to show different widgets?

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:02.910
LUCIANO: Yes, I would like some
controls that change the

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:06.270
set of charts currently
displayed for

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.760
another set of charts.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.452
ERIC KOLEDA: OK.

00:21:08.452 --> 00:21:11.390
Yeah, I think that's probably
possible if you utilize some

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:14.330
of our UI app widgets, right?

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:17.800
So in the Dashboards world,
there are now these things

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.470
called controls.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:21.530
And these are things like
sliders and category pickers.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:22.170
IKAI LAN: Very cool stuff.

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.440
ERIC KOLEDA: And those really
integrate perfectly with

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.230
charts, but I don't
think you can get

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:27.900
other events from them.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.600
I don't know if you can
bind to their events

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.550
and do other actions.

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:34.780
But you can certainly create
other types of controls that

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:35.880
have been around for
a long time.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.070
So things like buttons,
radio boxes,

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.140
check boxes, tab panels.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.730
All these different widgets
exist within the UI app

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:44.690
infrastructure.

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:46.740
So you could potentially utilize
them, where if they

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:50.000
select one radio button, you
hide a bunch of charts, or you

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.030
hide a whole panel
of charts even.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:53.600
You can organize your charts
into a panel, hide the whole

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.940
panel, show another panel.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.240
So all that should
be possible.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.550
IKAI LAN: Right I think that
if you're not familiar with

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.350
building controls, a really good
tutorial that I've just

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:06.930
very recently done myself is
there's one about the Charts

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.160
API that uses different controls
for filtering by name

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.400
and age and weight, and
things like that.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.960
And I think that's a
pretty cool one.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.820
So once you do that tutorial,
you have a pretty good idea of

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:20.730
how to use controls to hide
and show different

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:22.540
panels in UI app.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.900
So when I heard this question, I
immediately thought of about

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.510
20 different ways
of doing this.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.440
And it's just whatever you're
most comfortable with.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.930
Now, if you're comfortable with
UI app, that's probably

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:35.240
the way I'd go.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.600
If you're more comfortable
with web development, say

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:42.570
JavaScript and DOM and HTML,
HTML service, this is fairly

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:45.350
straightforward to
do using JQuery.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:47.900
But it's not straightforward
if you're not familiar with

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.225
JQuery and manipulating the
DOM and working with HTML.

00:22:51.225 --> 00:22:51.680
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.630
I think, unfortunately, one of
the limitations there today is

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:59.020
that the new Dashboard stuff
that we've produced for

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.770
charts, I believe only works
in UI app today.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:02.980
IKAI LAN: Yep.

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.010
ERIC KOLEDA: With the HTML
service, we've talked about it

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:07.520
in the past Hangouts.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.520
It works using this engine
called Kaha that does a lot of

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.510
sanitization.

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:13.670
And currently, Kaha doesn't
allow through other API

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:14.990
packages like the charts API.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:17.530
So if you want to use the charts
Dashboard stuff that's

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:19.565
built into Google Apps Script,
I think you're going to have

00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:20.350
to server through UI app.

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:20.940
IKAI LAN: Right, right.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.046
And I guess that's one of the
trade-offs that you have to

00:23:23.046 --> 00:23:26.010
think about making, which is
that using the charts API, you

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.230
can create like a blog and an
image, and you could fetch

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:30.310
that HTML service.

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:33.240
But now you're doing all this
work to do something that you

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.410
could have just done
in UI app, right?

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:36.320
So it's up to you.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.990
But you do get more kind of
fine-grained control over how

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:40.580
it looks and how
it's laid out.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.490
So there are various trade-offs
you can make.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:46.540
But I do suspect that, like you,
Dashboards are great, and

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.380
I love that Apps Script lets
us build them very quickly.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:53.390
UI app is probably the way to
go, and there should be ways

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:56.200
that you can make click handlers
do hiding of things.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.380
And can you do this completely
client side?

00:23:58.380 --> 00:23:59.865
Or does it also have
to go server side?

00:23:59.865 --> 00:24:02.200
ERIC KOLEDA: That's a good
point, because in UI app,

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.740
there are the client
handlers, right?

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:05.650
LUCIANO: Well, yeah.

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:09.020
Doing it on the client side
is exactly what I want.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:09.290
ERIC KOLEDA: Right.

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:11.900
LUCIANO: And I don't know
if it's possible or not.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.790
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, I
think it should be.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:15.520
There are client handlers
that are very limited.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.450
You can't do as wide a
functionality as with the

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:19.150
server handlers, but you can, I

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:21.130
believe, change some styling.

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:22.760
You can, I think,
hide and show.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.460
And you can do some other basic
manipulations using the

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.750
client handler, so you may
have some success there.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:29.960
LUCIANO: Well, that's OK.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:30.750
Thank you very much.

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:31.930
I'm going to look
into it then.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:32.310
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:34.200
IKAI LAN: You're welcome.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.450
ERIC KOLEDA: I mean, to just
give us and our viewers a

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:38.440
sense, what are using
Dashboards for?

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.061
What kind of data do you find
them to be useful for?

00:24:42.061 --> 00:24:44.590
LUCIANO: I'm sorry, I was
shutting off my phone.

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:45.970
It started ringing.

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:47.130
What did you ask?

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:49.320
ERIC KOLEDA: What kind of data
are you showing in these

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:49.730
Dashboards?

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:51.940
Like what is your use case, just
to give people at home, I

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.040
guess, an idea of what
you use it for.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:59.710
LUCIANO: OK, I have a scientific
publishing house.

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:05.660
And we have many employees
filling out many different

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.000
spreadsheets.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.010
And I'm trying to make sense
of the data we have.

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:16.790
So I'm showing different
reference styles that each

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:18.435
publication uses.

00:25:18.435 --> 00:25:23.870
I'm showing percentage of users,
of employees working

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:27.230
with different publications
and stuff like that.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:28.640
ERIC KOLEDA: Very cool.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.550
LUCIANO: I am just
starting out.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:36.340
I actually did use the tutorial
mentioned that shows

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.836
how many donuts people
have eaten.

00:25:39.836 --> 00:25:41.310
IKAI LAN: That's a
very good one.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:46.490
LUCIANO: And my first challenge
was to actually use

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:51.130
data from the spreadsheet
instead of the data that was

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:52.020
already there.

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:52.446
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:25:52.446 --> 00:25:56.140
LUCIANO: And I'm very proud of
myself, because it took me

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.690
less than three hours,
actually, to do it.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:01.840
But it was very fun.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:02.355
ERIC KOLEDA: That's great.

00:26:02.355 --> 00:26:02.640
IKAI LAN: Cool.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.550
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, it's good
to see this new technology

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:06.824
already getting use.

00:26:06.824 --> 00:26:09.040
It's only been out there for
a couple of weeks, and now

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.990
people are already using it to
kind of dig deeper into data,

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.690
which is great.

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:13.300
IKAI LAN: Right, right.
it's very cool stuff.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.180
LUCIANO: It was a childhood
dream to do

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.070
Dashboards like this.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:21.990
I tried Excel many times
but couldn't make it.

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:24.090
So I'm very thrilled.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:26.710
IKAI LAN: One thing that's
really nice about Apps Script

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:29.240
is how easy it is to collaborate
on these things.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.040
So once you create a Dashboard,
you can publish it.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.990
And anyone that you want
to see it can see it.

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:38.400
So that's one advantage that
you definitely have over

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.410
something that's only
running locally.

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:40.950
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:42.485
That's true.

00:26:42.485 --> 00:26:44.530
And like you mentioned, the
time it takes to go from a

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:47.410
spreadsheet to something that
you can share is pretty small

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:50.335
compared to if you had to set
up a server, and all of a

00:26:50.335 --> 00:26:51.430
sudden, get an environment
going.

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:53.840
IKAI LAN: And Luciano, just
imagine that your next

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.320
dashboard, you're going to be
able to do it in half an hour.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.490
And the next time after that
it will be five minutes.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:00.340
And over time, it's like seeing
this paradoxical that

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:01.612
will approach zero, right?

00:27:01.612 --> 00:27:02.840
Where you'll be putting--

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.930
and maybe you'll break that
barrier where the Dash will be

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:09.070
built before you even
start working on it.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:13.940
LUCIANO: Well, that's an even
older dream of just dreaming

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.900
about the code, and it's
just magically

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.120
happening in front of you.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.210
ERIC KOLEDA: We can file that as
a feature request, I think.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:22.201
The dream service.

00:27:22.201 --> 00:27:25.290
IKAI LAN: That's gonna
get closed.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:27.780
LUCIANO: That would be
very, very nice.

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:31.210
IKAI LAN: What will be really
cool is once you get really

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:33.170
good at doing this, you'll be
able to kind of realize what

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.050
kind of data you have, and what
kind of Dashboards you

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:35.700
like to show.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.410
And you can generalize your
code so it'll work on any

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:39.090
spreadsheet.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:41.640
Right now, the code is flexible
enough such that you

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.660
can go through all your
different types of

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:43.965
spreadsheets.

00:27:43.965 --> 00:27:46.020
You can determine how many
columns there are, how many

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:49.670
rows there are, and roughly spit
something out that will

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:51.620
work for 90% of what you need.

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:52.040
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:52.760
That's actually--

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:53.952
LUCIANO: Oh, yeah.

00:27:53.952 --> 00:27:59.000
I was just playing
with that also.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:07.470
I added a second row that
had the column types.

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:13.040
Some of them were int, the
others were string, and I was

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:19.530
just dynamically building the
table using the second row.

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:20.170
ERIC KOLEDA: Oh, yeah.

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:25.170
LUCIANO: But then I face a
problem that I was just

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.830
reminded of right now.

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:36.770
I was getting the invalid type
while creating on that loop

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:40.130
that creates the table,
the data table.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:40.725
ERIC KOLEDA: Interesting.

00:28:40.725 --> 00:28:41.980
IKAI LAN: Invalid type?

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:46.950
LUCIANO: I just got rid of that
row, and, well, left it

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:48.300
for afterwards.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.190
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:50.960
It may need some more testing
there and debugging to figure

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.080
out what that is, yeah.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.920
IKAI LAN: I am gonna teach you
something right now that is

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.920
very dangerous.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.600
But it is worth noting.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.770
Oh, he's afraid now.

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:03.650
So it's something called eval.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.990
But I have seen this, like this
is something that we even

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.020
use in a pinch now.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.540
I use this sparingly where,
for our viewers out there,

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.830
eval is this thing that
takes a string, and

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:18.560
this string is code.

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.680
And it will execute this code.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.750
So what I've seen some people do
is they've taken code, and

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:26.250
they put it into a spreadsheet,
and their Apps

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.530
Script will go ahead
and run this code.

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:32.670
Now, this is very dangerous
because untrusted code is--

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.790
so only use it on your own
spreadsheets, where you know

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:37.160
where the code came from,
or if you trust people.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.630
Like if I built out something
that was accessing my personal

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:43.690
information, and I had an eval
in there, and Eric had access

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:46.760
the spreadsheet, he could go and
he could really just mess

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:47.650
things up for me.

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:51.510
But this is something that we
have seen people doing.

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:54.200
One thing that we were just
talking about a few days ago

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:58.520
was that sometimes people have
been doing this thing where

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:03.770
they will URL fetch, get some
code from the internet someone

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:04.690
has posted.

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:06.770
They'll fetch it, and they'll
eval the code.

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.210
And they'll run the
code that way.

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:11.590
Fortunately our developers
are--

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:13.730
I don't think we have too
many malicious people.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:15.165
I don't think we have any
bad people, now that

00:30:15.165 --> 00:30:15.960
I think about it.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.030
Just knock on wood.

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:18.000
LUCIANO: Knock on wood.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.110
IKAI LAN: So at least not
people who will publish

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:20.760
libraries, right?

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.090
But even if they did, you could
just look at the library

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:24.270
and see what it's doing.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:26.400
But when we saw that a lot of
people were doing this, we

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.100
realized that, hey, we need
real libraries, man.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.200
This is not--

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:30.460
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:30.900
IKAI LAN: This is not--

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:32.140
ERIC KOLEDA: We need a
full-time solution.

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:34.640
IKAI LAN: We can't keep--
this can't continue.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.640
ERIC KOLEDA: So yeah,
we do have

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.650
libraries today too, right?

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:36.730
IKAI LAN: We do now.

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:38.120
ERIC KOLEDA: So now there's the
ability to package your

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.660
script into libraries, import
them into other scripts.

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:40.980
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:41.695
ERIC KOLEDA: Share
functionality.

00:30:41.695 --> 00:30:42.170
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:44.070
ERIC KOLEDA: A little
better than eval.

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.420
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:49.120
But eval is an option, and
especially, we have one of our

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:52.310
mail merge scripts that does an
eval, only because it was

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:53.180
just easier.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:54.560
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.070
IKAI LAN: And only three people
were accessing it.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.860
LUCIANO: Oh, yeah.

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:06.440
I'm gonna spend a couple more
hours on that, making use of

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.980
something like that.

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:15.520
It will help me also when I have
to add or change columns,

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:19.120
order, remove columns.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:25.110
Being able to read the column
labels and just build up the

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:28.890
data table objects from
these labels is

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:30.475
definitely the way to go.

00:31:30.475 --> 00:31:31.273
IKAI LAN: Definitely.

00:31:31.273 --> 00:31:32.260
ERIC KOLEDA: All right, great.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:33.590
Well--

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:34.360
LUCIANO: Listen.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:40.070
I have one thing that I would
like to see that I

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:42.200
didn't find it yet.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:46.680
It's some tutorial on laying out
these dashboards, how to

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:53.090
use the vertical panels, style
them accordingly, horizontal

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:55.975
panels, making it look
a little more pretty.

00:31:55.975 --> 00:31:56.840
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.550
ERIC KOLEDA: So one thing before
we go on is that--

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:00.720
quick time check.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:01.870
We are a little bit over time.

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:03.590
IKAI LAN: Yeah, we have to wrap
it up, but I think you

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:05.930
did bring up a good point, which
is a lot of our scripts

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:07.220
tell you how to get it
done, but not how to

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:07.910
make it look pretty.

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:11.846
I think we usually don't go all
the way to pretty, right?

00:32:11.846 --> 00:32:14.290
A lot of our sample code, if
you probably complete a

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:16.930
tutorial, it's going to look at
a white background, right?

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:18.890
It's going to look
pretty boring.

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:19.870
And I think that's because it's

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:21.260
very subjective, obviously.

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:22.680
What's the best way to
organize your data?

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.040
It depends on what your data is,
how many charts you have,

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.740
how many controls.

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:29.270
So I would say start
experimenting, and if you run

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:32.560
into issues, that's definitely
where we can come in and help.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.260
ERIC KOLEDA: And I'm sorry that
we don't have time to

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:37.150
answer all of your questions,
but we will be here again, I

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:38.475
think, in two weeks.

00:32:38.475 --> 00:32:38.850
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:39.220
ERIC KOLEDA: Is it?

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:39.850
IKAI LAN: Maybe next week.

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:41.110
ERIC KOLEDA: Are we
doing that one?

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:42.150
Well, we are having--

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:44.360
we should be having one in the
next week, or two weeks.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.240
Look on developers.google.com
for the calendar, There's one

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.670
that we might push back because
we are running--

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:51.760
again, shameless plug--

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:55.960
a hackathon in Austin, Texas,
on September 13.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:56.650
It's a Thursday.

00:32:56.650 --> 00:33:01.290
So for our viewers in the
Austin, Texas, area, take a

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:04.780
look on our blog, search for
Austin Apps Script Hackathon.

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.210
Now that I've got it rigged with
Google+, you'll see my

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:08.120
face come up.

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.660
I'm doing this.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:12.490
So click through, and there's
a sign-up form, and we will

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.846
provide food and various
beverages.

00:33:15.846 --> 00:33:16.720
IKAI LAN: Sounds delightful.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.170
ERIC KOLEDA: Various
beverages.

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:20.850
Hopefully, we'll have lots
of things for you

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:22.390
to drink and eat.

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:26.260
And come by, and hack on Apps
Script, and meet us, and learn

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:26.830
some cool things.

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:28.800
We've got some heavy hitters
coming to that one.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.400
I found out recently
that we have--

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.000
there's a tech lead, and there's
an uber tech lead.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.320
And both of those guys are
coming out to Austin.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.610
So for those of you guys coming
to Austin, you're in

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:39.950
for a real treat.

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:41.255
IKAI LAN: Fantastic.

00:33:41.255 --> 00:33:42.170
Well, it's been great.

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:44.005
Another great episode, and we'll
see you guys next time.

00:33:44.005 --> 00:33:44.650
ERIC KOLEDA: All right.

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:46.370
Bye, guys.

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:50.000
