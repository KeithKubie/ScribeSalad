00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's talk a little bit about the difference between GET and POST.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We've already seen one of the differences, and that's

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
GET parameters are included in the URL

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and POST parameters are included in the body.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Another difference is that GET requests

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
are often used for fetching documents

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and GET parameters are usually used to describe

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
which document we're looking for

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
or maybe what page we're on

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
or things of that nature--

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
basically, things that are describing what we're getting;

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
where POST parameters are often used for updating data--

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
for actually making changes to the Server

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
or to the data held on the Server.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Another difference is that GET parameters--

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
because they are in the URL--

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
have a maximum URL length,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
or they're affected by the maximum URL length

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
because you can only encode so many parameters.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
For example, I think Internet Explorer

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
allows 2000 characters in the URL,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
or something like that, which can be quite limiting.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
POSTs, by default, have no maximum length.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Now, the Server can be configured--and most are--

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
to have a maximum length, but it's usually substantially longer than 2000 characters.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's probably a few megabytes.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Another difference is that GET parameters

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
are generally okay to cache.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And when you make a GET request--a simple request for a URL--

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
there's a good chance that it's been cached.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
There are a lot of machines between

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
you and the Server--

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
or often there are--

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and it saves a lot of effort

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
if we know the document hasn't changed

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
to--you know--cache it along the way

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
so you don't have to request it new every time.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
POST parameters are almost never cached.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
That's because you're probably updating data on the Server.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And so the industry standard is: don't cache POST requests.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
One more difference is that GET requests--

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
because they're okay to cache

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and because you're usually describing

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
which document you want--

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
they shouldn't change the Server.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
You should be able to make the same GET request over and over,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and the Server shouldn't change.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
POST requests, on the other hand, are okay to change the Server.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
That's what they're generally used for,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
is requests that update the Server.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
That's why they're not cached; there's no max length,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and that's the whole story.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So in short, GET requests should be

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
simple requests for fetching a document.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And GET parameters should be used to describe

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
what document or what page you're looking for.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And POST parameters are used for making updates to the Server.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And POST requests generally are destructive in nature.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Now, if you don't follow these rules,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
you can get into a little trouble.
