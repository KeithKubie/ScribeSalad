Hey, it's me, Destin.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.820
I'm in my secret winter wonderland spot

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.820
and I just got a boot full of ice cold water

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.580
'cos of this waterfall.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.540
There's something interesting happening here, I don't understand it.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.860
Umm, it looks like water droplets are standing on water droplets.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.040
It looks like water is hydrophobic.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.800
So, if you might have noticed why... I'd like to know. I mean I understand it probably

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.350
has something to do with the covalent
bonds and surface tension... whatever.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.310
It's the middle of the winter here in Alabama.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.720
It looks like when a bead of water

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.890
skates across a hot griddle it creates a
layer of water vapor underneath it.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.120
Only that's not what it is because it's...
it's almost freezing, it's actually

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.890
a little bit warmer than freezing out here.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.070
I don't understand it so... if you have any information,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.040
please let me know. I'd appreciate it.
