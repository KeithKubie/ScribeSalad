Now that we're storing the data 
we downloaded in a sensible fashion,

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.960
we're ready to build rich UIs
for each of our activities.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.620
That means learning about fragments
and how we can use them

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.070
to create complex user interfaces 
that can easily be adapted

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.630
to work seamlessly on a range 
of different devices and screens.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.360
But first I'd like to tell you 
a little more about the principles

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.610
behind great Android design.
