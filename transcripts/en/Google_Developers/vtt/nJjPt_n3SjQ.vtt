00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.810
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome to Google I/O 2017,

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.110
our Annual Developer Festival.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.310
I'm Timothy Jordan, a
developer advocate at Google.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.850
And I'll be touring the I/O
venue throughout the next three

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.540
days, exploring the sandboxes,
interviewing Googlers,

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.209
and giving you
eyes on the ground.

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.750
That's right.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.940
Even though you're joining
remotely, this year,

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.710
you'll get an in-depth
look at everything

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.340
happening at Shoreline,
not just the sessions.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.830
You can follow along on any
of the live stream channels

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.350
on google.com/io.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.660
Google I/O is an outdoor
developer festival

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.530
hosting 7,200 attendees
at Shoreline Amphitheater,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.590
along with millions of
viewers on the live stream--

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.230
that's you-- and
thousands of developers

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.500
and more than 450 local
I/O Extended events

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.330
across 80 countries.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.470
We have 14 content tracks with
over 150 breakout sessions,

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.890
all live-streamed
on google.com/io.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.500
There's also over
70 code labs live,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.010
to get you up and running
with our latest APIs today

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.362
at g.co/io/codelabs.

00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:21.320
But before you get to
any of that, let's review

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.770
a handful of the
announcements you just heard.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.280
Smart Reply, available in
inbox by Gmail and Allo,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.830
saves you time by
suggesting quick responses

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.090
to your messages.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.180
It utilizes machine learning
to give you better responses

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.350
the more you use it.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.540
And it already drives 12% of
replies in Inbox on mobile.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.970
Starting today, Smart
Reply is coming to Gmail

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.940
for Android and iOS too.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.910
We're excited to announce that
our second generation tensor

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.960
processing units are coming to
Google Compute Engine as cloud

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.410
TPUs where you can connect
them to virtual machines

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.440
of all shapes and sizes
and mix and match them

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.270
with other types of
hardware, including

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.110
Skylake CPUs and Invidia GPUs.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.930
You can program these
cloud TPUs with TensorFlow,

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.639
the most popular
open source machine

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.290
learning framework on GitHub.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.570
And we're introducing
high level APIs,

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.090
which will make it easier to
train machine-learning models

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.900
on CPUs, GPUs, or cloud TPUs
with only minimal code changes.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.330
Many top researchers
don't have access

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.630
to anywhere near as much
compute power as they need.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.240
To help as many
researchers as we can

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.840
and further accelerate the
pace of open machine-learning

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.550
research, we will
make 1,000 cloud TPUs

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.060
available at no cost to ML
researchers via the TensorFlow

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.430
research cloud.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.620
Android O, coming
later this year,

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.210
will bring more
fluid experiences

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.520
to your smaller screen,
as well as improvements

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.590
to battery life and security.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.690
With picture-in-picture,
you can seamlessly

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.390
do two tasks simultaneously.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.060
And smart text selection
improves copy and paste

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.310
by using machine learning
to recognize entities

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.170
on the screen.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.260
Google Play Protect is Google's
comprehensive security services

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
for Android, which provides
powerful new protections

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.110
and greater visibility
into your device security.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.230
Play Protect is built into
every device with Google Play,

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.570
is always updating,
and automatically

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.470
takes action to keep your
data and device safe.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.830
We also have an early
preview of a new initiative

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.590
for entry level Android
devices that internally we

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.450
call Android Go.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.480
The goal is to get computing
into the hands of more people

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.750
by creating a great smartphone
experience on all Android

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.230
devices with one gigabyte
or less of memory.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.020
Android Go is designed with
features relevant for people

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.030
who have limited
data connectivity

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.730
and speak multiple languages.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.370
Of course, way more was
covered in the Google keynote,

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.110
including new ways to share with
Google Photos, including photo

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.210
books; new ways that Google
Assistant can help you do even

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.970
more; investments in
the core technologies

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.240
that enable VR and AR,
and in platforms that make

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.640
them accessible to more people.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.620
Have questions about I/O '17?

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.020
Tweet them, starting
today through May 19,

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.780
using #io17request.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.300
A team of Googlers will be
on-site chasing down answers

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.050
for you.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.250
Make sure to also follow
the conversation on #io17

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.827
and on the Google
Developers blog.

00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:23.660
Make sure to tune into
the developer keynote

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.400
at 1:00 PM Pacific time.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.800
And I'll see you right
here on the Livestream

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.540
between all the sessions.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.530
This is Google I/O 2017.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.280
