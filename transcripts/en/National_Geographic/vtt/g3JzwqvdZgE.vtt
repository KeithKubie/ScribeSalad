[music playing]

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:11.333
TIM SAMUELS: I'm in Jerusalem,
and I'm searching for ecstasy.

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:15.200
[music playing]

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.633
My search is for the Na
Nach, a small sect of highly

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:40.100
religious Jews who themselves
are dedicated to the search

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.300
for spiritual ecstasy.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.500
Religion as I knew
it was a childhood

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.467
battle against
boredom, fidgeting

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:48.633
in the face of archaic text.

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:50.967
But in Jerusalem,
religion can be more

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:54.967
like the misspent nights of
my youth, a God rave right

00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:57.066
in the middle of the streets.

00:00:57.066 --> 00:01:00.300
[music playing]

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.533
A full-on yarmulke
flapping, Na Nach

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:08.233
dance party reverberating
through the ancient Jerusalem

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:09.200
stone.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.600
[music playing]

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.633
It's like five o'clock
on a Thursday afternoon.

00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:19.166
People are kind of starting
to go home from work.

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:22.133
They're on their way
back from the shops.

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:23.467
And these guys
have felt the need

00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:26.867
to come and express
their joy for God

00:01:26.867 --> 00:01:29.800
by dancing to happy
house on an old van.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.133
[music playing]

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:34.266
In my old Manchester
clubs, people

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:37.567
weren't this happy
without a little help.

00:01:37.567 --> 00:01:39.467
To clarify what's
going on here, I

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:42.400
asked a professor of theology.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.233
CANDIDA MOSS: An ecstatic
religious experience

00:01:44.233 --> 00:01:47.400
is an experience in which an
individual feels that they have

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.533
sort of left themselves
and have become

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:51.600
one with the universe or God.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.734
They're kind of
outside of themselves

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:56.633
and in connection with something
much bigger than themselves.

00:01:56.633 --> 00:01:58.433
[cheering]

00:01:58.433 --> 00:02:00.266
[music playing]

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:02.567
It exists in almost
every religious

00:02:02.567 --> 00:02:03.800
and spiritual tradition.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.500
It can take lots of
shapes and forms.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.900
And for some people,
when they see

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.767
others caught up in the
spirit, looks kind of crazy.

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:16.600
[music playing]

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.500
TIM SAMUELS: So,
this is what you like

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.767
to do on a Thursday afternoon?

00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:21.333
No, every afternoon, actually.

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:22.333
Every afternoon [inaudible].

00:02:22.333 --> 00:02:23.400
Except for Shabbat.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.533
[singing]

00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:27.433
TIM SAMUELS: Is everyone
just feeling good because

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:30.567
of the music and faith, or
do you kind of augment that

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:33.200
with some substances, as well?

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.800
Are you guys tripping?

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.100
Are you high?
- No.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.967
Or you just-- you just--

00:02:36.967 --> 00:02:39.200
No, we don't take anything.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.767
I think you don't need all
these substances, you know?

00:02:44.734 --> 00:02:47.200
TIM SAMUELS: The Na Nach are
followers of the 19th century

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.667
rabbi Nachman of Breslov,
and his 20th century

00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:53.667
follower, Rabbi Odessa.

00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:56.834
As a Hasidic Jew, Rabbi
Nachman taught his followers

00:02:56.834 --> 00:02:59.333
to observe the traditional
dietary restriction

00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:02.867
of [inaudible] and grow the hair
at the corners of their heads,

00:03:02.867 --> 00:03:04.800
but also encouraged
them to clap,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.500
sing, and dance
during their prayers

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.567
to bring them closer to God.

00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:11.700
I think there's
a disconnection

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.333
between your heart
and your head.

00:03:15.333 --> 00:03:17.767
And this connected
together, when

00:03:17.767 --> 00:03:20.467
you start dancing,
this action, it

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:22.800
connects everything together.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.934
And you start living.

00:03:23.934 --> 00:03:25.633
You start living.

00:03:25.633 --> 00:03:26.433
TIM SAMUELS: Mm.

00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:28.300
I'm still skeptical.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.834
