00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.880
This right over here is our

00:00:02.886 --> 00:00:07.191
understanding inverses of functions
exercise on Khan Academy.

00:00:07.191 --> 00:00:11.845
It's a good exercise to make sure
you understand inverses of functions.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:15.444
It's an interactive one
where we can move this line around

00:00:15.444 --> 00:00:18.435
and it tells us 'the graph of h(x)
is the green',

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:24.225
so that's this dotted green line,
'the dashed line segment shown below'.

00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:25.927
So that's this.

00:00:25.927 --> 00:00:30.027
'Drag the endpoints of the segment below
to graph h inverse of (x).

00:00:30.027 --> 00:00:32.042
There's a couple of ways to tackle it.

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:34.635
Perhaps the simplest one
is we say, okay, look,

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:38.279
h(x), what does h(x)
map from and to?

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:41.122
So h(x), this point
shows that h(x),

00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:45.579
if you input -8 into h of (x),
h of -8 is 1,

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.443
so it's mapping from -8 to 1.

00:00:48.443 --> 00:00:55.133
Well, the inverse of that, then,
should map from 1 to -8.

00:00:55.135 --> 00:00:59.825
So let's put that point on the graph,
and let's go on the other end.

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.919
On the other end of h of x,

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:08.499
we see that when you input 3 into h of x,
when x is equal to 3,

00:01:08.512 --> 00:01:10.633
h of x is equal to -4.

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:14.665
So this point shows us
that it's mapping from 3 to -4.

00:01:14.665 --> 00:01:19.409
So the inverse of that would map
from -4 to 3.

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.259
If you input -4 it should output 3.

00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:31.133
Since we took
the two end points of this line

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:33.507
and found the inverse mapping of it,

00:01:33.507 --> 00:01:36.952
what I have just done here
is that I have graphed the inverse.

00:01:36.952 --> 00:01:38.584
Another way to think about the inverse

00:01:38.584 --> 00:01:43.314
is if you were to draw the line y = x,

00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:51.139
these things should be reflections
around the line y =x

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:56.779
because one way to think about it is,
you're swapping the xs for the ys.

00:01:56.779 --> 00:02:01.237
If you were to draw the line y = x,

00:02:01.237 --> 00:02:04.424
if you flipped it around,
the line y = x, the green line,

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:06.100
you would actually get the old line.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.087
This would flip over there
and this would flip over there.

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:15.477
But either way, we're done.
We have graphed h inverse of x.
