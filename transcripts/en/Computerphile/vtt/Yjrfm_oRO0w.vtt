00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.300
Every time I talk about diffie-hellman

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.730
And use any kind of analogy people were like oh show us the math show us the math I could have taken the maths

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.939
So this is for the maths people where if you want to know how?

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.609
Mathematically diffie-hellman works watch this video if you don't want to know that there's a nice clothes button in the top corner or a back

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.449
Button you know be my guest so that this is for mathematically inclined people

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.109
Let's go back to where we were before so we have Alice and we've got Bob

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.598
And we've got our public area here sort of public

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:35.008
Public and we go draw down here now the mathematics behind diffie-hellman is usually

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.820
modulo arithmetic recall that we have our public numbers G

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.730
and M

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.480
G is often very small is usually a small prime number n is often very big and needs to be big for the security of

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.450
this to work and is often 2,000 bits long or

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.180
4,000 bits is more common now

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.669
So n is very very big it can't be too big because you won't gain much in security

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.050
But you lose in efficiency

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.099
So you know you have to think about that Alice and Bob need to pick their numbers a and B

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.100
so Alice picks a number a

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.699
Bob picks a number B. These are the ones they're going to keep private now a

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.889
Is somewhere between 1, and n but it's random and n is so vast, but it's not going to be 1

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.979
It's gonna be a very big number. It's not worry about what it is

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.949
She's not gonna. Tell anyone what that is same for Bob the

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.040
first thing else does if she calculates

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.549
G to the power of a mod n

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.299
right now modulo if you do any programming you'll be familiar with it's a percent symbol is the remainder after division so

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.769
Another way of looking at modulo is to have this kind of clock face, so if we have a clock face

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.180
Which should be a circle and we go from 1 2 3 all the way round?

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.399
To n these are the numbers modulo n 4 when we perform some arithmetic in this space

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.469
We just go around and man the clock face. We don't ever leave and go above in or below 0 in fact

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.509
If this should be 0 as well this should be a 0 in here

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.610
So when you do G to the power of a mod n?

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.740
What happens is you're raising G to the power of some massive number which would be very normally very big?

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.610
but in actual fact

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.069
It just goes round around this clock face and ends up somewhere

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.279
So let's say G to the a mod n arrived somewhere here on the clock face now. What's important about?

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.509
This is it's very difficult given this to work out

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.920
What a was we know g let's say three right if I say we are here on the clockface and we started at three

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.349
what number is a

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.370
It's just impossible to know right because it's position on this clock has no bearing on how many times has gone round

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:36.049
Or what a was at all right? The only way to do. This is essentially to brute force it to go

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.730
Well is it a ^ 1 no

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.469
It's not is it a 2 the power to know and and so on and so forth for an infeasible amount of time

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.040
well

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.230
We did a little bit of this with the hashing video didn't we there was a little bit of the modulo function there in in?

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.489
Calculating the hash yes, so that was used to shorten something at the end

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.029
But it's the same kind of principle mojo is very useful for taking something

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:03.409
But it could be any length and putting it into a sort of finite loop with a finite group of actual numbers now Bob

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:08.719
We're going to take G to the B mod n so let's say that turns off over here somewhere

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.579
So this is G to the B mod n so again what we've done is we've taken

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.869
G we've raised it to the power of B, and we've done all of this modulo

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.840
N which means that it just if it ever goes above in it

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.919
Just loops back down to 0 and keeps going so this is somewhere else these are very public components

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:30.769
So they share these like this so now these are public but again calculating a and B from this is very very difficult

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.069
it's called solving with discrete log problem and

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.659
Practically very very difficult for even a supercomputer all right now

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.449
Alice is going to take this I'm just going to simplify the notation slightly to make it fit on the page

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:48.439
But as it's going to take the G to the B but Bob sent and raised it again

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.989
to the power of a mod N

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.539
and Bob is going to take G to the a that Alice sent and raise it to the power of B mod N and

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.720
Anyone, that's done any exponentiation knows that if you do something to the power of something to the power of something else

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.479
It's actually just those two things multiplied so G

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.479
It's G to the a B

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.339
Mod n that's the answer so that will put you that will come somewhere around you know let's say here

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:20.060
so this is G to the a B mod n now this will be some number between 0 and n

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.130
Bob's done the same thing he's also got G to the a B mod n and

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.640
They're exactly the same briefly two identical colors

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.510
We were looking at in our color example

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.760
So they've both arrived at the exact same position in this group

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.559
Despite the fact that neither the knew what each other's private key was that's what's really cool about Diffie Hellman

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.460
To try and reverse this process we have to know a or B

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.540
We know publicly G to the a and we also know G to the B if we try and multiply them together for example

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.110
We'll get G to the a plus B. Which is not the same, right?

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.539
That's me sort of mixing my public colors together in the hope of getting to my answer. I haven't done it

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.830
That would be somewhere else a completely different number remember. This is cryptography if you're one

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.400
Position out it not going it's not going decrypt

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.790
Okay

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.499
So you know you have to get it exactly right the fact that she's got G to be

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.700
To the AE is no different to GT v8 in a bit. It's exactly the same

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:22.009
I mean you could you could look at an example if you went to to the power of 2 to the power of 3

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.380
That's 2 times 2 times

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.290
2 times 2

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.360
times 2 times 2

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.460
Right which is 2 to the 6 because? There's this stick to them you can do it in any order?

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:41.419
It doesn't matter you get the same number out at the end whereas that is a completely different thing. Yeah, so that is equivalent of

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.729
2 2 power of 2 times 2 to power 3 which is 2 times 2?

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:55.129
Times 2 times 2 times 2 which is 2 to the 5 entirely different number now those numbers are fairly similar because these examples are

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.360
Small you guys going to be somewhere else completely honest on this model you take clockface you're not gonna

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.979
It's not gonna work at all the N number is kind of important though is it right

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.129
It's mostly important that n is big because if n is small

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.030
Then in essence this clock face is going to have only a few numbers on it

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.750
You can brute-force that very quickly

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.869
Right you can find the value of a or the value of B and reverses process if n is you know

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.440
Astronomically large like 2,000 or 4,000 bits the amount of time

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.980
It's going to take you to find the correct the correct values for a or B is

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.239
I mean it essentially is long enough that you won't bother that's the argument

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.790
It's technically possible, but you would be long dead by the time you did it and so you're you finding out

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.790
What image they send each other is not about useful?

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.550
Actually, this is this is quite simple right? I mean let's not under play

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.039
This is incredibly important for computer science and mathematics

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.189
But it's actually not that complicated in some sense very elegant

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:53.480
If you want to see some worked examples of this Wikipedia and other websites have lots of small examples with small numbers

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.100
So that you can work this through if you want to have a go at the math yourself right and you'll get the same answer

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.100
Out and it's you know it's impressive
