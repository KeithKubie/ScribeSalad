countries like India and China had much
 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.410
countries like India and China had much
more wealth than ever before combined

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420
more wealth than ever before combined
 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.920

financial systems in Asia so they had

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329
financial systems in Asia so they had
 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.119
financial systems in Asia so they had
more wealth and they didn't have good

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129
more wealth and they didn't have good
 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.279
more wealth and they didn't have good
places in which to put it and it was

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289
places in which to put it and it was
 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.650
places in which to put it and it was
very difficult for Asian societies to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660
very difficult for Asian societies to
 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.540
very difficult for Asian societies to
tap the savings of their own country and

tap the savings of their own country and
and so what we ended up doing was

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199
and so what we ended up doing was
 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.779
and so what we ended up doing was
accumulating a lot of savings in places

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789
accumulating a lot of savings in places
 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.639
accumulating a lot of savings in places
like central banks in these sovereign

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649
