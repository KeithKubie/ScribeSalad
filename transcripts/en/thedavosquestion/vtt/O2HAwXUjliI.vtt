Hi, my name is Bjarte Reve. I am the CEO of
Oslo Cancer Cluster in Norway and I think

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:13.759
the World Cup in 2010 will, it might actually
be a new beginning for Africa, not just South

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:19.230
Africa, because a lot of people from all over
the world will come and visit, bring the stories

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:28.199
back home and also think we can use this opportunity
to discuss, show healthcare burdens in Africa

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.240
and bring that message out to the world as
well. So maybe we can do something together

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.530
to help it. Thank you.
