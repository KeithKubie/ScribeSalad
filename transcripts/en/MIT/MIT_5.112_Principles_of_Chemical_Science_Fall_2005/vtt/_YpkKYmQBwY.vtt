00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.936
Today I would like to start by
discussing a timeline.

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:25.253
And you will see in a moment
what this timeline has to do

00:00:25.253 --> 00:00:28.575
with.
It is obviously only a partial

00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:33.168
timeline.
But let's start here in 1916,

00:00:33.168 --> 00:00:39.285
as we have done this semester,
by talking about the Lewis

00:00:39.285 --> 00:00:43.000
theory of electronic structure.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.879
And his electron pair theory is
something we are going to come

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.067
back to a couple of times during
lecture today.

00:01:02.067 --> 00:01:07.932
Let's move on to 1954.
1954 was an important year in

00:01:07.932 --> 00:01:13.797
electronic structure theory,
because in that year there was

00:01:13.797 --> 00:01:19.359
awarded, to Linus Pauling,
the Nobel Prize in chemistry.

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:23.000
Let me write down Pauling here.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.210
And if you are interested in
knowing something about what

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.191
Pauling was awarded the Nobel
Prize in chemistry for,

00:01:36.191 --> 00:01:39.000
I will show you over here on
the side boards.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.106
What you are going to see here,
if you read this citation for

00:02:10.106 --> 00:02:15.127
Linus Carl Pauling in 1954 for
the Nobel Prize in chemistry,

00:02:15.127 --> 00:02:18.531
his prize was awarded
principally for his

00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:22.787
contributions to our
understanding of the nature of

00:02:22.787 --> 00:02:26.890
the chemical bond.
If you think back to the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.458
elegant title of the paper by
Lewis that we started out our

00:02:31.458 --> 00:02:36.105
discussion of acid-base theory
with, it was a paper entitled

00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:40.988
"The Atom and the Molecule." And
now we have gotten to Pauling,

00:02:40.988 --> 00:02:45.949
in 1954, who is being awarded a
Nobel Prize in chemistry for the

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:50.281
nature of the chemical bond.
That also is the title of a

00:02:50.281 --> 00:02:54.692
very famous chemistry book by
Linus Pauling entitled "The

00:02:54.692 --> 00:03:00.236
Nature of the Chemical Bond."
That was published by Cornell

00:03:00.236 --> 00:03:04.785
University Press originally,
because it stemmed from his set

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:08.024
of lectures at Cornell,
the Baker lectures,

00:03:08.024 --> 00:03:11.108
in the 1950s.
As we talk about electronic

00:03:11.108 --> 00:03:14.501
structure theory,
I would like you to keep in

00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:18.356
mind the way in which these
different geniuses were

00:03:18.356 --> 00:03:22.520
approaching the problem,
a problem that we are going to

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.607
launch in on today and spend the
next few lectures on.

00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:30.000
We will move up here to 1966.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
In 1966 there was awarded a
Nobel Prize to Mulliken.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Not to be confused with
Milliken.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
We are going from 1954 to 1966.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.548
You are going to find,
as you explore the Nobel Prize

00:04:37.548 --> 00:04:41.643
website, that there are a lot of
informational links on these

00:04:41.643 --> 00:04:43.417
people.
You can go and read

00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:46.010
biographies.
You can read some of their

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.603
writings.
In the case of Linus Pauling,

00:04:48.603 --> 00:04:52.220
you have links to all the pages
of all of his research

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.632
notebooks, spanning more than 60
years of research.

00:04:55.632 --> 00:05:00.000
Those are pretty interesting
supportive materials.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.750
In the case of Robert S.
Mulliken, he is being cited for

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.090
his contributions to the
molecular orbital method,

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.636
which we will also call the
molecular orbital theory.

00:05:10.636 --> 00:05:13.909
We have the Lewis theory.
We have, in the case of

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:17.863
Pauling, I am going to say the
nature of the chemical bond,

00:05:17.863 --> 00:05:20.659
described in terms of valance
bond theory.

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:23.181
We will come back to that in a
moment.

00:05:23.181 --> 00:05:26.931
And then, in the case of
Mulliken, we have a Nobel Prize

00:05:26.931 --> 00:05:33.300
for molecular orbital theory.
And I just would like to show

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.943
you something kind of neat,
here.

00:05:36.943 --> 00:05:43.203
This has to do with the fact
that if I go to the section

00:05:43.203 --> 00:05:48.894
labeled other resources,
I can click on MIT digital

00:05:48.894 --> 00:05:53.674
thesis library.
Then I can choose a page of

00:05:53.674 --> 00:06:01.052
Mulliken's thesis to display.
And that is because Robert S.

00:06:01.052 --> 00:06:06.631
Mulliken was Course 5 1917.
Let's hear it for Course 5

00:06:06.631 --> 00:06:09.789
chemistry.
[APPLAUSE] Robert S.

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:15.473
Mulliken was one of you guys,
and he graduated in 1917.

00:06:15.473 --> 00:06:21.578
His undergraduate chemistry
thesis at MIT was entitled "The

00:06:21.578 --> 00:06:27.473
Effective Structure on the
Activity of the Hydroxyl Group

00:06:27.473 --> 00:06:31.413
in Alcohols."
Submitted by Robert S.

00:06:31.413 --> 00:06:33.469
Mulliken.
There is his signature.

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:37.068
Isn't it cool to have your
undergraduate thesis linked in

00:06:37.068 --> 00:06:39.510
from the Nobel Prize website?
Robert S.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.887
Mulliken for molecular orbital
theory.

00:06:41.887 --> 00:06:44.200
And you can see,
even as you read his

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.542
undergraduate thesis,
he was talking about the effect

00:06:47.542 --> 00:06:50.755
of structure on the activity of
the hydroxyl group.

00:06:50.755 --> 00:06:54.032
He had the idea that if you
knew something about the

00:06:54.032 --> 00:06:56.666
structure of the molecule,
even back then,

00:06:56.666 --> 00:07:00.072
you could make predictions
about the properties of the

00:07:00.072 --> 00:07:04.487
molecule.
And that is what we really want

00:07:04.487 --> 00:07:09.220
to be able to do in chemistry,
because we want to be able to

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.108
control function as much as
possible.

00:07:12.108 --> 00:07:16.842
I will take that way for now
and we'll come back in a moment

00:07:16.842 --> 00:07:21.495
because I am going to mention to
you that in 1998 there was

00:07:21.495 --> 00:07:26.389
another Nobel Prize given for
advances in our understanding of

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:30.000
electronic structure of
molecules.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.670
And this one was a shared
prize, rather than these three

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:40.309
other ones that I mentioned.
Well, two others.

00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:45.773
Lewis was neglected from that
category, unfortunately.

00:07:45.773 --> 00:07:51.855
In 1998 Kohn and Pople shared
the Nobel Prize for furthering

00:07:51.855 --> 00:07:57.938
our understanding of how to
describe electronic structure of

00:07:57.938 --> 00:08:02.103
molecules.
And this is a theory that we

00:08:02.103 --> 00:08:06.386
are not going to be talking
about too much explicitly here

00:08:06.386 --> 00:08:10.367
in 5.112 this semester,
but if you go on in chemistry,

00:08:10.367 --> 00:08:13.297
you will be exposed to it more
and more.

00:08:13.297 --> 00:08:16.152
It is called density functional
theory.

00:08:16.152 --> 00:08:20.585
It is one of the most expedient
ways to use computers to get

00:08:20.585 --> 00:08:24.191
electronic structure information
about molecules.

00:08:24.191 --> 00:08:29.000
And so, that method has become
extremely important.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.953
And I will just show you a
little piece of information from

00:08:33.953 --> 00:08:36.515
that website,
so we go to 1998.

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:41.041
And, under the John Pople
section, I am going to go to

00:08:41.041 --> 00:08:44.286
interview.
He has given an interview on

00:08:44.286 --> 00:08:49.154
different topics relating to his
involvement in chemistry.

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:53.765
One short piece of that
interview is entitled "Interest

00:08:53.765 --> 00:08:57.779
in Quantum Mechanics and
Development of Computer

00:08:57.779 --> 00:09:02.290
Techniques."
We are going to take a look at

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:06.108
that and hopefully,
if the audio and video are both

00:09:06.108 --> 00:09:10.918
working, you will be able to see
John Pople talking a little bit

00:09:10.918 --> 00:09:13.819
about this important area of
chemistry.

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:18.171
We just don't have time for
fixing audio/video problems in

00:09:18.171 --> 00:09:20.385
real-time here,
unfortunately.

00:09:20.385 --> 00:09:23.897
Therefore, what I would like
you to do is go to

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:27.256
NobelPrize.org,
Chemistry Laureates on Pople,

00:09:27.256 --> 00:09:30.998
and actually watch that
five-minute segment of his

00:09:30.998 --> 00:09:35.426
interview that has to do with
his feelings about electronic

00:09:35.426 --> 00:09:41.000
structure theory and advice to
students on that topic.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And I will summarize his
comments here --

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.009
-- by saying that the goal of
studying electronic structure of

00:10:11.009 --> 00:10:16.724
molecules is to try to get
predictive power about molecular

00:10:16.724 --> 00:10:20.566
systems.
And we want predictive power in

00:10:20.566 --> 00:10:25.000
terms of the 3D structure of
molecules.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.296
We know how to represent
connectivity in molecules in two

00:10:34.296 --> 00:10:37.519
dimensions.
We have been doing that already

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:41.508
quite a bit this semester.
But we would like to know,

00:10:41.508 --> 00:10:44.808
if you know which atoms are
bonded to which.

00:10:44.808 --> 00:10:48.644
And then how does that
translate into the intricate

00:10:48.644 --> 00:10:52.634
three-dimensional structures
that molecules can have?

00:10:52.634 --> 00:10:57.237
Also, molecules can have color.
That is an important property

00:10:57.237 --> 00:11:01.921
of a molecular system.
In addition to which,

00:11:01.921 --> 00:11:06.771
molecules can be magnetic.
So, magnetism is one of the

00:11:06.771 --> 00:11:10.522
important properties of
molecular systems.

00:11:10.522 --> 00:11:15.281
And, as they aggregate into
extended solid materials,

00:11:15.281 --> 00:11:20.222
the way in which magnetic
molecules interact to produce

00:11:20.222 --> 00:11:25.895
macroscopic magnetic phenomena
is very much an area of interest

00:11:25.895 --> 00:11:30.583
to chemists.
People want to design molecular

00:11:30.583 --> 00:11:35.750
magnets in order to be able to
make materials that have desired

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:40.333
properties that will be useful
to us in building things.

00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:44.166
And then, of course,
we have molecules that are

00:11:44.166 --> 00:11:47.666
redox-active.
And redox properties are very

00:11:47.666 --> 00:11:51.083
important.
We would like to be able to sit

00:11:51.083 --> 00:11:56.000
down with our computer and draw
out a structure.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.520
We would like to be able to pop
it into its optimum 3D geometry

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.604
and find out what that is.
We would like to then know how

00:12:04.604 --> 00:12:09.197
easy is it to remove an electron
from that system or how easy it

00:12:09.197 --> 00:12:11.822
is to add an electron to that
system.

00:12:11.822 --> 00:12:14.812
Can we sit down and,
right from the start,

00:12:14.812 --> 00:12:18.385
use theory to predict
properties like the energies

00:12:18.385 --> 00:12:22.468
associated with electron
transfer to and from a molecular

00:12:22.468 --> 00:12:26.432
system?
That would be important if we

00:12:26.432 --> 00:12:31.130
are going to do what I talked
about last time in terms of

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:35.827
inventing systems to transform
light energy into chemical

00:12:35.827 --> 00:12:40.693
energy in terms of the water
splitting reaction I discussed

00:12:40.693 --> 00:12:44.048
last time.
Also, molecules have acid-base

00:12:44.048 --> 00:12:47.152
chemistry.
And this is one of the most

00:12:47.152 --> 00:12:52.017
pervasive forms of chemical
reactivity that we can discuss.

00:12:52.017 --> 00:12:56.883
And so, we really have been
talking, so far in my lectures,

00:12:56.883 --> 00:13:02.000
about redox chemistry and
acid-base chemistry.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.364
And, as I go on,
during the next few lectures,

00:13:05.364 --> 00:13:10.000
we are going to be also talking
about properties like color and

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.336
magnetism and 3D structure from
theoretical considerations.

00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:18.448
Acid-base is one type of
reactivity, but then also there

00:13:18.448 --> 00:13:22.710
are all kinds of different modes
of reactivity that can be

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:26.971
classified in different ways.
Just to give you an example,

00:13:26.971 --> 00:13:31.158
there is a class of reactions
in organic chemistry called

00:13:31.158 --> 00:13:37.340
electrocyclic reactions.
We will be talking a little bit

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:43.375
about reactions of that sort.
And then there is something

00:13:43.375 --> 00:13:49.625
that Professor Ceyer referred to
earlier in the semester as

00:13:49.625 --> 00:13:56.090
stability and the idea that this
can take on both kinetic and

00:13:56.090 --> 00:14:00.661
thermodynamic forms.
And so, we would want,

00:14:00.661 --> 00:14:04.286
from first principles,
to be able to sit down and

00:14:04.286 --> 00:14:08.515
consider a molecular system
composed of whatever elements

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:12.669
from whatever part of the
periodic table it is composed,

00:14:12.669 --> 00:14:16.747
and just how these properties
follow naturally from the

00:14:16.747 --> 00:14:20.901
collection of elements that you
have put together into a

00:14:20.901 --> 00:14:23.695
molecule.
This is really chemistry and

00:14:23.695 --> 00:14:28.000
this is what we would like to be
able to do.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.690
In this next part,
what I would like to do is just

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:40.425
spend a little time right here
in 1957 because that is when

00:14:40.425 --> 00:14:46.000
Ronald Gillespie published his
VSEPR theory.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.512
Ronald Gillespie is now kind of
in the twilight of his career.

00:15:05.512 --> 00:15:10.481
He has published on his
"Lifetime in Chemistry." And so,

00:15:10.481 --> 00:15:15.993
you can Google Ronald Gillespie
and find information about him

00:15:15.993 --> 00:15:21.234
and his VSEPR theory that will
go well beyond what you will

00:15:21.234 --> 00:15:25.843
find in that section devoted to
it in your textbook.

00:15:25.843 --> 00:15:30.000
This VSEPR theory,
it is an acronym.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And it stands for Valance-Shell
Electron-Pair Repulsion theory.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.280
I tell you, the closer you get
to the board the less easily you

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.006
can see the things on that
board.

00:16:08.006 --> 00:16:12.094
When we talk about VSEPR
theory, Ronald Gillespie

00:16:12.094 --> 00:16:17.034
formulates it simply in terms of
five basic considerations.

00:16:17.034 --> 00:16:21.123
The first of these,
you can tell very easily from

00:16:21.123 --> 00:16:27.000
the name, and that is that
electron pairs repel each other.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.452
And note here I am underlining
the word "pairs." And that is

00:16:38.452 --> 00:16:42.679
because we know that electrons
are all negatively charged

00:16:42.679 --> 00:16:45.094
particles.
And so they should all

00:16:45.094 --> 00:16:48.264
individually repel each other.
And they do,

00:16:48.264 --> 00:16:50.830
in fact.
But, based on the ideas of

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:54.830
Lewis, you will see that
Gillespie is formulating this

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:59.660
theory, taking the notion of the
electron pair as the fundamental

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:04.436
unit to consider.
And he is saying that electron

00:17:04.436 --> 00:17:09.064
pairs are somehow organized in
space in a manner that they

00:17:09.064 --> 00:17:12.232
repel each other,
and they try to occupy

00:17:12.232 --> 00:17:15.723
different regions of space from
one another.

00:17:15.723 --> 00:17:20.515
And this is going to be useful
in terms of predicting the 3D

00:17:20.515 --> 00:17:24.900
structure of molecules,
and this is what this theory is

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.986
devoted to.
And, two molecules can have

00:17:27.986 --> 00:17:31.477
single bonds,
or they can have double bonds,

00:17:31.477 --> 00:17:37.000
or they can have triple bonds
between pairs of atoms.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.699
Maybe we will see this semester
also that molecules can have

00:17:41.699 --> 00:17:46.238
quadruple bonds between pairs of
atoms if the orbitals are

00:17:46.238 --> 00:17:49.663
available for that.
But in the VSEPR theory,

00:17:49.663 --> 00:17:55.000
in this context multiple bonds
are treated like single bonds.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.250
You might suspect that that
type of approximation is a

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:15.807
little crude and that it might
lead to certain guesses that

00:18:15.807 --> 00:18:19.304
might turn out not to be quite
right, but actually it is a

00:18:19.304 --> 00:18:22.493
useful enough approximation for
the prediction of the

00:18:22.493 --> 00:18:26.112
three-dimensional structures of
a lot of different molecules

00:18:26.112 --> 00:18:29.669
that we are actually going to
adopt for the purposes of our

00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:34.000
treatment of VSEPR theory.
Number three:

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000
if you have multiple central
atoms, --

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
- they are treated
independently.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.213
And you will see what I mean by
that in a moment.

00:18:58.213 --> 00:19:00.556
You should see,
from that statement,

00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:04.171
that in the context of VSEPR
theory, we are going to be

00:19:04.171 --> 00:19:08.255
trying to identify central atoms
and peripheral atoms that are

00:19:08.255 --> 00:19:11.000
attached all to the central
atom.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.529
And there may be one or more
central atoms in a molecule that

00:19:16.529 --> 00:19:22.152
themselves are interconnected.
And, four, we have two kinds of

00:19:22.152 --> 00:19:26.483
electron pairs that we consider
in VSEPR theory.

00:19:26.483 --> 00:19:31.000
We have lone pairs,
and we have bond pairs.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
And lone pairs occupy more
space --

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
-- than bond pairs do.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
And we will discuss the reason
for that in a moment.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.691
Finally, I want to give you
rule number five for 3D

00:20:04.691 --> 00:20:07.694
structure prediction using
VSEPR.

00:20:07.694 --> 00:20:13.418
That is that lone pairs are not
included in the description of

00:20:13.418 --> 00:20:17.640
the structure.
And you will see what I mean by

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:22.144
that in a moment.
The idea is that the names that

00:20:22.144 --> 00:20:27.774
we give to different molecular
structures have to do with the

00:20:27.774 --> 00:20:32.747
3D arrangement in space of the
nuclei only and not the

00:20:32.747 --> 00:20:35.000
electrons.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
The lone pairs are not included
in the structure description.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.102
This is reserved for the
nuclei.

00:20:55.102 --> 00:21:00.000
Now, let's do a couple of
examples.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.173
And, in introducing these
examples, I will also be giving

00:21:05.173 --> 00:21:10.625
you some more of the shorthand
that is associated with VSEPR

00:21:10.625 --> 00:21:13.581
treatment of molecular
structure.

00:21:13.581 --> 00:21:17.000
Let's talk about this one here.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.033
I have drawn here a very simple
Lewis dot structure for a

00:21:29.033 --> 00:21:32.000
hydrogen sulfide molecule,
H2S.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.786
And for a molecule like this,
we really only have two

00:21:35.786 --> 00:21:40.228
possibilities for the structure
because you have three nuclei.

00:21:40.228 --> 00:21:44.378
And so, either they can all be
arranged -- we are going to

00:21:44.378 --> 00:21:48.893
assume that nuclei are not going
to fuse together and be one on

00:21:48.893 --> 00:21:52.970
top of another because those
positively charged nuclei do

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:56.684
indeed repel each other very
successfully -- and so,

00:21:56.684 --> 00:22:02.000
therefore, we could either have
a linear or a bent structure.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:19.293
And we can approach that
question using the VSEPR theory

00:22:19.293 --> 00:22:25.174
very nicely.
We start out by recognizing

00:22:25.174 --> 00:22:30.000
that we have two lone pairs.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.972
That would be this one and this
one in the Lewis dot structure

00:22:39.972 --> 00:22:44.945
that are not interacting with
both hydrogen and sulfur nuclei.

00:22:44.945 --> 00:22:49.021
And we will call those E.
And then we have two bond

00:22:49.021 --> 00:22:50.000
pairs.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.780
And we will refer to those each
as X.

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:07.825
And then we have a single
central atom.

00:23:07.825 --> 00:23:15.925
We have a central sulfur atom.
And the central atom is usually

00:23:15.925 --> 00:23:22.431
given the label A.
And so, that means that we have

00:23:22.431 --> 00:23:30.000
a system here of the type AX two
E two.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.760
And if you look at the general
class of molecules of the type

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:42.619
AX two E two,
it turns out that we can draw

00:23:42.619 --> 00:23:46.000
their structures this way.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.891
What I am trying to indicate in
this structure is that one of

00:23:55.891 --> 00:23:59.654
these lone pairs is coming up
and out of the board this way

00:23:59.654 --> 00:24:04.000
and the other one is going back
behind the board the other way.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.518
These are our two bond pairs
that I am representing as lines.

00:24:08.518 --> 00:24:12.057
Bond pairs occupy less space
than lone pairs do,

00:24:12.057 --> 00:24:16.424
and that is because you have
two electrons interacting with

00:24:16.424 --> 00:24:20.942
two positively charged nuclei.
Whereas, in the case of a lone

00:24:20.942 --> 00:24:25.611
pair, you have a single pair of
electrons interacting only with

00:24:25.611 --> 00:24:29.000
a singly positively charged
nuclei.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.377
Two nuclei cause a greater
localization in space of bond

00:24:34.377 --> 00:24:37.701
pairs, as compared with lone
pairs.

00:24:37.701 --> 00:24:43.469
And the angle here that this
vector associated with the lone

00:24:43.469 --> 00:24:48.162
pair direction makes to the
hydrogen is something

00:24:48.162 --> 00:24:53.636
approximately tetrahedral.
Actually, probably larger than

00:24:53.636 --> 00:24:59.796
tetrahedral in this case because
the H-S-H angle is smaller than

00:24:59.796 --> 00:25:07.025
tetrahedral in H two S.
But this is an angle certainly

00:25:07.025 --> 00:25:12.369
greater than 90 degrees.
And that is one of our angles

00:25:12.369 --> 00:25:18.621
of the type E-A-X that describes
the interaction of a lone pair

00:25:18.621 --> 00:25:23.361
with a bond pair.
What we want to do is maximize

00:25:23.361 --> 00:25:28.605
those E-A-E and E-A-X angles
because, as I was saying

00:25:28.605 --> 00:25:33.747
earlier, a lone pair of
electrons requires a greater

00:25:33.747 --> 00:25:40.000
amount of space than does a bond
pair of electrons.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.569
The magnitude of the
repulsions, if we get back to

00:25:43.569 --> 00:25:46.847
the word repulsion in the name
of this theory,

00:25:46.847 --> 00:25:50.635
the greatest repulsions are
found between lone pairs.

00:25:50.635 --> 00:25:54.860
And so, next we have repulsions
between lone pairs and bond

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.609
pairs.
And then, finally,

00:25:56.609 --> 00:26:00.688
the weakest repulsions in the
system will be between bond

00:26:00.688 --> 00:26:03.478
pairs.
And so, the best

00:26:03.478 --> 00:26:08.561
three-dimensional structure
given by this theory is that

00:26:08.561 --> 00:26:13.735
which minimizes these different
repulsions in the system.

00:26:13.735 --> 00:26:18.910
If we considered the linear
structure, then what we would

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:23.993
have to do is put all the
electrons in the same plane of

00:26:23.993 --> 00:26:27.689
the molecule.
And these angles here would

00:26:27.689 --> 00:26:31.095
have to be 90.
And, overall,

00:26:31.095 --> 00:26:35.561
this would be a higher energy
structure because of the

00:26:35.561 --> 00:26:40.280
necessity of putting in an E
lone pair at 90 degrees to a

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.494
couple of bond pairs and so on
around the molecule.

00:26:44.494 --> 00:26:49.550
Three dimensionally in space,
this quasi-tetrahedral geometry

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:54.606
gets the four pairs of electrons
of the molecule the farthest

00:26:54.606 --> 00:27:00.000
apart in space and minimizes
electron pair repulsion.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.267
And that leads,
therefore, to a description of

00:27:03.267 --> 00:27:06.897
the structure as bent.
The structure is called bent

00:27:06.897 --> 00:27:11.254
rather than tetrahedral because
we include only the nuclei in

00:27:11.254 --> 00:27:15.174
the way that we refer to the
structure of the molecule.

00:27:15.174 --> 00:27:18.224
And we do not include those
electron pairs.

00:27:18.224 --> 00:27:22.000
Let me give you a feel for how
this looks.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.862
And in this picture that I am
going to show you,

00:27:40.862 --> 00:27:46.965
which will recall to mind some
that I showed you in my first

00:27:46.965 --> 00:27:51.931
couple of lectures,
you will see that what I have

00:27:51.931 --> 00:27:57.413
here is an electron density
isosurface for the H two S

00:27:57.413 --> 00:28:02.109
molecule.
And you can see here one of the

00:28:02.109 --> 00:28:04.490
S-H bonds.
Here is another S-H bond.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:08.505
Over here is that region in
space where the electron density

00:28:08.505 --> 00:28:11.226
isosurface is associated with
lone pairs.

00:28:11.226 --> 00:28:15.241
And you can see that certainly
the electron density is a lot

00:28:15.241 --> 00:28:19.323
more tightly contracted in the
region between the sulfurs and

00:28:19.323 --> 00:28:23.065
the hydrogens than it is
elsewhere, where it bulges out.

00:28:23.065 --> 00:28:26.808
And you can see that effect of
getting the eight valance

00:28:26.808 --> 00:28:30.686
electrons in this molecule as
far apart from each other in

00:28:30.686 --> 00:28:34.809
space as you can.
And then, furthermore,

00:28:34.809 --> 00:28:39.414
the coloring in this diagram
represents the propensity of

00:28:39.414 --> 00:28:44.184
electrons at that point in space
to come together as pairs.

00:28:44.184 --> 00:28:49.282
In effect, that coloring is the
three-dimensional manifestation

00:28:49.282 --> 00:28:53.641
of the Pauli principle mapped
onto an electron density

00:28:53.641 --> 00:28:58.000
isosurface for the H two S
*molecule.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.302
This type of picture is very
nicely associated with the VSEPR

00:29:03.302 --> 00:29:06.572
representation of molecular
structure.

00:29:06.572 --> 00:29:10.460
And I am going to go through
another example.

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:15.586
I am numbering this off so as
not to distract you with that

00:29:15.586 --> 00:29:17.000
picture.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:30.000
This next example is SF four.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Let me draw out a Lewis dot
structure of this.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.294
As you are looking at this
Lewis dot structure,

00:30:07.294 --> 00:30:11.377
one of the things you should do
is to see if the number of

00:30:11.377 --> 00:30:14.672
electrons that I am including in
my drawing is,

00:30:14.672 --> 00:30:18.683
in fact, the correct number of
valance electrons for this

00:30:18.683 --> 00:30:20.831
system.
And that is easy to do.

00:30:20.831 --> 00:30:25.057
You know that fluorine is in
Group 19 of the Periodic Table.

00:30:25.057 --> 00:30:30.000
You know that sulfur is in
Group 6 of the Periodic Table.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.622
And so you can quickly figure
out how many valance electrons

00:30:34.622 --> 00:30:37.050
there should be.
And, hopefully,

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:41.986
I have indicated all of them on
my drawing, and no more than all

00:30:41.986 --> 00:30:45.041
of them.
What you might not like about a

00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:49.193
drawing like this is that while
each fluorine has been

00:30:49.193 --> 00:30:53.423
represented as an octet,
as being associated with eight

00:30:53.423 --> 00:30:57.576
electrons, four pairs of
electrons, the central sulfur

00:30:57.576 --> 00:31:00.161
atom seems to be,
in this drawing,

00:31:00.161 --> 00:31:04.000
associated with ten electrons,
--

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.393
-- doesn't it?
That seems to be a violation of

00:31:07.393 --> 00:31:10.107
the octet rule.
And I will defer that

00:31:10.107 --> 00:31:13.425
observation for now,
but it is an interesting

00:31:13.425 --> 00:31:16.969
feature of this.
And, when you do yourself write

00:31:16.969 --> 00:31:21.116
down Lewis structures as a
prelude to subjecting them to

00:31:21.116 --> 00:31:25.414
the valence bond theory of
Pauling or to the valence shell

00:31:25.414 --> 00:31:29.863
electron pair repulsion theory
of Gillespie or the molecular

00:31:29.863 --> 00:31:34.463
orbital theory of Mulliken or
the density functional theory of

00:31:34.463 --> 00:31:37.931
Kohn and Pople,
you should be sticking with the

00:31:37.931 --> 00:31:42.229
basics here and making sure you
are working with the right

00:31:42.229 --> 00:31:47.496
number of valance electrons --
-- because your whole initial

00:31:47.496 --> 00:31:50.283
description of the molecular
system is going to revolve

00:31:50.283 --> 00:31:53.225
around the correct distribution
in space of this number of

00:31:53.225 --> 00:31:56.270
valance electrons that these
atoms that you are including in

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:59.264
the molecule bring into play.
And then you are going to see

00:31:59.264 --> 00:32:02.000
if you can predict properties
based on that.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:12.992
That is what we do first.
And, in terms of bond pairs,

00:32:12.992 --> 00:32:20.666
based on that structure,
we have four.

00:32:20.666 --> 00:32:30.000
And, in terms of lone pairs,
we have one.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:37.226
Therefore, the type of system
that we are working with here is

00:32:37.226 --> 00:32:42.675
AX four E.
This is one of the possible

00:32:42.675 --> 00:32:49.665
types, when you have five units,
surrounding a central atom.

00:32:49.665 --> 00:32:56.299
And the most typical type of
geometry that arises when we

00:32:56.299 --> 00:33:04.000
have five units surrounding a
central atom is as follows.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.978
The atom A at the center is
intended to be here.

00:33:08.978 --> 00:33:13.004
And then I am going to draw
five balls.

00:33:13.004 --> 00:33:18.724
You can think of them as
representing either lone pairs

00:33:18.724 --> 00:33:23.809
or fluorine atoms.
And I am going to color two of

00:33:23.809 --> 00:33:29.000
them to distinguish them from
the others.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.923
And this structure is called
TBP.

00:33:33.923 --> 00:33:41.000
And that standards for trigonal
bipyramidal.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.046
And the reason I have colored
this type different from that

00:33:51.046 --> 00:33:54.395
type is that in a trigonal
bipyramidal structure,

00:33:54.395 --> 00:33:56.837
there are two possible
environments,

00:33:56.837 --> 00:34:00.744
either for a lone pair of
electrons or for a bond pair of

00:34:00.744 --> 00:34:04.132
electrons.
You can have axial,

00:34:04.132 --> 00:34:10.193
and the axial position is
easily distinguished from the

00:34:10.193 --> 00:34:13.000
equatorial position --

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.353
-- by virtue of the fact that
an atom or a lone pair in the

00:34:23.353 --> 00:34:28.707
axial position makes 90 degree
angles, three of them to its

00:34:28.707 --> 00:34:31.616
neighbors.
Whereas, an atom in the

00:34:31.616 --> 00:34:35.904
equatorial position makes two 90
degree angles with respect to

00:34:35.904 --> 00:34:38.786
its neighbors.
It is three versus two that

00:34:38.786 --> 00:34:42.090
will help you distinguish axial
from equatorial.

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:45.746
And understanding that about
this molecular geometry,

00:34:45.746 --> 00:34:49.823
you can see that for the SF
four molecule there are

00:34:49.823 --> 00:34:53.126
two possibilities.
Note that when I am drawing a

00:34:53.126 --> 00:34:57.274
wedge here that means that the
atom connected to the central

00:34:57.274 --> 00:35:01.000
atom is coming out of the plane
at us.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.654
And the dashed bond means that
it is going back behind the

00:35:06.654 --> 00:35:12.109
plane so that viewed from the
top, this thing would look

00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:17.863
simply like a Mercedes Benz
symbol, just to understand that

00:35:17.863 --> 00:35:23.319
about the wedges and dash
nomenclature on these systems.

00:35:23.319 --> 00:35:29.270
And so, the two possibilities
that we have for our system is,

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:35.024
we can either put our lone pair
E up here and our four bond

00:35:35.024 --> 00:35:41.000
pairs X down here.
Or, we can have the lone pair

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.000
equatorial and our bond pairs,
two of them axial and two of

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.241
them equatorial.
As in the case of H two S,

00:35:51.241 --> 00:35:57.344
we had two structures
to distinguish between linear

00:35:57.344 --> 00:36:01.390
and bent.
Over here, we have a structure

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:06.251
with an equatorial lone pair or
with an axial lone pair for SF

00:36:06.251 --> 00:36:09.519
four.
And when you look at the top

00:36:09.519 --> 00:36:14.300
one and realize that you have
only two of these very bad lone

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:17.966
pair-bond pair contacts at 90
degrees, whereas,

00:36:17.966 --> 00:36:22.987
on the bottom one we have three
of these bad lone pair-bond pair

00:36:22.987 --> 00:36:27.210
contacts at 90 degrees,
you might be inclined to pick,

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:30.000
in fact, this top one.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.151
And that would be right because
it minimizes the number of the

00:36:39.151 --> 00:36:41.738
worst kind of repulsions.
In this case,

00:36:41.738 --> 00:36:43.984
lone pair bond pair at 90
degrees.

00:36:43.984 --> 00:36:48.272
And when we give this structure
a name, we are not going to call

00:36:48.272 --> 00:36:52.560
it trigonal bipyramidal because
we do not include the lone pair.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.575
We only include the positions
of the nuclei in the naming of

00:36:56.575 --> 00:37:01.000
the molecular structure.
This one is called a seesaw.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.721
Some of you may be aware that
there is a piece of playground

00:37:11.721 --> 00:37:17.442
equipment known as a seesaw.
You probably don't get a chance

00:37:17.442 --> 00:37:20.642
to play on them anymore very
much.

00:37:20.642 --> 00:37:23.551
Neither do I.
This is more fun,

00:37:23.551 --> 00:37:27.042
anyway.
And what I am showing you now

00:37:27.042 --> 00:37:32.569
on these side screens is a
picture of the electron density

00:37:32.569 --> 00:37:38.000
isosurface for the SF four
molecule.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.188
And hopefully,
you can see that it looks like

00:37:41.188 --> 00:37:43.942
a seesaw.
These two fluorines down here

00:37:43.942 --> 00:37:48.362
would be the legs of the seesaw.
And then you would sit either

00:37:48.362 --> 00:37:52.347
here or here and then lean
forward and put your hands on

00:37:52.347 --> 00:37:55.753
the lone pair and then rock up
and down somehow.

00:37:55.753 --> 00:37:58.000
I don't know.
Anyway.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.564
In this system,
you should be able to see that

00:38:01.564 --> 00:38:04.891
the lone pair on the sulfur,
which is here,

00:38:04.891 --> 00:38:08.138
is definitely in this
equatorial position,

00:38:08.138 --> 00:38:12.336
so the electro-density
isosurface has a nice dark-blue

00:38:12.336 --> 00:38:16.138
color where we find that lone
pair on the sulfur.

00:38:16.138 --> 00:38:20.732
And then the four flourines are
organized, according to the

00:38:20.732 --> 00:38:25.326
predictions of VSEPR theory,
with these 90 degree angles to

00:38:25.326 --> 00:38:30.000
the flourines that are oriented
in the axial.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.016
The two flourines are axial.
And then here is our two

00:38:35.016 --> 00:38:40.321
equatorial flourines here
spinning around in the belt of

00:38:40.321 --> 00:38:43.987
this system.
We could also say that you

00:38:43.987 --> 00:38:49.678
would be sitting on the axial
positions if you were going to

00:38:49.678 --> 00:38:55.659
ride on this particular seesaw.
Now, I would like to proceed in

00:38:55.659 --> 00:39:00.000
time briefly back from '57 to
1954.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.848
Because we need to discuss some
of the issues of the valance

00:39:02.848 --> 00:39:05.696
bond theory that Pauling brought
into the quantum mechanical

00:39:05.696 --> 00:39:07.000
treatment of molecules.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.305
What I am representing here are
a couple of hydrogen atoms 1S

00:39:42.305 --> 00:39:47.980
orbitals at a distance.
We have (H)A 1s and we have the

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.449
1s of hydrogen labeled B.

00:39:51.449 --> 00:39:58.070
And we are going to say that at
some infinite separation between

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:04.480
the two, they would not really
know much about the spin of the

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:09.000
electron on the partner
hydrogen.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.349
But as we bring them close
together, the spin is going to

00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:17.233
become very important.
And that is by virtue of the

00:40:17.233 --> 00:40:20.650
Pauli principle.
And you should remember that

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:25.310
one of the ways of formulating
the Pauli principle is that no

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:29.660
two electrons in a quantum
mechanical system can have the

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:33.000
same set of four quantum
numbers.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.806
As these two hydrogens get
close together,

00:40:36.806 --> 00:40:42.098
the stable situation for the
electrons coming from the two

00:40:42.098 --> 00:40:46.461
have opposite spin,
so I am drawing with spin-up

00:40:46.461 --> 00:40:50.917
and one with spin-down.
And then you are going to

00:40:50.917 --> 00:40:56.395
notice that here in the center
of our H two molecule,

00:40:56.395 --> 00:41:02.151
now, is a region of overlap and
of constructive interference of

00:41:02.151 --> 00:41:08.000
those 1s-orbital wave functions
from the two sides.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.362
In this representation of the
ground state of the molecule,

00:41:12.362 --> 00:41:14.769
the Pauli principle is
satisfied.

00:41:14.769 --> 00:41:18.756
And we can put this pair of
electrons into an orbital.

00:41:18.756 --> 00:41:22.141
And when that orbital is
represented that way,

00:41:22.141 --> 00:41:25.000
it is cylindrically symmetric.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
And we call that a sigma bond.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.873
In chemistry we talk often
about the properties of sigma

00:41:50.873 --> 00:41:53.354
bonds.
We talk about also the

00:41:53.354 --> 00:41:56.544
properties of things called pi
bonds.

00:41:56.544 --> 00:42:00.000
And we can even have delta
bonds.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:07.339
Just as I was talking about
bond multiplicity a moment ago

00:42:07.339 --> 00:42:13.390
with reference to VSEPR,
let me give you here an

00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:18.540
x,y-plane.
I am drawing in perspective an

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:23.433
x,y-plane.
And in this x,y-plane we are

00:42:23.433 --> 00:42:30.000
going to have,
actually, six atomic nuclei.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.369
And our z direction is
perpendicular to this plane

00:42:35.369 --> 00:42:40.739
drawn in perspective.
And I am drawing in here the

00:42:40.739 --> 00:42:46.000
positions of four hydrogen and
two carbon nuclei.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.465
And when I draw them in like
that, you are going to see that

00:42:52.465 --> 00:42:58.493
all the valence orbitals of this
system, except for two,

00:42:58.493 --> 00:43:04.949
lie in that x,y-plane.
And the two that lie out of

00:43:04.949 --> 00:43:08.882
that x,y-plane,
I will show you here,

00:43:08.882 --> 00:43:14.126
are p orbitals that go above
and below the plane.

00:43:14.126 --> 00:43:20.025
And I am shading in the
negative phase lobe of these pz

00:43:20.025 --> 00:43:24.067
orbitals.
This is pz from carbon A and

00:43:24.067 --> 00:43:30.621
this is a pz from carbon B.
And you can see that these are

00:43:30.621 --> 00:43:35.776
oriented in a side-on fashion,
so that the overlap area that

00:43:35.776 --> 00:43:40.582
can occur is a side-to-side
overlap of two neighboring P

00:43:40.582 --> 00:43:44.951
orbitals, like this.
And the distinguishing feature

00:43:44.951 --> 00:43:49.495
here, as compared to my
description of the sigma bond

00:43:49.495 --> 00:43:55.000
over there, is that it is not
cylindrically symmetric.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.809
This bond has a nodal surface,
which is the x,y-plane,

00:44:01.809 --> 00:44:09.388
where the phase changes as you
pass from above that plane to

00:44:09.388 --> 00:44:14.656
below that plane.
We have a nodal surface,

00:44:14.656 --> 00:44:19.666
a node containing the
internuclear axis.

00:44:19.666 --> 00:44:27.118
The type of bond that I have
drawn there is distinct from a

00:44:27.118 --> 00:44:32.000
sigma bond.
It is a pi bond.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.250
That bond over there,
the sigma bond,

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:42.937
has no nodal surfaces passing
through the internuclear axis.

00:44:42.937 --> 00:44:46.687
If I draw the internuclear axis
here, you can see that it has

00:44:46.687 --> 00:44:50.312
the same phase no matter where
you are with respect to that

00:44:50.312 --> 00:44:52.375
axis.
Plus, plus, plus everywhere.

00:44:52.375 --> 00:44:55.625
And here, if these lobes of
these two pz orbitals are

00:44:55.625 --> 00:44:58.937
considered to be positive in the
positive z direction,

00:44:58.937 --> 00:45:02.187
then as we go this way,
we pass through the x,y-plane

00:45:02.187 --> 00:45:06.943
and get down into negative z.
We now have negative phase,

00:45:06.943 --> 00:45:10.112
as indicated by the purple
shading down here.

00:45:10.112 --> 00:45:14.143
The fact that that happens only
once with respect to this

00:45:14.143 --> 00:45:18.103
internuclear axis is what tells
us that it is a pi bond.

00:45:18.103 --> 00:45:22.280
If there were two such nodal
surfaces, then we would have a

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.871
delta bond, and so on.
And next time,

00:45:24.871 --> 00:45:29.264
we are going to start talking
about the progression from these

00:45:29.264 --> 00:45:33.743
ideas onto hybridization.
And then from there onto

00:45:33.743 --> 00:45:35.409
molecular orbital theory.
