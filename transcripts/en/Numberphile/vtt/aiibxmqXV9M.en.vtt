PHIL MORIARTY: Some of you might
remember the math metal

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.750
song we did based around the
golden ratio where we took the

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.510
digits of phi, the golden
ratio, mapped them onto

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.240
various scales, mapped them
onto various rhythms, even

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.015
involved the lyrics.

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:15.910
And that was a huge amount of
fun, but I think Brady lost

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.660
some subscribers because, for
some strange reason, not

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.970
everybody's a heavy metal fan.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:21.820
I don't know why that is.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.750
So what I did instead was I
decided to do something which

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.370
is actually far removed
from metal.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.990
There's a little bit of guitar
in what you're about to hear,

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.619
but not very much-- very subtle,
very gentle tones,

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.570
piano, strings, interweaving.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.430
And what I've done is I've
sampled Vi Hart's voice.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.120
There's a great video.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.841
In one of her videos on tau, she
actually sings the notes,

00:00:43.841 --> 00:00:46.130
and she's got this
crystal clear

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.390
bell-like tone in her voice.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.830
It's really quite nice.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.910
So I've incorporated
that in this.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.550
What this actually is is a
mixture of phi, the golden

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.680
ratio, and tau, and scales
based around those.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.530
And Brady will somewhere add a
link to a detailed description

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.050
if you're musically inclined
about that.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.300
[MUSIC - PHIL MORIARTY,
"THE TAU OF PHI"]

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.570
PHIL MORIARTY: So that first
bit, those notes are based

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.265
around tau.

00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:14.565
And this coming in in
the background--

00:01:14.565 --> 00:01:16.118
[PIANO MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:19.070
PHIL MORIARTY: --that low note
signals where I'm going to

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.780
introduce in a second the notes
due to the golden ratio,

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.030
which are there in the
background, which is good.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.390
I wish I had a piano
in front of me.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.810
I don't.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.100
So then, those notes, that
rhythm, are the first three

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.055
digits of the golden ratio
played on top of that riff,

00:01:39.055 --> 00:01:46.974
which is rising from the notes
of tau, the digits of tau.

00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:51.305
And the strings also follow
certain digits as well.

00:01:51.305 --> 00:02:03.085

00:02:03.085 --> 00:02:07.320
PHIL MORIARTY: So coming in here
is a cameo by something

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.620
called "Lateralus" by a
band called Tool, who

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.870
are mentioned a lot.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.944
And here comes Vi's vocals.

00:02:25.944 --> 00:02:31.790
[VI HART LIGHTLY SINGING]

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.550
PHIL MORIARTY: So I've had to
do strange things with the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.910
sampling and the effects and
frequency shifting to get it

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.180
into the right pitch,
but I really just--

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.670
I'll play you Vi's vocals again
because they are really

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.516
quite neat if I can
find the channel.

[VI HART SINGING]

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.550
PHIL MORIARTY: So six, two,
eight, et cetera, are the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.700
digits of tau to pi.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.970
And in the description under the
video somewhere down here,

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.963
Brady will link to a
longer description.

00:02:58.963 --> 00:02:59.910
MALE SPEAKER: Just
do it that way.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.850
And actually, if you're
a seasoned--

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.480
PHIL MORIARTY: So with the fine
angles counterclockwise.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.770
So we go that way rather
than that way.
