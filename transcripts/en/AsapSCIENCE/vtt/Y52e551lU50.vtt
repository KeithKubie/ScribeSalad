00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.000
With over 1.8 billion bottles of Coca-Cola sold
a day and nearly half of Americans (48%) drinking

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.690
at least one glass of soda or pop a
day, it’s safe to say many of us love a

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.359
sugary drink. But what would happen to our
brains and bodies if we only drank soda?

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:20.580
As the drink enters your mouth, it’s high
acid content begins to erode the enamel on

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.689
your teeth, and the microorganisms in your
plaque start to feed off the sugar, which

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.310
can lead to cavities. Finish the can, and
you may have consumed upwards of 46 grams of

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.460
sugar. The receptors on your tongue sense
this and send a message to your cerebral cortex,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.940
activating the reward centre of your brain,
which says “more please!” After a week

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.050
of substituting the recommended 8 daily glasses
of water for cola instead, you would have

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.920
consumed around 5432 extra Calories. And this
is one of the biggest health problems linked

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.239
to carbonated drinks: weight gain.

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.879
It’s been estimated that ⅕ of the weight
gained in the US between 1977 and 2007 can

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.810
be attributed to soft drinks. Furthermore,
Yale researchers found that when people drink

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.000
soft drinks, they also consume more calories,
mainly because people don’t accurately account

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.430
for the added calories in their beverage.
On top of this, the high fructose corn syrup

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.250
- which is the primary soda sweetener - is
not metabolized in our bodies the same way

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.119
other sugars are. They increase liver fat,
upping the risk of cardiovascular disease,

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.759
and don’t stimulate the hormones insulin
and leptin. These hormones help the body signal

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.360
when we are full, to prevent overeating. The
disruption of insulin also increases the risk

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.049
of diabetes. Overall, research suggests that
reducing the amount of sugar in drinks could

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.670
prevent 1 million cases of obesity.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.640
So, should we swap in diet drinks instead?
Surprisingly there is still a link between

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.790
artificial sweeteners and weight gain as well.
Experiments have found that the sweet taste,

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.149
whether from real sugar or artificial sweetener,
enhances our appetite. Not to mention many

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.670
diet drinkers allow themselves to eat more
because they believe they have already reduced

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.729
calories, thinking “I’m having a diet
soda so I can have a large fry with my burger”.

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.060
But soft drinks can also age us. Telomeres
are protective caps on the end of our chromosomes

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.580
which shorten over time. And it turns out
that their rate of shortening is nearly the

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.870
same in a person who drinks 600ml of soda
a day, as it is in a smoker.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.830
So, what if you drank 2 litres of pop every
day? Well, one woman did just that for 16 years

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.650
straight, until she was hospitalized at age
31. With no family history of heart problems,

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.540
she suffered from arrhythmia and fainting
spells, and tests found her severely deficient

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.410
in potassium, as both fructose and caffeine
can lead to potassium loss through urine and

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.800
diarrhea. Luckily, our bodies have an amazing
ability to recover and once she quit, her

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.920
potassium levels and other complications began
to rebound.
