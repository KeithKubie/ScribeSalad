00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.884
Let's try something a little more difficult. Here's a polynomial with multiple

00:00:04.884 --> 00:00:09.109
variables. We have a and b. We're going to divide this polynomial by 5ab

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:13.761
squared. We divide each of these terms by 5ab squared. So now, you tell me.

00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:18.414
Using what you know about division and exponents, what would the answer be?
