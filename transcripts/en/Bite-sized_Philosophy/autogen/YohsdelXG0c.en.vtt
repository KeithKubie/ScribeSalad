00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780
now the utility of the American system
 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.279
now the utility of the American system
is that it is a hierarchy right there's

have a certain amount of autonomy and so

have a certain amount of autonomy and so
far that's worked sufficiently well

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
far that's worked sufficiently well
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.399

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939
continue to work I mean the Americans
 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.149
continue to work I mean the Americans
are very very robust people and they've

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159
are very very robust people and they've
 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.890
are very very robust people and they've
gone through things that are analogous

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900
gone through things that are analogous
 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.240
gone through things that are analogous
to what they're going through now many

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250
to what they're going through now many
 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.859

very dangerous thing to presume that the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180
very dangerous thing to presume that the
 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.640
very dangerous thing to presume that the
Americans are down for the count because

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650
Americans are down for the count because
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.800
Americans are down for the count because
they have an uncanny ability to rise out

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810
they have an uncanny ability to rise out
 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.390
they have an uncanny ability to rise out
from mash is even stronger than they

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400
from mash is even stronger than they
 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.340
from mash is even stronger than they
were before but you can certainly see

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350
were before but you can certainly see
 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.130
were before but you can certainly see
the danger lurking Europe that's that's

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140
the danger lurking Europe that's that's
 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.630
the danger lurking Europe that's that's
a different thing like I think the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640
a different thing like I think the
 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.050
a different thing like I think the
European state is doomed because I think

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060
European state is doomed because I think
 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.080
European state is doomed because I think
it grew too fast and it severed the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090
it grew too fast and it severed the
 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.330
it grew too fast and it severed the
connection between like there's not the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
connection between like there's not the
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.630
connection between like there's not the
proper hierarchy of identification so

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640
proper hierarchy of identification so
 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.030
proper hierarchy of identification so
and people are saying wait Brussels like

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040
and people are saying wait Brussels like
 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.710
and people are saying wait Brussels like
who the hell are you guys why are you

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720
who the hell are you guys why are you
 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.630
who the hell are you guys why are you
making decisions for us and we don't

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640
making decisions for us and we don't
 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.520
making decisions for us and we don't
agree with your decisions and like are

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530
agree with your decisions and like are
 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.109
agree with your decisions and like are
you sure that Greece and Germany can be

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119
you sure that Greece and Germany can be
 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.569
you sure that Greece and Germany can be
in the same place because that's by no

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579
in the same place because that's by no
 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.240
in the same place because that's by no
means self-evident right the Germans

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250
means self-evident right the Germans
 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.170
means self-evident right the Germans
aren't very happy about it

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180
aren't very happy about it
 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.670
aren't very happy about it
and the Greeks aren't very happy about

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680
and the Greeks aren't very happy about
 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.339
and the Greeks aren't very happy about
it and one of the rules for making an

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349
it and one of the rules for making an
 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.020
it and one of the rules for making an
organization is that it's a lot easier

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030
organization is that it's a lot easier
 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.520
organization is that it's a lot easier
to make a functional or

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
to make a functional or
 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.650
to make a functional or
organization worse than it is to make a

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660
organization worse than it is to make a
 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.410
organization worse than it is to make a
dysfunctional organization better and so

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420
dysfunctional organization better and so
 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.390
dysfunctional organization better and so
you might say well you've got Germany

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400
you might say well you've got Germany
 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.490
you might say well you've got Germany
and France and England well let's say

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500
and France and England well let's say
 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.990
and France and England well let's say
Germany and France powerhouses

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000
Germany and France powerhouses
 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.540
Germany and France powerhouses
especially Germany they can afford to

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550
especially Germany they can afford to
 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.210
especially Germany they can afford to
bring Greece in well maybe but there's

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220
bring Greece in well maybe but there's
 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.030
bring Greece in well maybe but there's
no evidence that they can afford it so I

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040
no evidence that they can afford it so I
 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.010
no evidence that they can afford it so I
mean Greece is unbelievably corrupt no

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020
mean Greece is unbelievably corrupt no
 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.750
mean Greece is unbelievably corrupt no
one pays their income tax that's a big

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760
one pays their income tax that's a big
 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.199
one pays their income tax that's a big
problem right and bringing them in to a

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209
problem right and bringing them in to a
 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.170
problem right and bringing them in to a
union at a high order has no effect

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180

whatsoever on the micro behaviors and
 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.160
whatsoever on the micro behaviors and
the thing is the micro behaviors have to

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170
the thing is the micro behaviors have to
 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.020
the thing is the micro behaviors have to
be rectified and no one really knows how

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030
be rectified and no one really knows how
 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.580
be rectified and no one really knows how
to do that how do you stop a country

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590
to do that how do you stop a country
 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.530
to do that how do you stop a country
where people don't pay their taxes from

where people don't pay their taxes from
 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.509
where people don't pay their taxes from

how do you stop people from not paying
 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.020
how do you stop people from not paying
their taxes why do we pay our taxes who

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030
their taxes why do we pay our taxes who
 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.059
their taxes why do we pay our taxes who

decide not to you know and the
 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.729
decide not to you know and the
government wouldn't have the resources

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739
government wouldn't have the resources
 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.979
government wouldn't have the resources
to run around gathering them all up for

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989
to run around gathering them all up for
 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.600
to run around gathering them all up for
one reason or another it's become

one reason or another it's become
 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.180
one reason or another it's become
customary for people in functional

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190

Western democracies to pay their taxes
 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.780
Western democracies to pay their taxes
but why who knows it would have been way

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790
but why who knows it would have been way
 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.370
but why who knows it would have been way
easier for us just to do what the Greeks

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380
easier for us just to do what the Greeks
 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.020
easier for us just to do what the Greeks
did and pretend to pay them you know so

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030
did and pretend to pay them you know so
 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.479
did and pretend to pay them you know so
they're too big I think and so the

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489
they're too big I think and so the
 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.220
they're too big I think and so the

doing that but but the danger is the
 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.400

nation will subordinate the individual
 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.830
nation will subordinate the individual
and I do see it as another example of

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840
and I do see it as another example of
 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.610
and I do see it as another example of
safe spaces

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620
safe spaces
 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.300
safe spaces
it's just scales different so and that's

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310
it's just scales different so and that's
 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.810
it's just scales different so and that's
why I think that the proper antidote to

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820
why I think that the proper antidote to
 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.610
why I think that the proper antidote to
that to both the chaos on the left and

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620
that to both the chaos on the left and
 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.500
that to both the chaos on the left and
the order on the right roughly speaking

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510
the order on the right roughly speaking
 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.420
the order on the right roughly speaking
is to walk the proper line in the middle

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430
is to walk the proper line in the middle
 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.520
is to walk the proper line in the middle
and when did we better do that because

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530
and when did we better do that because
 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.979
and when did we better do that because
things are not things are too chaotic at

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989
things are not things are too chaotic at
 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.699
things are not things are too chaotic at
the moment so it's not good maybe it's

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709
the moment so it's not good maybe it's
 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:02.360
the moment so it's not good maybe it's
really good

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370
really good
 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.699
really good
that's possible but we're in a state

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709
that's possible but we're in a state
 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.560
that's possible but we're in a state
where I really believe we're in a state

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570
where I really believe we're in a state
 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.009
where I really believe we're in a state
where things could go any number of ways

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019
where things could go any number of ways
 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.780
where things could go any number of ways
and there's no there's no predicting it

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790
and there's no there's no predicting it
 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.860
and there's no there's no predicting it
so and I've never felt that you know I

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870
so and I've never felt that you know I
 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.810
so and I've never felt that you know I
mean I lived in the 80s and you know

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820
mean I lived in the 80s and you know
 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.729
mean I lived in the 80s and you know
political correctness rose up in the 90s

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739
political correctness rose up in the 90s
 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.740
political correctness rose up in the 90s
as well and I can remember a lot of what

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750
as well and I can remember a lot of what
 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.330
as well and I can remember a lot of what
happened in the early 70s with the oil

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340
happened in the early 70s with the oil
 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.159
happened in the early 70s with the oil
crisis and all that so there were times

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169
crisis and all that so there were times
 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.480
crisis and all that so there were times
when things were

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490
when things were
 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.430
when things were
shaky but they weren't shaky the way

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440
shaky but they weren't shaky the way
 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.740
shaky but they weren't shaky the way
they are now they're an internal

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750
they are now they're an internal
 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.840
they are now they're an internal
shakiness rather than something that was

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850
shakiness rather than something that was
 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.249
shakiness rather than something that was
a threat that was seem to be imposed

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259
a threat that was seem to be imposed
 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.290
a threat that was seem to be imposed
from the outside and that's different

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300
from the outside and that's different
 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.710
from the outside and that's different
and and it's it's it is associated with

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720
and and it's it's it is associated with
 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.909
and and it's it's it is associated with
with this intellectual war that's going

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919
with this intellectual war that's going
 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.950
with this intellectual war that's going
on with post-modernism and new Marxism

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960
on with post-modernism and new Marxism
 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.460
on with post-modernism and new Marxism
and all of that as well so
