00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.150
So this is an amazing exhibit at the
Autry museum

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.710
well this exhibit looks at the
photographic collection that was created

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:20.040
by about La Raza magazine and newspaper in
1967 to 1977

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.940
This is a pretty seminal

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.869
publication that comes out of a
community-based social protest movement

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.340
all of these groups are doing something
new as part of their efforts to really

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.680
communicate something that's being left
out of the mainstream press

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.220
well for the last four or five years the UCLA Chicano
Studies Research Center has been working

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.680
with the photographers to develop a
digital archive. Here's a timeline

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.820
almost a neural network. Our goal is to really
get this embedded into the educational pipeline.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.480
This is Los Angeles history
it's American history there are 25,000

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.300
images so the vast majority of images
that were shot never been seen before

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.080
they really went out there with the goal
of showing you things that the LA Times

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.590
wasn't going to show you the other
major producer of images was the LA

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.680
Sheriff's Department. I love the way they
place new surveillance images.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.300
They documented the people that were
doing surveillance they also took

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.250
numerous photographs of undercover
police they took a lot of effort to

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.880
photograph youth but you have to realize these
are photographers maybe in their 20s

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.120
looking at the generation coming up just
behind them and wanting to capture them

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.620
they're also trying to just simply
humanize their community. So I really I

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.220
really love this photograph. It brings
together both the role of youth but also

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.980
just the immediacy of the press and
they're facing many of the same issues

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.180
Do we need another La Raza? The media
environment is changed so much and so

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.220
the nature of protest has changed you
see various efforts to kind of pull out

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.640
and have portraits. Some of the ones
where they're posing to kind of show the injuries

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.300
This kind of implicit trust
between the photographer and the subject

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.320
the whole exhibition ends with this kind
of lesson in community

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.700
Well and that politics is not
something of individuals identifying in

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.300
some abstract terms but of families in a
community
