00:00:00.442 --> 00:00:01.900
Let's think about
the different use

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.820
cases for credit default swaps.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.330
So let's say that I have
some company over here,

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.980
and it's given a
BB credit rating.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.820
And this rating, of course,
comes from a credit rating

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:20.281
agency, sometimes called a
ratings agency or a rating

00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:20.780
agency.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.160
I've seen it every
different way.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.750
So this would be like Moody's or
Standard and Poor's or whatever

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.110
else.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.630
And they look at this company,
and they look at its business,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.671
they look at its balance
sheet, and they say, OK,

00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:32.009
it's not super safe, but
it's not super risky either.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.710
We give it a BB rating.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.020
And let's say that there's
an investor over here who

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.740
wants to lend money
to this company.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.880
So he might lend them
some money and get

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.285
some interest in return.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.120
But this investor doesn't
like this level of safety.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.770
He wants to make sure
that he's made whole

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.650
even if this company
goes out of business.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.430
So he can go to a writer
of a credit default swap,

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.700
and the most famous of
those credit default

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.564
swap writers is or was AIG.

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:04.980
And he'll say,
hey, AIG, I'm going

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.150
to pay you a little
bit every year.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.330
You could view that as
an insurance premium.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.460
And in exchange,
you are essentially

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.349
going to ensure me in the case
of a default by this company.

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:20.390
And what we already said,
it's a little bit shady

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.760
because it was not
regulated like insurance.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.150
So AIG did not have
to set anything aside.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.110
And what was
powerful here for AIG

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.800
is that the rating
agencies continued

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.420
to give AIG a very high rating.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.486
So let's say it had a AA rating.

00:01:34.486 --> 00:01:36.110
So despite the fact
that it kept taking

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.730
on all these liabilities,
the credit rating agency

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.390
says, hey, we'll
still give you a AA.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.212
So they were able to use
this AA rating to keep

00:01:43.212 --> 00:01:45.295
writing these contracts,
to keep writing insurance

00:01:45.295 --> 00:01:48.300
and not setting anything aside,
and essentially just getting,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.800
almost you could
view it, free money

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.660
with having to pay
the piper eventually.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.340
Now this is one scenario.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.340
Another scenario is
maybe an investment bank

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.250
creates some type of
special purpose entity

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.600
or some collateralized debt
obligation right over here.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.450
And they have their
different tranches.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.340
And maybe for the senior
tranche over here,

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.720
just so that they can sell them
to pension funds who can only

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.590
buy AA rated debt,
pension funds.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.310
The investment bank goes
to AIG and says, hey,

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.220
can this entity right over
here buy credit default swaps?

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.830
Can we enter into credit
default swap agreements

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.440
on you, so that in case any
of this stuff were to default,

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.090
you will also insure that?

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.960
And once we do that,
then a rating agency.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.090
So this is a security.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.310
This is a senior tranche of a
collateralized debt obligation

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.380
now, the senior tranche, and
now that that senior tranche

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.760
is essentially insured by
AIG, a credit rating agency,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.030
once again, will assign
this a AA rating.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.950
Even though this
thing might be made up

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.240
of a bunch of sub-prime
mortgages and all of the rest,

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.710
although it is a senior tranche
so it'll be made whole first,

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.630
but now pension funds can
buy this type of thing.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:13.970
The last use case is maybe you
have a hedge fund out here who

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.990
doesn't want to lend
anybody any money,

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.320
but is convinced that a whole
bunch of these companies, maybe

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.930
this company over here or maybe
this company over here, that

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.220
has some other rating.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.110
So this is another company.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.897
This hedge fund is convinced
that these companies are going

00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:31.480
to default on their
debt, that there's

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.770
going to be a credit
crisis of some kind.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.440
Well, then this hedge fund can
enter into credit default swap

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.360
agreements to essentially
get insurance,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.420
but not having
anything to insure.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.780
It's like getting car insurance
on someone else's driving

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.530
or someone else's
car, and you kind of

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.950
are starting to hope that they
have to have a car accident.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.890
Because now if this guy
has a credit default

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.100
swap on this company
right over here,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.510
despite the fact that they
didn't lend out to them,

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.801
the hedge funds is going to
pay a little bit every year

00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:04.120
and get the insurance.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.900
And they are essentially going
to hope that this company goes

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.820
out of business,
because if it does,

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.820
then they're going to get
the insurance payment.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.950
They're going to get the same
payment that this investor

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.449
would have, but they would have
never had to lend the money.

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:16.890
So you could use
it as a side bet,

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.630
you could use it as a way of
making lower-rated securities

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.720
all of a sudden acceptable
to pension funds,

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.860
or you could use it as a
straight-up way of insuring

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.410
debt that you're
lending to someone else.
