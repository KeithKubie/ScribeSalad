00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.520
From subliminal imagery to dated stereotypes,
much has been written about details later

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.559
deemed inappropriate in kids films, but what
about the mature themes and jokes put their

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:17.530
intentionally for older audiences?

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.220
While these scenes may provide parents with
little chuckle or food for thought, they could

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.260
lead to some pretty awkward conversations
with their kids afterwards.&nbsp;

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.140
Here are 10 Inappropriate Scenes in Kids Movies&nbsp;
Zootopia&nbsp;

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.320
While Judy Hopps acts as if she’s above
corruption when investigating the missing

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.840
Otter in Zootopia, she uses several questionable
tactics to uncover the mystery.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.210
Including but not limited to blackmailing
and coercing Nick, as well as colluding with

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.920
Zootopia’s organized crime element.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.850
Judy’s ‘by the book’ persona goes out
the window completely when she has Mr. Big

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.600
threaten to ice Duke Weaselton in order to
scare some information out of him.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.239
I guess the moral of this story is that the
ends justify the means.

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.030
Toy Story&nbsp;
As early as their first film, Pixar was slipping

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.679
in jokes that only older viewers would catch.

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.819
Did you ever notice the toy in Toy Story that’s
a clear allusion to the sex trade industry?

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:08.030
Of course this is in the deranged Sid’s
bedroom, seen when all of his mutilated toys

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.260
come out from under the bed.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.030
There’s one that looks like a Barbie doll’s
legs attached onto a fishing line with a hook

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.020
on the end, literally turning her into a hooker.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.691
Shrek&nbsp;
There’s a lot more that’s inappropriate

00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:20.830
about Lord Farquaad than just his name.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.550
Did you ever wonder what he was doing in his
bed when he asks the mirror to show him Princess

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.280
Fiona’s image again and again?

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.260
There’s even a subtle movement under his
covers when he take a peak for some reason.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.500
Really the Mirror’s disgusted face says
it all.&nbsp;

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.560
Toy Story 3&nbsp;
One of the great things about Toy Story 3

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.030
was that it felt like it was made for fans
who grew up with the first film and were now

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.880
the same age as Andy as he headed off for
College.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.840
The image of Woody’s friends joining hands
and accepting their impending incineration

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.850
recalls stories told about real-life tragedies.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.530
This is easily one of Pixar’s most intensely
disturbing moments, thank god for THE CLAW

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.100
saving the day just as the toys had accepted
their fate.&nbsp;

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.450
Despicable Me 2&nbsp;
Even though Despicable Me 2 was only released

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.000
a few years ago, there’s one scene that
probably wouldn’t make it past censors today.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.700
When Gru is having a bad date with the shallow,
annoying Shannon, Lucy saves him by shooting

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.160
Shannon in the rear with a mild moose tranquilizer.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.560
While it’s obvious that Gru didn’t administer
the drugs himself, just having a date end

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.660
up drugged and in such a compromising position
is bad for business, even for a supervillain.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.830
The Good Dinosaur&nbsp;
Considering that The Good Dinosaur seemed

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.540
to be more in line with Cars, in that it was
a Pixar film with very little adult appeal,

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.380
there was one scene that seemed particularly
out of place.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.450
No, not the scene where Arlo’s father dies,
by now that’s par for the course in Disney

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.481
film, I’m talking about the scene the where
Arlo and Spot trip balls (hallucinate) on

00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:42.640
some rotten fruit.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.209
Their out of body experience looks like a
pretty fun time, despite the brief drug hangover.&nbsp;

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.561
Inside Out&nbsp;
As if Inside Out’s Riley doesn’t have

00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:54.740
enough problems, it’s likely things could
actually get worse for the 11 year old.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.650
Things got so bad in the film that she stole
her mom’s credit card, ran away and hopped

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.650
a bus to Minnesota.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.069
While we see her finally adjusting to her
new home near the end, we can’t help but

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.210
think her world could be easily crushed again
if her dad ever finds out that her mom daydreams

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.240
of an ex boyfriend anytime she needs to go
to her happy place, implying she regrets her

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.660
choice in husbands.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.990
Perhaps the sequel will be about Riley’s
emotions during her parents’ turbulent divorce.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.240
Ghostbusters&nbsp;
In the 1980s the lines between kids movies

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.290
and&nbsp; adult fare was a little more blurred
than it is now.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.260
For example you have a film like Ghostbusters,
a PG-13 movie with lots of mild swearing and

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.880
sexual innuendo, yet marketed towards kids
with toys and an animated series.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.870
One scene in particular that shouldn’t make
any sense to younger viewers is as brief as

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.880
it is inappropriate.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.069
We’re referring of course to the now infamous
felatio scene that implies Ray is receiving

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:43.520
oral sex from a ghost.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.959
Don’t expect anything like this in this
summer’s reboot.&nbsp;

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.959
How To Train Your Dragon 2&nbsp;
This next entry isn’t so much inappropriate

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.480
as it is just an unexpected nod to a character’s
sexuality.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.489
The world of How To Train Your Dragon is filled
with gruff vikings, so it may surprise you

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.459
to find out which character is actually gay.

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.849
In How To Train Your Dragon 2, Hiccup’s
parents reunite and start bickering right

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.379
away, causing Gobber to comment “This is
why I never married.

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:13.170
This and one other reason.”

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.160
That other reason could be anything, but actor
Craig Ferguson and director Dean Deblois have

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.150
both confirmed that Gobber just hasn’t found
the right man.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.280
If anything, the line is a little too subtle,
perhaps How To Train Your Dragon 3 will contain

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.199
a more overt reference to Gobber’s sexuality.&nbsp;

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:31.680
Ice Age : Dawn of the Dinosaurs&nbsp;
In the third Ice Age film, Buck, the weasel

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.350
voiced by Simon Pegg, goes a little too far
when regaling the possums with stories.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.530
Buck is about to tell them about the time
used a sharpened clam shell to turn a T-Rex

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.000
into a T-Rachel when the mammoths put an end
to fairy tale time.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.320
Parents watching were probably very thankful
that Buck didn’t go into any more detail

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.350
about his crude castration of a dinosaur.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.810
These are just a few of the jokes and references
that hopefully went over kid’s head, did

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.090
any go over ours?

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.790
