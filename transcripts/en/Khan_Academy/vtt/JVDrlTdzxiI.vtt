00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.810
I have here three linear
equations of four unknowns.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.050
And like the first video, where
I talked about reduced

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.690
row echelon form, and solving
systems of linear equations

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.510
using augmented matrices, at
least my gut feeling says,

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.720
look, I have fewer equations
than variables, so I probably

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.470
won't be able to constrain
this enough.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.370
Or maybe I'll have an infinite
number of solutions.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.690
But let's see if I'm right.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.720
So let's construct the augmented
matrix for this

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.310
system of equations.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.190
My coefficients on the x1
terms are 1, 1, and 2.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.230
Coefficients on the x2
are 2, 2, and 4.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.680
Coefficients on x3
are 1, 2, and 0.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.190
There's of course no x3 term,
so we can view it as a 0

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.060
coefficient.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.750
Coefficients on the x4 are
1, minus 1, and 6.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.080
And then on the right-hand side
of the equals sign, I

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.670
have 8, 12, and 4.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.360
There's my augmented matrix,
now let's put this guy into

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.430
reduced row echelon form.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.640
The first thing I want to do is,
I want to zero out these

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.500
two rows right here.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.910
So what can we do?

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.550
I'm going to keep my first row
the same for now, so it's 1,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.450
2, 1, 1, 8.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.080
That line essentially represents
my equals sign.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.670
What I can do is, let me
subtract-- let me replace the

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.170
second row with the second
row minus the first row.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:45.735
So 1 minus 1 is 0, 2 minus 2
is 0, 2 minus 1 is 1, 1--

00:01:45.735 --> 00:01:54.530
negative 1 minus 1 is minus 2,
and then 12 minus 8 is 4.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.140
There you go, that looks good so
far, it looks like column,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.680
or x2 which is represented by
column two, looks like it

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.590
might be a free variable, but
we're not 100% sure yet.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.240
Let's do all of our rows.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.910
So let's take-- to get rid of
this guy right here, let's

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.620
replace our third equation with
the third equation minus

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.720
two times our first equation.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:26.950
So we get 2 minus 2 times 1 is
0, 4 minus 2 times 2, well

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:35.800
that's 0, 0 minus 2 times
1, that's minus 2.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.330
6 minus 2 times 1, well
that's 4, right?

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.600
6 minus 2.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.380
And then 4 minus 2 times
8, is minus 16, 4

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.510
minus 16 is minus 12.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.570
Now what can we do?

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.740
Well, let's see if we can
get rid of this minus

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.100
2 term right there.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.640
So let me rewrite my
augmented matrix.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.510
I'm going to keep row two the
same this time, so I get a 0,

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.390
0, 1, minus 2, and essentially
my equals sign, or the

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.070
augmented part of the matrix.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.700
And now let's see
what I can do.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.564
Let me get rid of this 0 up
here, because I want to get

00:03:19.564 --> 00:03:21.090
into reduced row echelon form.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.170
So any of my pivot entries,
which are always going to have

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.800
the coefficient 1, or the entry
1, it should be the only

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.560
non-zero term in my row.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.910
How do I get rid of
this one here?

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.720
Well I can subtract-- I can
replace row one with row 1

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.000
minus row 2.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:48.380
So 1 minus 0 is 1, 2 minus 0 is
2, 1 minus 1 is 0, 1 minus

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.520
minus 2, that's 1 plus
2, which is 3.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.750
And then 8 minus 4 is 4.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.200
And now how can I get
rid of this guy?

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:06.910
Well let me replace row 3 with
row 3 plus 2 times row 1.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.780
Sorry, with row 3 plus
2 times row 2.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.050
Right?

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.600
Because then you'd have minus
2, plus 2 times this, and

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.410
they'd cancel out.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.070
So let's see the zeros.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.110
0 plus 2 times 0, that's 0.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:26.120
0 plus 2 times 0, that's 0,
minus 2 plus 2 times 1 is 0.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:35.220
4 plus 2 times minus 2, that's
4 minus 4, that's 0.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.410
And then I have minus
12, plus 2 times 4.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.175
That's minus 12 plus
8, that's minus 4.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.680
Now, this is interesting right
now-- this is interesting.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.170
I have essentially put this in
reduced row echelon form.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.720
I have two pivot entries, that's
a pivot entry right

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.230
there, and that's a pivot
entry right there.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.230
They're the only non-zero term
in their respective columns.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.420
And this is just kind of a style
issue, but this pivot

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.010
entry is in a lower
row than that one.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.930
So it's in a column to the right
of this one right there.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.860
And I just inspected, this looks
like a-- this column two

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.120
looks kind of like a free
variable-- there's no pivot

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.410
entry there, no pivot
entry there.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.820
But let's see, let's
map this back to

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.860
our system of equations.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.990
These are just numbers to
me and I just kind of

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.600
mechanically, almost like a
computer, put this in reduced

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.010
row echelon form.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.530
Actually, almost exactly
like a computer.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.000
But let me put it back to my
system of linear equations, to

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.130
see what our result is.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.610
So we get 1 times x1, let
me write it in yellow.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:50.930
So I get 1 times x1, plus 2
times x2, plus 0 times x3,

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.080
plus 3 times x4 is equal to 4.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.100
Obviously I could ignore this
term right there, I didn't

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.930
even have to write it.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:59.220
Actually.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.980
I'm not going to write that.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:05.210
Then I get 0 times x1, plus 0
times x2, plus 1 times x3, so

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.860
I can just write that.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.850
I'll just write the one.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:12.650
1 times x3, minus 2 times
x4, is equal to 4.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.580
And then this last term,
what do I get?

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.030
I get 0 x1, plus 0 x2 plus 0
x3 plus 0 x4, well, all of

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.080
that's equal to 0, and I've got
to write something on the

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.410
left-hand side.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.240
So let me just write a 0,
and that's got to be

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.800
equal to minus 4.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.070
Well this doesn't make
any sense whatsoever.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.060
0 equals minus 4.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.160
This is this is a nonsensical
constraint, this is

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.230
impossible.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.430
0 can never equal minus 4.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.653
This is impossible.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.420
Which means that it is
essentially impossible to find

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.550
an intersection of these three
systems of equations, or a

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.030
solution set that satisfies
all of them.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.220
When we looked at this
initially, at the beginning of

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.650
the of the video, we said
there are only three

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.170
equations, we have four
unknowns, maybe there's going

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.980
to be an infinite set
of solutions.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.330
But turns out that these three--
I guess you can call

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.320
them these three surfaces--
don't intersect in r4.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.560
Right?

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.970
These are all four dimensional,
we're dealing in

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.080
r4 right here, because we have--
I guess each vector has

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.210
four components, or we have four
variables, is the way you

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.130
could think about it.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.100
And it's always hard to
visualize things in r4.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.350
But if we were doing things
in r3, we can imagine the

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:34.560
situation where, let's say
we had two planes in r3.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.680
So that's one plane right there,
and then I had another

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.930
completely parallel
plane to that one.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.110
So I had another completely
parallel plane

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.490
to that first one.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.320
Even though these would be two
planes in r3, so let me give

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:47.910
an example.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.640
So let's say that this first
plane was represented by the

00:07:51.640 --> 00:08:02.680
equation 3x plus 6y plus 9z is
equal to 5, and the second

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:08.400
plane was represented by the
equation 3x plus 6y plus 9z is

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.170
equal to 2.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:15.630
These two planes in r3-- this is
the case of r3, so this is

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.540
r3 right here.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.810
These two planes, clearly
they'll never intersect.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:23.520
Because obviously this one has
the same coefficients adding

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.430
up to 5, this one has the same
coefficient adding up to 2.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.690
And when, if we just looked at
this initially, if it wasn't

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.090
so obvious, we would have
said, we have only two

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.530
equations with three unknowns,
maybe this has an infinite set

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:34.230
of solutions.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.659
But it won't be the case,
because you can actually just

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:39.799
subtract this equation, from the
bottom equation, from the

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:40.460
top equation.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.570
And what do you get?

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.190
You would get a very familiar--
so if you just

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.220
subtract the bottom equation
from the top equation, and you

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.183
get 3x minus 3x, 6y minus 6y, 9z
minus 9z-- actually, let me

00:08:50.183 --> 00:08:51.500
do it right here.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.300
So for that minus that, you get
zero is equal to 5 minus

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.700
2, which is 3.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.200
Which is a very similar result
that we got up there.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.110
So when you have two parallel
planes, in this case in r3, or

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:07.150
really to any kind of two
parallel equations, or a set

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.620
of parallel equations,
they won't intersect.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:12.290
And you're going to get, when
you put it in reduced row

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.490
echelon form, or you just do
basic elimination, or you

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.250
solve the systems, you're going
to get a statement that

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.720
zero is equal to something, and
that means that there are

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.970
no solutions.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.030
So the general take-away,
if you have zero equals

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:27.840
something, no solutions.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.770
If you have the same number of
pivot variables, the same

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:36.210
number of pivot entries as you
do columns, so if you get the

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.040
situations-- let me write this
down, this is good to know.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.600
if you have zero is equal
to anything, then

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.760
that means no solution.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.710
If you're dealing with r3,
then you probably have

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.680
parallel planes, in r2 you're
dealing with parallel lines.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:55.930
If you have the situation where
you have the same number

00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:02.960
of pivot entries as columns, so
it's just 1, 1, 1, 1, this

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.350
is the case of r4 right there.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.390
I think you get the idea.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.440
That equals a, b, c, d.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.690
Then you have a unique
solution.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:19.010
Now if, you have any free
variables-- so free variables

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:23.190
look like this, so let's say we
have 1, 0, 1, 0, and then I

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:30.010
have the entry 1, 1,
let me be careful.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:33.320
0, let me do it like this.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:41.040
1, 0, 0, and then I have the
entry 1, 2, and then I have a

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.520
bunch of zeroes over here.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.370
And then this has to equal
zero-- remember, if this was a

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.760
bunch of zeroes equaling some
variable, then I would have no

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.330
solution, or equalling some
constant, let's say this is

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.820
equal to 5, this
is equal to 2.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.120
If this is our reduced row
echelon form that we

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.860
eventually get to, then we have
a few free variables.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.750
This is a free, or I guess we
could call this column a free

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.730
column, to some degree this
one would be too.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.390
Because it has no
pivot entries.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.280
These are the pivot entries.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.420
So this is variable x2 and
that's variable x4.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.910
Then these would be
free, we can set

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.240
them equal to anything.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.170
So then here we have unlimited
solutions,

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.670
or no unique solutions.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.510
And that was actually the
first example we saw.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.540
And these are really the three
cases that you're going to see

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.880
every time, and it's good to
get familiar with them so

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.570
you're never going to get
stumped up when you have

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.930
something like 0 equals minus
4, or 0 equals 3.

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:35.440
Or if you have just a bunch of
zeros and a bunch of rows.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.870
I want to make that
very clear.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:40.550
Sometimes, you see a bunch of
zeroes here, on the left-hand

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.360
side of the augmented divide,
and you might say, oh maybe I

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.770
have no unique solutions,
I have an

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:46.730
infinite number of solutions.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:50.380
But you have to look at
this entry right here.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.880
Only if this whole thing is
zero and you have free

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.210
variables, then you have an
infinite number of solutions.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.050
If you have a statement like,
0 is equal to a, if this is

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.380
equal to 7 right here, then all
of the sudden you would

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.000
have no solution to this.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.390
That you're dealing with
parallel surfaces.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.850
Anyway, hopefully you
found that helpful.
