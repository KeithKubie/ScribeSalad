The first thing I want to do is show you something very fascinating about sin θ

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
when θ is very small.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
If θ is 0.01 what is the sine of that angle?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Remember, we're measuring in radians, not degrees.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If I type this into Google, the sine of 0.01, I get 0.0099983333,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but if I round that up to any reasonable number it's 0.01.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Can you do the same thing for 0.02 and 0.04?

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Just enter your answers in this box.
