00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.763
The answer is, the curve I'm calling D, which is this purple one up here.

00:00:04.763 --> 00:00:09.568
Replacing x with x minus 2, meant a shift 2 to the right, from the original

00:00:09.568 --> 00:00:14.470
equation, y equals x squared, who's graph is this grey one right here. And

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.368
replacing y with y minus 3, meant shifting that curve up 3, so if we move this

00:00:19.368 --> 00:00:24.112
curve over 2 and then up 3, we end up with this purple one, right here. Note

00:00:24.112 --> 00:00:28.784
that just as we saw in the example with Grant, we replace x with something else

00:00:28.784 --> 00:00:33.164
like x minus 2 in this case, that entire quantity has the same operations

00:00:33.164 --> 00:00:37.796
applied to it, as x had. So this entire thing is squared, not just the x part.
