00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.050
My name is Tom Cummins.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.130
That means I'm not Homi Bhabha.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.149
But it's still a pleasure
to be here in front of you

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.630
to begin this--

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.660
I think this is the first
of the master classes.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.150
Homi returned from London
a bit under the weather,

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.960
and so, I have really
received the great honor

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.910
to do the introduction today.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.230
And as many of you
know, but I should

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.990
say that the master
classes are that Hendra

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.790
said is an attempt to showcase
scholars engaged in one

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.930
of the humanities, whether
it's essential practices,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.310
interpreting with scrupulous
care and patients, either

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.760
a single text, or an
image, or a practice.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.550
And over the years, we've
hear poems by Yates,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:15.560
paintings by Caravaggio, and
a shot from Bonnie and Clyde.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.640
This year, there will
be three master classes

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.130
that will focus
on one of the most

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.935
traumatic years of the
last century that is 1968.

00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:31.670
It's hard to believe
that was 50 years ago.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.360
And I will tell you
how old I am by saying

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.590
that that was the year that
I graduated from high school.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.310
And those of you
who were not of age

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.990
then will remember-- will
not remember, should I say,

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.510
that that was such
a traumatic year.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:02:01.770
The year of rage in Chicago,
this death of Bobby Kennedy,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.940
Martin Luther King.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.570
Most of you know this,
but to have lived

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.370
it was a traumatic year
as I think I've ever

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.170
lived until this century.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.560
I never thought it
would be that bad.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.160
And so, in addition to tonight's
speaker, Diana Sorensen,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.400
who will be speaking on Che
Guevara's Pasajes, which

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.430
was published in English in
1968, on Thursday, November 27,

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.580
Peter Gordon will discuss
Adorno's resignation.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.430
And then, on
Thursday, April 11th,

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.730
Homi Bhabha will take on Frantz
Fanon's Wretched of the Earth.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.670
Another really
fundamental text that,

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.180
again, is something that has
meant a lot to me and to many

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.440
of us working in the humanities,
and working across cultures,

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.180
and working with the
colonial shackles

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.840
that still seem to have us
entwined in the 21st century.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.200
Tonight's speaker,
Diana Sorensen,

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.920
is [SPANISH], retired.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.670
Not from academics, but
from administration.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.280
I had the wonderful privilege--

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.990
well, it wasn't a
privilege being chair--

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.940
but I had the
wonderful privilege

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.940
of working as a chair with
a most spectacular dean.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.890
She is, of course,
more than a dean.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.920
She's is the James Rothenberg
professor of romance languages

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.570
and literatures and of
comparative literature.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.280
And so, as she was a dean,
she maintained a high profile

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.290
as a scholar.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.810
Before joining the faculty
in 2001 here at Harvard,

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.240
she came from Columbia.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.510
Before that, she taught
at Wesleyan University.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.070
She is a specialist in
19th and 20th century

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.950
literatures of Latin America.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.680
Her books include The
Reader and the Text,

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.050
Interpretive Strategies for
Latin American Literatures,

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.220
Facundo and the Construction
of Argentinean Culture, which

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.850
won the MLA prize
for the best book

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.880
in the field of Latin
American scholarship.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.150
She also wrote on
Sarmiento, someone

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.450
who crosses between
Argentina and Boston,

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.540
an annotated edition
of his works.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.240
And then, A Turbulent Decade,
Remembered Cultural Scenes

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.820
from Latin America in the '60s.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.180
Her current work deals
with mobility and shifting

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.090
units of regional coherence--

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.930
or, incoherence-- and it
focuses on the transformations

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.510
of the global in
the 21st century.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.500
Her book, Territories,
Trajectories, Cultures, and

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.272
Circulation, is
a wonderful book.

00:04:57.272 --> 00:04:58.480
One that I'm in the process--

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.340
actually, right
now-- of reading.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.790
It's published by
Duke University Press.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.420
And as I said, she served--

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.040
and really did more
than serve-- she

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.030
led as dean of arts and
sciences for 10 years

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.650
before stepping down in 2016.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.140
And tonight's talk will be
about Che Guevara, his writing,

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.600
and the year 1968.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.808
Please help me welcome
this wonderful [SPANISH]..

00:05:29.808 --> 00:05:32.676
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.330
Thank you, Tom.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.520
And thank you all for coming.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.220
This is an incredibly
busy time of the year,

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.330
so I'm happy to see you here.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.950
I also want to thank Homi's
wonderful group at the Humanity

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:03.160
Center, including Steve Beale,
Mary Halpenny-Killip, Andrea

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.860
Volpe, and Sarah Razor
for helping get us going.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:16.640
So the 50 years that
separate us from '68

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.620
invite us to remember,
commemorate, assess,

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.720
and reinterpret.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.870
Hannah Arendt
anticipated this urge

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.790
to remember by
claiming that, I quote,

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:38.840
"The next century will once
learn about 1968 the way we

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.860
learned about 1848."

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.570
And here we are.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.130
'68 does indeed
occupy a central place

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.030
in the revolutionary
archive filled

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.000
with the inevitable
contradictions of a youth

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.160
culture that sought to reach
out to the working class

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.150
while it tried to
integrate culture,

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.960
[? Eros, ?] and politics.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.400
Today when we are bereft
of collective projects

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.680
and Utopian spirit,
'68 appears like

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:25.130
the nostalgic, dusty residue
of a once dazzling set

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.940
of fireworks.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:33.020
As Tom indicated, my class
will deal with an iconic figure

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.540
of '68, Che Guevara.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.160
The best rendition is
in the wonderful poster

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.500
that Steve and his
people just did.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.660
And there we go.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:08:02.310
So I will look at the book that
appeared in '63, Pasajes de la

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:06.770
Guerra Revolucionaria,
and, as was indicated,

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:12.440
translated into English
in 1968 as reminiscences

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.585
of the Cuban Revolutionary War.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.720
Let me begin with
a historical stage

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:28.266
upon which Che's fame arose,
the Cuban revolution of 1956

00:08:28.266 --> 00:08:30.900
to '59.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:35.730
During its early years,
before the repressive turn

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:39.090
of the early '70s,
the revolution

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:43.590
ushered in new configurations
of radical practice

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:46.890
and ideologies of
transformation which

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:51.970
occupied much of the social
imaginary of the '60s,

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:55.170
especially in Latin America.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.110
Their boundless belief
in possibilities,

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:03.480
in the creative verve to fashion
humanity and its culture,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.680
cannot be separated from
the experience of newness

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.880
and invention, which
characterizes the writing

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.530
of the '60s in the boom.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.960
The group of revolutionaries
who set sail on the Granma

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.820
in November, 1956,
fashioned themselves

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.660
as an exemplary
community held together

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:35.940
by strong horizontal
bonds, led and united

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.020
by a powerful
leader, Fidel Castro.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.230
With few exceptions,
this community

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.680
was structured as a
phallocratic brotherhood

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:54.480
based on a spirit of egalitarian
and fraternal solidarity.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.330
In the shaping of
the new community,

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:01.140
Che played an emblematic role.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.320
One could make the
perhaps startling case

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.280
with Alma Guillermoprieto
that Che was,

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:14.880
as she put it, the century's
first Latin American.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.020
With that peculiar
mixture of foreignness,

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:24.570
transnational identity,
and marked Argentinean

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.290
idiosyncrasies-- hence the Che--

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:34.380
that made him both uniquely
local and continental.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.650
The myth, which
grew upon his death,

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.190
turned him into a
model for experience

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.580
based upon the
compelling mixture

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:50.670
of striking individualism and
unconventional personal style,

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:55.920
on the one hand, with the
will to collective integration

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.450
on the other.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:01.860
What Che Guevara
exemplified was metonymica

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.400
of the manner in which the
Cuban revolution wished

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:11.190
to represent itself, thereby
offering a possible resolution

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.430
to the '60s growing
disenchantment

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:20.220
with what Marcuse would
call, uni-dimensional man.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.270
This also accounts for the
immediate international

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:29.460
appropriation of Che as
myth after his death and his

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:35.940
symbolic value in the Paris
of May '68 articulated

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:41.250
in the following observation
made by Jean-Michel Palmier

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:48.270
in the May 1968 issue of
the magazine Littéraire.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:52.110
Palmier says, "Dead,
everyone wanted

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:56.970
to appropriate his reflection,
to approach his shadow,

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:00.570
to forever imprint
in their memory

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:06.660
the features of this corpse
with his wide-open eyes

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.325
riddled with bullets."

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:14.840
This spectral quality
of the disembodied Che

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:20.750
seemed to expand his presence
and secrete a magical force

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:26.090
which combined holiness
with violence, austerity

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:32.900
with celebration, effort with
joy, fragility with power,

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:37.790
unsullied heroism with defeat.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:44.600
Not until '97 were his remains
found so that the resulting

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:50.360
spectrality had the haunting
effect of the disappeared

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:56.570
occupying a space infused
with longing for a body which

00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:02.360
had been withheld
but might be found.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:06.110
As has been the case with
other heroic figures,

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:12.770
the absent body encouraged the
myth of the eternal return.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:17.420
Here, you see the cover of
an Argentine weekly, Primera

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:22.490
Plana, that fashioned
itself after Time.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:28.610
And in 1967, in October,
this is its cover.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:33.140
Guevara, dead or a phantom?

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:37.370
Let me briefly comment
on the exceptional effect

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:40.460
of two photographs
which contributed

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:45.620
to this spectral quality
and myth-making energy.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:49.910
The haunting
Christ-like figures--

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:54.440
quality, sorry, of the
Freddy Alborta photograph

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:59.720
taken right after his death
in Bade Grande, Bolivia,

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:04.130
has paradoxically
engendered a disjunction

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:10.700
between his captor's desire to
proclaim and verify his death.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:14.840
And I want to show you
what he looked like when

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.780
he was first captured.

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:24.770
So they wanted to leave
no doubt as to the fact

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:31.610
that this was, indeed, Che
Guevara having been captured.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:37.210
So, on the one hand, proclaiming
and verifying his death,

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:41.410
and at the same time,
an unwitting creation

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:48.730
of an everlasting icon both
heroic and martyr-like.

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.730
Jean-Michel Palmier's
observation that I read

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:55.465
a moment ago deals
precisely with the effect

00:14:55.465 --> 00:14:57.610
of this [? will ?]
to memory which

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:04.390
had so deep an impact
on the imaginaire 1968.

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:08.530
Equally powerful, but with
different inflections,

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:16.390
was a 1960 photograph by Alberto
Días Gutiérrez, known as Korda,

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:22.780
and is taken at a ceremony
to mourn 81 people killed

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.110
at an explosion
in Havana Harbor.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:31.420
A tragedy that Fidel Castro
attributed, of course,

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.890
to the CIA.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:38.470
Che's face here may have
expressed a mixture of anger

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:41.260
and sadness at the event.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:46.840
It was captured by Korda's lens
even though, on that occasion,

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.780
there were distinguished
foreign visitors.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:56.940
Among them, Jean-Paul Sartre
and Simone de Beauvoir whom he,

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:01.180
Korda, was intent
on photographing.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:05.710
At the time, the photograph was
not chosen by the government

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:11.110
magazine Revolucíon, which
covered this particular rally.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:17.620
But seven years later
in May or June 1967,

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:21.730
Korda gave a print to
the Italian publisher

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:26.140
Filtrinieri who turned
it into a poster

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:31.060
after the news of Che's
death was divulged.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:35.140
Of course, the photograph was
to have an illustrious life

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.770
in its extraordinary
circulation as can

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:44.470
be seen in a documentary
film about it made in '82.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:49.630
In Cuba, Korda's photograph was
enlarged to cover the entire

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:54.760
facade of the interior ministry,
which faces the Plaza de la

00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:00.640
Revolucíon where a mass rally
was held when Che's death was

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:06.460
publicly announced
on October 18, 1967.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:12.069
Later, it was appropriated
by the young marchers of 1968

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:18.160
in Milan, Paris, London,
Mexico City, and other places.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:24.700
The process of posterization
was suited to street rallies.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.480
The form contributed to
their spirit of freedom,

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.690
and it had the
boldness of design

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:35.680
to express the widespread
sense of discontent

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.490
of the spirit of '68.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.310
The gravitational
pull of the Che myth

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:47.500
produced a space for the
representation of fullness.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.530
It allowed the
reordering of elements,

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:57.610
which existed in dislocated
form in the social imaginary,

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:01.960
producing what Allen Badeau
would call a suturing

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:09.400
effect that helped overcome
paradoxes and disjunctions.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.460
The force of integration
derived not only

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:16.060
from the magic of
his face, but also

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:20.620
from what was known about
his character, his behavior,

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:25.530
and the considerable body
of writing he left behind.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:29.980
Che's face had the
spontaneity and versatility

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:34.930
of expression associated
less with political figures

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:36.640
than with actors.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:41.950
Asthma intensified the
awareness of his body,

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:47.980
marking it with fragility and
willpower at the same time.

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.170
His devastating asthma
attacks, in fact,

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:55.780
pay an ever-present role in
the representation of a Che

00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:00.400
who had to overcome the
crippling effects by dint

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.380
of will.

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:05.800
Self-sacrifice and
determination were

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:10.460
key to the production of
self, exemplified by Che,

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.570
as central elements
in the new man

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:17.290
to be created after
the revolution.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:23.950
Che epitomize this new man as
the model the decade aspired to

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:28.090
in its revolutionary
inflection, as the subject whose

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:33.090
self-definition rested on
the politics of wrecking

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:38.910
and building, hard at work
on changing the world.

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:44.460
In the construction of the Che
myth, his style, his behavior,

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.960
and his writings were
all deployed to what

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:53.550
an important aim of the early
years of the Cuban revolution.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:20:00.720
Finding ways for the transition
from individual passions,

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:05.760
such as love, to the collective
and social dimensions

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.060
of the state.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:12.680
A new vision of community
and the bonds that link it,

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:18.140
negotiated by Che's model, one
that supersedes the earlier

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:22.880
paradigm which rested
on the Bourgeois family,

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:27.110
was strengthened by this myth.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:31.040
Better suited to the mood
of liberation of the '60s

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.240
was his fervent
espousal of a citizenry

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:42.260
united by horizontal ties
of equality and solidarity.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.410
This imagined
community is organized

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.170
around a different
kind of desire,

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:53.120
no longer galvanized by the
reproductive aims of the family

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.550
and its private values.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:58.850
It espouses the
grammar of fraternity,

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:02.060
apparently disavowing
patriarchy,

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:07.400
whilst fostering the
conditions for Utopian growth.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:12.350
And yet, as we shall
see, in its center

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:15.110
is located the
revolutionary leader

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:21.200
Fidel Castro, who performs
exacerbated masculine values

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.160
in his relationship
with a body politic.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:30.050
So how does Che, the
construct, derive

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:34.790
from the myth and
the writer, fashion

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:38.450
the project for the new man?

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:41.840
Speeches given at
commemorative festivities,

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:46.430
at factories, high schools
and universities, peasant

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:49.520
gatherings, and
inaugural ceremonies

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.610
construct a force
field which attain

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:57.620
an alchemical fusion of
personal and collective,

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.710
secular and religious.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:05.540
Che maps the terms for the
definition of the new man

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:09.050
in language appropriated
from religion.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:12.830
His eyes set on the
ideal revolutionary

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:16.940
as he works out a
new social pact.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.430
Here, we come to
the aporia which

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:23.540
the efforts of critical theory,
as developed by the Frankfurt

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:28.090
School, never quite
resolved, but whose way

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:33.860
out was glimpsed by Benjamin
in his less secular moments.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:39.140
The possibility of
happiness as indissolubly

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:42.800
bound up with
images of redemption

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:48.410
claiming freedom and
reconciliation as Utopian,

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:53.390
yet possible, if our earthly
existence is transformed

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:55.840
into a superior form.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:01.970
Che seemed to suggest that these
aspirations might be realized,

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:05.360
and his death arrested
the dream whilst

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.570
creating the conditions
of possibility

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:11.210
for its perpetuation.

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:14.390
Herbert Marcuse's
one-dimensional man

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:17.850
was to point in
the same direction.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:24.440
He says, "Society will be
rational and free to the extent

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.290
to which it is
organized, sustained,

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:34.790
and reproduced by an essentially
new historical subject."

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:40.130
That goal would seem to lie
beyond the limits of the state,

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:44.420
to prefigure a new form
of celebratory, masculine

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:51.860
sociability in which voluntary
work took on a festive air.

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.980
To show how these powerful
forces find their way

00:23:54.980 --> 00:24:03.440
into writing, I have chosen
this text written originally

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:09.350
in serialized form and published
in [INAUDIBLE] and later

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:15.500
as Pasajes de la Guerra
Revolucíonaria in 1963

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:20.840
translated in '68 as
reminiscences of the Cuban

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.030
Revolutionary War.

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:26.930
I will refer to it
briefly as Pasajes.

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:31.730
In reconstructing the Pasajes
of the revolutionary campaign

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:35.870
which culminated in the
overthrow of Batista,

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:40.290
Che is working out an
interesting narrative project.

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:45.920
How to construct the future
in the telling of the past.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.530
The temporal
complexities, in part,

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:52.040
the work of memory,
but it is furthered

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.840
by the scene of reading, which
is invoked by the Pasajes.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.440
The reader in question
is experiencing

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.570
the new revolutionary society.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:08.270
He is being embodied and
modeled by the text in his hand

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:13.550
as he traces the origin of the
nation to be reconstructed.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:17.480
And here, let me
announce that I'm not

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.570
going to say he or
she because this

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:25.610
is a deeply masculine
and patriarchal vision.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:31.430
And it's really a
masculine society

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.220
that Che is referring
to, even in his most

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:37.760
revolutionary spirit.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.870
So Che's ostensible purpose,
as set down in the preface,

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:45.470
is to help preserve the
memory of the revolution,

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:49.190
protecting it from the
ravages of oblivion,

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:53.090
and addressing a question posed
by the revolutionary leaders

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:59.510
themselves, namely, how to write
a history of the revolution.

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:04.490
The effort of retrieval is
central to Che's writing, which

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:08.720
we could describe as
an ethos of remembering

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.420
marked by the
conceptual attempt to be

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:15.960
self-critical and accurate.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.470
This is a part of the preface.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:23.090
"The years pass, and the
memory of the insurrection

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:26.750
is dissolving in the past.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:30.860
We have not yet definitively
set down these events,

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:34.940
which already belong to
the history of America.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.000
For this reason, I'm
starting a series

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.020
of personal reminiscences
of attacks, battles,

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:46.460
and skirmishes in which
we all participated.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:51.920
It is not my intention that
this fragmentary history, based

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.340
on remembrances and
a few hasty notes,

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.070
should be taken
as a full account.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:03.110
On the contrary, I hope that
each theme will be developed

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:06.380
by those who lived it."

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:10.610
This is presented as the
beginning of a collective work

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:15.740
to be executed by a
community of memory workers.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:20.390
In the very writing, the project
had a collective dimension.

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:24.560
Che would begin by
recording the first draft.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:29.810
Then, when the typed version
was produced by his secretary,

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:34.970
he would not only rework it
using his diaries to achieve

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:39.680
greater accuracy, but he
would also review the text

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:44.600
in meetings held at the Ministry
of Industry with his old

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:49.370
comrades in arms who shared
their own reminiscences

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:53.130
to correct and discuss Che's.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:57.470
Che claims to be taking
only the first steps

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:03.870
issuing an invitation essential
to the success of this project.

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:08.630
There are many survivors of
this battle, and each of them

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:12.030
is encouraged to contribute
to his recollections

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:16.490
so that the story may
thus be filled out.

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:20.780
The ethos of remembering
is not fulfilled

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:24.500
until the task of
recalling and writing

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:29.270
are submitted to
scrupulous self-criticism.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:35.840
The author is to remove any word
which may not be entirely true

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.790
or of which he may
not be entirely sure.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:44.840
Precisely because
Che's ideal reader

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.560
is learning as he
followed his tale,

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:55.790
Pasajes is structured along the
[? topoi ?] of errors, becoming

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:58.580
and beginnings.

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:03.620
Since the victorious outcome
is the very presupposition

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:08.930
of the book, he excused
the predictably epic tone

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:12.710
and triumphalist
rhetoric, replacing them

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:17.180
with the rhythms of
learning and transformation

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:22.040
better suited to narrative
form to the persona cultivated

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:27.710
by Che, and to the mood
of his youthful admirers

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:30.770
who were drawn to
his informality

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:33.440
and lack of pretense.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:38.460
The opening pasaje
entitled Alegría de Pío--

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:43.360
it's just a place in the
Sierra Maestra area--

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.860
is a case in point.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.590
It is built as an
exemplary story

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:52.220
in which the
inventory of missteps

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:56.780
is meticulously described,
the better to avoid them

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.520
in the future.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.010
Like school children
who have yet

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:04.550
to draw the unforgiving
distinction between game

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:09.500
playing and war games,
the 82 youthful rebels

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:14.630
who disembarked
on December, 1956,

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:18.710
were soon to learn
the dire consequences

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:22.340
of inexperienced campaigning.

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:27.290
Wearing ill-fitting boots,
having lost their way at sea

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:31.550
and on land, leaving traces
which allowed the enemy

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:35.870
to detect their whereabouts,
lacking the judgment needed

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:41.450
to tell friend from foe, they
fell prey to an air raid that

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:43.790
left many wounded--

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:46.370
Che himself among them--

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:51.620
and inflicted
their first defeat.

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:56.360
This pedagogy of mistakes
is but the reverse

00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:00.380
of the process of learning
and transformation,

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:04.250
which leads to becoming
a revolutionary army

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:09.470
in this particular version
of the Bildungsroman.

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:14.510
Che's narrative is punctuated
by moments of evaluation,

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:17.700
which keep marking beginnings.

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:22.670
This master plot is
reenacted at every occasion

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:27.900
when the rebels seem to be on
the verge of becoming an army.

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.650
He ends his memoir
with an account

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:34.770
of effective, though
minor, accomplishments.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:38.120
He calls them,
small feats, which

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:43.620
began to drive Batista's troops
away from the Sierra Maestra.

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:48.470
As if what constituted
a desirable Koda were

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:52.700
the vision of a promising
beginning in which the rebels

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:57.470
have become a fully-fledged
army and the process of learning

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:02.120
that particular lesson
has come to fruition.

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:05.180
Thus, the significance
of Pasajes

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:09.770
lies in the narration of
learning from mistakes,

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:15.590
which is at the center of Che's
construction of the new man.

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:18.470
If this lesson is
learned, the task

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:24.170
of vigilant self-fashioning
can begin again and again,

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:29.230
much in the same way as each
arrival of reinforcements

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:32.990
enacts the pattern of
transforming the newcomers

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:37.740
into true revolutionaries.

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:42.080
A reading attune
to literary echoes,

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:47.090
one that I cannot resist,
detects text in Che's writing

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:51.800
two quite different forms
which work together to address

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.470
questions of ethics.

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:58.250
One of them, the
Picaresque, is inscribed

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:00.710
in the rebellious register.

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:06.350
It flouts normativity and opts
for an irreverent contestation

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:08.480
of the doxa.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:13.610
Conversely, the earlier
one, the medieval exemplum,

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:18.240
invokes normativity
in a didactic manner,

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:23.130
making the story
subservient to the lesson.

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:26.990
This particular mix is
perhaps the rightfully version

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:31.820
of Che's style,
carefree and moralizing

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:34.920
at one and the same time.

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:41.420
It makes the text hover on an
interestingly unstable edge

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:46.490
which mitigates the heavy
imprint of teaching.

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:50.600
In the emplotment provided
by the economy of mistakes

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:54.170
and learning, there
are picaresque echoes

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:59.010
infused with humor and a
penchant for the ridiculous.

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:02.600
Like the main character
of picaresque novels,

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:06.560
the young rebels
sometimes resort to tricks

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.560
when their own
military callowness

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:14.900
makes their wits more reliable
than their soldiering.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.710
This lightens the
narrative tone,

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:20.870
and in the pleasure
provided by humor,

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:24.500
the reader can catch a
glimpse of the youthful spirit

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:29.659
of camaraderie which blurred
the boundary between living

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:36.770
and dying, danger and fun,
between soldiering and playing.

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:40.070
Early on, for example,
a brilliant ruse

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:46.670
played by Fidel Castro on Chicho
Osorio, an infamous foreman who

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:51.320
terrorized the peasants on
behalf of the local landowners,

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:55.100
yields valuable information
about the whereabouts

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:59.210
of the army headquarters
and the possible allegiances

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:01.640
of the rural population.

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:05.240
Che tells the story
with obvious delight,

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:09.260
not only at Fidel's
daring and inventiveness,

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:12.890
but also at the
process of astutely

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:18.020
giving the unwitting
Osorio his just desserts.

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:20.770
Tricking and
tripping up the enemy

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:25.400
are presented tongue-in-cheek,
and the narrated encounter

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:30.500
is not always lethal as is the
case with a captured soldier

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:35.950
who never suspects that he's
being fed the very horse he

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:39.680
is intending to look after.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.160
Picaresque echoes
are also present

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:49.430
in the economy of scarcity that
the rebels are subjected to.

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:52.790
Lack of food and
proper weapons is

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:56.210
the focus of narrative concern.

00:35:56.210 --> 00:36:00.840
Che sometimes depicts himself
as a latter-day Lazarillo de

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:07.010
Tormes lovingly evoking the
ingestion of four sausages

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:10.580
as one of the greatest
banquets of his life,

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:14.990
or acknowledging that the most
lamented aspect of a defector's

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:20.420
departure was his absconding
with a can of condensed milk

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.970
and three sausages.

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:29.990
For Che's Cuban readers in
1963, this regime of shortages,

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:33.770
of making do and
doing without, may

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:37.060
have helped
negotiate experiences

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:40.700
they were confirming
in their daily lives.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:46.250
More powerful than the
Picaresque is, in the Pasajes,

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:50.060
the vestige of an earlier
narrative form which

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:53.750
has been essential to the
transmission of learning,

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:55.730
the exemplum.

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:58.580
Interspersed in
the reminiscences

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:01.850
are numerous tales
whose exemplarity

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:09.170
lies in their presentation of a
gallery of heroes and traitors

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:13.460
through their actions,
complete with Kodas which

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:18.860
explicate and develop the
didactic value of the passage

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.510
in question.

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:25.880
The result is a veritable study
of human potential ranging from

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:30.890
the model provided by
heroes, such as Frank País,

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:35.600
to traitors such as Eutimio
Guerra, Philippe Pasos,

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.730
and Raul Chivas.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:44.020
But Che's task is not simply
hagiographic or demonizing.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:50.060
He's also sketching the embrace
of a future community for which

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:55.250
it is important to offer a
spectrum of acceptable forms

00:37:55.250 --> 00:38:00.800
of behavior and degrees
of political commitment.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:06.110
In Pasajes, one can detect
a productive tension

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:10.940
between the self, constructed
by the narrative voice,

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:17.390
and the one observed and admired
in the heroic figure of Fidel.

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:21.950
The I who tells the
stories is self-effacing

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:25.730
and modest to a fault,
reluctantly assuming

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:29.510
the protagonist's
role, and careful not

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:32.900
to indulge in emotional
self-expression

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:38.450
unless he's recording the
frailty of his asthmatic body.

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:40.850
And while Che goes
out of his way

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:43.850
to name the women who have
made heroic commitments

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:47.480
to the revolution, this
foundational community

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.810
is essentially phallocratic.

00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:55.760
So the horizontal bonds of
this collective singular,

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:59.720
as Reinhart Koselleck calls
this kind of community,

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:03.860
configure the state
only if the dynamics

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:08.750
of egalitarian solidarity
is organized around a higher

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:10.340
authority.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.650
This, of course,
is Fidel Castro,

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:17.900
the leader whose representation
occupies the space carved out

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:19.430
by Che.

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:24.530
Wherever he has noted a lack
derived from physical frailty,

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:29.360
or military ineptitude,
poor strategic thinking,

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:33.320
or faulty judgment,
Che has filled it

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:38.510
with a totalizing presence,
the leader, Fidel.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:42.770
Furthering the heroic
representation of Fidel

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:49.190
is a framing based on distance
which connotes infallibility.

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:54.530
If Che can be construed as a
possible model for an emerging

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:59.440
kind of masculinity
inviting identification

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.150
through the
acknowledgment of weakness

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:06.570
and the compensatory
effort that accompanies it,

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:11.230
Fidel can be seen,
instead, as the emblem

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:15.370
of a certain
hyper-masculinity performed

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:19.220
as infallible leadership.

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:26.920
So as I draw to my
conclusion, I want

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:32.530
to close with a
small anecdote that

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:37.120
encapsulates the dynamics
that I've just described

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.715
between Che and Fidel.

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:46.340
Che's deliberate undermining
of his own authority

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:50.270
for the sake of underscoring
Fidel's is amusingly

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:55.850
encapsulated in an anecdote
conveyed with obvious delight

00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:59.930
by the novelist Guillermo
Cabrera Infante.

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:04.040
And I quote, "The
late Comandante Duque

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:08.090
used to tell a story of a
shooting match in Sierra

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:10.830
Maestra that he witnessed.

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:17.120
Castro and Guevarra were
engaged in a war against boredom

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:22.290
doing practice against
some empty beer bottles.

00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:29.670
Castro was hitting all the
bottles, but Guevarra hit none.

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:35.870
Later, Duque asked Guevarra, who
was a sharp shooter famous all

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:42.260
over the Sierra, why Che, you
could do better than that.

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:46.670
Guevarra answered with a
sneer and a true confession.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:50.810
You want me to make
our leader lose face?

00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:54.170
You should know
better than that."

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:58.640
How telling that this master
of self-effacement and

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:04.430
revolutionary commitment would
be appropriated by the branding

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:08.100
and marketing machine
that had turned him

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:14.400
into an advertising tool for
Smirnoff Vodka, for Mercedes

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:18.330
Benz, for Converse Sneakers.

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:23.630
Che's ideals may belong
to the past in our era

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:28.760
bereft of collective projects,
but the work of nostalgia

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.790
and marketing marches on.

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:32.420
Thank you.

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:35.366
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:52.090 --> 00:43:00.850
That was a wonderful exposition
of both the commercialization

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:07.210
of Che and Che's own text
and the contradictions that

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:11.680
lie within that which are
sometimes very hard to resolve.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:16.010
And just before opening
it up to questions,

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:19.030
I just had a few
comments because I

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:21.490
sat down and reread the text.

00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:26.560
I must have read
it in 1969 or '70.

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.440
And one of the things
that really struck me,

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.860
which you mentioned
here, are two things

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:37.060
that Che does talk about
in which, all of a sudden,

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:44.530
he moves out of the deprecating
individual to one that

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:49.390
is, as you read it, a
somewhat heroic individual.

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:55.660
And that is when he is shot
and thinks he's going to die.

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:59.230
And it's the only time,
I think, in the book--

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:00.430
I may be wrong--

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:02.570
that he actually
appeals to literature.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:03.430
Jack London.

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:06.610
And he appeals to Jack
London and his short story

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:08.350
to build a fire.

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:10.270
And of those of you who
have ever read that,

00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:13.660
it's the coldest
story ever written

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:19.510
because this individual is in,
of all places, the antithetical

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:24.370
place where he's talking
about mosquitoes,

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:26.150
the heat, the bother.

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:29.830
And to build a fire, of
course, takes place in Alaska.

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:33.520
And it's about an individual
who is freezing to death

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:36.440
and tries to build a fire.

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:39.380
And in the end, he
gets the fire going.

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:41.650
And the fire is under a tree.

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:46.120
And the branch, as I remember,
drops the snow on the fire,

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.170
and it puts it out.

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:50.560
And then he has to sit
back and heroically

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:55.240
accept his own death, stoically.

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.010
And Che says this.

00:44:57.010 --> 00:44:59.986
I was like this figure.

00:44:59.986 --> 00:45:02.110
He doesn't mention the
story, but I know the story.

00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:02.410
I mean--

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:03.380
He mentions the author.

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:04.630
He mentions the author.

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:08.710
And it's that moment of
self-realization of both death

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:15.940
and accepting death in this,
you know, really stoic way

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:20.860
that couches him in a
very different light.

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:24.190
And the other instance is one
that, as you're reading it,

00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:31.300
you realize that he is
writing this down to someone

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:34.640
who he talks about
teaching to read and write.

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:35.140
The peasant.

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:35.639
Yes.

00:45:35.639 --> 00:45:36.970
[SPANISH]

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:37.480
Yes.

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:40.150
And all of a sudden,
there's an engagement

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:45.990
with a reader for whom he
has performed the heroic task

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:47.800
of learning to read and write.

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:51.880
So every once in a while for
me, Che comes through not--

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.970
and he comes through
one other time this way.

00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:58.280
And it's when they're
in full retreat,

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:01.120
and he has to make a decision.

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:06.280
Because he's a doctor
or he's a guerriero.

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:11.600
And he says, I can't carry
both medicine and ammunition,

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:13.730
and I have to decide.

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:15.220
And what does he decide?

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:20.920
He picks up the ammunition, and
he leaves his medicine behind.

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:24.140
So that there are these
moments to me in the text where

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:29.860
Che professes himself in
different ways that are not

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:35.680
about Fidel, but really are
about him and his becoming

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:39.850
either by dying or choosing
to be I am a guerriero.

00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:41.600
Those kinds of things.

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:45.160
So that there is a
multiplicity, I think, sometimes

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:49.750
when you read this between
Che as the individual

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:51.460
there, who also gets
blisters and has

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:54.100
to carry his shoes as you said.

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:56.920
But also, these
moments that mark him

00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:02.032
as teacher, as reader,
and as a revolutionary as

00:47:02.032 --> 00:47:03.115
opposed to being a doctor.

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:10.090
That's a wonderful
observation, Tom.

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:19.960
And I would add
one more instance,

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:26.704
which is when Fidel decides
to make him Commandante.

00:47:26.704 --> 00:47:31.480
And he's named Commandante
in a very casual way,

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:37.240
but for Che Guevarra, this is
another moment of becoming.

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:43.700
So there not many, but they
are significant moments.

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:45.220
And they punctuate the text.

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:48.430
I mean, they don't
come one after another.

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:50.790
As you're reading along
as you described it.

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:53.880
But every once in a
while, it opens that up.

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.050
Yes.

00:47:56.050 --> 00:48:00.160
And it is, as you say,
a very hyper-male text.

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:04.300
So the three women who
he names are named,

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:06.460
not as individuals,
but as companeras.

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:07.960
Yes.

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:13.630
And nobody else is called
companero that way to anybody.

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:20.050
I would rather, you
know, open it up now

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:21.670
for those who might
have questions

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:30.640
or comments about the text
or comments on the talk.

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:31.140
Peter.

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:37.310
Thank you, [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:37.920
Hello?

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:38.400
Can you hear me?

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:38.550
Yes.

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:39.050
It's on.

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:40.567
OK.

00:48:40.567 --> 00:48:41.400
Thank you very much.

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:42.720
It was fascinating.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:47.310
The particularly interesting
to me is a literary question.

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:50.610
Namely, the question of the
picaro, or the picaresque,

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:53.490
and the degree of
its reconcilability

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:56.220
with moments of learning.

00:48:56.220 --> 00:49:01.200
And it seemed to
me that you were

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:04.850
arguing that there's
a simultaneity

00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:07.620
of the picaresque and--

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:11.200
well, I wouldn't say the
Bildungsroman, but of learning.

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:13.350
Whereas, it seems to me
that the learning that

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:18.090
happens in the course
of a picaresque

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:22.560
is always only pretense
or only temporary,

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:27.050
and by the fifth or sixth
misadventure at the latest,

00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:30.690
you no longer think
of any of the learning

00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:35.920
from mistakes that's going on
as being in any way authentic.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:42.220
And so, I'm wondering if you
could trouble that a bit more.

00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:42.930
Thank you.

00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:44.730
Thank you for the
question, Peter.

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:48.270
I would say that
these are strands

00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:51.660
that appear in the
text, and the picaresque

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:57.030
lightens the tone in
the tradition started

00:49:57.030 --> 00:50:01.300
in the 16th century by
Lazarillo de Tormes.

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.990
The Lazarillo does
learn quite a lot,

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:06.150
but it's all very disenchanting.

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:09.720
You know, it's about
Spanish society

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:13.410
in the 16th century
overwhelmed by appearances

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:16.980
and lacking any kind of agency.

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:21.240
But I think that
Che is finding ways

00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:28.770
to draw on the repertoire
to lighten up and make

00:50:28.770 --> 00:50:34.845
the didactic tone
a more digestible--

00:50:34.845 --> 00:50:36.669
[INAUDIBLE] the
picaro the function

00:50:36.669 --> 00:50:38.960
of the learning by mistake
rather the other way around?

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:39.510
Yes.

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:43.390
And I would be doing
the text an injustice

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:47.440
if I considered it an example
of the picaresque because there

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:49.300
is a lot at stake here.

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:53.850
But there is a lot of
that sort of light-hearted

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:58.500
tripping up or tricking because
the characters themselves

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:01.320
are learning, and
they're trying to make

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:08.484
their way through by dint of wit
more than soldiering at first.

00:51:08.484 --> 00:51:11.470
Thank you.

00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:11.970
Yes?

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:16.770
Could you tell us who you are?

00:51:16.770 --> 00:51:17.790
This is being recorded.

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:18.660
Yes?

00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:20.372
And we need this for the mic.

00:51:20.372 --> 00:51:21.330
Could you take the mic?

00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:21.829
Yeah.

00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:22.615
Thank you.

00:51:22.615 --> 00:51:23.114
Hi.

00:51:23.114 --> 00:51:27.060
I'm Ogden Ross.

00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:40.170
Is there a way in which Che's
political Marxist theory which,

00:51:40.170 --> 00:51:43.500
in my mind, was somewhat
more radical in nature

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:52.720
than Castro, perhaps, be
contrasted in the stories

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:57.100
to Castro, particularly
in response

00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:59.710
to the overthrow of
Batista, which was

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:03.410
the whole point of this anyway.

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:07.310
And is that part
of the narrative?

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:08.210
Part of the?

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:09.290
Narrative.

00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:16.010
Not in this case because this
is the story of the exploits

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:20.460
that took place
between '56 and '59.

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:25.670
So it's about trying to
convince the rural population.

00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:30.230
And of course, you
referred to Che's doctrine.

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:34.610
He articulated the
foco theory which

00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:40.070
was based on rural uprisings,
not urban uprisings.

00:52:40.070 --> 00:52:42.590
But this text,
The Reminiscences,

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:46.505
is more about remembering
than about expounding

00:52:46.505 --> 00:52:48.800
a political program.

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.110
That will come later.

00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:55.340
And you are right that,
as the Cuban revolution is

00:52:55.340 --> 00:53:01.580
consolidated, Fidel will tend
towards the Soviet model,

00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:04.550
and Che for a while--

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:07.460
because it was a
very short while--

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:11.576
felt greater allegiances
with the Chinese model.

00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:15.590
Yes?

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.495
So you talked about--

00:53:20.495 --> 00:53:21.880
Could you just
identify yourself?

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:23.280
I'm Kayla.

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.890
I'm a student here.

00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:29.790
You talked about
disembodied images,

00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:34.410
and it seemed to me that it
was very profoundly ambivalent

00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:38.430
the ways that images get
disembodied because the image

00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:41.445
that was meant to capture
Castro's death and show

00:53:41.445 --> 00:53:41.945
everyone--

00:53:41.945 --> 00:53:42.690
Che's death.

00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:43.580
Oh, sorry.

00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:44.820
Che's death--

00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:46.030
Castro dies much later.

00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:48.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:55.590
To show the US's ultimate
victory over Che Guevara

00:53:55.590 --> 00:53:58.500
did anything but,
and got circulated

00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:01.920
as a revolutionary trope that
empowered a lot of movements.

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:05.640
But then, at the end, you
said that now, that image

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:11.670
has been appropriated by
capitalism in commercializing,

00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:13.560
ironically, everything
he stood for.

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:21.100
So how does that shift
happen, and do you

00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:27.490
think it's possible to shift
it again and read Che Guevara's

00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:30.910
consistent, haunting
presence in capitalism

00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:37.120
as kind of the potential for
that revolutionary sentiment

00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.580
to reappear?

00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:42.490
Thank you, Kayla.

00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:44.380
I'll start with
your last question.

00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:47.680
And I don't mean to be
flippant, but the answer

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.990
is up to you and
your generation.

00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:56.170
Are you ready to, you
know, espouse idealism

00:54:56.170 --> 00:54:58.150
and a sense of the
collective that's

00:54:58.150 --> 00:55:03.520
based on solidarity and not on
competition and a rearrangement

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:06.010
of certain values?

00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:12.280
The other part of your
question would take--

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:15.530
perhaps deserves a long answer.

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:17.920
But let me say
that the '70s right

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:22.990
after the death of
Che Guevarra, the '70s

00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:27.580
are a period of retrenchment.

00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:31.180
All the revolutionary
fervor of '68

00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:35.560
ends up becoming
clandestine movements

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:39.340
in mostly urban environments.

00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:42.820
And there are military
takeovers to avoid

00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:49.850
what is seen as a terrible
risk to democracy.

00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:53.920
And then, we have
the further decline

00:55:53.920 --> 00:56:00.640
of moments like the
dirty war in Argentina

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:02.470
or the various dictatorships.

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:08.260
And again, leaping
through the decades--

00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:10.150
50 have gone by--

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:13.000
I would say that
the neoliberal order

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:18.220
has done a lot to dissolve
ideologies of change

00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:24.850
for the sake of a vision of
prosperity, the free market,

00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:35.530
and has silenced some of the
ideological programs that

00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:41.170
were so confidently
proclaimed in the '60s.

00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:43.450
So I'm not giving you
the answer you deserve,

00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:47.670
but it sort of points to
the general direction.

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:48.670
We have a question here.

00:56:51.081 --> 00:56:51.580
Yes.

00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:52.510
Just wait for the mic.

00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:57.220
If you could just
identify yourself.

00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:58.040
OK.

00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:58.540
Hello.

00:56:58.540 --> 00:56:59.170
Thank you.

00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:00.670
My name is Rosa Montez.

00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:03.250
I'm a visiting
scholar from Mexico

00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:05.890
but originally from Argentina.

00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:10.780
And I really enjoyed your
talk and the going back

00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:13.750
to these writings.

00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:17.050
I would like to
just make a comment.

00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:22.810
Sort of anecdotal evidence from
a recent visit a few years ago

00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:27.820
to Cuba in early 2016.

00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:30.970
And being from Argentina, I
talked to a couple of people

00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:35.350
on the street who
remembered those times

00:57:35.350 --> 00:57:38.530
and had reminiscences of Che.

00:57:38.530 --> 00:57:41.680
And I remember very
clearly a conversation

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:44.920
while we were on a long
wait with a bus driver, who

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:49.540
seemed to have known a lot of
people around that time, very

00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:54.400
critical of the current
government and very critical

00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:58.060
of the people that had,
according to this bus

00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:01.540
driver, sort of lost their way.

00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:09.310
And his opinion-- he had some
kind of official function--

00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:13.690
but his opinion was
that Che and Fidel

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:17.830
were really crossing
paths, and were going

00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:20.710
to come to a big confrontation.

00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:23.670
And Che had to leave.

00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:30.490
And how he rejected
some of the privileges

00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:34.510
that the ruling class at
that time, the government

00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:38.560
at that time, were enjoying.

00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:42.100
And the anecdote was
how during the blockade

00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:48.640
and during the crisis, Fidel
had sent some food to his home,

00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:51.880
and [? Dona Leda ?]
very happily was

00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:55.180
cooking the chickens and
the rest of the provisions

00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:57.010
that had been sent.

00:58:57.010 --> 00:59:02.260
And when Che got back, he
had them sent back to Fidel

00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:05.890
thanking him, but
rejecting him because he

00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:12.010
couldn't accept something
that the rest of the people

00:59:12.010 --> 00:59:13.463
were not enjoying.

00:59:13.463 --> 00:59:14.270
Thank you.

00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:16.150
This may be true
or not, but it's

00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:18.950
part of how the myth
lives on right now.

00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:19.450
Yes.

00:59:19.450 --> 00:59:26.980
And a lot has been said about
the tensions between Fidel

00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:35.830
and Che in '65, and Che went off
to Congo, and then, eventually

00:59:35.830 --> 00:59:37.480
to Bolivia.

00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:41.110
And there is a sense
that it may have

00:59:41.110 --> 00:59:46.390
been because there was no longer
a role for him to play in Cuba.

00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:48.190
Thank you.

00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:49.690
Mariano.

00:59:49.690 --> 00:59:51.750
Thank you, Diana, for
this wonderful talk.

00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:54.250
Mariano, could you just identify
yourself for the recording?

00:59:54.250 --> 00:59:54.550
Oh, sorry.

00:59:54.550 --> 00:59:54.790
Yes.

00:59:54.790 --> 00:59:55.990
My name is Mariano Suskind.

00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:57.948
I'm [? department ?] from
[INAUDIBLE] languages

00:59:57.948 --> 00:59:59.900
and literatures and
comparative literature.

00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:02.080
And thank you for
the wonderful talk.

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:07.540
And I think you touched
upon a bit about what

01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:08.290
I want to ask you.

01:00:08.290 --> 01:00:14.330
So maybe if I reformulate
what I was going to ask you.

01:00:17.730 --> 01:00:23.370
It's not about Che, but
about the wonderful ending

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:26.700
of your paper about the--

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:28.040
[INAUDIBLE]

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.807
Well, I don't know.

01:00:30.807 --> 01:00:32.140
But that's what I won't ask you.

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.050
But it's about the image,
and the appropriations

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:40.102
of the image, and working
in two different ways.

01:00:40.102 --> 01:00:41.560
One thing that I
had never thought,

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:45.810
but it was a
striking resemblance

01:00:45.810 --> 01:00:49.890
and reminiscence of--

01:00:49.890 --> 01:00:56.450
When you projected the
photograph of his death,

01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:59.239
bodies surrounded by
the Bolivian military.

01:00:59.239 --> 01:01:00.030
Do you want me to--

01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:00.720
Yes, please.

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:03.210
I mean, let's-- because--

01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:08.190
and this is just
a comment, but I

01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:12.210
think it's striking
in the composition

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:17.930
of the photograph the
way it seems to mimic

01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:21.000
Rembrandt's Anatomy Lesson.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.695
And so, I wanted to ask you if
there was any thought in terms

01:01:26.695 --> 01:01:29.070
in Che's scholarship in
relation to-- because,

01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:34.560
I mean, this is a
very, as you explained

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:42.180
in detail, highly
produced scene that

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:49.660
had a very deliberate intentions
in terms of the circulation

01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:52.080
to attest to the death of Che.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.010
So that is one thing.

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:58.950
And the other one has to do with
the ending of your paper, which

01:01:58.950 --> 01:02:02.220
is the--

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:04.470
Can we see the Kordas picture?

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:14.430
In terms of the processes of
commodification of his image

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:20.310
that you finished
with, the composition

01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:27.480
of Barack Obama's poster Hope,
particularly the direction

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:34.970
of the gaze and the position
of the head reappropriated,

01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:44.000
of course, devoided of any of
the radical politics of Che,

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.070
a form of radical politics
that perhaps could

01:02:46.070 --> 01:02:49.490
have been consumed when the
poster came up during the 2008

01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:50.130
campaign.

01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:53.360
But as time went on, eight
years of his presidency

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.360
perhaps dissolved
and perhaps going

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:59.120
in the same direction of the
processes of commodification

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.560
that you pointed to.

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:07.850
So those two-- not
intertextualities,

01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:11.900
but interfigural
relations of these images.

01:03:14.770 --> 01:03:19.850
And the fact that you've
written so much wonderful texts

01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:27.320
about Che, but making
clear, I think as a gesture,

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:32.420
but this is what I want to ask
you, that he can be reread.

01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:38.420
He can be put in different
kinds of networks.

01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:50.130
But he can be
reinscribed as a writer,

01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:54.064
but not recuperated in terms
of his radical politics.

01:03:54.064 --> 01:04:00.780
So if that's, in spite of
what you answer to Kayla's--

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:03.750
like, I want you to
say more about the way

01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:07.960
that you see the
possibilities and limitations

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:12.400
of this revisiting
of his figure today.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.770
Thank you, Mariano.

01:04:14.770 --> 01:04:19.140
Let me start with the images.

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:24.780
And indeed, shortly
after Feltrinelli

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:28.210
created the poster,
John Berger--

01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:31.710
who many of us have read--

01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:34.830
you know, the art historian
and theoretician--

01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:36.660
said, oh, this is just--

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:41.340
well, not this one, but the
one where he's lying dead--

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:43.650
this-- Gracias.

01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:44.280
This is--

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.300
I'm good at this.

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:48.660
--just like the anatomy
lesson of Dr. Taupe,

01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:52.990
and this is just like
Mantienias painting of--

01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:53.490
Christ.

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:54.720
--Christ.

01:04:54.720 --> 01:05:00.320
And, I would add, just like
Holbein's Christ in his

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:01.710
[INAUDIBLE].

01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:06.150
So it was immediately captured.

01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:09.210
There is one thing about the
way in which this image that

01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:12.120
seems to be so
carefully arranged

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:14.910
has a rather gruesome detail.

01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:22.320
Do you see a limb
down there in front

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:25.880
of one of the soldiers
on the far left?

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:34.230
So as much as this seems
to be an arranged scene,

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:38.200
it betrays some of the terrible
things that were going on.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:42.600
Che was captured with
two other guerrieros.

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:52.230
So that about the images
that you absolutely

01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:58.290
identified correctly about
the revolutionary message

01:05:58.290 --> 01:06:03.150
and how we could
arrest the marketing

01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:08.730
and the commercial appropriation
of Che's [INAUDIBLE] that

01:06:08.730 --> 01:06:11.640
would make him die all
over again if he saw it.

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:15.540
Imagine Mercedes
Benz selling its car

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:20.530
putting on the little logo
instead of the star up there,

01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:23.370
or, you know, ice creams.

01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:29.100
There's a magnum ice cream
called, Cherry Guevara.

01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:32.620
And we could go on and on.

01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:36.150
I think the big
question of our time

01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:39.690
and the big task of the
work we do in a university

01:06:39.690 --> 01:06:45.090
is to rethink the whole
question of a program

01:06:45.090 --> 01:06:51.150
for community, for solidarity,
for reigniting some kind

01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:53.850
of Utopian possibility.

01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:58.770
Right now, for all the reasons
I don't need to even refer to,

01:06:58.770 --> 01:07:02.490
I'm very pessimistic,
which is not in my nature,

01:07:02.490 --> 01:07:06.900
but it's difficult to get
up every morning these days.

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:09.270
And it's not just
Trump's America,

01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:13.870
but a lot of what's happening
in other parts of Latin America,

01:07:13.870 --> 01:07:18.450
such as Venezuela, where what
would be a populist message

01:07:18.450 --> 01:07:22.680
has derailed in
really terrible ways.

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:26.960
So it's something I'd love
to talk more about with you.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:31.560
So I'm just sort of
gesturing towards an answer.

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:33.210
I'm going to
interject just to say

01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:36.160
one thing about
Mariano's question

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:39.120
and the commercialization
of this photograph.

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:41.820
First of all, the
photograph is taking

01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:45.210
on a trope that goes back to
the 16th century, at least,

01:07:45.210 --> 01:07:49.564
in terms of a kind of
portrait type, which is a--

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:56.490
When the viewer doesn't look
at you and looks up like that,

01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:58.260
that's a regal photograph.

01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:01.900
I mean, this is a
posed photograph.

01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:08.130
This is not a snapshot, and
it is one that resonates

01:08:08.130 --> 01:08:20.250
completely within the history
of art as a kind of [SPANISH]----

01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:20.750
Portrait.

01:08:20.750 --> 01:08:23.779
--portrait that is well known.

01:08:23.779 --> 01:08:26.779
So that, as soon
as you see it, you

01:08:26.779 --> 01:08:31.910
associate it with certain
kinds of rhetorical meanings

01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:34.340
whether you know it
or not because you've

01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:36.500
seen it over and over again.

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.350
And just as you see in
this photograph here,

01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:42.109
there's also the
demonstration of proof

01:08:42.109 --> 01:08:44.210
which is to counter
the Doubting Thomas.

01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:48.830
When you put your finger
in the chest like that,

01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:51.770
that becomes a Christlike
figure immediately.

01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:53.960
But here, he's proving
he's dead, but of course,

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:57.529
in doing that, you're
proving he's alive.

01:08:57.529 --> 01:09:00.229
And the other thing I
just couldn't help saying

01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:06.200
is that Adorno's analysis
of the culture industry

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.830
has been used to really
talk about this image

01:09:09.830 --> 01:09:13.399
and what happens to
political imagery as--

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:20.189
and rap and all kinds of radical
counterculture images, music,

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:23.660
et cetera, as it's run through
the culture industry as Adorno

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:25.260
describes very well.

01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:27.859
So this was
well-articulated in the '50s

01:09:27.859 --> 01:09:31.080
already in terms of what
was going to be happening.

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:35.180
But this photograph is
paradigmatic of what

01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:36.740
Adnorno was arguing about.

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:38.120
There's a question right here.

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:42.380
I would just add that,
interestingly, the portrait--

01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:44.300
not this one, but
the other one--

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:50.240
was snapped by Korda while
he was watching the crowd

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:53.210
at this memorial service.

01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:55.730
Yeah, but it's cropped,
and taken down below--

01:09:55.730 --> 01:09:58.820
It's just a perfect choice.

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:00.425
He's a professional
photographer.

01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:06.949
And by the way, Tom, he
keeps all the rights and--

01:10:06.949 --> 01:10:07.490
Yeah, I know.

01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:10.612
--and the revenues, so--

01:10:10.612 --> 01:10:12.780
Well, thank you, Diana,
for a wonderful talk.

01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:13.880
Would you just identify--

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:14.810
Oh, sorry.

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:16.946
My name is Adriana
Guteirez and a I

01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:20.041
teach at romance
languages and literatures.

01:10:20.041 --> 01:10:20.540
No.

01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:25.340
Thank you for a very, very
meaningful, thoughtful talk.

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:27.530
And my question was more--

01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:33.890
I was puzzled by the
another or relationship

01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:39.740
with the picaresque is that
self-effacement of the picaro

01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:43.790
that is there to tell
the tale of others

01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:47.840
and by learning through
watching and witnessing.

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:54.020
And in that he
self-effacement serves

01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:59.960
for the purpose of creating the
image of Fidel as, you know,

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.640
the perfect leader.

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.990
And he portrays himself
as somehow the imperfect,

01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:14.330
or the learner, after Fidel
in this very paradigmatic duel

01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:17.750
that is also very much
of the picaresque.

01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:22.750
But and as thinking about
what Mariano said later,

01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:29.490
that self-effacement is as if he
were also preparing the ground

01:11:29.490 --> 01:11:33.590
for this social destiny of
his own image that is that

01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:39.200
self-effacement that has allowed
people to put in the anecdotes,

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:42.170
real or imagined--
some of them--

01:11:42.170 --> 01:11:48.560
and just to present a very
pristine image precisely

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:51.590
because of that self-effacement.

01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:54.230
That he, somehow, never--

01:11:54.230 --> 01:11:58.850
even though he's using
himself as an exemplum,

01:11:58.850 --> 01:12:00.510
he really doesn't become that.

01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:02.840
It's Fidel who becomes that.

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:08.240
So it's as if he's there to tell
the tale, but at the same time,

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:12.800
he's the one who follows the
revolutionary dream that Fidel

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:15.260
never really achieves.

01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:19.340
So in that sense, I disagree
with Mariano in the sense

01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:23.510
that he's also an open
mark for reinterpretation

01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:30.890
and that political
ideologies may come and go,

01:12:30.890 --> 01:12:32.950
but that he's still
an open symbol

01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:37.960
to be refilled
with possibilities.

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:42.590
Maybe not of technical
guerrilla warfare,

01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:45.670
but with possibilities
and images

01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:48.520
that will be created
in the future.

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:54.100
Well, I will be keen to see
how that gets reappropriated,

01:12:54.100 --> 01:13:00.190
and if one could say,
rested from coaptation.

01:13:00.190 --> 01:13:03.430
But it would be a
very productive thing

01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:04.840
if the miracle could happen.

01:13:09.170 --> 01:13:11.080
My name is Gustavo Quintero.

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.900
I'm from the Romance
Studies Department.

01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:15.040
Diana, thank you so much.

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:17.050
It was a great talk.

01:13:17.050 --> 01:13:20.390
I have two questions.

01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:21.510
The first one is--

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:27.940
I mean, we can see how
there is a Christification

01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:34.900
of the Che in all these images,
but I was wondering how,

01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:42.250
or to what extent, there is this
presence of religious topics

01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:47.010
and religious tropes within
El Pasajes de la Guerra

01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:49.720
Revolucionaria.

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:53.650
Does he mobilize
some of those to--

01:13:53.650 --> 01:13:56.710
And the second question I have,
and it's more like a comment,

01:13:56.710 --> 01:14:02.740
it's very interesting because,
if I understand correctly,

01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:06.110
these Pasajes come from a--

01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:10.190
they were previously circulated
in [INAUDIBLE] magazine, right?

01:14:10.190 --> 01:14:11.630
Yes.

01:14:11.630 --> 01:14:15.260
And so, at the same
time they tried

01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:20.932
to show how the future
should be from the past,

01:14:20.932 --> 01:14:22.640
it seems to me that
the future is already

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:26.690
split because they
published it twice.

01:14:26.690 --> 01:14:30.200
So it's already this
idea of circulation

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:34.040
of how the future
is, but it's already

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:39.900
published once in
[INAUDIBLE] and another time

01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:41.420
in the passages.

01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:48.380
Well, I don't think I would
run with that hypothesis

01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:55.610
because that would suggest that
every time a book is reissued,

01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:58.640
there aren't new
readers to be reached.

01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:01.100
And when it appeared
in [INAUDIBLE],,

01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:04.070
it was really at
the very beginning.

01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:07.010
And so you could
imagine that you

01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:09.890
have a readership
that's sort of following

01:15:09.890 --> 01:15:14.960
[INAUDIBLE] which was truly
a kind of military journal

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:19.490
that got set up
immediately after '59.

01:15:19.490 --> 01:15:21.130
And then, in the
process in which

01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:22.910
a book gets, if you will--

01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:25.790
I won't say canonized--

01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:29.780
but established as
that important book

01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:34.310
for the revolutionary
project, then it

01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:38.720
continues to create a
sense of the future.

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:40.840
Now, does it do that now?

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:44.990
Did you do that 10, 20
years after it came out?

01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:46.100
No.

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:48.410
At that point, it
was read differently,

01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:51.890
and that's sort of
the life of a text.

01:15:51.890 --> 01:15:54.980
Remind me, Gustavo,
what was your other--

01:15:54.980 --> 01:16:02.430
oh, you asked me if the Christ--

01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:08.540
I think what you see is a kind
of secular project expressed

01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:10.700
in religious terms.

01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:15.420
And a lot of his speeches, not
just in this book, but in many,

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:18.770
many speeches--
and he gave a lot--

01:16:18.770 --> 01:16:25.670
you have this sense of a future
march towards a greater, higher

01:16:25.670 --> 01:16:27.840
level of humanity.

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:32.720
And it's difficult to separate
that from the vocabulary

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:38.900
we have inherited
in religious terms.

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:43.040
But I would not say
that Che, in any way,

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:45.560
portrays himself
as a Christ figure.

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:50.840
These are kind of
accidents of the evolution

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:55.450
of the myth, the photographs,
and the historical record.

01:16:55.450 --> 01:17:00.530
And that's why I mentioned
the strangeness of the body

01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:04.970
disappearing for 30 years.

01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:07.040
Nobody knew where it was.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:12.350
They surgically
removed his hands.

01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:18.890
And a few years after his death,
they were sent to Fidel Castro.

01:17:18.890 --> 01:17:23.840
So the body was
turned into a kind

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:31.430
of spectral, ghostly absence.

01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:33.110
One question there,
and then, we'll

01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:35.220
take the last one over here.

01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:36.587
OK.

01:17:36.587 --> 01:17:38.420
I forgot to introduce
myself the first time.

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:38.740
Sorry.

01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:40.073
Peter Berger, German department.

01:17:40.073 --> 01:17:42.770
And forgive me for
asking a second question,

01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:47.090
but I found this anecdote
about a shooting contest

01:17:47.090 --> 01:17:48.060
very striking.

01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:51.770
And I think it's topical given
the question of self-effacement

01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:54.170
because it strikes
me that it is both

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:58.640
a self-effacement and an act
of power, an act of arrogance

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.010
and presumption.

01:18:00.010 --> 01:18:05.420
For losing to Fidel
on purpose, of course

01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:08.120
Che is becoming Fidel, right?

01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.526
Is showing fidelity to him.

01:18:10.526 --> 01:18:11.900
But at the same
time, he's losing

01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:15.050
on purpose, which is an act
of presumption and arrogance

01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:19.370
and placing himself
above Castro.

01:18:19.370 --> 01:18:23.210
I wonder what you think about
that being a highly problematic

01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:25.520
example of self-effacement?

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:29.510
I'd be with you, Peter,
if he were losing

01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:32.690
in a very explicit, clear way.

01:18:32.690 --> 01:18:35.600
But the assumption is that
the man went up to him

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.100
and said, what are you doing?

01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:41.010
Because it looked as though he
wasn't managing to hit the beer

01:18:41.010 --> 01:18:41.510
bottle.

01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:50.360
So I think we can assume that
he was not flaunting his--

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:52.744
I don't think
flaunting, but he is

01:18:52.744 --> 01:18:55.327
in this very technical sense in
the sense of the name becoming

01:18:55.327 --> 01:18:56.740
Fidel, right?

01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:58.160
By doing that.

01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:01.580
Yes, but I wouldn't call
it-- what did you say?

01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:03.090
Defiant?

01:19:03.090 --> 01:19:05.690
I think it's a much
more muted gesture.

01:19:05.690 --> 01:19:09.740
Well, presumptuous, I
would say, but maybe

01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:10.865
it's not right word for it.

01:19:10.865 --> 01:19:11.900
Anyway, thank you.

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:13.820
Thank you.

01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:16.940
My name's Anala Thangelo,
York University.

01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:18.440
I have a couple of questions.

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:20.720
The one goes to your--

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:23.630
when you were talking about the
picaresque around the ethics

01:19:23.630 --> 01:19:24.620
question.

01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:26.930
So you set it up
as being about--

01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:30.650
the one is about doxa, you
know, and [INAUDIBLE] basically.

01:19:30.650 --> 01:19:32.840
And then, the second
one, you we're

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:35.120
talking more about
the pleasure provided

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:39.990
by humor, and then, of course,
the food economy as well.

01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:42.390
I'm wondering if there was--

01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:44.960
I don't know, I haven't read
the text very carefully,

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:49.790
but I'm curious if there was
a different way of reading it

01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:53.960
that points not
to this kind of--

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:56.390
in a lot of ways-- so the
one is the hyper-masculine,

01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:59.720
and the other one is the
masculine embodiment.

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.550
But whether you can
read it in a way

01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:04.955
that really challenges this
kind of dichotomization

01:20:04.955 --> 01:20:07.940
of the subject itself
through these ethics

01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:11.180
and these economies that
you have articulated.

01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:12.830
So that's the first
question, and the--

01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:14.460
Can I answer it just so
that we don't get lost?

01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:14.960
Oh, yeah.

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:17.490
Yeah, that would be great.

01:20:17.490 --> 01:20:22.830
No, I think that if
you read the text,

01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:29.330
you will see that there is
one elegantly self-effacing

01:20:29.330 --> 01:20:34.550
narrative voice that is
obviously becoming [INAUDIBLE]..

01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:38.930
As Tom was saying, he
was really a doctor,

01:20:38.930 --> 01:20:44.810
and the commitment to giving
Fidel Castro the leadership

01:20:44.810 --> 01:20:45.710
role.

01:20:45.710 --> 01:20:48.440
So I would say that
that distinction

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:50.881
holds through the whole.

01:20:50.881 --> 01:20:51.380
No.

01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:53.330
I mean, I'm not saying
that it doesn't hold.

01:20:53.330 --> 01:20:56.870
But is there any way as the
readers, contemporary readers,

01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:59.300
that are interested
in disrupting some

01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:02.810
of these kind of appropriations
that are taking place, that we

01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:06.050
can do a reading that
can also open kind

01:21:06.050 --> 01:21:09.590
of different orientations
beyond these kind of, you know,

01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:12.070
dominant, very masculine--

01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:15.050
Well, there, you'd have
to do it and show me,

01:21:15.050 --> 01:21:19.610
and I tell you whether I could
go along with it because this

01:21:19.610 --> 01:21:21.290
is not an open text.

01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:25.170
This is a text with a purpose,
but I'd be very curious.

01:21:25.170 --> 01:21:30.110
I mean, it's always important
to reread and discover

01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:32.870
other interpretations.

01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:35.870
And my second
question comes out--

01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:37.710
and probably is
not in this text--

01:21:37.710 --> 01:21:42.290
but since you suggested
it, around the Chinese

01:21:42.290 --> 01:21:43.820
and the Soviets.

01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:46.190
And I'm really curious--

01:21:46.190 --> 01:21:48.220
I mean, based on
your other work--

01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:50.570
whether some of
that comes through,

01:21:50.570 --> 01:21:54.320
you know, a little bit later
in terms of the tensions

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.330
that are generated.

01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:58.910
And the reason I'm interested
in that since everybody's

01:21:58.910 --> 01:22:01.170
talking about the
future, I mean,

01:22:01.170 --> 01:22:05.210
where there are some kinds of
imaginations that were really

01:22:05.210 --> 01:22:07.790
crucial, but were not taken--

01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:10.100
you know, let's say through
the project of Fidel--

01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:15.320
but they are still important
for us to take more seriously.

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:16.450
Thank you.

01:22:16.450 --> 01:22:22.310
I would say that there's an area
in many of his later writings--

01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:26.000
that is before he leaves in '65.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.580
Because after that, he
writes his Congo diary

01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:30.260
and his Bolivian diary.

01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:34.850
But there is something to think
about when he is speculating

01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:38.420
about voluntary labor.

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:45.560
And how to create community
motivated by solidarity,

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:54.380
by the willingness to
work, by doing away

01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:58.880
with a distinction between
labor and intellectual work.

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:05.390
And so, that's a project that
he was extremely keen on and did

01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:09.500
not really succeed in, but
it is quite a bit of writing,

01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:11.570
and it would be
interesting to see

01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:17.240
that because, for him, the new
society can only take place

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:20.840
if the collective needs
and the willingness

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:28.340
to do voluntary work at
every level is sustained.

01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:29.240
Thank you.

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:31.510
You're welcome.

01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:32.300
All right, Tom.

01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:33.450
I think we'll bring
it to a close.

01:23:33.450 --> 01:23:33.750
Yes.

01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:34.250
Please.

01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:37.100
[APPLAUSE]
