expenses crisis added to that you had
 

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.820
expenses crisis added to that you had
the impact of the financial crisis and I

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:24.830
the impact of the financial crisis and I
 

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.380

00:47:40.059 --> 00:47:40.069
movement that BRICS it might bring to
 

00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:43.479

the fore but take either of those points
 

00:47:43.489 --> 00:47:45.489
the fore but take either of those points
and then on the second point I think

00:47:45.489 --> 00:47:45.499
and then on the second point I think
 

00:47:45.499 --> 00:47:47.799
and then on the second point I think
creating a new third party at a moment

00:47:47.799 --> 00:47:47.809
creating a new third party at a moment
 

00:47:47.809 --> 00:47:49.569

the Labour Party for the reasons you
 

00:48:06.529 --> 00:48:08.170
the Labour Party for the reasons you

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:10.029
gave but I think the problem the
Conservatives have is that Ken's

00:48:10.029 --> 00:48:10.039
