[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.227 --> 00:00:06.976
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.976 --> 00:00:08.143
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO: Thank you.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.573
I'm always really biased.

00:00:12.573 --> 00:00:14.740
That's one of my absolute
favorite Nike commercials.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.240
[LAUGHING]

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.460
But it's pretty
brilliant I think.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.310
So thank you for the
great introduction.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.730
And as you saw in that video,
it's all about being first.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.580
About a year ago,
I did something

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.120
that no other African
or black woman had ever

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.290
dared to do before.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.490
And so I'd like to start with
a description of skeleton.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.930
We just saw a little
bit of it in the video,

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.220
but I don't ever assume that
anyone knows what skeleton is.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.860
Because you get a lot of
definitions when you say,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.570
I do the sport of skeleton,
and people get confused.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.550
So I always like
to start with that.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.140
So with millions of people from
all around the world watching,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.910
I dared to do the sport of
skeleton, which is essentially

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.160
you going down, headfirst, at
80 miles an hour on a frozen ice

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.130
track with your face
just inches from the ice.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.435
Who's signing up for that?

00:01:10.435 --> 00:01:12.310
And that's essentially
the sport of skeleton.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.018
And it goes a little
something like this.

00:01:14.018 --> 00:01:16.070
I'll just describe
it a bit further.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.240
So you first sprint on
ice for about 30 meters--

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.150
yes, I said, on ice
for about 30 meters

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.020
before you dive onto your tummy
onto something called a sled.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.980
So you kind of do like a little
Superman dive onto your sled.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.320
And the sled is
actually, essentially,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.420
a tray about the size
of a large suitcase.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.330
So about this long.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.880
Once you're on the
sled, just imagine

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.770
being on a giant, frozen,
water slide with massive twists

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.060
and turns.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.420
And you're going about as
fast as your car goes down

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.000
the freeway.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.960
Yeah, that fast.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.860
So once you're navigating
your way down the track,

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.020
you have no safety belt, and
you have no braking mechanism.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.720
And your heart is pretty much
beating faster and faster

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.360
with every turn that
you're going down.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.490
And also, your vision
gets a little blurry

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.650
because you're going so fast.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.140
And for about 60
seconds, it's just

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.760
you, the ice, and your sled
trying to get across the finish

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.950
line as quickly as possible.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.700
Now, did I mentioned that
I did this voluntarily?

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.300
[LAUGHING]

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.630
And I did.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.190
And so, as the intro
said, I made history.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.930
This time last year, I was in
PyeongChang, South Korea making

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.560
history as the first
Nigerian to ever compete

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.450
in the Winter Olympics.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.020
I also made history as the
first black and African woman

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.170
to compete in the sport of
skeleton at the Olympics.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.980
Now, this all sounds
wonderful, but you

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.880
might be wondering, outside
of the amazing pizza that's

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.410
available at the
Olympic Village--

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.410
and it was very, very
good, by the way--

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:09.600
why would I, a then 36-year-old,
mid-level professional,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.760
working at the time at one of
the world's most recognizable

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.260
brands--

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.820
I was working at Nike--

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.480
with a fancy job title,
decide and choose

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.320
to put all that aside and
go on a 100 day journey

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.110
to pursue the Olympics?

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.770
Well for me, it was all
about shifting the narrative.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.880
And this is super important
because this was basically

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.730
the driving force,
the motivating force,

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.010
that led me to do what I did.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.200
Shifting the narrative
was very important

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.870
because my journey was
inspired by the fact

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.020
that I discovered that no
African or black woman had ever

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.660
competed in the sport of
skeleton at the Olympics.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.770
And I thought, wow, we have
over a billion people in Africa

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.670
and there's not been one
person that has done this?

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.310
And I recognized an
opportunity, at that point,

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.220
to shift the narrative of
what was possible coming

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.750
from the continent of Africa.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.250
So Africa is very
severely underrepresented

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.713
at the Winter Olympics.

00:04:09.713 --> 00:04:11.130
So I don't know
if any of you guys

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.230
watched the Olympics last
year, did anyone get a chance,

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.610
check me sleighing?

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.790
Yes.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.600
You only saw eight countries
that were there from Africa.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.340
And that was historic, right?

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.360
Eight countries.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.580
Africa has 54 countries, though.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.230
So there's still quite
a lot of work to do.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.130
And it makes sense.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.900
Obviously, I mean, the
conditions in Africa--

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.230
we don't have a lot
of winter climates.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.750
Also, the facilities
aren't there.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.840
And also, it's really
expensive to do these sports.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.380
But I wanted to show people
that despite these barriers,

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.180
anything is possible.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.010
That anybody could do anything.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.570
And I wanted to
shift the narrative

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.580
of what people
have come to expect

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.890
from the continent of Africa.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.720
And so that's why I
went on the journey.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.790
And ultimately, for
me, it was about

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.552
inspiring the next generation
to dream without limits.

00:05:03.552 --> 00:05:05.760
And so that's what I really
want to talk to you guys,

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.210
today, about is my journey
shifting the narrative.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.940
I want to share with you what
that journey looked like, some

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.130
of the lessons that I learned.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.660
Because I believe that--

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.540
I mean, I'm pretty special,
but I'm not that special.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.590
I am just a regular
person just like you,

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.040
who had the desire to
do something different

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.040
and make a choice to
do something about it.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.010
I saw an opportunity
where I thought

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.100
that I could solve and
use my gifts and talents

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.820
to do something about it.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.510
So let's talk about shifting the
narrative and what that means.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.360
And also, in your
lives, everyday lives,

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.290
whether it's in your
personal life or your career,

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.070
there are opportunities
all around us

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.565
to shift the narrative.

00:05:48.565 --> 00:05:50.190
And what this journey
has really taught

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.550
me is that we all have the power
to take those steps to do it.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.790
So I hope that what I share
with you, you can take

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:57.977
and you can apply.

00:05:57.977 --> 00:06:00.060
And we're all going to be
shifting the narratives.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.070
I actually like to call it
sleighing the narrative.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.330
Forget shifting,
I like to sleigh.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.820
So-- but first, I
want to just give you

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.510
a little context as to who I am
and what led me to this point

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.630
in my life.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.020
So this is my birth picture.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.040
And I wanted to start here
because, actually, for me

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.720
as a Nigerian, the name is
really important in my culture.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.045
I am from the Yoruba
culture in Nigeria.

00:06:27.045 --> 00:06:27.962
AUDIENCE: Woo.

00:06:27.962 --> 00:06:28.920
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO: Yeah.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.940
We got some Nigerians?

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:30.640
Yes.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.720
Yes.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.420
Yes.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.770
It's really, really important.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.480
And in my culture, children
get named-- babies get named

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.490
seven days after they're born.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.380
And that's because
it's really important

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.160
to understand the circumstances
around a child's birth.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.720
If you hear the
name, you can hear

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.320
the story of what was going on
with the family or the child

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.430
at that particular
point in time.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.770
So my full name is Simidele and
that means accompany me home.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.930
And you can see right
here, I was born

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.640
in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.630
So yes, I have multiple
passports, which helps.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.630
But I'm Nigerian to the bone.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.710
But my name is Simidele
because I was born in Canada

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.050
and I was essentially
accompanying my parents

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.670
back home to Nigeria.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.680
So a couple months
after I was born,

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.160
my parents went back to Nigeria
and I accompanied them home.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.100
And it's interesting because
that was actually a sneak peek

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.680
into kind of how my life
ended up playing out.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.080
But this is where
my story starts.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.900
So I lived in Nigeria
until I was six years old.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.660
And after that, then my
family moved to the US

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.710
and we moved to Canada, as well.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.160
And I grew up in different
parts of the US and Canada,

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.360
until seventh grade.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.410
I moved to Louisville, Kentucky.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.040
And that's where, for the
most part, that I grew up.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.820
In seventh grade is also where
I pretty much discovered sport.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:54.060
And I started playing sports
on a pretty active level.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.050
I played a number
of different sports,

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.625
including those that you
see there, track and field.

00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:02.610
I played field hockey,
volleyball, basketball.

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.310
You name it, I played
it and I loved it.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:09.780
And this is where the athlete
in me really started to arise.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.120
But the sport that kind
of stuck with me most

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.560
is track and field.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.720
And this is where
I really excelled.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.650
And this is what I call
my original Olympic dream.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.350
I had a vision that I
would be at the Olympics.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.910
The sun would be shining, and
I would be jumping in sand.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.790
And I came really
close to that vision.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.010
In college, I was a
four-time All-American

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.559
at the University of Kentucky.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:36.659
And those that don't know
what an All-American is,

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:37.826
it means you're really good.

00:08:37.826 --> 00:08:40.860
[LAUGHING]

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.409
It means you are one of the
top athletes in the nation

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:44.430
in the United States.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.080
So that was quite an honor.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.470
And I felt that I had a lot
of potential to really make it

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:50.970
at the Olympic level.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:56.760
So I tried out for two Olympic
teams in 2004, as well as 2008.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.440
And I came very, very close
to making those teams,

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.830
but just didn't quite make it.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.320
And that, obviously, was
a huge disappointment.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.040
I had spent years of my
life devoted to this goal

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.790
and falling short was
very disappointing.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.770
But that's when I
realized that, hey, you

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:17.380
can give something your best and
maybe you don't quite make it.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.940
And then you keep going.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.360
And so for me, I decided
to call it quits.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:26.670
I hung up my spikes, and I
retired for about 10 years.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.170
I moved on with my life.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.260
And this is actually where
my shifting the narrative

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.360
story really begins.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.840
So I had a job opportunity
and I had the chance

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.610
to move to South Africa--

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:42.270
Johannesburg, South Africa
about 5 and 1/2 years ago.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.850
And it was awesome
because before that, I was

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.430
living in Beaverton, Oregon.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.260
And if you've ever
lived there, you

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:53.890
know that that was a come up
for me to move to South Africa.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.980
So I was quite
pleased with that.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.760
[LAUGHING]

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.600
And so my shifting the
narrative journey really

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.460
begins here, because
this is where I

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.800
started noticing a disconnect.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.340
I started noticing that there
was a disconnect between what

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.640
the world sees and
perceives of Africa,

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.100
and what I was experiencing
everyday living

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.510
and working on the continent.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.960
So this picture,
here, is, to me,

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.930
kind of representative of
what the world typically sees

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.000
when they think about Africa.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.020
To me, this picture represents
despair, hopelessness, death,

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.290
disease, destruction.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.180
Those are the stories
and the narratives

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.520
that get told about Africa.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.910
And it just wasn't matching up
with what I was seeing, living

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.830
and working in Johannesburg.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.430
What I was seeing was
beauty, vibrancy, resilience,

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:45.870
innovation.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.870
And I was starting to know more
about the business context,

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.440
as well, because I
was working there.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.060
So I started hearing stats
like, Africa's got the youngest

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.770
consumers in the world.

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:00.540
The average age of an
African is 19 years old.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.290
Africa also has 6 out of 10
of the world's fastest growing

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:05.760
economies.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.140
Also, Africa has more
than 400 companies

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:14.670
that are driving more than
$1 billion of revenue.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:17.370
And these are stats that
we don't hear about.

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:21.150
That is not the story that
we are told about Africa.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.010
So that started getting
me curious and interested.

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.160
So I was there in
a corporate sense,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.650
but I started getting a
sense that maybe there

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:31.410
was more that I could do
in my personal capacity

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.540
to shift the narrative.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.090
And oh, yeah, I love to travel.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.100
So while I've been
in South Africa

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.900
for the last 5 and
1/2 years, I've

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.170
made it my personal
agenda, my personal mission

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.510
to travel to as many African
countries as possible.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.110
So here's a picture
from Dakar, Senegal.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.270
This is the Renaissance statue.

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.820
And I went there a few
years back to visit.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.810
And I was just shocked that I
had never heard of this statue

00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:58.710
before.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.380
It's about 50 meters tall.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.830
And it's taller than the
Christ the Redeemer in Rio.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:07.200
It's taller than the
Statue of Liberty.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.990
And it's really dope, as
well, because it represents

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:13.260
African freedom and independence
and the story behind it

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.120
is really, really deep.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.560
And I was shocked that this
beautiful, beautiful statue

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.630
that's sitting, here,
right on the continent,

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.760
I had never heard of.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.780
I'd never seen in a magazine.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.360
And it's taller than
all of these statues

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.290
that we hear about all the time.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.680
So I started also kind of
taking those kind of things

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.760
into consideration.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.570
And then, of course, you
have some holiday time

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.530
and you get to go
to the beaches.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.070
This is a picture from Zanzibar.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:45.090
And you can see there, it's
beautiful white sand beaches

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.070
with turquoise waters.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.460
The waters and the beach
setting that we all dream of.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.520
This is right here on
the continent of Africa.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.790
And by the way, this
is just one of many.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:01.080
And again, these are not the
stories that we hear about

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.540
or people talk about
when it comes to Africa.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.100
So for me, that five years
that I've been in South Africa

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.050
has really impacted me.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.270
And this is the
conversations that I

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:16.020
started having with myself
and started asking myself that

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.520
well, it's great that I'm here.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.750
I'm working in my
corporate capacity.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.440
But I really feel
a personal calling

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:27.720
to do something in my capacity
to help shift the narrative.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.200
So-- and now, I had this
opportunity to do that.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.440
And so now begins the
part where I actually

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.455
started shifting the narrative.

00:13:36.455 --> 00:13:37.830
And this is where
I want to share

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:41.740
with you some of the lessons
that I learned along the way.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.830
So there's three
key things that I've

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:46.550
learned as I've talked
about and experienced

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.120
shifting the narrative.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.440
It starts with a choice.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:55.440
So my choice started
when, in December of 2016,

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.440
a friend of mine sent
me a link to an article

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.530
about the Nigerian
women's bobsled team.

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.530
And like most people,
I probably had only

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:06.600
heard of bobsled through what?

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.190
The movie "Cool Runnings."

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:10.690
Exactly.

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:11.550
[LAUGHING]

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.950
And that was my only
point of reference.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.330
But there they were.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:19.350
These three women who said
they wanted to make history.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.920
They wanted to become the
first African bobsled team

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.750
to go to the Olympics.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.700
And I immediately was hooked.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.040
And given what I just
mentioned about what

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.470
I was seeing and
starting to understand

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.590
and seeing the disconnect in the
narratives that were being told

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.840
and the reality of
what I was living,

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.200
I knew instinctively,
immediately that this

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.800
was my opportunity and my way
to play a part in shifting

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.060
the narrative.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.860
But-- big problem--

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.230
I know nothing about bobsled.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.160
What's going to happen?

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.830
So I did what everyone would do.

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:54.255
I hit these girls
up on Instagram.

00:14:54.255 --> 00:14:55.230
[LAUGHING]

00:14:55.230 --> 00:15:00.220
And I reached out and I said,
hey, I just saw this article.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.340
And I'm super interested.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.990
Are you looking
for team members?

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:08.550
Because in my mind, bobsled
is a four person sport,

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.440
and there were
only three of them.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.540
So they quickly
corrected me and let

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.360
me know that actually,
for women, it's

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.000
still only a two women sport.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.890
And we actually have our
team and an alternate.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:23.760
So yeah, you're good.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.900
So that was the
immediate response.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.440
And at that point, I
though, OK, well, maybe that

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.760
wasn't my opportunity
to shift the narrative.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.620
And I kind of just went
on minding my business.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.850
And then a few months later,
I saw this on their Instagram.

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:40.740
And that dream was reborn.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:44.460
And that opportunity and that
choice to shift the narrative

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.780
was reborn.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.710
So this was the post that was
posted by the Nigerian Bobsled

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:51.540
and Skeleton Federation.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.980
It was for a tryout
in Houston, Texas.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.160
So the Federation
is based in Houston.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.870
Anybody who's been
to Houston probably

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.520
knows there's lots
of Nigerians there.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.780
So our founder was
actually based in Houston.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.910
And so that's why the
tryouts were there.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:09.000
So I saw this post on
Instagram about two weeks

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.850
before the actual tryouts.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:14.730
And I really, really
wasn't sure what

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:17.280
to do with this information
because I knew, OK,

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.680
maybe they already had
their team in place.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.600
And I thought, OK, I don't know.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.980
I live in Johannesburg.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.530
Am I supposed to fly
to Houston for this?

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:28.472
And then, I just also wasn't
sure what am I trying out for?

00:16:28.472 --> 00:16:29.430
Is it for the Olympics?

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.260
Is it for the next Olympics?

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.940
And then, if you see
there in the fine print,

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.030
it says 18 to 35.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:40.734
And just a week before I
saw this post, I turned 36.

00:16:40.734 --> 00:16:41.668
[LAUGHING]

00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:44.940
Dang it.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.030
But this is where
the choice really

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:51.870
the important part and the
big first step in shifting

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.010
the narrative.

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:56.610
No narrative gets
shifted accidentally.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:59.260
You have to make a
deliberate choice.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.080
So even though I had all these
things I wasn't sure about.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.442
I had all of these fears.

00:17:04.442 --> 00:17:05.400
Would I be good enough?

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.130
Do I know anything
about bobsled?

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.180
What does this mean?

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.079
Am I too old?

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:13.260
I had to make a
choice because I was

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.930
that passionate about
shifting the narrative

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:17.550
and it starts with
that first step.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.599
And that's making the choice.

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:23.099
So I decided two weeks
before this tryout

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:24.810
that I was going
to go and try out.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:28.060
And by the way, I was still in
my 10-year retirement when I

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:28.560
got--

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.730
when I saw this post.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.560
That also was one of my fears.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.370
I had not competed at a
high level in 10 years.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:37.900
So was I ready?

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:38.820
I didn't know.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.350
But I was willing to find out.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:44.560
And I felt that I had
absolutely nothing to lose.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.520
So I traveled to Houston.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.920
I flew all the way
from Johannesburg.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.710
And I was at the
tryout for one day.

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.630
There were three
things you had to do.

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.610
You had to do a 45-meter sprint.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.620
You had to do a
standing long jump.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.410
And then you had to
do a shot put throw.

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.150
And I felt like, if
I can just make it

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:06.360
through without
pulling a muscle, that

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.150
is a win at 36 years old.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.110
So I felt I could make it.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:13.990
And so I used the two weeks
between when I booked my ticket

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.760
and when I went to try to
get my muscles back in shape.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.030
And I made it through.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.990
And not only did
I make it through,

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:22.680
but I made it through
enough to make the team.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.870
And I was invited back
to a camp the next month.

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:31.380
So making that choice and
doing that first step was huge.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:35.900
So the next part of shifting
the narrative, once I decided

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:40.280
to make that choice, it was
then about how was I going

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.900
to step into this new world?

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.900
What does this new
world look like for me?

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.240
And again, I knew nothing
about this new world.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.730
So when I showed up to the camp
that I was then invited to,

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.080
it was a lot of learning.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.950
I had no idea about anything and
I felt just like this picture.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.800
I felt like a fish out of water.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.450
And that's when I actually made
the transition from a focus

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:09.200
to bobsled to now a
focus to skeleton.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.970
One, because at that camp
it was confirmed that hey,

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:14.750
the team is already
in place for bobsled.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:17.100
And somebody actually
suggested, hey,

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.520
would you be
interested in skeleton?

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.940
And like many people, I
said, what's skeleton?

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.550
And when they showed
me, I said, huh?

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:29.490
And I didn't think I would
be interested either.

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.810
But after I made my choice,
and said, I'm interested,

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:35.660
my choice was really about
shifting the narrative.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.150
So whether the vehicle--

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:41.240
literally, the vehicle was a
bobsled or a skeleton sled,

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.970
I stayed focused on
that choice that I made.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.160
And that was to
shift the narrative.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.860
But I still had to
start from somewhere.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.800
And I was starting
below ground zero.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:55.160
Because this is a sport
where nobody from my country

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.810
knew anything about it.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:01.400
I couldn't ask anyone from my
country, my family, my friends.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.750
No one could help me.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:07.640
And so I had to rely on
the community of people

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:12.290
to try to figure out how I
could somehow fit in and not

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:16.640
feel like an imposter, which was
very difficult because I looked

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:21.380
very different than anybody
that was in the sport.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:25.010
And there I was with my
beads, with my braids,

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:29.330
with my Davido blasting
in my Beats headphones.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:32.390
And I was just kind
of somebody that was

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.180
trying to just figure it out.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.490
And there was a whole
new language as well

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:38.870
that was spoken.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:42.020
All kinds of technical terms
that I didn't know about,

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.830
equipment things, and I had
to learn a whole new culture,

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.420
essentially.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:51.800
But what I realized in that
space was that although I'm

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.600
trying to shift
the narrative, it

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.630
was really important
to stay true to myself.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.940
And the more I
stayed true to myself

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.220
that would just help
me build my confidence

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.260
and know that I could do it.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.670
I always thought about
why I was doing it.

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:08.750
The reason that I was doing
it, for the people back home

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:11.700
because this barrier
needed to be broken.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.700
And then, what I
realized is that I

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:17.940
would need to curate what I
wanted the new narrative to be.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.150
And for me, that
was rooted in how

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:24.000
I wanted black women and
African women to be represented.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.030
So I started thinking
about what do

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:29.900
I want to show up looking like
when I do show up in this room

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.430
when I'm an imposter.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:34.340
And nobody's ever
seen anybody like me.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.230
What do I want their
first impression

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:38.860
to be of an African woman?

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.820
And I started curating that.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.820
And that was a
head-to-toe curation.

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:46.040
So it started with my braids.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.250
And this was something
super important to me.

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:53.190
First of all, braids are very
convenient and practical,

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:54.950
especially when you
have to wear a helmet.

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:56.210
You saw it in that video.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.110
I'm always wearing a helmet.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:01.640
So from a practicality
standpoint, it made sense.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.970
But braids to me represented
more than practicality.

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:07.190
Braids were super
important because I just

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:11.780
felt that they represented an
African beauty, specifically,

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:13.760
these braids that you
see in these pictures.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.630
They're called Fulani braids
from a tribe in Nigeria.

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:18.620
And you've seen them.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.680
Stars like Alicia Keys
wears them and other stars.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.870
Well, she did back
in the day anyways.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:28.760
Where you have two braids
coming down in front and usually

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.900
there's beads and things.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.370
And they're decorated.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:33.360
And I just thought
that if I was going

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.420
to be stepping
out into the world

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.760
and wanting to
represent what it is

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:43.640
to be a beautiful, intelligent,
strong, black, African woman,

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.670
that the braids were an
important crown to that.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.730
And I wanted the world to
see and celebrate that.

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:52.220
And that was all part
of how I could curate

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.860
the narrative that I wanted.

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.240
Then, the beads.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.220
The beads were really
important to me,

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.700
as well, because those
told a deeper story.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.190
For me, the beads
told a deeper story

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.710
of the women that
had come before me,

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:10.680
specifically, Venus
and Serena Williams.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.930
These were heroes
of mine growing up.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:16.020
And I called them the
original trailblazers.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.270
And if you remember,
when they first, first

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:22.110
came out back in the day,
they had those beads.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.240
And those beads were iconic.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.380
And so I wanted to pay homage
to that legacy in some way

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:29.880
by rocking beads.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.660
So up until this day, every
time that you see me compete,

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.167
I'm usually wearing those
beads, just to pay homage.

00:23:37.167 --> 00:23:38.250
And they're cute, as well.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.720
[LAUGHING]

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.916
Don't mind being cute.

00:23:41.916 --> 00:23:43.620
Whoop, sorry.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.510
And then, the last piece--
now, we're working my way down

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:48.150
the head-to-toe look--

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:50.220
was then, what are
the little elements

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:52.080
that I could put
into my equipment

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:55.710
to tell a deeper story about
what I wanted the narrative

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:59.460
to be and how I wanted to curate
the narrative of what it means

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.640
to be a modern African woman?

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:07.800
And so what you see,
I guess to my left,

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.260
is what the back of
my sled looks like.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.450
This is a pattern
that I had designed.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:14.950
And so, hopefully,
you can see it.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:17.200
Some people see different
things when they look at it.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:21.480
But what it is the
continent of Africa,

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:26.350
and you can also see kind of the
silhouette of a woman's face.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:29.490
So I just felt like
that was super strong.

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.260
And it has a deeper
meaning, as well,

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:34.410
because this was a
logo of an organization

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:37.440
that I co-founded
back in Johannesburg

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.570
that was all about
women's empowerment

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:42.930
and connecting women and
bringing them together

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:44.410
to elevate them.

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:46.260
So I wanted to
carry that with me

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.900
as I was going to PyeongChang.

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.520
And then, of course, you
have to have the shoes.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.150
The shoes have to be on point.

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:56.340
And so my good
friends at Nike were

00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:01.620
able to design some shoes for me
that spoke to who I truly was.

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.080
And that was all part
of the curated narrative

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.580
that I wanted to drive.

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.650
So you have the green
and white, which

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:10.450
is all about Nigeria colors.

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:14.250
And then they had the date
that I made history, as well

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:18.450
as equality, which really spoke
to kind of equality in sports

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:22.110
because I was doing
something to break barriers.

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:27.630
And so curating is the second
part of one of my lessons

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:30.300
I feel that I've learned
through this journey of how

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.920
to shift the narrative.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.960
So first you make the
choice, but then you

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.300
have to be really
strategic about how

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:40.990
you curate the new narrative
that you want to drive.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.720
So the third piece
is commitment.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.220
So you've made the choice.

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:47.530
You've now curated
the new narrative.

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:50.180
Now, you have to commit to it.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.600
And so this is me
in PyeongChang.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.780
And PyeongChang was
really a starting point.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.010
I really see it as
a starting point.

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:00.550
Now, I have a
longer-term commitment

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.340
to continue to
shift the narrative.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.550
And I've made that commitment
through to the next Olympics

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:08.770
in Beijing 2022.

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:13.120
Narratives typically don't
get shifted overnight.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.200
That's the reality.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.770
So you have to be
committed for however

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:19.150
long that journey takes.

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:20.300
And it's an evolution.

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.440
It's always a conversation.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.780
And so I have taken that step.

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.550
And there's still tons
of work to be done.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:31.720
So I mentioned
earlier that Africa

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.810
had eight countries,
which represent about 8%

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:38.200
of the total countries that
were at the Winter Olympics.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:42.230
Europe, as a continent, 52%.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.960
So the gap is still
very, very wide.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:48.370
And I'm hoping that what
I've done to open the door

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:51.050
will inspire other African
countries to come along,

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:51.550
as well.

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:55.090
And who knows where
we can be by 2022.

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:58.060
The other thing that I'm
going hard at to continue

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:01.720
to shift the narrative is,
it's one thing to participate,

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.490
but it's a whole other
thing to be a contender.

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:07.900
So the goal is, by
2022, that the narrative

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.240
is shifting from, oh, cute,
the Africans are here--

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.420
[LAUGHING]

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:16.780
--to wow, the Africans
are winning medals.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:19.660
And that's now the next
level of the narrative

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.400
that I'm trying to drive.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:25.120
Norway, just by
themselves, won 39 medals

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.160
at the last Winter Olympics.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.500
And the rest of the
European countries

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.540
also followed suit with 21.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.520
And Africa had 0.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.880
So the race is on for
which African country

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.300
is going to win the first
Winter Olympic medal.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.950
And that's the
commitment that it's

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:44.800
going to take to continue
to shift the narrative

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.690
and shift the conversation.

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:51.670
So I think through
my journey, I hope

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:57.250
that you guys have taken from
this that I'm a regular person,

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:58.910
just like everyone else.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:02.870
But I made the choice
to shift the narrative.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:07.250
I curated how I wanted that
narrative to be shifted.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:09.910
And then, I'm continuing
with that commitment

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:15.130
to continue to drive further
growth and development in ways

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.860
that people see Africa,
people see black women,

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.600
people see what's possible.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.040
There's so many layers to this.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:25.000
And I'm continuing
to drive change.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.110
And I hope that you guys see
that I'm just a regular person.

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:30.790
And that you can do it, too.

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:32.770
Any narrative that
you want shifted,

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:35.780
whether it's in your personal
life, professional life,

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.000
it's possible.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.240
So I hope you're
inspired to do that.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.207
Thank you.

00:28:41.207 --> 00:28:45.103
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:51.750
SPEAKER: So I want
to touch on something

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:55.330
you mentioned about
your collegiate career.

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:58.960
So you said, All-American
means pretty good.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.040
But as I understand it, you
have the Kentucky record

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.330
for triple jump?

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.250
Kind of the best?

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:07.410
And you were also an
Academic All-American.

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:11.670
So how do you balance being
really, really competitive

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:13.262
at two different things?

00:29:13.262 --> 00:29:14.220
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO: Yeah.

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:17.100
So, unfortunately,
I have to report

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.440
that my records did just
get broken recently,

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.580
which was very sad.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:27.030
But I held them for over 10
years, which is a long time.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:30.360
But for me, that's
always been how

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.930
I've been is to balance both
academics and athletics.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.330
The two have always
gone hand in hand.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:37.170
At my house--

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.400
I don't know-- you
have Nigerian parents?

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:39.900
It was--

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:40.500
SPEAKER: Two of them.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.417
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO: Yes.

00:29:41.417 --> 00:29:43.140
[LAUGHING]

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.220
It wasn't a choice.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:45.450
There wasn't an option.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:48.250
You couldn't do one
without the other.

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:52.350
If the grades were slipping,
athletics were cut.

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:55.972
So I always had to make
sure that I balanced both.

00:29:55.972 --> 00:29:57.120
Yeah.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.920
SPEAKER: And was it difficult
to go from track and field,

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:05.580
where, clearly, you were
very knowledgeable and top

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:09.120
of your game, to something
where you didn't even know

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:10.110
were to begin?

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:13.460
That transition from-- when
you go to change the narrative

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.500
as a courage for
overcoming some kind

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.350
of fear of being an imposter.

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:21.782
Can you dig into that
a little bit for us?

00:30:21.782 --> 00:30:22.740
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO: Yeah.

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:26.700
I think-- you know, they
look very foreign, track

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.230
and field and skeleton.

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:30.550
But the more I've spent
time in the sport,

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:33.570
I'm now starting to see
more and more similarities.

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:37.440
But when I was new, I didn't
see a lot of similarities.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:40.180
It was very
terrifying, at first.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.910
But what I did is
actually, what I

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:46.080
mentioned in my talk, which is
really press into my strengths,

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.690
and press into myself,
which sounds selfish.

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:52.590
But one thing that I was
able to pick up very quickly

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:54.630
is the 30 meter sprint.

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.600
So once I realized that
I was good at that,

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.030
I was like I'm going
to do this all day.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:03.330
So for the first 5, 6
seconds of the race,

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:06.570
I'm actually in the lead,
which was really exciting.

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:11.320
At the Olympics, at a point, you
know, I was in medal position.

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.900
But there's the
rest of the track.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:18.490
So the race is about 60
minutes-- or, yeah, 60 seconds,

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:19.900
sorry.

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:23.280
And so what I'm working
on now to close that gap

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.990
is to be a better driver.

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:26.400
So I used my strength.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.440
I operated from a
position of strength.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.760
What am I good at?

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.050
The 30 meter sprint.

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:33.810
And I just tried to dominate
that as much as I could.

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:36.610
I had the third best
time at the Olympics.

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:39.060
And so for somebody who
had been in the sport

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:43.050
for about 100 days, I
thought that was pretty good.

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:46.470
So I just always
feel that if you

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:49.170
can operate from a
position of strength,

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:51.423
you're never an imposter.

00:31:51.423 --> 00:31:53.090
SPEAKER: Yeah, along
that, in your talk,

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:54.630
you mentioned
changing the narrative

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:58.280
and multiple levels of it,
which I thought was great.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.390
When I was watching
you in the Olympics,

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:01.890
I was listening
to the announcers

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:04.920
speak about that point, about--

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:08.280
from the first-- from the drive
and through the first couple

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.790
of time check points,
that you were in the lead.

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:15.780
And that people were sort
of, like, hey, you know,

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:16.760
the Nigerians are here.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:17.260
Cute.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.840
Oh, wait.

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.670
She's starting to
win some events.

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:24.150
And you'd won some
events before that.

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:26.700
Have you noticed a
change in how helpful

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.300
some of your competitors
are, as people

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:34.110
start to realize you can become
a better driver easier than you

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:35.882
can just magically get faster?

00:32:35.882 --> 00:32:36.840
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO: Yeah.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.240
Yeah, skeleton is
an interesting sport

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:42.610
and people really keep
their cards close to them.

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:44.760
And so yes, as you're
getting better and better

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:48.330
naturally the competition
is not maybe as open.

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:51.060
When you're finishing dead last,
everybody is like, oh, yeah,

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:51.790
maybe try this.

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:52.290
[LAUGHING]

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:56.520
But when you start
showing some promise,

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.670
people are a little
bit more secretive.

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:02.880
SPEAKER: You work as a product
marketing manager for Nike

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.460
working on campaigns
for you mentioned

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.560
like Venus and Serena.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.830
And it's interesting,
now, that's you.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:12.060
Right?

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:16.020
people, like me are inspired
by you and look to you.

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.630
And now, Nike is
making shoes for you.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:21.060
How has that transition felt?

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:23.585
And has that been weird or--

00:33:23.585 --> 00:33:24.960
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO:
It's definitely

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.240
been strange because
I was so used

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.680
to being on the other side.

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.450
So working on campaigns
for other athletes.

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:34.200
And so when the team actually
brought that commercial

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.510
and showed me for
the first time,

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:40.080
I just felt so vulnerable
because, you know,

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.360
I'm used to being the
one calling the shots.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.340
And saying, OK, we need
to touch on this insight.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:45.840
You know?

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.530
But now the team was
asking me and trying

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:50.480
to dig into how I
feel, to capture

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:54.740
the essence of the emotion
that you saw in that ad.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:58.920
So it just was a very
different experience.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.120
But it was really cool.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:04.690
I mean, hey, being a Nike
athlete is never a bad thing.

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:06.500
And I actually have
just recently made

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.380
the transition more to
focus on being a Nike

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:13.460
athlete versus working
in the corporate space

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:16.670
because I want to spend more
time doing the work that I'm

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:18.739
doing around shifting
the narrative on a deeper

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:24.320
level as an advocate,
continuing my journey to 2022.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.260
So yeah, it's been
an interesting kind

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:31.460
of relationship being on the
other side as a Nike athlete,

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.710
but cool, as well.

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:36.860
SPEAKER: And touching
on advocacy, you

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.690
know, it's more than
just doing two things.

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:40.350
You do many things.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:42.980
So can you tell us a little bit
about the work with the Malala

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:46.113
Foundation and Obama
and what's all that?

00:34:46.113 --> 00:34:47.030
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO: Yes.

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:52.850
So this whole skeleton thing
was not planned, like I said.

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:55.130
But what was cool about
it was that I really

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:59.250
realized that my story
somehow inspired other people.

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:01.850
And so I have taken
it very seriously

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:05.520
to use my platform
responsibly, as I call it.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.630
So coming out of the Olympics,
I looked for those opportunities

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:11.180
where I could drive
social impact.

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.890
One of them being Malala Fund.

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:17.510
Nigeria is one of Malala
fund's priority countries.

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:19.550
There are more
girls out of school

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:23.340
in that country, in Nigeria,
than anywhere else in Africa.

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.970
And so it's a very
serious issue.

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:28.880
And so I thought,
if there's anything

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:35.240
that I can do to bring awareness
and to raise money, I'll do it.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.970
So I've been working closely
with them as an ambassador

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:39.300
to do that.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:42.620
And then, I was super
excited because I

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:46.500
was selected as one of the
Obama Foundation leaders.

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.580
So the Obama Foundation
has started a program,

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:52.940
and I was in the inaugural
class, where they selected 200

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.130
leaders from all across Africa.

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:57.050
Leaders who are
creating and driving

00:35:57.050 --> 00:36:00.080
change in their communities
and their countries

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.270
in all kinds of
different spectrums.

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:06.470
Some in government,
some in sports, like me.

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:08.700
Everybody doing all kinds
of different things.

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.300
And so the Obama Foundation
is really working with us

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.910
to help amplify all of
the different things

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:15.720
that we're doing and support it.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.060
So that's been cool, as well.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:18.980
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:19.480
All right.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:22.590
I'm going to open it up
to the room for questions.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:25.805
And we'll take some questions
from the Dory as well.

00:36:25.805 --> 00:36:27.430
Do we have a microphone
to pass around?

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.930
AUDIENCE: So crazy small world.

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:36.445
My high school big sister,
Seun, is on the team with you.

00:36:36.445 --> 00:36:37.820
So I picked that
up on the flyer.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.433
So that was-- if you have any
bad stories about her that I

00:36:40.433 --> 00:36:43.100
can [INAUDIBLE], let me know.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:48.880
My first question is you spoke
a lot about the opportunity

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.580
and maybe pressure of
having to kind of define

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:56.510
how the world viewed what
an African woman was, right?

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:58.460
And so I think that's
something very similar

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:01.190
that minorities at
Google experience

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:02.120
in a different light.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.365
It's not due to
athleticism, but you

00:37:04.365 --> 00:37:05.990
consider the people
that work at Google

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:08.010
like the best of the best.

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:13.490
And so it kind of presents
this challenge or a task

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:16.340
that is not necessarily--

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.650
you're not asked to do it,
but it's kind of required

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:22.250
as a part of your
daily job to think

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:25.820
about how you present yourself
to co-workers and people that

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:28.658
may not have a lot of experience
in dealing with people that

00:37:28.658 --> 00:37:30.950
look like you or working with
people that look like you

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:35.480
and that genuinely want to
understand more about others.

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.670
But I think that that
can become frustrating.

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:42.050
And especially, as we look at
how black people experience

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:45.240
our company, it's a little bit
different than everyone else.

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:48.230
So for, I guess, the black
women and the black men

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:52.610
in the room that have to
constantly kind of feel

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:56.300
this pressure of wanting to
shift the narrative every day,

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:58.400
what advice do you give
them or what do you

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.100
tell them about the
opportunity and privilege that

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:01.820
also presents?

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:04.190
Because it's not just
work, but it's a privilege

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:07.040
to be someone in
that position to be

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.820
able to have that opportunity.

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.432
So how do you
encourage those folks?

00:38:10.432 --> 00:38:11.390
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO: Yeah.

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:15.830
I always look at it as a
position of inspiration

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:19.142
and an opportunity to inspire
through what you're doing.

00:38:19.142 --> 00:38:20.600
When you're shifting
the narrative,

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:24.080
there's always going to be
people who don't understand

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:28.820
or are criticizing a
certain group or whatnot.

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:32.970
But I like to flip it, and
people say ignore the critics.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:35.150
I like to say
inspire the critics.

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:39.620
And so I would just say back
to what I was talking about

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:42.680
I really had fun curating.

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.980
I look at it as if I
was working in a museum

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:49.880
and I would want to curate
a beautiful exhibition.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:53.390
What is that experience
that you want people to have

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:54.980
when they encounter you?

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.710
Of course, you can only
represent yourself,

00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:00.350
but knowing that, as a
minority group, typically,

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:02.420
like you said, some
people may only

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.690
have limited experience
with just you.

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:09.920
And so suddenly you're speaking
for all black people on Earth.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.830
So as you do that, know that
you can only do your best

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:15.530
and try to inspire
as you're doing that

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:17.210
and curate it to
the best that you

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:19.940
can working from a
place of strength

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:22.845
and just showing
how you do things.

00:39:22.845 --> 00:39:24.720
AUDIENCE: My question--
I have two questions.

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.780
One of them being,
I have a little bit

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:27.710
of insider knowledge.

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:30.320
I was at my alma mater
a couple of weeks ago

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:33.330
and one of the alumni works
at Nike as a category--

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.240
I think she's a
category sales manager--

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:41.870
working on the women, focus
on women in emerging markets.

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:44.540
And I found it interesting
that when she mentioned which

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:48.170
markets Nike considers
emerging for women,

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:50.242
Africa wasn't in there at all.

00:39:50.242 --> 00:39:51.950
And I just was like--
and we both looked.

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:52.780
And she was like, yeah, I know.

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:53.330
It doesn't make sense.

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:55.350
And I was like, no,
it doesn't make sense.

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:58.130
And so that's one
question as to when

00:39:58.130 --> 00:39:59.630
you talk about
shifting a narrative,

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:05.950
obviously, your track is,
for lack of a better term,

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:10.250
is doing that from a
Nike athlete perspective

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:13.220
versus maybe corporate.

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.190
What might that look
like in a corporation?

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:16.730
And my second
question really feeds

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:19.850
into that is, how did you sell
that shifting of narrative

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:24.080
and that story and that
brand opportunity to Nike?

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.730
Because, yeah,
they sponsored you.

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:27.020
Yes, you're a Nike athlete.

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.570
But that wasn't a, hey, I
want to try out for the team

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:31.400
and, you know, this
will be cool and you

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.810
know this is a cool thing.

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:35.830
It was, I'm sure, much
more well thought out.

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:39.465
And how did you present
that opportunity?

00:40:39.465 --> 00:40:41.090
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO: So
the first question

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:45.500
about kind of the
lack of, I guess,

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:48.840
recognition that
Africa is on the map

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.750
is something that
I've personally

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:54.210
found challenging
working on the continent.

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:55.970
And so it's not only
Nike, but there's

00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:59.720
a lot of companies who
are just not there yet.

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.870
They are not seeing the
potential and the opportunities

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:05.510
that exist in Africa.

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:06.980
I'm really excited
because I just

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.890
came from NBA All-Star
Weekend, where the NBA made

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:11.690
this huge announcement
that they're

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:15.710
starting a pro league in Africa
starting next year with 12

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:16.850
pro teams.

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:18.800
And I thought that that
was a huge statement

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.380
that they are taking that
step, making an investment

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.030
to expand specifically
in Africa.

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:26.900
So I'm hoping more
companies follow suit.

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:29.470
As I mentioned, some of
those stats are just amazing.

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:32.150
I mean, I think people
think of the story

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:33.980
that we typically get.

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.170
And they don't know the
opportunities that exist there.

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:39.710
So I'm just hoping that global
companies, more and more,

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:43.430
start seeing the
opportunities within Africa.

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:46.580
And the companies that
are already there,

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:50.330
I think you really, from having
the experience of working

00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:53.330
on the continent,
had to do a lot

00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:57.620
of internal kind of advocating
to have make sure Africa

00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.810
has a seat at the table.

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:01.100
It's 2019.

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.970
It's sad that that's
still the case.

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:06.010
But it is kind of what
we have to do for now.

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:08.330
And I think if we just keep
pushing and keep pushing,

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:11.600
people are going to
eventually open their eyes

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.160
to the opportunities.

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:16.490
So the second question is,
how did I approach Nike?

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:18.950
The funny thing is I
was minding my business.

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:21.800
And-- no, this--

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.680
everything happened
so fast, honestly.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.600
So from the time
when I tried out,

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:30.200
like I said, in
August of 2017, I

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.990
wasn't really sure at that
point what it would lead to.

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:35.630
So I just snuck away to
Houston for the weekend.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:37.530
I literally didn't tell anyone.

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:40.340
I think we had like an off
site that Friday that I

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:41.780
was supposed to be there.

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:44.360
And I took the day
and went to Houston.

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.290
And because I just wasn't sure.

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:48.250
And I was like, I don't
want to tell anybody,

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:50.870
and then it turns
out to be nothing.

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:53.360
But by the time I got invited
back to the team camp,

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.920
I was like, OK, this
could be something.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.150
So I told my boss.

00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:59.840
And one thing that I
appreciate about Nike

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.790
was that I had their support.

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:03.943
I had my boss's
support from day one.

00:43:03.943 --> 00:43:05.860
Even though we didn't
know where it was going,

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:07.580
she said, wow, this is amazing.

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:11.300
If you do end up having a real
shot, you know, this is great.

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.370
And I support you 100%.

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:15.560
And so the closer
and closer it got

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.620
and the more realistic
that, wow, by-- so by now,

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:21.290
like, by October, it was
starting to look like,

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:23.820
OK, this is actually happening.

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:25.580
And they were in full support.

00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:29.850
Now, I never came with like an
agenda or a proposal to say,

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:32.750
hey, you know, can
you do a commercial?

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:33.800
[LAUGHING]

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.190
I, at that time,
as an employee, I

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:40.220
was just more worried about
would I have the flexibility

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:43.250
to pursue this opportunity?

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:44.480
And thankfully, I did.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:47.850
I was able to work remotely
for the first few months.

00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:51.180
Then, as it got closer to the
games, I had to take time off.

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:54.210
And Nike was supportive of that.

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:57.270
It was actually the marketing
team, independent of me.

00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:58.740
I didn't ask anything.

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:03.930
They thought that my story was
interesting and a story that

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:04.830
needed to be told.

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:07.170
So big kudos to Nike.

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:09.660
I think that was a bold step.

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.520
You know, skeleton
is not a sport

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:15.660
that Nike really is
in the business of.

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:19.110
Nike doesn't really do a lot
with winter sports, in general.

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:21.060
But I think they
just were inspired

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:24.420
by the essence of the story and
felt that it needed to be told.

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:28.020
And that happened completely
independently of me.

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:30.395
SPEAKER: Would've been awkward
if you signed with Adidas.

00:44:30.395 --> 00:44:33.580
[LAUGHING]

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:36.100
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO: Yeah.

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.570
AUDIENCE: How's it going?

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:38.720
My name's Jonathan.

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.910
So I'm originally from Texas.

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:43.200
And one of the reasons I
moved out to California

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.980
was because it was easier
for me to be in tech here

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:51.150
than it was in Texas, especially
being an African American.

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:54.720
And I noticed you said you
lived many places in the US.

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.630
And also lived in
many places in Africa.

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:59.610
And I'm wondering, just from
your personal experience,

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:03.870
did you find a place or location
where maybe it was easier

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:06.720
for black people
to thrive or become

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:11.080
more successful in careers like
tech or high value careers,

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:11.610
like tech.

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:16.638
Or is it pretty much different
problems, different places?

00:45:16.638 --> 00:45:19.740
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO: Yeah,
I would say the latter.

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:21.780
But I actually
think Johannesburg

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:25.110
has been a place where
I really feel like has

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:28.200
a lot of great things about it.

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.540
You have a lot of
affluent black people

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:34.920
doing a lot of different
things in different industries.

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.450
South Africa now
has a little bit

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:38.390
of a trickier
background because they

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:42.060
are just 20 plus years from
apartheid-- post apartheid.

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:43.840
So that adds some complexities.

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:47.040
But just in terms of
opportunities and everything

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:50.560
like that, it's
very diverse there.

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:53.100
And I've enjoyed living there.

00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:55.830
I would say it's probably,
yeah, the most diverse place

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:57.720
that I've lived.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:02.340
I mean, Portland, Oregon
wasn't really diverse.

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:05.070
But I also grew up in
Louisville, Kentucky.

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:07.330
I lived in Canada.

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:11.490
So I think Johannesburg has
that perfect blend of diversity

00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:15.620
and opportunities
for everyone, really.

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.540
SPEAKER: Your baby brother
is changing some narratives,

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:19.474
as well, right?

00:46:19.474 --> 00:46:21.016
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO:
Yeah, a little bit.

00:46:21.016 --> 00:46:22.680
[LAUGHING]

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:26.720
SPEAKER: For those Googlers
who are members of dev color

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:31.496
is founded by Makinde, who
is Simi's younger brother.

00:46:31.496 --> 00:46:33.120
So yeah.

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:34.920
I'm going to go to
the Dory and see if we

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:38.190
can take one Dory question.

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:41.850
The question is, "Your
story is pretty interesting.

00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:45.780
Have you considered
selling it to Hollywood?

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:46.600
Making a movie?"

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:47.600
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO: Well--

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.183
SPEAKER: I could
play assistant coach.

00:46:49.183 --> 00:46:51.840
[LAUGHING]

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.990
Just give me one line.

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:56.970
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO: Well, I do
think there are opportunities

00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:59.910
to tell the story
and I've considered

00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:02.430
what the best platforms
to do that would

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:06.690
be, whether it's through
books or movies, et cetera.

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:08.040
So my agent is waiting.

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:13.140
If they know somebody, tell
them to call my people.

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:13.800
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:14.883
Where's the next question?

00:47:14.883 --> 00:47:16.030
Right here.

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:17.550
AUDIENCE: So growing up--

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:18.640
so I'm from Cameroon.

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.130
We're neighbors.

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:24.330
And I learned figure
skating when I grew up here.

00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:28.140
And I was wondering, you
talked about the talent

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:31.380
that's in Africa, both on the
continent, but also people

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:33.330
whose families have
immigrated here.

00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:37.740
How do we connect people with
those interests or passions

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:40.772
with that opportunity both on
the continent and also here?

00:47:40.772 --> 00:47:41.730
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO: Yeah.

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:45.510
I think that's a huge thing
because the diaspora is so big.

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:48.300
Are you asking specifically
about in winter sports

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:49.770
or just in general
connecting them?

00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:50.603
SPEAKER: In general.

00:47:50.603 --> 00:47:52.680
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO: Yeah,
I don't know the answer

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:54.400
to that-- the best
answer to that.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.720
But I definitely see
that it needs to happen.

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:00.480
A couple of years ago, I went
to the Harvard Business School

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.440
Africa Business Conference.

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:06.300
And they had a ton of people,
mostly from the diaspora,

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:09.600
talking about some of
these topics of what's

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.780
happening on the continent.

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:12.297
How we can shift the narrative.

00:48:12.297 --> 00:48:14.130
And I thought it was a
lot of good dialogue.

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:17.070
But I thought what was
missing was connecting it back

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:19.590
to those that are
actually in Africa.

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:23.290
I happened to have traveled
there from Johannesburg.

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:25.600
But outside of me,
I don't think there

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:28.650
were many people who were
coming from Africa to attend

00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:30.040
that conference.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:33.060
So I think there definitely
needs to be those spaces.

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:35.640
And maybe digital--
we are at Google--

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:39.070
is the space to find
those connections.

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:42.450
Because obviously physical
is not always feasible

00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:44.580
for different reasons.

00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:46.080
But I think the
more and more we can

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:50.610
have those opportunities to
connect, the better that we can

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:52.800
lift and elevate
Africa, as a whole,

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.560
whether you're in the
diaspora or actually

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.210
living on the continent.

00:48:57.210 --> 00:48:58.037
So--

00:48:58.037 --> 00:48:58.870
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:00.370
SPEAKER: And so for
those of us that

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:04.450
want to continue following
your story, like, what's

00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:06.960
the website, social media?

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.250
Like, what's the best way?

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:08.580
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO:
Thank you, because I

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:09.900
did forget to put it on here.

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:16.410
So all my handles are
SimiSleighs, S-I-M-I.

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:20.868
And then I spell
sleighs, S-L-E-I-G-H-S.

00:49:20.868 --> 00:49:22.660
That's the way you do
sleighs in the sport.

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:23.610
SPEAKER: Santa.

00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:26.050
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO:
Yes, like Santa.

00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:30.890
So SimiSleighs.com and then all
Instagram, Twitter, Facebook,

00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:32.310
is @SimiSleighs.

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:33.920
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:39.590
And request-- a slightly
selfish request for me is it's

00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:42.860
possible to buy, you
know, LeBron jerseys

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:46.190
and such in women's
sizes, it's not

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:51.740
as easy to buy, like, say, you
know, Rapinoe jerseys or Simi

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:53.400
jerseys in men's sizes.

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:59.690
So when you get back
to Nike, if you could

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:01.220
put that little request in.

00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:02.905
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO:
We'll put the word in.

00:50:02.905 --> 00:50:03.697
SPEAKER: I'm a 2XL.

00:50:03.697 --> 00:50:04.838
[LAUGHING]

00:50:04.838 --> 00:50:06.880
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO: We've
got to get you on a sled,

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.690
though, first.

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:08.190
SPEAKER: Oh.

00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:09.410
Oh.

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:11.190
It might-- it might--
it might break.

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:12.680
How thick is the ice?

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:15.620
How thick is the ice?

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:16.980
Thank you so much.

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.930
This has been fascinating.

00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:22.550
And you know, we've really
enjoyed watching your story

00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:26.600
and hearing about how we can
kind of think about changing

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:29.510
the narrative in our own lives.

00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:32.120
You've done it in several
different contexts.

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:34.820
And I think it's
something that all of us

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:36.180
are trying to do here, as well.

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:38.143
So that's-- this has
really been great.

00:50:38.143 --> 00:50:39.310
SIMIDELE ADEAGBO: Thank you.

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:40.310
Thank you for having me.

00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:43.860
[APPLAUSE]
