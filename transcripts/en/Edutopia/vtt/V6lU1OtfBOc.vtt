00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:01.056
-

00:00:01.056 --> 00:00:04.206
&gt;&gt;Tina: My role in this project
is creating the prefabricated

00:00:04.206 --> 00:00:05.046
building walls.

00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:08.726
&gt;&gt;Brittany: I've been working with
the business aspect of the project.

00:00:08.726 --> 00:00:11.846
&gt;&gt;Fabiana: I was in charge of
working on the water management.

00:00:11.846 --> 00:00:13.400
&gt;&gt;Alasanne: My roles in
this project is based

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.076
on the energy system for the house.

00:00:18.696 --> 00:00:22.426
&gt;&gt;Simon: Some kids take real
pride in having a 98 in red ink

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.396
with a smiley face
on a piece of paper.

00:00:25.416 --> 00:00:27.606
But most of us, when you
think back to high school,

00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:29.736
the things you remember
are not that test.

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:31.626
It's something real that you did.

00:00:31.956 --> 00:00:35.186
And our question is, why
can't school be based on that?

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:39.426
&gt;&gt;You've got one, two,
three, four, five, six,

00:00:39.646 --> 00:00:42.486
seven boards that you need
to cut to make a wall.

00:00:43.556 --> 00:00:46.556
Let's figure out, how long do we need
to cut all your two by fours, right?

00:00:46.706 --> 00:00:46.946
&gt;&gt;Student: Mm-hmm.

00:00:47.186 --> 00:00:49.426
&gt;&gt;Simon: The sustainability
workshop is a school program,

00:00:49.426 --> 00:00:52.276
it's a high school program
for high school seniors.

00:00:52.376 --> 00:00:56.366
The idea behind the program is that
students can actually learn more

00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:57.786
by doing real world projects.

00:01:03.186 --> 00:01:05.866
&gt;&gt;The big question that you always
get is, how are students going

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.776
to learn to read and do math if
they're working on projects all day?

00:01:09.346 --> 00:01:12.386
And we thought the best
way to show people was

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:14.536
to create this pilot program

00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:16.876
and demonstrate what it
looks like and feels like.

00:01:24.306 --> 00:01:27.376
&gt;&gt;It's called Land Rafts and it's
a high efficiency, modular home.

00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:30.936
These modular homes will be packaged
in a reused shipping container.

00:01:30.936 --> 00:01:33.196
&gt;&gt;Inside the shipping container,

00:01:33.196 --> 00:01:36.276
it is packed with composting
toilet, solar panels...

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:38.536
&gt;&gt;Prefabricated walls, battery packs.

00:01:38.796 --> 00:01:41.886
&gt;&gt;A water kit system, energy system.

00:01:41.886 --> 00:01:47.276
&gt;&gt;Basically, Land Raft is one package
that provides everything you need.

00:01:48.036 --> 00:01:50.736
&gt;&gt;And this is to be deployed
in disastrous areas like Haiti.

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:53.406
&gt;&gt;Once it gets over there, they
will be able to pull it out

00:01:53.406 --> 00:01:55.946
and put all the systems
together within two days.

00:01:55.946 --> 00:01:58.436
&gt;&gt;Alasanne: Yeah, let's
bring all the other end too.

00:01:59.226 --> 00:02:02.986
&gt;&gt;Simon: The students did a
tremendous amount of research

00:02:02.986 --> 00:02:05.326
on Haiti, natural disasters.

00:02:05.326 --> 00:02:08.066
A part of it that was
thrilling for me was this idea

00:02:08.546 --> 00:02:13.036
that developing countries don't have
access to the sustainable technology.

00:02:13.226 --> 00:02:16.256
When natural disasters occur in
these countries, there's this inrush

00:02:16.316 --> 00:02:21.056
of money to address recovery
and wouldn't it be cool to use

00:02:21.156 --> 00:02:25.226
that as a mechanism to deploy
these high efficiency, small homes?

00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:27.316
&gt;&gt;To the best of our
ability, we need to make sure

00:02:27.316 --> 00:02:28.536
that these are square, right?

00:02:28.716 --> 00:02:32.236
Right now, look, this is
turned this way slightly.

00:02:32.606 --> 00:02:35.366
&gt;&gt;They developed a business
plan and a technical report,

00:02:35.626 --> 00:02:39.016
what kind of sustainable materials,
energy capture, water capture.

00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:41.796
And so the research, the
science, the math and the kind

00:02:41.856 --> 00:02:44.966
of research abilities that
they developed were impressive.

00:02:45.256 --> 00:02:46.586
&gt;&gt;Tina: Okay, let's go back
in the shipping container

00:02:46.586 --> 00:02:50.156
and see how much space we'll have,
if we do it like vertical wise

00:02:50.156 --> 00:02:52.556
and horizontal wise, you
know what I'm saying?

00:02:52.556 --> 00:02:55.456
&gt;&gt;Tina: My role in this project is
creating the prefabricated building

00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:57.626
walls that can be fit inside
the shipping container.

00:02:57.626 --> 00:02:58.966
&gt;&gt;There are going to be three here,

00:02:59.016 --> 00:03:00.076
three panels here and
two panels here.

00:03:00.626 --> 00:03:03.696
&gt;&gt;So we're creating about
eight panels for the walls,

00:03:03.696 --> 00:03:05.966
eight panels for the ceilings
and four panels for the flooring.

00:03:06.466 --> 00:03:11.516
&gt;&gt;Man: So here is the big question:
how do we get potential customers?

00:03:11.606 --> 00:03:14.946
&gt;&gt;Brittany: I've been working with
the business aspect of the project,

00:03:14.946 --> 00:03:18.006
basically trying to translate
the whole technical idea

00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:21.286
and the good idea into
a real world project.

00:03:21.456 --> 00:03:26.006
&gt;&gt;It has potential to rebuild
communities efficiently, so...

00:03:26.216 --> 00:03:29.346
&gt;&gt;Man: Yeah, this is long term, this
is permanent, this is sustainable.

00:03:29.636 --> 00:03:32.296
&gt;&gt;Brittany: So I've been looking
into where does the money go

00:03:32.296 --> 00:03:35.066
and how does Land Rafts
fit into budgets

00:03:35.066 --> 00:03:37.556
of nongovernmental organizations?

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:41.106
&gt;&gt;Sagar: So basically, I click on it
which will take me to other window

00:03:41.106 --> 00:03:44.366
and then I can just go to sketch.

00:03:44.486 --> 00:03:46.816
&gt;&gt;The part that I'm working

00:03:46.816 --> 00:03:49.146
on with the Land Raft is
designing the whole structure

00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:51.026
of the modular home on 3D AutoCAD,

00:03:51.496 --> 00:03:53.596
and making an earthquake-proof
foundation.

00:03:53.826 --> 00:03:58.116
&gt;&gt;We put the foundation and then
the flooring, then the walls.

00:03:58.566 --> 00:04:03.396
&gt;&gt;I'm the kind of guy who likes to
work on graphics and stuff like that,

00:04:03.396 --> 00:04:06.016
so I thought if I'm in this
project, I have to like,

00:04:06.016 --> 00:04:09.106
I'm going to use the 3D AutoCAD
a lot, which I like to do.

00:04:09.266 --> 00:04:12.176
&gt;&gt;Alasanne: We tried to test
the solar panels by putting five

00:04:12.176 --> 00:04:15.676
of them together and put them
at the forty-five degree angle.

00:04:15.926 --> 00:04:21.116
&gt;&gt;My roles in this project is based
on the energy system for the house.

00:04:21.586 --> 00:04:25.476
&gt;&gt;This is where we were trying to
put the batteries and on this...

00:04:25.476 --> 00:04:28.076
&gt;&gt;So we're using solar
panels that will be mounted

00:04:28.076 --> 00:04:29.626
on the roof of the container.

00:04:29.926 --> 00:04:32.256
We're also using twenty batteries

00:04:32.396 --> 00:04:36.656
and the batteries' input will
be twenty kilowatts an hour.

00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:49.126
&gt;&gt;Student: Your right
hand up, there you go.

00:04:50.366 --> 00:04:50.666
&gt;&gt;No.

00:04:50.896 --> 00:04:51.626
&gt;&gt;Yeah, that's right.

00:04:51.716 --> 00:04:52.166
&gt;&gt;That's it.

00:04:52.266 --> 00:04:52.746
&gt;&gt;That's correct.

00:04:53.066 --> 00:04:54.636
&gt;&gt;Simon: The process of trying

00:04:54.636 --> 00:04:57.436
to solve a problem is what
we're really after, right?

00:04:57.596 --> 00:04:59.486
The solution doesn't
even really matter.

00:04:59.906 --> 00:05:02.966
It's the fact that students are
struggling with real information.

00:05:03.126 --> 00:05:04.946
They're taking ownership,
they're engaged.

00:05:05.076 --> 00:05:07.726
And then the amount of
intellectual work that has to occur

00:05:07.796 --> 00:05:12.646
to build an electric car or create a
Land Raft or create a business plan

00:05:12.916 --> 00:05:15.276
that solves a lighting
problem is tremendous.

00:05:15.666 --> 00:05:16.236
&gt;&gt;Student: All push.

00:05:16.346 --> 00:05:20.166
Lift your hand, in the bottom.

00:05:20.846 --> 00:05:21.236
&gt;&gt;Simon: Hold on.

00:05:21.676 --> 00:05:22.176
&gt;&gt;William: A program

00:05:22.176 --> 00:05:25.296
like Sustainability Workshop
is really important for us

00:05:25.296 --> 00:05:28.436
as a school district, because
if you think about the skills

00:05:28.436 --> 00:05:31.556
that our children need in
order to be competitive,

00:05:32.046 --> 00:05:38.446
skills like problem solving, critical
thinking, collaboration, innovation,

00:05:39.016 --> 00:05:43.136
then Sustainability workshop
provides those types of experiences.

00:05:43.136 --> 00:05:49.056
And not only are they taking on
tough and challenging world problems,

00:05:49.306 --> 00:05:54.066
there's been a tremendous amount
of learning that has taken place.

00:05:54.386 --> 00:05:58.346
&gt;&gt;Simon: A lot of the school day in
a typical urban school is "Sit down,

00:05:58.346 --> 00:06:00.676
be quiet, take your hat off,
put your cell phone away."

00:06:01.456 --> 00:06:04.156
Here it's, "Why is that?

00:06:04.336 --> 00:06:05.566
Why isn't that working?"

00:06:05.606 --> 00:06:07.936
or "Why are you getting frustrated?"

00:06:07.936 --> 00:06:11.056
And even the difficult
conversations are conversations

00:06:11.056 --> 00:06:14.926
around stuff that's real,
instead of, "Behave,

00:06:15.086 --> 00:06:16.726
please fall in line, comply."

00:06:17.036 --> 00:06:22.616
&gt;&gt;That's one of the things I
think this process allows for,

00:06:22.836 --> 00:06:25.166
and teachers that thrive
in it do really well,

00:06:25.166 --> 00:06:26.946
is we see the best in these students.

00:06:26.946 --> 00:06:29.086
We see the potential they
have, we really see it,

00:06:29.086 --> 00:06:32.336
and it's not like I've got
high expectations for Johnny

00:06:32.336 --> 00:06:33.336
and he's going to live up to them.

00:06:33.336 --> 00:06:36.526
It's, "I know that you can do
this and we're here to work

00:06:36.526 --> 00:06:38.186
on this together and
let's get it done."

00:06:38.396 --> 00:06:40.606
&gt;&gt;All: One, two, three, Workshop!

00:06:40.736 --> 00:06:43.000
All right [laughter].
