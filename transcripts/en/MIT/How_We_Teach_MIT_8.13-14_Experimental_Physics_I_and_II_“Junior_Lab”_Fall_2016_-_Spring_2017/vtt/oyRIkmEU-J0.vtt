GUNTHER ROLAND: So over
the last few, last couple

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.360
of years, Sean Robinson and
I have made a few changes

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.650
to the 8.14 curriculum to
really are differentiate it more

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:21.430
from 8.13 But I mean, a change
that happened a number of years

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.980
ago, five years ago, was
sort of the introduction

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.970
of this exploratory project.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.420
But then in the last few
years, what we decided to do

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.229
was add yet another
communication component,

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.260
namely, the poster session.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.750
As the students move
on to graduate school,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.530
posters are one of the
communication forms

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.080
they will have to use at
conferences, et cetera.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.890
And I think, like for the
papers and the presentations

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.370
in 8.13, the
poster, I mean, when

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.770
you have to start for the
first time with a blank slate,

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.130
I think it is very different
to find the appropriate form.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.290
So we thought it would be very
good to practice that in 8.14.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.040
And the reason we made this
change is that 8.14 competes

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.650
for the students' time with
many other things they can do,

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.960
including taking UROPs,
which they feel, correctly,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.970
are important for
their future career.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.130
And we felt that we need
to revamp 8.14 a little bit

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.440
to really make it worth
the students' time,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.655
to give them something
on which they

00:01:22.655 --> 00:01:24.580
can build for their
graduate school

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.750
applications and their
work as graduate students.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.980
And I think many of the--

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.070
essentially, all of the students
that take 8.14 in the end,

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.090
move on to graduate
school in physics.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.600
And the new components, I
think, really help them,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.260
in both rounding out
their application

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.800
and in developing some tools
that they will use later

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.040
on as graduate students.
