1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,630
You are listening to
radiolab radio from W N Y s.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,913
C

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,730
hey man, how are ya? Very well. So
Aaron set this up. Who we about to meet?

4
00:00:15,731 --> 00:00:18,730
So this is skip Sherry. He
lived in Brooklyn and that is,

5
00:00:18,731 --> 00:00:20,530
we should say Aaron
Scott, he's a reporter.

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,780
We turned us on to skip and Aaron met up.

7
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:26,980
Was skipped because he had this experience
that common to a lot of people who

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,400
moved to New York City. Just tell
us where you, where you grew up.

9
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,340
I grew up in the country
outside of Athens,

10
00:00:33,341 --> 00:00:38,341
Ohio on 54 acres of wooded land and I
would work all day as a kid in the heat

11
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,520
hoeing and picking strawberries,
hauling water, planting trees.

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,280
He'd play in the woods. I loved the woods,

13
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,420
but as he got older he knew he
couldn't stay in Athens. Why not? Well,

14
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,940
he's a musician. He wanted
to make a living at it.

15
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,770
So he bounced around for a bit.

16
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:58,510
I finally find them finally at age 30
there was no place to go except for New

17
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,210
York's. It wasn't a matter that
you wanted to live in New York,

18
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,890
New York was your last, my
last option and he hated it.

19
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:09,640
It was ugly to me. You know,
like, like which too many humans.

20
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:14,450
Too many. Too much concrete. Yeah. No.

21
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,970
One theory about autism is that the things
that come into an autistic kids brain

22
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,150
all have equal value. They don't
know how to sort through it.

23
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,850
And when I first came to New
Yorker was, it was really,

24
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,100
it is pretty overwhelming.

25
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,900
I did decide to leave for sure,
but then take us to the roof.

26
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,630
I was lucky when I first moved here,

27
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,560
so he's staying with a friend who lives
in this big building in Brooklyn Heights

28
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,240
right across from the twin towers.

29
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,520
It is 36 stories high and he decides
one lonely night to go up onto the roof.

30
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,980
And there was this intense fog

31
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:56,880
[inaudible]

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,420
in the twin towers. The bottom of them
was covering the fog but not the top.

33
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,590
So it was like they were flooding.

34
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:07,660
There's little like a cuticle sliver
of moon in the sky and the foghorns are

35
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:09,710
going in. The boats are slowly moving

36
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:12,540
[inaudible]

37
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,080
and there's this Rees and I had this,

38
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:20,010
this brass penny wasn't that my father
had given me and I was standing there.

39
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:24,480
I was playing it and that I was really
suddenly something clicked. I was like,

40
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,230
oh, that must, those are all the bridges.

41
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:30,880
That's the Williamsburg Bridge.
That's the Manhattan bridge.

42
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:35,500
There's the Brooklyn Bridge
that New York, it's small now.

43
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:37,850
[inaudible]

44
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,940
and I'm looking down at the Statue
of Liberty and my grandmother,

45
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,200
Anastasia Patty came from Albania
and they went to Ellis island.

46
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,370
I could see my history there too and I
was suddenly hit me like, oh my goodness,

47
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,550
this is like a coral reef.
You can't see the people,

48
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,130
but look at this beautiful strip

49
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,880
fog in the air.

50
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,240
It was just the whole city was breathing
[inaudible] the whole nature was

51
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,890
beating. Everything was
[inaudible] breathing.

52
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,360
I felt connected on a spiritual
level to the city for the first time.

53
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,170
[inaudible]

54
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,820
and so skip decided to stay for awhile,

55
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,160
for awhile. All over the
world. People are now moving.

56
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:33,190
Of course we know this from the
country to the city at this point,

57
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:37,510
the world two years ago across
this extraordinary benchmark.

58
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,800
That's physicist Geoff West.

59
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,930
We're more than half of the planet is
now urbanized 51% and that made us wonder

60
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,420
how do cities work?

61
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,480
Is there some deep organic logic that
holds all these people together or is

62
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,820
writer general era puts it or cities,

63
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:57,340
just these tumors that
people on the landscape

64
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,580
[inaudible]

65
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,390
I'm Janna. Boom, Ron. I'm Robert Krulwich.

66
00:04:03,391 --> 00:04:05,280
This is radio lab and our topic today,

67
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,700
cities, cities. I loved
it, but I don't know why

68
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,483
[inaudible].

69
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,780
All right. So in talking about cities,

70
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:28,050
it's Kinda hard to know where to start
because every city has its own DNA,

71
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,160
kind of its own unique feel.

72
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,133
Yeah.

73
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,380
Like for instance, let me just give
you my own stupid example here.

74
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:41,680
So every time I go to St Louis to visit
my mom, yeah, I'm gay, I'm on the plane.

75
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,180
I mean my own kind of groove and I step
off the plane into the airport and it's

76
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:51,181
just like with the first step you just
hit this wall of something is different.

77
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:57,100
Like you feel the difference in your
bone because let's the question I,

78
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,340
is he there? Right. I'm here.
What gives the city its feel?

79
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,130
Oh is this Mr Bob Levine?
This is Mr Rob Levin.

80
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,300
Mr Bob Levine is a professor of
psychology, California State University.

81
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,240
And he thinks the answer to
that question is time. Time.

82
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,000
Did each city warps time
in its own unique way?

83
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,340
Why should these are my subjects? No,

84
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,920
he studied this idea for the past 30
years in all kinds of different ways.

85
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:21,370
We looked at things like a
percentage of people wearing watches.

86
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,660
How long does it take bank tellers in
each city to change a $20 bill? Really?

87
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:30,130
Yeah. And then we, we, we looked
at talking speed. Hawkings yeah.

88
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,280
We'd get on the phone and uh,

89
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,070
called post offices since that seemed
like something that would be available

90
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:38,770
every place and make a standard request.

91
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,000
What'd you tell me the difference
between regular mail certified mail and

92
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:46,780
insured mail. Okay. Certified is when
you just need someone to sign for it.

93
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,010
Then he says they'd calculate the
number of syllables per second

94
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,070
regular mail. Just close your
mail. You know at the out of Utah,

95
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,270
Salt Lake City, Utah,
2.73 syllables per second.

96
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,130
Then if you want bootcamp
receipt car to come back

97
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,640
to your house, Springfield
mass time on the phone.

98
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,880
Yes, 3.4 or five syllables per second and

99
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,870
certified is when you want,

100
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,850
not really sure where it's from because
the tape lost the id but it could be

101
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:12,684
Nashville,

102
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,010
her failing and nick would want to
know who you want to return more three

103
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,340
and if it is Nashville, 2.65 syllables

104
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,290
low. Well Springfield is like fume,

105
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,730
but the whole talking thing was
just really a prelude for Bob.

106
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,820
It got him into what he,

107
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:31,110
I think he's most known for and
what we find most fascinating. Uh,

108
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,440
we actually looked up at
walking speed walking.

109
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,420
Yeah. Well what I would do is I would
get into a new city. I am in Mumbai,

110
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,960
India, Jerusalem, [inaudible]
Chiang Mai, Thailand.

111
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,020
We actually put out a call to
radio lab listeners everywhere.

112
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,290
We in Buchanan in Liberia to
help us repeat the study. Hey,

113
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:53,010
good morning Radiolab. I'm recording
from Dublin in Ireland, downtown Oslo,

114
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:56,340
Copenhagen. Why are we getting
to a new city? And step one,

115
00:06:56,341 --> 00:06:59,150
I would scope out main
business and shopping near

116
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,580
[inaudible] street step to get
out some street or roll of screen.

117
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,890
I red strings, 60 feet long.

118
00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:10,890
20 meters means over here we
wouldn't say feed really. Step three,

119
00:07:10,891 --> 00:07:12,760
use that string to
measure out the distance.

120
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,280
You just have to roll out this and you
take the one end to the sidewalk and I

121
00:07:17,281 --> 00:07:20,690
would just make a mark step four and go
under covers. Get into Carter and uh,

122
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,540
it'd be cool, you know, act like you're
reading a paper or waiting for somebody.

123
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,830
Alright, found myself a discrete
place. Found a pretty nice spot here.

124
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,040
You use a stopwatch? I would
use a stopwatch. Stopwatch.

125
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:37,470
It's trusty beef watches working.
Ready? Oh, you're ready? Boots. Okay,

126
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,633
I'm ready.

127
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,163
Wow.

128
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,060
I don't know what goes quiet the
minute I want to start. Brilliant text.

129
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,750
Delvin this experiment was actually harder
than you would think. I love people.

130
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:54,110
This is not very easy to
do. Timing was an issue.

131
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,290
People trying to sell you stuff. Oh
No, no. I don't need this too shy.

132
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,060
Betty Boucher. I look in my corner. I
just don't, can't, no patients don't care.

133
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,073
Okay.

134
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,530
Are you ready? Boom. All together. Now,

135
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,400
Doug Walks. Step, step, step, step, step,

136
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,600
step, step, step.

137
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,440
Actually, it didn't sound like
that at all. They weren't in sync.

138
00:08:17,441 --> 00:08:21,540
As you can imagine, every
city had its own beat guard

139
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,540
snippets. Yes, yes, yes,
yes, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep,

140
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,290
Yep. Which on some level we knew still

141
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:35,620
change was pretty amazing. Stop.
Tough line to Oslo. 14.4 seconds.

142
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,800
27 seconds. You Canon, Liberia. Wow.

143
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,780
So team 0.8 Wayne is
Eris 12.13 Mexico City,

144
00:08:43,781 --> 00:08:47,780
10.1 seconds. Copenhagen,
21.5 seconds. Yeah.

145
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,850
Nine 11.57 Portland thing and
a half seconds. Jerusalem.

146
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,640
Just to break it down on the
high end, you've got steps,

147
00:08:54,641 --> 00:08:56,010
steps you're on it's step, step,

148
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,070
step, step. That [inaudible] steps.

149
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,380
She was 9.5 and that's 10.4 who take on
average 10.76 seconds to cover 60 feet.

150
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,490
Compare that to Buchanan.
Liberia step, step, step,

151
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,790
step, step, step. Let's get around
something that actually own the head.

152
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,950
So you've got a teen pink blouse whose
walkers covered the same distance in

153
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:19,590
about 21 seconds, 21 seconds.

154
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:21,270
So if you want to think
about it in football terms,

155
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,830
by the time the Dubliner has scored
a touchdown, the gripe from you,

156
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,350
Kevin Lay Bierria is somewhere I guess
around midfield like in this spooky thing

157
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,280
according to Bob Levine is if you
do these under the same conditions,

158
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,600
same place, you will get the same time.

159
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:39,420
These times don't change.

160
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,710
Dublin is always about this steps you're
on. It's step, step, step and Buchanan.

161
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:47,760
Liberia is always around
this yet step, step,

162
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,550
step Manhattan is we
found is right about here.

163
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,240
And usually that step with
thunders step, step, step in pink,

164
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,370
no Dublin but not bad. But why
the consistency, what is it?

165
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,160
What is it that makes that walking speed?

166
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,540
Yeah. Where does it come from? You know,

167
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,360
I mean there's anybody beating the drum.

168
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,580
How well can you change the walking speed?

169
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,870
Say a bunch of us got together and decided
that we were just gonna up it by 5%

170
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:16,120
on a given day. Will we
get everybody to do it?

171
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,540
And will they even notice the
difference? Do we make the city

172
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,520
or just the city? Make us

173
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,860
thank you to our blockers.
[inaudible] who's the faculty?

174
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:33,390
Liberia. Jerusalem. Eric. Killer
man. And Copenhagen went to Oslo.

175
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:38,700
Scott, Portland, Oregon. Harry Sante
Nacho. Thailand. [inaudible]. Yes.

176
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,920
Go City [inaudible] in Mumbai. Mark.

177
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,630
I'm Nolan. I'm Dublin in Ireland.

178
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,480
Perhaps also to Daniel Estrin
and an assessment. I don't know,

179
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,360
cause they didn't, they didn't say their
name. Put them in there. Okay. Okay.

180
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:53,460
So getting back to that
question I asked a second ago,

181
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,840
why is it that cities develop
particular be yes. I mean,

182
00:10:57,841 --> 00:11:02,010
is it because the city does it to the
people or the people do it to the city?

183
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:05,610
Yeah. And we ran into a couple
of guys who may be released,

184
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:09,930
have the start of an answer.
Yes. No, a couple of physicists,

185
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,990
oddly enough high named
Jeffrey West and Leash Benton.

186
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,110
This is Jeffery and there's Lewis on
the other side of the table. Cool.

187
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:21,340
Here at the Santa Fe Institute in New
Mexico and lots of bases and stuff.

188
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,430
Nothing like the cities we just visited.
It's almost biblical in its expanse.

189
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:28,281
Yeah,

190
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:32,060
but blue skies just sort of make you
brave and potassium and all those good

191
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:36,690
things. Brave enough. In fact, to
claim from their high desert Birch,

192
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,900
that eas beats the meter of every city
that we've just been to actually has

193
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:46,190
underneath it a kind of logic,

194
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:51,340
if you told me the average speed of
walking in some city x or Rochester New

195
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:52,821
York,

196
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:57,821
where walk at about this 60 feet
and 12.67 seconds different,

197
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,110
don't tell him Rochester.

198
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:04,111
You just tell him the number of beats and
we'll tell you the population is maybe

199
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,110
one and a quarter billion
people, actual population,

200
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,200
1.0 3 million people and the average
weight for about $16,000 a year.

201
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:20,200
Actual average wage, $15,588 wow.

202
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,530
But let me ask you a precise question.

203
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,450
Are you 100% correct? Are
you pursuing some things?

204
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:30,940
You will score close to a
hundred percent other things, 80%

205
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,930
but if you start with just the
number of footfalls per unit of time,

206
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:38,590
they can tell you all kinds of
other things about the same place.

207
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,880
I can tell you how much crime
there is in the city. Income wages,

208
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:46,960
GDP number college's restaurants,
[inaudible], restaurants, theaters,

209
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,520
police number patents that are being
produced, cultural events per capita,

210
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,990
number of theater that libraries,

211
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,510
the number of aids cases
it's going to have this year.

212
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,610
All of these things are
correlated in a quantitative,

213
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,160
and I use the word predictive fashion.

214
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,141
Wait,

215
00:13:04,141 --> 00:13:07,740
are you saying that just from the number
of footsteps per given time that you

216
00:13:07,741 --> 00:13:10,800
can tell? Can you tell me how
many libraries there are? Yes.

217
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,450
Could tell me how many you should expect.

218
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:17,660
How many things can you count
when you're infinite number, but,

219
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,130
but it's limited by the things
for which there are data.

220
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,540
They've got data from the u s
census, that's Jonah Lehrer.

221
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:27,810
He's written about Luis and Jeff and
he's the one that Kinda got us thinking

222
00:13:27,811 --> 00:13:29,700
about all this paper from Japan,

223
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:33,690
China data from sociological
surveys on cell phones.

224
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,620
And when they put all these numbers
together, they discovered a deep pattern.

225
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,230
It's call comes from the flood zone,
not the footstep. What do you mean?

226
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,760
Having the footsteps are a reflection of
this deep and fundamental pattern that

227
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,000
governs everything. Just one fact.

228
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:52,290
What is it you really want to
know? Yeah. What is it? Size.

229
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,870
Size. How many people live there?

230
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,140
Size matters.

231
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,180
Size is the largest determinant of
all characteristics of the city,

232
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,470
right?

233
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,270
They would say, tell me
the size of the city,

234
00:14:03,271 --> 00:14:08,010
and I can explain the vast majority of
all these different variables that we can

235
00:14:08,011 --> 00:14:10,530
measure as a city scales up. They say

236
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,440
100,000 to 200,000 the million to 2
million from 5 million to 10 everything

237
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:20,830
about it. All those things that they'd
been measuring, they scale up too,

238
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:25,300
but they scale up according to a
very simple mathematical formula.

239
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,600
It does not matter that New York has big
skyscrapers and is on the ocean and the

240
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:36,530
Boise's in the rocky mountains that
San Francisco is on San Francisco Bay.

241
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,650
Wait a second. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait. That can't be. They can't be. I'll,

242
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,090
I was with you right up until
the last two. That last point.

243
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:48,091
I mean you go to the Midwest and it's
landlocked and then you go to a port city

244
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,290
and it's on a port. I mean
that's got to matter. It matters.

245
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:56,291
But these actually are superficial effects
and account for only 10 20% of their

246
00:14:57,081 --> 00:15:00,830
variation. What they're saying
is that those specificities, the,

247
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,760
the local history is in
large part insignificant,

248
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:10,030
but it is completely overwhelmed by
these generic laws of urban scaling.

249
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,380
That to me is a very interesting and
surprising idea simply because we don't

250
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,050
think of cities like that at
all. No, we certainly do not.

251
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,490
That's because you're not a physicist.

252
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,240
So you don't think abstractly in
that we're guard. Well, why should I?

253
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,740
Because sometimes it can be very useful.

254
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:29,630
Remember what these guys have done is
they've just created eight average profile

255
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,040
for every size city. So if you're a
1 million or 7 million or 12 million,

256
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,210
here's how many things you should
have. Now you can ask, okay,

257
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,910
let's look specifically that city and ask,

258
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,550
is it overperforming or
underperforming? Right.

259
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,080
So what are some cities that are
over-performing for their size, uh,

260
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,360
of the largest cities? San Francisco
is quite an innovative city.

261
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,140
New York is about average
in terms of patents, terms,

262
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:57,170
New York's below average juices.

263
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,190
Roughly speaking the number of patents
it should for a size you produce for

264
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:05,600
example, a about uh, twice as
many patterns as Boston we do.

265
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,900
That's something you should have produced
many more given the size difference

266
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:15,800
between about what average could they'd
counting patents, I mean who may,

267
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:16,690
who do we don't have engine.

268
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,860
This is one of the problems
with their larger theory,

269
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:21,980
which is that no attention to that
they're relying on your data at the u s

270
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,190
census collected. So that's a real
blind spot. Counting fabulous.

271
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:28,670
If we ever can figure out a way to
account. Fabulous. Yes, he has a point.

272
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,640
You're not taking into account with it
actually the experience of living in a

273
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:33,490
place, well, what this one,

274
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:38,491
a theory cannot do is tell you
about the essence of New York,

275
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:40,790
the New York Ness of New York,

276
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,930
so to speak, the soul of the city.
And where does that come from?

277
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:51,450
Who knows? I mean, I think that's
such a broad question. Well,

278
00:16:51,451 --> 00:16:54,810
obviously it has something to do with
lots of people being jammed into a tight

279
00:16:54,811 --> 00:16:58,260
space environment, bumping into each
other, kind of people who moved there.

280
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,990
What the physicists we
call human friction.

281
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,080
And that's a story you can't really
tell in math. But yeah, you can hear it.

282
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,913
Take skip.

283
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:11,200
He gave producer Aaron Scott a
tour of his block in Brooklyn,

284
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,830
listen to who he pumps into everyday.
So he took us on this tour. Okay.

285
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:19,750
First place we went was this Jamaican
body shop. Body shop is in cars. Yeah.

286
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,750
Religion specialists. I mean
it's basically these, you know,

287
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,110
western, these Jamaican guys
listening to [inaudible]

288
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,000
and hip hop reggae.

289
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,010
I like all kinds of music.

290
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,930
It's like it's one place and a
cross across the street from this as

291
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,760
kindergarten, hidden orthodox
Jewish cookie bakery.

292
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,800
And, and I'm disappointed from
that. It's a butcher that, um,

293
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,160
sells live goats and chickens
and here are the goats.

294
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,810
And on the corner of

295
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,670
the Hispanic Pentecostal church,

296
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:08,080
every Sunday they give it up to God
with this exceedingly enthusiastic

297
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,970
[inaudible]. And I huddle at the window

298
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,570
and I think this is the
best music in the world.

299
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,130
I feel that deeply.

300
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,020
And then across the street
from that one is a mosque.

301
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,360
Whoa. Whoa.

302
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,780
It was beautiful on the inside. Wow.

303
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,150
Across the street there's
this big building and the
proprietor of this space is

304
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:53,070
a gay foot fetish film producer.
Show me your feet. Show me your feet.

305
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,010
Two 80 something. He's got Jamaicans,

306
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,430
orthodox Jews and the cookies.
Hispanics, Jesus, Allah,

307
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,160
goats in gay porn. Show me your
feet all on the same block.

308
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:12,480
Absolutely. For me, that's the hammer.
The nails. That's the wrong gradients.

309
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,210
Now I'm gonna take that home and
I'm gonna Assemble it into a song.

310
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,940
And when you heard his music,
could you hear all that stuff?

311
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,100
Some of it is clear than others.

312
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:25,900
[inaudible]

313
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,420
the sounds of the neighborhood, like
the reggaeton music of the West indies,

314
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:31,560
auto body shops.

315
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:36,660
He kind of takes them and then filters
it through some device that makes it

316
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:38,120
sound like vowels.

317
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,293
[inaudible].

318
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:47,911
Oddly enough,

319
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:51,930
the day that Aaron spoke with skip was
the day skip decided he's leaving New

320
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:55,470
York City and he put in his notice,
which I guess makes his latest album,

321
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,340
sonic New York, kind of a
dear John Letter to the city.

322

for one about walking and time and stuff.

324
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,710
Yeah, it's called the geography of time.

325

Hey, this is jad from
Radiolab. We're having a, uh,

341
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,960
we're celebrating a little
milestone over here at radio lab.

342
00:20:59,961 --> 00:21:02,720
We have been doing this, we're
making stories for the podcast,

343
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:07,721
for the radio for 15 years at is
15 years of stories about like,

344
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,010
um, I don't know, the science of morality,
the metamorphosis of butterflies,

345
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,430
legal foundation for the war on
terror. All these different stories.

346
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,080
I've been doing it for 15 years.

347
00:21:18,081 --> 00:21:22,760
So check out our latest episode out of
the archives and all of our episodes are

348
00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:24,590
available wherever you get your podcasts.

349
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,020
Hey, I'm Janet [inaudible].
I'm Robert Krulwich.

350
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,470
This is Radiolab and our
subject right now is cities.

351
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,700
So far we've tried to pin down the
character of a place with math or with a

352
00:21:38,701 --> 00:21:40,590
story or with some music.

353
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:42,690
Woo.

354
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:47,100
But it's like trying to take a snapshot
of something that's growing and changing

355
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,770
all the time. And that
feeling that skip had

356
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,850
up on the rooftop, like
the city with breathing.

357
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,930
Maybe the city really
is like a living thing.

358
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:02,180
Well, yes, in some ways that's
exactly right. The evolve, the grow.

359
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:06,730
Think about it as Jeff West, every
day, every minute, incomes, energy,

360
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,350
food, trucks, water people
out goes garbage ideas,

361
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:16,310
songs, stories, people,
energy in, energy out, energy,

362
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:17,680
energy, Huh?

363
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,600
That's just what a city
needs to do. Sit Jeff

364
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:23,480
quote, metabolize food, so
to speak, cause without that,

365
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:27,650
organisms and cities and
so on will simply decay.

366
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,500
So how does a city stay a lot?

367
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:33,140
What does it really
take for a city to grow?

368
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,400
Well that question got me
thinking about New York and led me

369
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,410
to a place I'd been
wanting to go for awhile.

370
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,023
Thank you.

371
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,240
[inaudible] I think you're
the reverb a little bit.

372
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:54,180
Where are you underground?
Oh, a hundred feet under

373
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,623
brown.

374
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,690
So this is the sound of one of
New York City's water tunnels.

375
00:23:01,691 --> 00:23:06,400
I'm standing in it. It's exactly
what you would imagine. A big tube.

376
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,070
It's about nine feet wide, nine feet up,

377
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:14,360
perfectly polished cement. And uh,

378
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,060
it seems to just go forever.

379
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,680
So this is basically a,

380
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,530
like you might call a smaller artery
inside the city's circulatory system.

381
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,570
When this is online in a couple of months,

382
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:30,740
it will pump up to 290
million gallons a day,

383
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,713
something like that,

384
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:41,240
which is an awesome thought in the
literal sense of the word. It's uh,

385
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,970
when you walk through the streets in
Manhattan, this is Catherine Mallon,

386
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,430
the Department of environmental

387
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:46,880
protection.

388
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,540
These water tunnels are anywhere
from 200 to 800 feet below your feet.

389
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,780
They just there and they're silently
there. And when you turn on your tap,

390
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,893
can you take a drink?

391
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,320
You are basking in a daily
convenience that is born from blood,

392
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,930
sweat and death.

393
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,680
To explain, you really have to go back
to a time when there were no tunnels.

394
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,370
Success would be uh,

395
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:18,420
1790 1800 or so around that time says
historian Diane Galicia in New York's

396
00:24:18,551 --> 00:24:22,600
population was booming,
tripled and 20 years.

397
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,680
And you suddenly had a 100,000 people
all getting their water from the same

398
00:24:26,681 --> 00:24:29,830
spot. A large freshwater
pond called the collect.

399
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,820
And they had pigs running around by the
hundreds and the chamber pots out in the

400
00:24:33,821 --> 00:24:36,820
streets and there were livestock
and lower Manhattan at the time.

401
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,460
People had cows for milk.
And so when they died,

402
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:40,600
they had to do something with them.

403
00:24:40,601 --> 00:24:45,601
So often she says they'd throw their dead
cows and everything else in the pond,

404
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,500
the same pond that they were
drinking from right now,

405
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,330
not surprisingly, as the city grew,

406
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,930
people got sick in 1798 there
was this yellow fever epidemic,

407
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:03,220
killed a couple of thousand people and
cholera and typhoid city officials were

408
00:25:03,221 --> 00:25:05,430
like, this has to change. And uh,

409
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:10,030
as if to accentuate the point in 1835
there was this huge fire and the fire

410
00:25:10,031 --> 00:25:12,610
department rushes out to put
out the fire, but they can't.

411
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,630
It was in December and the rivers froze
and they couldn't get water to the

412
00:25:16,631 --> 00:25:21,010
fires. If you don't have water to
fight the fire, the city burns down.

413
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,350
It's pretty simple. Yeah. 700 buildings.

414
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,500
So that's our starting point in
New York City that could not grow.

415
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,020
And by the way, the guy we
just heard John Chick Donahue,

416
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:33,850
he's the sand dog part of the long line
of guys who blasted New York out of its

417
00:25:33,851 --> 00:25:38,250
poopy pon phase and into its
future. You ask the question why?

418
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,160
Why are you guys cold?

419
00:25:39,161 --> 00:25:44,161
Sandhogs why won't you be cold tunnel
blasters or earth movers or something

420
00:25:44,651 --> 00:25:47,410
that's more, do you have any idea
where that name came from? Yeah,

421
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:48,490
it comes from the dictionary

422
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,380
really and I loved the look in people's
faces when they asked me that and I,

423
00:25:53,381 --> 00:25:54,250
that's the answer.

424
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,290
It's described in Webster's dictionary
as a laborer who digs or works in sand

425
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:03,550
originals sandhogs with the
soft ground guys compressed air.

426
00:26:03,551 --> 00:26:05,380
That's where you need
to backup for a second.

427
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:10,120
When the city decided to scrap the pond
in favor of clean water from upstate,

428
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,880
it faced a couple of challenges
and this is also true.

429
00:26:12,881 --> 00:26:17,050
When they decided to build the subway
system, namely nature, like how do you,

430
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,120
for example, build a tunnel under a
river? Well, they was San hucks, Jamie.

431
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:22,954
Dan laid

432
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,950
literally Doug with what we call
muck sticks, shovels on the ribbon,

433
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:33,730
50 60 a hundred feet under the bottom
of the ribbon. Men with shovels,

434
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:38,050
excavating ground. That's Nick's
socal. I'm a tunneling engineer.

435
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,760
Generally it's a dark dank

436
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,910
please. Now the obvious engineering
problem is that the river bottom,

437
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:49,800
which is now above their heads is
soft sands and silts and gravels.

438
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,900
How do you keep that from
not falling on your head?

439
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:54,930
That's when a compressed
air started being used.

440
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:59,700
The basic idea says nick is these huge
pumps would basically pump air into the

441
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:04,380
tunnels at such pressure that it
would basically push the ceiling up.

442
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,090
Exactly. So the mind doesn't
cave in on you. Yeah,

443
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,660
it compressed their holes. That
thing from collapsing in on.

444
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,380
Usually the engineers on the shore had
to get the pressure just right says

445
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:19,710
chick. Cause if they didn't, you get
this absolutely terrifying situation.

446
00:27:19,711 --> 00:27:21,990
That is maybe the best
cocktail party story ever.

447
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,170
We used to give an award, we
haven't given it many years.

448
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,350
We call it the Marshall
may be award there.

449
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,400
We're doing one of those
tunnels to Brooklyn

450
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:33,590
[inaudible].

451
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:36,740
The men are weapon, the face
of the tunnel digging away

452
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,190
very suddenly.

453
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:44,360
There's a blowout in the face of the wall.
Puncture hole develops tiny at first,

454
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,840
but it quickly becomes bigger and bigger
until it's the size of sort of like an

455
00:27:47,841 --> 00:27:51,720
eye. Then a whole head and all the
compressed air rushes into that. Okay. Oh,

456
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:55,470
it would be like if you shot
a hole through an airplane.

457
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,900
All the air with shoal hats are flying
into this whole lanterns shovels.

458
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,560
Then a guy goes into the hole guy. Yeah,

459
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:07,380
a human being into the whole food
and another guy. Boom. Then a third,

460
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:09,960
the third guy must've been the
luckiest sand hog in the world.

461
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:13,320
This is an article from the New
York Times as I struck the mud.

462
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,440
It felt as if something was squeezing
me tighter than had ever been squeezed

463
00:28:18,441 --> 00:28:21,100
before. He blew through
all at 60 feet of water

464
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,790
and through the ribbon.

465
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,280
Yup.

466
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,420
To the surface. The pressure

467
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,450
blew him right up into the air.

468
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:35,700
You're telling me I was thrown about 25
feet above the water when I came out,

469
00:28:35,701 --> 00:28:39,470
but I don't remember that.
That's remarkable. Anything

470
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:45,900
back down and landed right alongside
a police boat in the one in the water.

471
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:52,030
So they took him, cleaned him up, he
went home, he came to work the next day.

472
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,680
That's why they gave him the
award. That's why the ward is now.

473
00:28:56,681 --> 00:28:57,514
I'm not kidding you.

474
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:02,691
In the early days,

475
00:29:02,691 --> 00:29:06,920
no one kept track of how many people
died building New York's tunnels the

476
00:29:06,921 --> 00:29:10,640
number. It's probably in the thousands.
So wait, this, this right here,

477
00:29:10,641 --> 00:29:13,520
this plaque that we're looking
at, this flack was a donated.

478
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,140
This is Richie fits in and
sees the current head of
the sandhogs union and we're

479
00:29:18,141 --> 00:29:20,950
standing in front of a big stone
plaque with two dozen names.

480
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,680
So your memory of all the, uh,

481
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,400
people that we lost in tunnels in
New York City since 1970, you know,

482
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:28,900
since we started keeping records,

483
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,300
small little photos. Come on here

484
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,490
later. He showed me a picture,
which really underlined the point.

485
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,810
It's a picture of him on his first
compressed air job. Oh Wow. Look at that.

486
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,380
This is myself. He's 19.

487
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:44,230
He's huddled with five other guys and
they're in this crowded tunnel and they're

488
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:47,650
all black was said, and he
points to each guy in turn

489
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:51,850
dead, dead, dead, dead,

490
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,180
had cancer still alive, still alive.

491
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,780
If you ask any of the
sandhogs why they do this,

492
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,520
mostly they'll tell you what we've got to.

493
00:30:01,521 --> 00:30:03,350
The city can't grow without its tunnels.

494
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,340
But you also get answers like
this from chick. If he says,

495
00:30:07,341 --> 00:30:10,530
when you're down there and it's pitch
black and you're just walking the wall.

496
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,880
Yeah, 600 foot under Manhattan,

497
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:16,070
you're approximately
30th screen or something.

498
00:30:16,071 --> 00:30:18,830
You're in the middle of the
greatest city in the world.

499
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:23,960
Nobody even knows you exist.
Nobody has it. Nobody has a clue.

500
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,753
It just

501
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,053
beautiful.

502
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:35,310
It's just that a, it's a weird place.
It's like being on a planet somewhere.

503
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,840
He says when he's literally in this
rock that is half a billion years old,

504
00:30:39,841 --> 00:30:41,010
he sometimes feels

505
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:43,803
very

506
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,700
humble. Yeah. We're in the middle
of the art then. Yeah. This is,

507
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:52,230
you want to see nature. If it is, that's
real, a romantic way of saying it.

508
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,520
Uh, the human reality of it
is, here's Richie's take.

509
00:30:57,521 --> 00:30:58,470
Remember when you were a kid,

510
00:30:58,471 --> 00:31:01,920
and I used to give you the an farms and
the [inaudible] and farms, we're big.

511
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,440
We are ants.

512
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:10,680
Aes is so fricking many of them
that if you got a squish a few,

513
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:14,540
and if they gotta use each other
to step over each other to, to, to,

514
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,530
to keep that whole thing, that's it.

515
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,500
That doesn't sound very grand the way
you're putting it. Like next reality,

516
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:23,850
our job is to conquer nature. He says,
plain and simple. We're builders.

517
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,950
Human beings are builders.

518
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:31,050
And collectively there's
nothing that we can do.

519
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,503
Nothing.

520
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:39,360
Okay.

521
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,070
October 14th, 1842, oh,
it was a huge celebration.

522
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,680
Hundreds of thousands of
New Yorkers Line Broadway.

523
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,840
It was firing of cannon and the
ringing a church bell fireworks even.

524
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,010
And at the end of it all says Diane,

525
00:31:56,011 --> 00:31:59,730
everybody gathered in City Hall Park
and they turned a big fountain on and

526
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:04,750
[inaudible]

527
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,090
water shot 50 feet into the air.

528
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,040
New York City. We'd never be the
same. Now can finally be a city.

529
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,480
But here's where you start to wonder a
little bit about the real legacy of sees.

530
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:22,590
What you see almost immediately after
this moment, according to Diane,

531
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:26,670
is that water usage skyrocketed.
Suddenly you had indoor plumbing,

532
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:30,630
all the new buildings were being
outfitted with water closets and kids were

533
00:32:30,631 --> 00:32:33,600
playing in the hydrants all day
long. And to make a long story short,

534
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:36,870
just 10 years later, the
city is out of water again.

535
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:40,220
So they get to build more tunnels and
then more. And if you follow the water

536
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,690
in those tunnels, backup state,

537
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,230
you see that the city has gobbling up
reservoirs one after another, dozens,

538
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:47,330
which meant it had to
kick people off that land.

539
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,710
Well then called eminent domain.

540
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,460
Their villages would have to be
bulldozed and burned. Cemeteries rooted.

541
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:53,391
Do you see what's happening?

542
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:57,530
I mean you could see this city that
we live in as a kind of monster.

543
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,980
Just always hungry,
eat, eat, eat, eat, eat

544
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:04,910
second. Because like, like there
is another logic available here.

545
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:08,330
Like if you took all the people in
New York City, all those New Yorkers,

546
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,110
you know, if you had every
inhabitant in New York City,

547
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,030
suddenly left New York City and moved
to small towns all across America,

548
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:16,880
you would need a ton of
resources to make that possible.

549
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,550
That's Jonah lira again,
by the way. So in a sense,

550
00:33:19,551 --> 00:33:24,050
New York City saves lots of forests,
saves lots of water, and the reason why,

551
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,770
well that takes us back to Jeff
and Alecia's ideas about cities.

552
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:32,750
So I suppose because it all started
years ago, Jeff at the time was studying,

553
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:36,170
uh, this time was living things.
Let's go back to biology for a moment.

554
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:40,400
He looked at a huge variety of creatures
and for each one he collected your

555
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:40,830
data.

556
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:44,340
Everything from it's a metabolic
rate to length through it's a altar,

557
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,900
how quickly it breathes.

558
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,980
They discovered something kind of
fascinating about creatures as they grow

559
00:33:49,981 --> 00:33:54,420
bigger and picker. If you
double the size of an organism,

560
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,020
you double the number of cells
that need to be sustained.

561
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:02,820
You would therefore expect that the
energy you need to supply would double.

562
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,600
You've doubled the number of customers
so to speak. Yeah, yeah. No, no.

563
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,750
That is not the case. Instead of doubling,

564
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,080
it needs less energy per unit cell
to sustain the whole organism.

565
00:34:15,861 --> 00:34:16,440
So there is,

566
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,420
I don't know, let's wait a
second. That means that the,

567
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,780
that the sale is somehow
doing more with less. Right.

568
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,310
Does it also mean though that an elephant
cell somehow is more efficient than a

569
00:34:26,311 --> 00:34:30,270
mouse cell? That's correct. Huh.
And Jeff says, the way they do that,

570
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,150
it's pretty simple. They just move slower.

571
00:34:33,151 --> 00:34:37,620
I process energy at a slower
rate. So if you take a mouse cell,

572
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,840
a cell that lives in a
mouse and does its work,

573
00:34:39,841 --> 00:34:41,850
it brings in resources without the waste.

574
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:46,050
Bringing in more resources spits out the
way it does this with particular beat.

575
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,560
But now says, Jeff, if you
listen to an elephant cell

576
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:55,723
[inaudible]

577
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,970
he means no,

578
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,750
it's more than

579
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,570
obviously slower. So it's
using less energy [inaudible]

580
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,830
given moment, which
makes it more efficient.

581
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:09,930
And what does that have to do with cities?

582
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:13,590
Turns out cities work kind
of the same way in cities.

583
00:35:13,591 --> 00:35:15,450
You see the same kind of efficiency

584
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,320
when it comes to infrastructure,
electricity, a length of roads, water,

585
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,470
lengths of pipes, lengths of
electrical cables, gasoline,

586
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,160
how much gas is consumed is
the point. The bigger the city,

587
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,760
the less roads you need per capita.
What does per capita mean anyways,

588
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:33,840
per person, per person,
the less electrical cable
lines you need per capita,

589
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,160
the less gasoline stations you need
per capita, et Cetera, et cetera.

590
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:41,250
So every unit of pipe carries
more water or more sewage.

591
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:45,240
Every line of electrical
wire carries more. Jeff,

592
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:47,460
does that mean then that if, uh,

593
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,000
if I move to a bigger and bigger city,

594
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:56,420
do I in a sense become greener
the bigger the city I live in?

595
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,110
That's a very interesting,
very good question.

596
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:04,380
And this is where Lewish and Jeff, I
think the case is still a little bit out.

597
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,750
And even Jonah, it gets
complicated when you ask,

598
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:08,160
are people more or less efficient?

599
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:12,120
This is when everybody starts to
throw in all of these caveats and

600
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:13,950
qualifications, all the variable

601
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,430
qualifications and ambulations and
prognostications and distillations.

602
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,640
Let me just tell you what I think.
I think you'd better. All right.

603
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:26,190
We all love to talk about how green
we are when we live in cities.

604
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:29,220
This is something everybody in the city
talks about, right? Because we are,

605
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,820
because we take the subway
and the bus we take,

606
00:36:31,821 --> 00:36:36,090
we don't draw and driving like the most
energy consuming. And listen to me,

607
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,750
the analogy that you just gave
me, it does not work. Okay.

608
00:36:39,751 --> 00:36:44,730
You said that sells as they go from
small bodies to big bodies, slow down.

609
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:48,600
Well, cities, the opposite happens.
Of course as cities get bigger,

610
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:53,030
each individual unit in that city moves
faster. Thank you Jonah. We speed up.

611
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,740
That's true. We learned this earlier
and this is not trivial. Okay.

612
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:59,460
Cause as we speed up, we bump into
more people. We have more ideas,

613
00:36:59,461 --> 00:37:02,130
we invent new things, we want more things.

614
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:06,540
We want more or more of rivers
from your tastes. New Ideas.

615
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:10,620
More interactions. More human
friction. More, more choices. Yeah,

616
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,850
a better life. That's what a
city is all about. I, I, I,

617
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,500
is there anything wrong
with that? No, not at all.

618
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:20,580
But there's all I'm saying is there's
a cost to it that we don't acknowledge.

619
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,910
Western Betancourt did this back of the
envelope calculation where it's long

620
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:27,990
been known that a body at perfect rest
of you lie on your bed all day in a coma,

621
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,870
you will consume and buy 90
watts of electricity that's cold.

622
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,520
Your basal metabolic rate.

623
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:36,090
If you're a hunter gatherer living
in some tribe in New Zealand,

624
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,210
you will consume about 240
watts of electricity every day.

625
00:37:39,211 --> 00:37:40,950
Energy just simply to stay alive,

626
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,820
plus the energy you need to
hunt and gather. However,

627
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,930
if you are living in America, the
wattage required to drive your car,

628
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:52,200
run your computer, make your
clothes, air conditioning,

629
00:37:52,201 --> 00:37:55,380
being able to go to movies on and on
and all of the various things that

630
00:37:55,381 --> 00:37:57,510
constituted our life.
If you add all those up,

631
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:02,220
your lifestyle requires about 11,000
watts of electricity every day, so that's,

632
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,640
that's more energy than in blue whale
requires. Now, some of you listening,

633
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,160
if particularly if you're an engineer,
you may think, wait a second,

634
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:09,300
why are you calling these watts?

635
00:38:09,301 --> 00:38:13,400
When it's power through a system power
through a human, call them jewels,

636
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,320
the technically correct word. And
then you'd be right, wouldn't you?

637
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,600
But the numbers are the same. So
let's, we'll just call them lots.

638
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:23,010
So one way to look at what cities have
enabled us to do is basically live like

639
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:25,140
300 million blue whales in America.

640
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,080
Are you sure that cities are
causing this development?

641
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:31,710
That it begins and ends with cities?
And you can't assign it all to cities,

642
00:38:31,711 --> 00:38:34,890
but that psychology of
wanting more, that's a city.

643
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,820
It's why people come to cities and then
the lifestyle that grows up around that

644
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:42,760
gets broadcast out on TV
and radios and movies,

645
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:45,160
which are city industries to the country.

646
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,290
And if you just take a
historical look at this,

647
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:52,150
like the last 300 years have seen more
and more consumption, right? Yeah.

648
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,710
And that trend, it's, it's,

649
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:58,770
it's grown in neat parallel
with the growth of cities. Um,

650
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:02,640
cities have enabled that kind of
growth. Even if you guys are are,

651
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:06,590
are right and we know that half of the
planet already is living in cities,

652
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:10,040
80% of America. So yes, there are
more people. I agree with that.

653
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:13,220
More choices asking for more consumption,
more energy, more, more, more, more,

654
00:39:13,221 --> 00:39:16,640
more, even if that, so cities,

655
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,120
because they also are ingenious and
they come up with all these new ideas,

656
00:39:20,121 --> 00:39:23,240
maybe cities will solve
the problem right now.

657
00:39:23,241 --> 00:39:28,190
Jet someone somewhere in Calcutta is
about to invent the super light bulb

658
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:33,330
elevator telephone pipe that will make
it possible for another 200 controlling

659
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:38,270
people to live together in peace,
harmony, and beauty until the next round.

660
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,111
All right,

661
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:43,160
you go ahead and claim to that optimism
and you of course can go hang yourself.

662
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:49,000
So we'll be right back. I remember
crawling. That's Jab Radiolab.

663
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,983
This is try and con

664
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,260
the city of brotherly love.

665
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:55,800
Radiolab is supported in part by
the Alfred p Sloan Foundation,

666
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,700
enhancing public understanding of science
and technology in the modern world.

667
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,080
More information
aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

668
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,920
hey, I'm Janet. Boom,
rotten. I remember grill,

669
00:40:10,921 --> 00:40:15,921
which this is radio lab and our subject
today is cities and if cities are like

670
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:20,370
organisms and one thing we should say
about every organism that's ever been,

671
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,630
they die. Yeah they die. So you would
think cities would die, you would.

672
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:28,180
But Jonah says no, cities die very,

673
00:40:28,181 --> 00:40:33,181
very rarely and they almost never die
if there hasn't been a total total

674
00:40:33,191 --> 00:40:36,040
catastrophe. Physical
catastrophe, which is weird,

675
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,150
you know if you think about it,

676
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:40,420
it says Jonah cause like take a company
and sometimes it can get very big so

677
00:40:40,421 --> 00:40:44,920
that they include hundreds of thousands
of employees and yet they die all the

678
00:40:44,921 --> 00:40:47,530
time. Of the 30 companies
and the original Dow Jones,

679
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,690
only three are still
on the Dow Jones Index.

680
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:54,810
If you took 30 cities from the 1920s
I can guarantee you all 30 of those

681
00:40:54,811 --> 00:40:58,920
randomly selected cities would still
exist on the map. And the question is why?

682
00:40:58,921 --> 00:41:02,460
Why don't they die like every
other social organization?

683
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:06,300
What is it about cities that
gives them this crazy persistence?

684
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:10,650
That question led us to a place that by
all measures should have died long ago.

685
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,960
A place called Centralia.

686
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,810
Okay, so we begin on the
side of where are we?

687
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:25,730
We're on route 61 in eastern Pennsylvania.
Right. This is bad, by the way.

688
00:41:25,731 --> 00:41:29,850
He's a producer at radio lab. I know
who pat is. Thank you very much. Anyhow,

689
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:33,390
we're waiting for this guy named Tom
to meet our professors. He, Tom? Yeah.

690
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,380
Tom [inaudible] asked you, are you
doing okay yet? It's up to you guys.

691
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,440
When did you get her? Just now.
Just now. Just happened to be,

692
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:42,530
can we ask Tom to show us around
his town? Probably the best place.

693
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,870
He goes up on the hill up
there and look, you know,

694
00:41:44,871 --> 00:41:47,450
you could look over
everything. Okay, sure.

695
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:54,410
So we go up on the hill with Tom. We
actually meet up with another time.

696
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,730
I'm Dempsey. I was the former postmaster
here. We now have two toms, Tom, Tom,

697
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,600
or confusing.

698
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,260
Any of the four of us stare down into a
valley that used to have a town in it.

699
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:06,920
Front of house was all, it was all
streets with homes on them all over.

700
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:12,340
Now Centralia is just trees right down
here was the a Tom two points system.

701
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:17,480
Trees are a high school
over here. More trees,

702
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:21,470
flooding nation's church are still
shooting playground right at the bottom of

703
00:42:21,471 --> 00:42:23,870
this little hill right here.
You can still see the bars.

704
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,640
This is where things get a little strange.

705
00:42:25,641 --> 00:42:29,780
I mean right next to the swing set where
kids used to laugh their little heads

706
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:31,550
off. There's a hole in
the ground right there.

707
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:36,551
I can see some steam coming out of the
ground spewing steam and that and I would

708
00:42:36,591 --> 00:42:40,490
later discover and we got close to
it that that steam was really hot.

709
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:44,100
It's hot and wet. Oh My god, Ha.

710
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,820
What? Where exactly is
the fire underneath this?

711
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:55,070
Like how far here? 50
feet, maybe 50 feet down.

712
00:42:55,340 --> 00:43:00,170
If it is, the smell doesn't bother you
guys. What? Smell? You can smell it.

713
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,610
It smells like burning tires here.

714
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:08,600
That must be from New York. That's
stuck in your nose. Come on.

715
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:09,830
It really did smell put.

716
00:43:09,831 --> 00:43:13,730
The thing no one can deny is that
underneath our feet there's a web of coal

717
00:43:13,731 --> 00:43:16,400
mines that stretches from miles
40 miles in each direction,

718
00:43:16,401 --> 00:43:21,170
30 miles and somewhere in those mines is
a fire that's been burning for 40 years

719
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:26,180
and has either destroyed this town
or not depending on who you ask.

720
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:31,190
This is pat right here.
My name is Mary Lugandan.

721
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:34,880
I'm 82 years old and I lived in
Centralia most of my adult life.

722
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,400
What year were you born in? If you
mind me asking, what year was I born?

723
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:41,930
1927 Mary Lou gon grew up in a
town not too far from Centralia.

724
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,320
Really neat little farm
town called Burnsville and
when she got to central Ella

725
00:43:45,321 --> 00:43:48,290
she said was like moving to the city.

726
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:51,650
It had a legion drug store. It had that.

727
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:54,380
It had a couple thousand people,

728
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:57,810
lots of bars was in center and somebody
told me one time there were 22 bombs in

729
00:43:57,811 --> 00:44:00,620
Centralia. I don't know if that
was true cause I didn't frequent.

730
00:44:00,621 --> 00:44:04,160
Byron's at that age and all these places
that you just mentioned were right on

731
00:44:04,161 --> 00:44:06,260
top of each other. So when
you were walking around,

732
00:44:06,261 --> 00:44:08,870
you'd see people all the
time. Just take, for instance,

733
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:12,380
you'd go to the post office after work
and show you where the post office was.

734
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:16,910
Tommy would be there sometimes. I was
postmaster here for a number of years.

735
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:19,960
Tweet. You're pointing into a
forest. It's hard to imagine this.

736
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:20,990
It is hard to imagine,

737
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:23,600
and yet I walk to the post office
because your mail wasn't delivered,

738
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:27,350
so I'd go up to the post office and get
my mail and you'd meet people in the

739
00:44:27,351 --> 00:44:30,410
post office. You'd meet people
coming out of the post office.

740
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,630
This was a good football field
here. Now it's all growing in.

741
00:44:33,631 --> 00:44:36,580
Nobody's cutting the grass. There's bushes
growing up in it now, Tommy Dempsey,

742
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,830
to have his story, I would be an
hour till I got home. Whole hour.

743
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:46,550
This is house and was. Okay.
Fast forward, it's Memorial Day,

744
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,540
1962 this is where the borrowers
just picked up all their garbage.

745
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:55,310
Magnify the star that I'd say just about
right here where I'm standing right

746
00:44:55,311 --> 00:44:59,690
now. Tell me points to a little
patch of nondescript yellow grass.

747
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,920
Like why here? How did it start?
Do we have any idea? Well,

748
00:45:03,921 --> 00:45:06,640
it started the most
likely scenario. He says,

749
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:08,950
we also heard this from a
writer named Joan Quigley,

750
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,630
author of the day the Earth gave him,

751
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:14,110
is it people used to heat their homes
with coal and maybe somebody threw their

752
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,810
ashes into the garbage, which
then ended up onto the dump.

753
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:20,350
It caught the whole thing on fire,
furniture, rugs, kerosene camps,

754
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,300
which John says wasn't that unusual?

755
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:26,770
Some of the former firefighters said out
the dumps caught on fire all the time

756
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,710
and usually the virus just fizzled
out on their own. But this one,

757
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:33,730
for whatever reason before it did
wandered a little bit and it found its way

758
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:38,680
over to an old exposed, exposed call
vein there. Basically an old strip mine.

759
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:40,810
Yeah. It should have
been covered but wasn't.

760
00:45:40,811 --> 00:45:44,230
So there was just a big open cavity
when the fire got in there and okay,

761
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,093
that call, the

762
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:50,500
fire trucks came up here and a hose down
the fire until they thought it was out

763
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:54,240
and they left following
Betty. Somebody says, all,

764
00:45:54,241 --> 00:45:56,590
we see smoke and steam coming
out of the ground up there.

765
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,920
[inaudible] came back the next day and
they tried to get the fire out and they

766
00:45:59,921 --> 00:46:03,520
couldn't very well do it or they weren't
getting it cause at that point it was

767
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:06,120
too, I wouldn't know where
to start with this mind far.

768
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,190
I wouldn't know where to start. The
first place that fire came down,

769
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:14,250
it was right underneath Mary Lou's house
and from that point on it kind of took

770
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:18,060
over her life. Oh my goodness. Is
Your scrapbooks. When we were there,

771
00:46:18,061 --> 00:46:21,630
she pulled out these
two gigantic scrapbooks.

772
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,250
Is it gonna take for
men to lift this book?

773
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:27,300
Each book is literally three feet tall
and they document in painful detail.

774
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,930
How that fire split the town in to,

775
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,510
this is how intense I was with
this mindful fire that she heaved,

776
00:46:33,511 --> 00:46:37,620
opened the book and she showed us this
picture of three people crouched on the

777
00:46:37,621 --> 00:46:40,050
street in front of a
whole, this is my husband,

778
00:46:40,051 --> 00:46:42,450
my son and me and husband
holding a thermometer.

779
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,560
We dropped this down on it like a
fishing pole down on a like you're ice

780
00:46:46,561 --> 00:46:47,394
fishing. Yeah.

781
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:50,190
This is their way of measuring
the temperature of the
fire bill up and what did

782
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:53,150
we read? It was pretty high.
A hundred degrees high.

783
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,840
850 or something under your
house? No, this was on the street,

784
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:02,160
but the street right in front of her house
and the garage. The garage was right.

785
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,290
As you can see, that
garage here is right there.

786
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,860
She showed us another picture
of her standing in her
garage in front of a trench

787
00:47:07,861 --> 00:47:11,740
that they'd dug in inside that
trench. You see flames. Oh,

788
00:47:11,741 --> 00:47:13,920
we used to go out at night and
watched there that, you know,

789
00:47:13,921 --> 00:47:18,390
the glowing and the ambers fire up
there got so bad that some of Marilu's

790
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,200
neighbors actually got government money
to leave their houses name where the

791
00:47:22,201 --> 00:47:26,160
first people bought out. Never once,
like at the beginning did you think like,

792
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,800
oh, maybe we should just get outta here.
No, there's a fire a hundred yards.

793
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,720
Yeah, never. Yeah. I never went to, no.
Instead she did exactly the opposite.

794
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,180
My husband, and this was a big official
and this was the beginner heals,

795
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:43,180
started writing letters, men Nelligan
Musto. We wrote letters to him.

796
00:47:43,181 --> 00:47:46,630
We talked on the phone with him. I
couldn't tell you all the congressmen.

797
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:47,900
We talked before, governors,

798
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,190
all the Harrisburg officials and they
were promising everything but the sun.

799
00:47:51,191 --> 00:47:55,050
But it never happened. But other than
the people who lived on that street,

800
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,050
then many,

801
00:47:56,051 --> 00:48:00,910
many people in town didn't have to
worry or even think about the Mindfire.

802
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:04,690
Nobody ever believed that the fire
was, was even serious in some tragedy.

803
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,590
My husband, myself and Helen, rumor,

804
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:13,830
it's uptown and the fire is uptown.
All that changed on Valentine's Day.

805
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:17,290
1981 we're up a little bit
hotter because of this guy,

806
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:20,650
fellow named Todd Demboski,
who at the time was just a boy.

807
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:24,640
I was 1212 year old boy. He's playing
outside in his grandmother's backyard.

808
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:29,710
I noticed a small wisps of
smoke coming out of the ground,

809
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:34,480
so he went over to take a look. I
was like, I bent down to investigate.

810
00:48:34,481 --> 00:48:37,360
I noticed that my feet
were starting to sink in.

811
00:48:37,361 --> 00:48:40,030
It was really soft and
it was like quicksand.

812
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:44,290
The more I tried the struggle and more,
ah, I was just opening the hole larger.

813
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:48,460
He wound up sliding to my
thighs, to my waist until he was,

814
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:53,970
I was under all the way underground
surrounded by hot steam.

815
00:48:54,261 --> 00:48:57,990
Smoke was so intense. Now
it's like rotten eggs. Oh,

816
00:48:59,840 --> 00:48:59,961
well.

817
00:48:59,961 --> 00:49:04,940
I was screaming for my cousin and his
cousin heard him and came running over,

818
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,650
blocked me out like a flower.

819
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,560
What happened to him? Changed everything

820
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:18,220
because suddenly reporters were
everywhere. Reporters from the evening,

821
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:20,710
Harold's Nightline, national news media,

822
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:22,540
everybody pointing their cameras at Todd.

823
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:26,020
I see smaller flown over to shape
was the mind burn when I did.

824
00:49:26,021 --> 00:49:29,560
I just thought right through and doing
stories about this town that was on fire.

825
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:35,190
The underground coal fires still burn
Hodgson and isn't inferno federal

826
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:35,590
attention.

827
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:40,450
Parts of Centralia look like the outskirts
of hell would focus on what had to

828
00:49:40,451 --> 00:49:42,810
happen for the town. There
wasn't long says Joan before.

829
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,190
Some of the younger residents,

830
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:48,980
small informal group of young parents
organized in March and look is to have

831
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:52,030
anyone down the main street in town. How
many people are we talking about here?

832
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:55,780
Couple of dozen with red ribbons around
their arms and their wrists and they

833
00:49:55,781 --> 00:50:00,040
walked two by two down the main street
of Centralia like striking miners.

834
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:04,930
Mary Lou glared at them as they passed.
I was bitter. I was bitter with,

835
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:08,250
they claimed they were for
helping the town to be safe,

836
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:11,790
but they weren't what they were really
for. She figured was getting out there,

837
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,320
look for funds to get relocated.
She even hated their name,

838
00:50:14,321 --> 00:50:17,560
concerned citizens against the
Centralia mine fire. She thought,

839
00:50:17,561 --> 00:50:20,530
how are they the concerned citizens.
She's the concerned citizen.

840
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,240
She had been fighting the fire for years.

841
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,450
The media was there taking video
cameras, filmed the marchers,

842
00:50:25,451 --> 00:50:28,160
looping red ribbon over everything,
and Mary Lou's neighbor,

843
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:29,810
Helen cut the red room.

844
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:33,770
It's down because we fought so
hard to try to save Centralia.

845
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:37,370
Why did they want to do this? People
like Mary Lou and Helen Willmar.

846
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:39,920
They started telling people, no,
no, no. Here's why it's safe.

847
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,180
Here's why you should say

848
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:45,470
parents from the other group were on
TV complaining about gases in the home.

849
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,300
It could be a death house.

850
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:48,151
It's Mary Lou,

851
00:50:48,151 --> 00:50:51,810
Helen and a few others started up their
own committee and I did Centralia area

852
00:50:51,811 --> 00:50:52,950
mine task force.

853
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:56,790
They got on TV themselves and in the
community they started putting up flyers,

854
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,950
fact sheets and handing them out. Yep.
Door to door. Okay. On a college meeting,

855
00:51:01,951 --> 00:51:03,360
daughter at town meetings.

856
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,970
The dueling committees would get
up there and make their case,

857
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,940
but this is a borehole get yelled down,
will not protect us when they get old.

858
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,890
They get rowdy. Absolutely
ridiculous. Families fighting against

859
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:15,690
families, neighbors against neighbors.

860
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:19,800
There's lambing and you split the town
apart. Who's that? David Lamb. This guy,

861
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:20,401
David Lamb,

862
00:51:20,401 --> 00:51:24,210
ran a motorcycle shop in town and he
was also a member of this concerned

863
00:51:24,211 --> 00:51:25,260
citizens organization.

864
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:29,460
[inaudible] early morning and one morning
at about 4:00 AM he was sleeping in an

865
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:34,461
apartment and someone threw a Molotov
cocktail through his plate glass window.

866
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:39,600
Mary Lou showed us an article from a
scrapbook related to lamb's activities as

867
00:51:39,601 --> 00:51:43,950
an officer of concerned
citizens. Wow, this is no joke.

868
00:51:43,951 --> 00:51:47,340
This is like the Sopranos,
but worse yet this was really,

869
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:50,400
it was really bad and in
the midst of all this chaos,

870
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:53,790
Congress started considering a bill that
would basically let them buy out the

871
00:51:53,791 --> 00:51:56,880
town. Some observers believed
that for about $50 million,

872
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:00,970
Centralia could be totally bought out
until the mayor decided that idea,

873
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:01,950
let's hold a referendum,

874
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:05,140
and the issue was stay or go. In the
weeks leading up to the referendum,

875
00:52:05,141 --> 00:52:08,050
Mary Lou and Helen again went
door to door talking to people.

876
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:11,170
They'd known their whole lives and
pretty much everyone they talked to said,

877
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,600
I really want to stay.
My mother wants to stay

878
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:18,310
August 11th, 1983 shortly
before 10 this evening,

879
00:52:18,311 --> 00:52:20,490
Centralia is mayor announced the results.

880
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:24,750
There is 545 boats, boats, cash,

881
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:28,530
200 voted to stay.

882
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:36,570
345 voted to relocate. I was
crying. Yes, in my heart.

883
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:38,250
I never thought that would happen ever.

884
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:41,160
You thought that everybody
would would Wednesday,

885
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,280
maybe 40 people might decide or maybe
30 but that was devastating to to know

886
00:52:47,641 --> 00:52:49,260
that so many people want it to move.

887
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:55,800
It was and when you look at
her scrapbooks, everything
stops after that day.

888
00:52:55,830 --> 00:53:00,100
Yeah. This is just drawn in papers.
Wow. It just stopped so abruptly. Yup.

889
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,530
I was always mad and disgusted
and I didn't want to,

890
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:08,790
I didn't want to do it no more
about it. That was the end.

891
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:13,320
Almost immediately after that
vote, Congress bought out the town.

892
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,720
People started packing up and
leaving. Know. Let me see where it is.

893
00:53:15,721 --> 00:53:16,380
I have some,

894
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:19,110
it has the big numbers that ray Lou
told us that when you decided to leave,

895
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,220
a demolition crew would actually come
to your house and paint big red letters

896
00:53:23,221 --> 00:53:26,010
like this. A big number
one in front of your

897
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:29,310
house. Like blood was dripping off.
Oh, it's like you were marked. Yeah.

898
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,241
And what would happen?

899
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:32,850
She says when your house was marked
as that your neighbors would see it,

900
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:36,480
they'd get nervous and then suddenly
their houses would be marked and then

901
00:53:36,481 --> 00:53:38,040
suddenly the whole block would be marked.

902
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:40,650
And I knew every one of them
quite well. And I'm thinking,

903
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:43,590
I stopped talking to some of them.
She'd see him on the street, she says,

904
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,440
and look the other way. I
didn't like any of them really.

905
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:49,680
[inaudible] and one day
in the fall of 1987,

906
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:54,450
these divisions caused something to happen
that is just kind of like mythically

907
00:53:54,451 --> 00:53:58,770
bad. Yeah. It involved a married
couple who'd been in the town most.

908
00:53:58,771 --> 00:54:02,730
She'd been there her whole life. And
um, as a couple they were divided.

909
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:04,830
One wanted to stay, one wanted to go.

910
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:08,250
I think it was the wife who didn't
want to leave and the husband,

911
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,720
why he was a shovel runner and he,

912
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:13,560
he wanted to take the money you get
from your location and get out there.

913
00:54:13,561 --> 00:54:14,880
Neighbors were moving,

914
00:54:14,881 --> 00:54:19,620
had moved the houses around them are
being torn down and they had to make a

915
00:54:19,621 --> 00:54:24,621
decision and all we really know is that
at some point they started to argue and

916
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:26,490
um, and it escalated.

917
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:32,780
He stabbed her to death with a kitchen
knife and then drove up to an old

918
00:54:32,851 --> 00:54:35,760
stripping pip and set
himself in his car on fire.

919
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,033
Wow.

920
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,980
Is, this is going to sound
like a strange question,

921
00:54:41,981 --> 00:54:44,200
but is there anything about
that that makes sense to you?

922
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,130
Like why couldn't people
let go of this place?

923
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,070
It is very primal.

924
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:54,660
Beyond that she really couldn't say why.

925
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:59,550
And we asked Mary Lou who
hung on long after the murder,

926
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:03,510
after that referendum, after
the town was basically empty.

927
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:08,420
I have no idea what kept me there. I
have no idea. You have no idea. No,

928
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:13,440
I knew I just didn't want to move the
other street [inaudible] man banners.

929
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:16,110
You got houses down there. Yeah. Today,

930
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:19,420
11 people live in town was
better than his wife, man.

931
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:21,450
My mom and him lived down
through the intersection.

932
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:25,020
Tom and Tom pointed them all out from
the hill. We knocked on every door,

933
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,730
figured we asked them what it is that
keeps them living literally on top of a

934
00:55:29,731 --> 00:55:33,000
fire. Hi, good evening.

935
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:38,250
Wow. That was the shortest, but
none of them wanted to talk to us.

936
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:43,370
Not even the dogs. Oh, okay. All right.

937
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:47,670
But then Tom two took us to one last spot.

938
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:53,000
Where are we right now? You're in San
Ignatius, Roman Catholic cemetery.

939
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:58,280
The cemetery is just a few feet away
from the hill where we started and it's a

940
00:55:58,281 --> 00:55:59,300
really strange contrast.

941
00:55:59,301 --> 00:56:04,301
You go from this steamy hell and
then suddenly you're in like Woodsy,

942
00:56:04,551 --> 00:56:06,620
Vermont. There's a lot of big beautiful,

943
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:11,900
this is my grandfather and my grandmother.
Tom has four generations buried here.

944
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,450
Do you know how many people are here, Tom?

945
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:20,180
There's over 3000 burials and
this time I Terry along 3000 yes.

946
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:25,090
Plus the thing is says Tom, even
the that left fled that fire,

947
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:30,730
continue to come back and be buried in
the cemetery, which means this place,

948
00:56:30,731 --> 00:56:34,180
the cemetery is the only thing in
Centralia that's still growing.

949
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:37,910
[inaudible]

950
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:42,100
it's suddenly how Joan put it earlier.
It is very primal. Made Sense.

951
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:47,940
You can experience your life
on a multigenerational planet.

952
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,600
This is where my great grandparents
are buried, which means in a sense,

953
00:56:52,601 --> 00:56:56,080
this town will never die as long
as the cemetery is still here.

954
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:59,170
Not even read their name on it
this year. This dig it up. Oh,

955
00:56:59,171 --> 00:57:00,250
it's under the dirt.

956
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:05,690
Do a

957
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,060
get this up by Shauna.

958
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:15,200
See it sinking down into the ground, but
it's in the, it's in the dirt. No, yes,

959
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:19,390
yes, no. There we go. We
can see a dem has c y s

960
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:25,300
y thinks about Walter's for reporting
that with me and also to Chris Perkel and

961
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:29,830
Georgie Roland who directed
a great documentary about
Centralia called the town

962
00:57:29,831 --> 00:57:33,340
that was, you can find out more
information about that on our website.
