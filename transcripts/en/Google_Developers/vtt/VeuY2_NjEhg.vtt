&gt;&gt; BURCH: Hi, my name is Todd Burch and I’m
one of the partners of smustard.com. Back

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:17.020
in 2003, when I was a professional wood worker,
I needed a 3D design program. And, I did the

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:23.470
search and I found SketchUp and I started
using it, and it was great. But I could--I

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.730
knew I could do more if SketchUp had an API.
And about a year later, in 2004, it was SketchUp

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.340
Version 4. SketchUp came out with an API implemented
in Ruby. I didn’t know Ruby at that time

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.040
but I sat down and learned it, and that just
really took SketchUp to the next level for

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.610
me. After writing scripts for the user community,
and for several years, I partnered with Rick

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:55.440
Wilson and Octavian Chis and we formed Smustard,
and our goal for smustard.com is to provide

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.510
scripts to the user community that will make
them more productive just like they were more

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.360
productive for us.
&gt;&gt; MALE: So can you talk about how you chose

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.929
the SketchUp API, and tell us a little bit
about how you came to this technical decision?

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:17.880
And what was it about it that made you think
this is what I'm going to develop for?

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.509
&gt;&gt; BURCH: Yeah, when the Ruby API came out
with SketchUp, I knew there was an opportunity

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.840
there to speed my use of SketchUp up. And
so, learning the Ruby API and learning how

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.159
to code in Ruby enabled to me to be more productive
to use these SketchUp. And so, instead of

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.180
sitting down and maybe drawing a cabinet and
taking 30 minutes to do it, you know, I sat

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.759
down for a couple of hours and I wrote a script
that would draw a cabinet and the next time

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.560
I need to draw a cabinet, it takes five seconds.
So it really made me a lot more productive.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.270
&gt;&gt; MALE: As developers, we really value being
able to share war stories and lessons from

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.950
technical challenges? Can you tell us about
one particularly difficult period of development

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.090
that you faced and how you approach this technical
challenge?

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.980
&gt;&gt; Sometimes, as developer, you run in to
technical challenges when using a product

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.180
or an API. One specific technical challenge
or a series of technical challenges that I’ve

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.890
had over the years were more related to advanced
math concepts that I never had in school,

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.930
for instance, transformations, scaling and
rotations. And so, learning to go through

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.079
and how to implement--not just use the API
but figure out what those math concepts were

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:43.470
to be able to manipulate things in an advance
way when inside SketchUp was kind of challenging.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.489
But the user community, the other scriptors
and even the Google people were just wonderful

00:02:49.489 --> 00:03:01.450
helping us users learn how to use the product.
&gt;&gt; MALE: So, tell me some of your favorite

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.870
features in SketchUp, in SketchUp API?
&gt;&gt; BURCH: My favorite features with the SketchUp

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.370
API, first and foremost, is that it’s implemented
in the Ruby language. You know, when the Ruby

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.090
language was chosen by Joe Esch, one of the
original authors of SketchUp, Ruby was a new

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:24.190
language. And not many people knew Ruby, and
since 2002 or 2003 whenever he decided to

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:31.060
implement Ruby as the language, Ruby is now
very well-known for Web development, and not

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.980
as many people use it for just applications.
So SketchUp is using Ruby as an application

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.660
programming language, scripting language.
And so, a lot of people that have grown up

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.270
around Ruby think of it as rails but this
is not rails, this is just a Ruby language.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.860
And so, it’s been a really good thing.
&gt;&gt; MALE: What are some things that you’d

00:03:51.860 --> 00:04:00.530
like to see added to the SketchUp API, the
future of what you see implemented?

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.760
&gt;&gt; BURCH: As far as the future of SketchUp
and the Ruby API, some of the things that

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:14.469
we would like to see at smustard.com is-is-is
better support for getting the word out that

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:20.120
there are these things called extensions,
and letting the user community know that they’re

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.080
pretty easy to implement and giving the users
an easy way to bring those in to SketchUp.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.889
I mean, we don’t want anybody to have to
learn how to be a programmer or even mess

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.370
with their file systems. So we would like
to see better support for distribution and

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:41.124
installation of Ruby scripts.
&gt;&gt; MALE: And what do you see as the future

00:04:41.124 --> 00:04:43.590
of 3D?
&gt;&gt; BURCH: You know, as far as the future of

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:51.340
SketchUp and 3D modeling, you know, SketchUp’s
goal in the beginning was 3D for every one.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.030
And I think they've come a long way towards
that--I mean, there’s a lot of big players

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.760
in the market place that are doing 3D that
have a very well-established user base. And

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.800
so, SketchUp is coming up and, you know, it’s
always kind have been--I don’t want to say

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.780
the joke of industry but it’s like, “Oh
well, you know, it’s free. How could it

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.400
be productive for people?” But, you know,
the SketchUp community is very alive and very

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.889
well and SketchUp users are growing everyday.
So I think the future is going to bring more

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:27.800
people using SketchUp and more people moving
off of their legacy solutions and using SketchUp,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.500
and part of that, is going to mean extensions
of SketchUp to customize SketchUp for their

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.069
processing, and to integrate SketchUp into
their flow of business that they’re establishing

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:41.279
using it today.
&gt;&gt; MALE: Great. Thank you very much.

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:42.189
&gt;&gt; BURCH: Okay.
