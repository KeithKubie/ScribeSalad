growth ok what's the impact of that they

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580
growth ok what's the impact of that they
 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.670
growth ok what's the impact of that they
have been in order to get that growth

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680
have been in order to get that growth
 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.289
have been in order to get that growth
and they've been growing recently about

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299
and they've been growing recently about
 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.109
and they've been growing recently about
six and a half percent unfortunately in

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119
six and a half percent unfortunately in
 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.550
six and a half percent unfortunately in
order to achieve that growth they've

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560
order to achieve that growth they've
 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.580
order to achieve that growth they've
been growing debt to GDP in other words

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590
been growing debt to GDP in other words
 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.410
been growing debt to GDP in other words
they have been leveraging in various

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420
they have been leveraging in various
 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.020
they have been leveraging in various
sectors

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030
sectors
 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.880

capacity in many state-owned enterprises

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530
capacity in many state-owned enterprises
 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.590
capacity in many state-owned enterprises
the impact of that is

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600
the impact of that is
 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.740
the impact of that is
they've got dramatic over capacity in a

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750
they've got dramatic over capacity in a
 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.570
they've got dramatic over capacity in a
number of their industries which creates

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580
number of their industries which creates
 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.540
number of their industries which creates
global over capacity and so China bears

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550
global over capacity and so China bears
 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.190
global over capacity and so China bears
watching the world is going to have to

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200
watching the world is going to have to
 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.110
watching the world is going to have to
get accustomed to lower levels of growth

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120
get accustomed to lower levels of growth
 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.630
get accustomed to lower levels of growth
from China and also because of currency

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640
from China and also because of currency
 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.320
from China and also because of currency
outflows that has the potential because

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330
outflows that has the potential because
 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.880
outflows that has the potential because
the world is much more financially

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890
the world is much more financially
 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.790
the world is much more financially
integrated currency outflows in China

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800
integrated currency outflows in China
 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.590
integrated currency outflows in China
which is what happened in the first

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600
which is what happened in the first
 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.340
which is what happened in the first
quarter of 2016 have the potential to

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350
quarter of 2016 have the potential to
 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.199
quarter of 2016 have the potential to
create ripple effects and spill overs

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209
create ripple effects and spill overs
 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.120
create ripple effects and spill overs
throughout the world and this happened

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130
throughout the world and this happened
 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.280
throughout the world and this happened
in the first quarter of 2016 where we

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290
in the first quarter of 2016 where we
 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.009
in the first quarter of 2016 where we
saw financial turmoil and China

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019
saw financial turmoil and China
 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.630
saw financial turmoil and China
translate into rapidly tightening

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640
translate into rapidly tightening
 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.790
translate into rapidly tightening
financial conditions globally so those

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800
financial conditions globally so those
 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.170
financial conditions globally so those
are a number of elements of

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180
are a number of elements of
 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.030
are a number of elements of
globalization what's the point of it all

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040
globalization what's the point of it all
 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.050
globalization what's the point of it all
the point of it all is you have to think

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060
the point of it all is you have to think
 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.670
the point of it all is you have to think
about the economy in a much more global

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680
about the economy in a much more global
 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.780
about the economy in a much more global
way globalization is likely putting

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790
way globalization is likely putting
 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.729
way globalization is likely putting
downward pressure on prices because it's

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739
downward pressure on prices because it's
 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.020
downward pressure on prices because it's
create because we have more over

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030
create because we have more over
 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.810
create because we have more over
capacity and also our trading

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820
capacity and also our trading
 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.039
capacity and also our trading
relationships have to be thought about

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049
relationships have to be thought about
 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.370
relationships have to be thought about
differently because particularly in this

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380
differently because particularly in this
 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.729
differently because particularly in this
hemisphere it's actually helping US

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739
hemisphere it's actually helping US
 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.729
hemisphere it's actually helping US
companies become more globally

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739
companies become more globally
 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.530
companies become more globally
competitive and therefore is likely

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540
competitive and therefore is likely
 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.360
competitive and therefore is likely
growing jobs in the United States so as

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370
growing jobs in the United States so as
 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.539
growing jobs in the United States so as
a central banker it's no longer an

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549
a central banker it's no longer an
 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:42.229
a central banker it's no longer an
option

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239
option
 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.349
option
in thinking about US monetary policy to

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359
in thinking about US monetary policy to
 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:46.880
in thinking about US monetary policy to
think just about the United States I

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890
think just about the United States I
 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.120
think just about the United States I
have to understand economic conditions

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130
have to understand economic conditions
 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.030
have to understand economic conditions
around the world and the

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040
around the world and the
 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.130
around the world and the
interrelationships between economies and

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140
interrelationships between economies and
 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.650
interrelationships between economies and
financial markets around the world

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660
financial markets around the world
 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.090
financial markets around the world
because the ripple effects the spill

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100
because the ripple effects the spill
 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.300
because the ripple effects the spill
overs are much more likely to happen and

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310
overs are much more likely to happen and
 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.819

this is one reason why when we talk

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829
this is one reason why when we talk
 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.890
this is one reason why when we talk
about the currencies particularly the US

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900
about the currencies particularly the US
 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.259

much more sensitive and aware of the

much more sensitive and aware of the
 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.810
much more sensitive and aware of the

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390
 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.570
and so we have to think about the

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580
and so we have to think about the
 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.470

economy in a different way it's my view
 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.140

disruption we need to do much more to

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:09.960
disruption we need to do much more to

help workers adjust to these trends and
 

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.980
help workers adjust to these trends and
help them improve their ability to adapt

have the much more likely we are going

to be able to adapt to these trends but
 

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.640

but so so that's the third trend is

but so so that's the third trend is

technology enable disruption but I think

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:36.750
technology enable disruption but I think
 

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.500
technology enable disruption but I think
that and globalization are related and

in today I think some of the effects of

in today I think some of the effects of
 

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.750
in today I think some of the effects of
technology enable disruption are being

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760
technology enable disruption are being
 

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.240
technology enable disruption are being
attributed to globalization and I think

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:47.250
attributed to globalization and I think
 

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.570
attributed to globalization and I think
in some cases inaccurately
