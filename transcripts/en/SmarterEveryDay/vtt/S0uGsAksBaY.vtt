00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day. This is Gordon. He's been doing the sound

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.010
for Smarter Every Day for years. This is the first time we've met, but it's in Peru. Pretty crazy
- It's awesome.

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.050
He's from Canada. So what are we doing here?
- We're fitting you up with

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.090
binaural microphones. So I want you to put that in your ear.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.100
I'm gonna get you some windscreens, which make you look extra good.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.130
- What are binaural microphones?
- Binaural microphones are stereo microphones that take into account

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.140
the fact that you have a head, which most stereo microphones do not.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.180
So your head is a big frequency filter, and if a sound goes in

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.200
this ear, not all the same frequencies are going to reach this ear.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.230
In the same way, or at the same..
- That's because of the fatness of my head right?
- You're very fat.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.240
[laughs]
- Umm. They're not gonna.. There'll be a time delay

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.270
and there will be a frequency change.
- That's awesome. So I did a

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.300
back of the envelope calculation. If I have a sound coming in from the left it's a 500 microsecond

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.320
delay before it gets to my other ear. And they should be able to hear that?
- They should be able to hear that as if it's

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350
surround sound. If you put your headphones on.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.360
surround sound. If you put your headphones on.
- Oh ok. So go throw your headphones on

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.400
and we're gonna walk around Machu Picchu. The reason we're gonna do this

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.440
is because Jeff's up here taking the highest resolution photo of Machu Picchu that's ever taken

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.570
in a panoramic form and I'm trying to be productive with the time, so

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.610
go put headphones on right?
- Right.
- Alright. Here we go. Let's go check it out.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.650
(Voiceover) Wait a second,

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.660
this is Gord. We have to make sure that your headphones are on correctly,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.670
or it will ruin EVERYTHING. So let's test your left ear,

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.670
right ear, left ear, right ear, left ear, perfect.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.680
Go.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.180
(Girl in Peruvian Spanish) Thanks.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.820
(Destin) You want a photo?
- Perfect

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.850
- Thank you.
- No problem.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.930
(Male in Spanish) Let's sit.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.980
(Man walking by) From here go to... Australia...
(Woman walking by) From here go to Australia and then go to Asia?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.990
(Destin in Spanish) Ready?
- Yes.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.030
- Thank you.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.070
(Destin) Is good? You want another one?
- No. Is perfect.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.110
- Perfect? Thank you very much. Have a good one.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:03:21.590
              

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.620
(Man in Spanish) Hello.
(Destin in Spanish) Hello.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:04:22.070
             

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.090
(Guy in Argentine Spanish) We have to check the trains schedule, right?
(Woman in Argentine Spanish) yes, it's ready.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.140
- Ok, so the trains schedule, and then we go catch the bus and we're good.
- Yes, cause it doesn't matter which one we take, right?

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.160
(Destin in Spanish) Excuse me.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:46.280
  

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.350
(Man in Spanish) Theï»¿ Word of God is like the rain. It bears fruit. Calm.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:07:47.520
                                           

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.540
(Woman in spanish) Stay close to the rock, stay close to the rock.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:08:15.730
     

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.770
(Man in Spanish, pointing upwards) We're going up there, right?

00:08:17.790 --> 00:09:48.340
                     

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.370
(Man in spanish) Hey, Hey, Hey. It's not permitted.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.390
(Destin) So it's against the rules?

00:09:54.410 --> 00:10:34.980
         

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.980
(Destin) So apparently I was in somewhere I wasn't supposed to be.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:11:27.030
           

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:33.050
(Man in Japanese) But there's nothing inside here. That's due to the type of people that worked on this area.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:37.090
The people working here were important. Well, they weren't 'important'...They worked for the princesses of the sun.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:41.140
And you'll see that there are more steps here in more of a trapezoidal shape. This means that they're attached to a more narrow area...

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:57.980
   

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.250
(Destin) What's up man?

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:27.980
      

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.980
(Destin in Spanish) Crazy? 

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.980
(Destin) Hello, how are you?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.980
- Fine, how are you?
- I'm well. How are you?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.980
- Have a nice trip.
- Thank you, and you.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.560
(Man) Wow nice.
[laugh]

00:12:45.580 --> 00:13:33.930
           

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:37.980
(Destin, voice echoing in cave) Well, it doesn't go anywhere. It closes off; I don't know if the camera can see that.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Doesn't look like this was on purpose, though.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.020
That's a good cornerstone went there, once upon a time.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:14:02.980
   

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.180
If my wife was here, I would kiss her right there.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:15:11.980
                

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.920
This is pretty cool. They terrace it off like this so that they can farm. 

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:21.980
If the grade's super steep--like that over there--you can't farm, but if you terrace it off you can. 

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.980
It's pretty awesome.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:32.010
They said they had enough farming space to feed more than four times the capacity, people-wise, of Macchu Picchu.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.960
What? Seriously?

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:51.100
  

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.130
Wow.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:59.150
If you're hearing me breathing hard it's because I am.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:44.980
          

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.940
Heh, a broom.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.020
Check out the stones above the windows. It's pretty heavy.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:15.030
   

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.150
So what do you think this was for?

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:22.160
Keeping a vase or something here?

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:47.300
     

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.330
(Destin in Spanish) Goodbye.
(Woman in Spanish) How do you fire the flash?

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:54.370
- What? Flash?

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:58.410
Sorry, my spanish is very bad.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:02.420
- How do you do it?
- I don't have a flash.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.440
- ... Picture?
- Yes.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:10.490
Is it good?
- It's good.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:18.550
 

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.570
Oh wow.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:30.620
(Tour guide in Spanish) A few minutes of explanation, then some pictures. ok?

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.660
Hi walking camera.
(Destin in Spanish) Hi.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:54.980
    

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.800
(Destin) Hey, is the red light still blinking up here?
-Yep.
- Great.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.880
(Destin) How's it going.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.920
Oh, man, they even had running water! [laugh]

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.960
(Destin) How's it going?
(Woman) Hey! Good, good.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:28.510
 

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:31.040
(Destin) Is that a Red Sox fan?

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:35.060
- No...
- Nope? [laugh]

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:48.120
  

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:51.140
I'm in some jungle now.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:59.980
 

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.190
(Destin in Spanish) Good afternoon.
(Woman in Spanish) Good afternoon.

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:12.280
 

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.320
(Destin in Spanish) Funny? [laugh]

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:43.980
      

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.540
(Destin) Hello.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.580
(Women) Hello.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:21:05.980
   

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.740
(Destin) Oh, llamas.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.980
(Man in Brazilian Portugese) Over there people are climbing down.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.820
(Destin) Excuse me.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:39.920
   

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.340
(Man in Spanish) Hey look. Look at the mister with the camera, look at his camera.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:47.970
(Destin in Spanish) Hi.
(Kid in Spanish) Why is he carrying a camera?

00:21:47.990 --> 00:22:35.050
           

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:40.270
Llamas are bigger than I thought.

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:49.330
Here, you want some grass? [laugh]

00:22:49.350 --> 00:23:16.490
      

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:20.510
(Man in spanish) Greetings.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.550
So apparently I wasn't supposed to walk across that field like I did earlier.

00:23:28.570 --> 00:24:16.860
           

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.880
(Woman) Hi.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.930
Um...That is not the way. Hello? Hello? It's not the way.

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:28.970
(Destin) It's the wrong way. Yes. Thank you.

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:37.030
 

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:41.070
Go ahead. You first.

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:53.160
  

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:57.180
(Man in broken english) Mister please,

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.980
it's down, it's going down.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.240
(Destin in Spanish) That way?

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:06.270
(Destin) I'm in trouble again.

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:13.310
(Destin in Spanish) Which direction, Sir?

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:15.350
(Destin) Yeah I'm in trouble again.

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:21.370
(Destin in Spanish) Which direction, Sir?

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:27.480
Yes. There?

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.410
How many years have you worked here?

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.040
(Man in Spanish) 8 months, nothing more.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:38.460
- 8 months? Only 8 months!? Nine?

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.500
- Is it fun?
- Yes, yes.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.520
- Which part is your favourite?
- All of it!

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:49.540
- Everything? The people?

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:57.600
- Good, thank you.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:35.980
         

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.910
(Destin in Spanish) Hello.
(Man in Spanish) Hello.

00:26:41.930 --> 00:27:11.130
      

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:14.170
(Man in German) There he is again!

00:27:14.190 --> 00:28:04.680
           

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.550
(Man in Spanish) Speak english?
- Sorry?

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:12.020
(Destin in Spanish) Yes.
(In English) - Do you just push a button for that?
- Yeah. I'm getting audio.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.660
Just like I hear it.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.680
And this is a camera.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- That's awesome.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:21.180
- It's pretty cool.
- A lot better than this.
- No, no, no! It'll be on YouTube, Smarter Every Day.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.680
- Smarter Every Day.
- Yeah, check it out.
- Okay I'll do that.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:26.710
-Where you from?
- Kansas City, Missouri.
- Cool, I'm from Alabama.
- Alabama?

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:28.010
- Yeah, with a banjo on my knee.
- Alrighty!

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:31.750
- Take it easy!
- Smarter Every Day?
- Yep!
- Okay, I'll do that.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:30:09.440
                      

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.470
[Women cat calling]

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.520
Getting cat calls

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:27.570
 

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:31.590
(Man in Spanish)  Camera?, That's a camera?
(Destin in Spanish) On my head, yes.

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:35.630
(Man in English) Haha, it's very curious, i never saw one like this.
(Destin) Yes.
- Where are you from?

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:39.670
- Alabama, America, Estados Unidos.
- Wow. Wonder place.
(Destin in Spanish) Yes.

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:59.000
    

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:03.810
Oh, this is bigger. 

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:07.830
Wow. I'd sleep in there. It's like a fort.

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:19.920
  

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.950
The Incas were very advanced in their ladder technology.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:30.980
 

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
So I have to get up there.

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:40.020
Where the cameras are. I see the Gigapan sweeping... 

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.050
So... Wrong way.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:32:18.230
       

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:20.240
You can see without mortar, just the stone on the stone, the high quality of the construction. The Inca used...

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:33.020
  

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:36.340
That's a big rock.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:44.390
 

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:48.430
Well, this concludes your Machu Picchu experience. We saw llamas,

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:50.980
we got whistled at by girls, which never happens. That actually happened.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
- You got whistled at?

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:18.050
I actually walked across the green plaza. I didn't know I wasn't supposed to.

- Right in the middle of it?

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:24.710
