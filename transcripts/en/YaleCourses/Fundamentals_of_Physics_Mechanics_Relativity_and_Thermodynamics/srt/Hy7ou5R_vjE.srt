1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,330
Everything I told you last time,

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,560
you can summarize in these two equations.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,473
Okay.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,960
Do you remember what we did?
We said,

5
00:00:11,961 --> 00:00:16,610
let's take for the simplest case
that we can possibly imagine,

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,360
namely a particle moving in one dimension
along the x axis with a constant

7
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:27,350
acceleration, a what is
the fate of this particle?

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:32,530
And the answer was at any time t the
location of the particle is given by this

9
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:35,804
formula.

10
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,243
Yeah,

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,200
you can easily check by
taking two derivatives.

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,400
This particle does have
the acceleration a,

13
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:53,340
so what are these two other numbers?
X Zero and V zero x, not in Vienna.

14
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,890
I think we know what they mean.

15
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,590
They're tell you the initial location
and initial velocity of the object.

16
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:02,630
For example,

17
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,630
suppose you use vertical motion and use
y instead of x and a would be g r minus

18
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:13,070
G. That's a particle falling
down under the effect of gravity.

19
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,550
If all you know is the particular is
falling out of the effect of gravity,

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,550
that's not enough to say
where the particle is, right?

21
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,690
Suppose we all go to a tall building,
start throwing things at various times,

22
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,430
various speeds. We're all throwing
objects was acceleration is minus g,

23
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,170
but the objects that are different
locations at a given time,

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,480
that's because they could have been
released from different heights with

25
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,500
different initial velocities.
Therefore,

26
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:41,920
it's not simply enough to
say what the acceleration is.

27
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,820
You have to give these two numbers.

28
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,510
Then once you got those two numbers
that no longer free parameters,

29
00:01:47,511 --> 00:01:51,830
they are concrete numbers,
maybe five and nine, 10 foot.

30
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,520
Anytime t you plug into at the time
t and you will get the location.

31
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,010
If you took the derivative of this,
we'd get the velocity at time.

32
00:02:01,011 --> 00:02:05,900
T two B v not plus eight t again,

33
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:09,680
you shouldn't memorize the formula. I
hope you know why it makes sense, right?

34
00:02:09,681 --> 00:02:13,010
You want know how fast the guy is
moving this, the starting speed,

35
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,970
that's the rate that we did is gaining
velocity and that's how long it's been

36
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,470
gaining it.
So you add the two.

37
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,610
This also means the following.

38
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,550
It is true that if you give me the time,
I can tell you the velocity,

39
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,300
but conversely,
if I knew the velocity of this object,

40
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,140
I also know what time it is probated.
I knew the initial velocity.

41
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,610
Therefore mathematically
I'd they given time tea,

42
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:44,600
we can trade t four V and
put it into this formula,

43
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,070
vanish tea everywhere by doing it.
I got this formula.

44
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,993
Yeah

45
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,900
is a mattress, simple Algebra of
taking this and putting it here.

46
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,640
But I showed you in the end how you
can use calculus to derive that.

47
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,650
And I got the feeling when I was talking
to some of you guys that maybe you

48
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:16,500
should brush up on your calculus.
You have done it before. But uh,

49
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,510
when you say I know calculus,
sometimes it means you know,

50
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:21,180
it sometimes it means you know,

51
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:26,210
some fellow who does or you met somebody
who knows that's not good enough.

52
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,530
You really have to know calculus
and this is a constant problem.

53
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:32,550
It's nothing to do with uh,
you guys said.

54
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,570
It's just that you have
done it at various times.

55
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:37,870
It's a problem we have dealt with in
the physics department year after year.

56
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:43,530
And one solution for that is to get a
copy of the textbook I wrote called basic

57
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:49,030
training in mathematics.
It's about paper back or 30 bucks.

58
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,960
And I will, I've given the name of
the book in the classes website.

59
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,300
If I hadn't written it I would prescribe
it. But that is a little awkward moment.

60
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:00,550
You don't want to sell your own book.
On the other hand,

61
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:03,700
you don't have to withhold information
that may be useful to the class.

62
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,330
So I think that book will give you all
the basic principles you need in calculus

63
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,510
one variable more variables,
elementary, complex numbers,

64
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,720
maybe solving some problems
with vectors and so on,

65
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:20,920
which are going to get into whether you're
going to physics or not is irrelevant.

66
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:23,350
If you're going to any
science that uses mathematics,

67
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,530
chemistry or engineering
or even economics,

68
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,950
you should find the contents
of that useful. So I think, uh,

69
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,490
it'll be in your interest to
get that anywhere you like.

70
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:39,310
You can go to Amazon or you can go to
our bookstore bookstore has some copies,

71
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:41,050
but they're really for another course.

72
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:45,670
So you should look at it then
order it on your own. Okay.

73
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,700
So I will now proceed to the
actual subject matter for today.

74
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,191
So I told you,

75
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:56,980
the way I'm going to teach any subject
is going to start with the easiest

76
00:04:56,981 --> 00:05:01,981
example and lull you into some kind of
security and then slowly increase the

77
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:05,590
difficulty.
So what's the next difficult thing?

78
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,520
Next difficult thing is to consider
a motion in higher dimensions.

79
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,190
So how high do you want to go?
Now for most of us,

80
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,370
we can go up to three dimensions because
we know we live in a three dimensional

81
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:22,780
world. Everything moves around in three
d that that'll be enough for this course.

82
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,614
In fact,

83
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,450
I'm going to use only two dimensions for
most of the time because the difference

84
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:33,250
between one dimension and two is very
great between two and three and four and

85
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:34,720
so on.
It's not very different.

86
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,600
There's only one occasion where it helps
to go to three dimensions because at a

87
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:43,480
certain things you can do in three
d you cannot do in less than freely,

88
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:48,730
but that's later. So we don't have to
worry about that. So we'll stop it too.

89
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,390
If you talk to the string theorists,
they will tell you that are really,

90
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,250
how many dimensions do you know

91
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,800
that are actually 10 including space and
times that are nine spatial dimensions.

92
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:02,540
That's according string guys.

93
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,470
So mathematicians are likely lead told
us how to analyze a mathematics in any

94
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:09,680
number of dimensions.

95
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,850
We don't pay attention to them when they
are going beyond three but now we know

96
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,890
we need that.
We're going to do too.

97
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,950
So our picture now,

98
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,150
it's going to be some particle
that's traveling in the x y plane.

99
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,780
So the guy who's just
moving around like this,

100
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,210
this is not an experts as time
plot at white versus time.

101
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,630
This the actual motion of the particle
and if you say where this time,

102
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,130
but one way to mark climates,

103
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,890
they imagined that it carries a clock
as it moves and put markers every second

104
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,490
that may be a t equal to zero t equals
to one t equal the two and so on.

105
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,470
So time is measured as a parameter
along the motion of the particles.

106
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,890
It is not explicitly shown,

107
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,730
but you can sort of tell the particles
moving slowly or rapidly by looking at

108
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:05,470
the space in between these tick marks.

109
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,310
For example here in one second it went
from here to here, he hadn't one second.

110
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,740
It seems to have gone much
further so probably is traveling

111
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,053
faster.

112
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,360
But if you want to describe this particle,
what's the kinematics?

113
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,010
You can pick a point and
say I am at the point x y.

114
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,460
So when you go to two dimensions,

115
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:29,940
you need a pair of numbers
instead of x you need x and y.

116
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:35,550
But what we will find is
this more convenience to
lump these two numbers in the

117
00:07:35,551 --> 00:07:37,260
single entity,
which is called a vector.

118
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,110
So that's what we're going
to talk about a little bit.

119
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,400
Talk a little bit about vectors.
Now you guys,

120
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,320
I've also seen vectors,
I'm pretty sure,

121
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:51,321
but it is worth going over some properties
and some may be new and some may be

122
00:07:51,691 --> 00:07:52,524
old.

123
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:58,850
So the simplest context in which one can
motivate a vector and also motivate the

124
00:08:00,631 --> 00:08:05,580
rules for dealing with vectors
is when you look at a real space.

125
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,240
I mean just caught and it's x
and y and let's imagine that the,

126
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,680
I went on a camping trip and on
the first day here is where I was.

127
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,250
Then I tell you,

128
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,460
I went for five kilometers on the second
day and another five kilometers in the

129
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:31,080
third day. Then I asked you, where am I?

130
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,810
How far am I from camp?
You realize that you cannot answer that.

131
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,900
You cannot answer that. Even if I
promise to move only along the x axis,

132
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,210
because as I think,

133
00:08:45,211 --> 00:08:48,180
I don't want to post this as a question
because I think the answer is fairly

134
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:51,630
obvious to everybody. It's not enough
to say, I went five kilometers.

135
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,750
I got to tell you whether I went to the
right or whether I went to the left,

136
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,300
so I could be 10 kilometers from home.
I could be zero kilometers from home,

137
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,020
or I could be minus 10 if I
had gone two steps to the left.

138
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,000
But you can deal with this bike
saying not just five kilometers,

139
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:10,740
but plus or minus five kilometers.

140
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:15,480
If you give a sign on top of the number
that takes care of all ambiguity in one

141
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:19,950
dimension. So assigned a number is
adequate to keep track of my emotion.

142
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,990
But you know in two d the options that
are just left and right or north and

143
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,650
south, but infinity of possible
directions in which I could go.

144
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,610
There's five kilometers.

145
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:35,150
So what I could do on the first day is
to come here on the second day could be

146
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:38,640
to go there.
These two guys are five kilometers long

147
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:45,400
for that purpose to describe that
displacement, we use a vector,

148
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,570
this is called a vector.
Going to give it a name a,

149
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,570
it starts from the origin
and goes to this point.

150
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:59,070
That is a description of what I did on
the first day and the second day I did

151
00:10:00,941 --> 00:10:05,350
this and that is the description
of what it did on the second day.

152
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,200
But proper way to draw
vector is to draw an arrow.

153
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,450
It's got a beginning and it's got an ad.

154
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,453
Yeah.

155
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:18,520
So this is the reason behind seeing a
vector as a magnitude and direction.

156
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,120
Well magnitude is how long this guy isn't.
That action is at what angle it is,

157
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,520
so this is a, and this is B and now
you realize that, oh by the way,

158
00:10:27,521 --> 00:10:29,800
when you draw a vector like a,

159
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,180
you're supposed to put a little arrow on
top. If you don't put an Arrow on top,

160
00:10:34,181 --> 00:10:37,540
it means you're talking about just a
number a which could be positive or

161
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,120
negative or complex,
but it's just an ordinary number.

162
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,720
If you want to talk about
an Arrow of any kind,

163
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,080
you got to put a little arrow
on top of it. In a textbook,

164
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:49,810
they use boldface letters and classroom.

165
00:10:49,811 --> 00:10:53,620
You use the symbol like this is a,
this is B.

166
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,300
It's a very natural quantity
that you can call a plus B.

167
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,570
If you want to call something as a plus B,

168
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,740
it means that I did a and then I did B,

169
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,690
but if I want to do it all in one shot,

170
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,990
what is the equivalence
step I should take?

171
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:16,410
It's obvious that the bottom line of
my two day trip is this object C and we

172
00:11:19,061 --> 00:11:20,410
will call that a plus B.

173
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:26,160
It does represent the sum in the sense
that if I gave you four bucks and then

174
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,520
gave you five bucks,
I gave you effectively nine.

175
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,660
Here we are not talking
about a single number,

176
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:36,160
but a displacement in the plane and
see in d represents an effective

177
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,143
displacement.

178
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,280
This is the rule for adding vectors and
it has an origin in the simple example.

179
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:44,921
Okay,

180
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:48,400
so rule for adding the two vectors is
you draw the first one and at the end of

181
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:52,900
that first one you begin the second one
and the sun starts at the beginning of

182
00:11:52,901 --> 00:11:56,110
the and and said the end of the second.

183
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,990
Okay? So that tells you how to
add two vectors and get a song.

184
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,100
You can verify in this simple example
that a plus B is the same as B plus a,

185
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,290
B plus h would be first Robbie.

186
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,860
And from there you draw a and you
will end up with the same point.

187
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,160
So you say this is a community of law.

188
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,370
It doesn't matter the sequence
in which you add the two vectors.

189
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,400
We know that's true for ordinary numbers,
right?

190
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,660
Three plus four and four plus years.
Same is also true for factors,

191
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,900
but the off composition
is not always commuted.

192
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,980
That are certain occasions in which
you first do a and then you do B.

193
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:44,340
That's not the same as far as doing B
and then doing a come to that later.

194
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:50,530
Right now this is the simple law.
All right?

195
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,000
Next thing I want to do is to define a
vector that plays the role of the number

196
00:12:56,001 --> 00:13:00,940
zero, the number zero as a property
when you added to any number,

197
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:02,050
it doesn't make a difference.

198
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:06,760
I want a vector that I want to call
the zero vector and it should have the

199
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:10,570
property that I added to anybody.
I get the same vector

200
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:17,170
so you can guess who the zero of activist
zero vectors vector of no length.

201
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,880
I cannot. If this is a, I'm
going to drive back to here,

202
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:24,280
I cannot show you the zero vac.
The minute you can see it,

203
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,830
I'm doing something wrong,
right? If you can see it,

204
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,010
it's wrong because it's not
supposed to have any length,

205
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,390
but it has a property that when you add
it to anything, you get the same vector.

206
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,670
So that vector is called the null vector.

207
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,330
How about this guy?
I draw a,

208
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,130
then I draw another day.

209
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,653
Okay.

210
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,790
This is a plus.
A

211
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:56,430
No.

212
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:01,430
You have to agree that there's any vector
that deserved be called to a is this

213
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:05,690
guy, right? This is a plus a,
so we're going to call it to a,

214
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:12,200
the beauty of that is now we have
discovered a notion of what it means to

215
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:14,180
multiply the vector by a number.

216
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,500
If you multiply it by two you
get a vector two times as long,

217
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,780
but then you're able to generalize that
and say if you're multiplied by 2.6 I

218
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:27,080
mean a vector 2.6 hours long.
I see.

219
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,150
So multiplying vector by a number
means stretch it by the factor.

220
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,160
Then I want to think of a vector
that I can call minus eight

221
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,960
what do I expect of minus EI?

222
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,740
I expect that if it had minus a to a,

223
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,070
I should get the guy who plays
at all at zero in this world,

224
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,750
which is the vector of no length

225
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:57,340
is very clear that if you want to take
a and ask what should the APP to a play

226
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,700
get the nol vector,

227
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,300
it's clear that you want to add a vector
that looks like that because then if

228
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,400
you go from the start of
this to the finish of that,

229
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,770
you end up at the same point and you
get this invisible pseudo vector,

230
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:13,760
so the minus vector is that the same
vector flipped over to point the opposite

231
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:18,710
way. That's like minus one times
the vector. Once you got that,

232
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:21,950
you can do minus seven times of
vector minus Pi Times the vector.

233
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,220
Just take the vector multiplied
by Pi and flip it over.

234
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,910
That's minus Pi Times the vector.
This sub,

235
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,920
you get the rules for adding a vector to
another vector than taking a vector and

236
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:35,510
multiplying it by some constant.

237
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,110
Then of course you can do
more complicated things.

238
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:42,110
You can take this vector multiplied
by one number, take that vector,

239
00:15:42,111 --> 00:15:44,300
multiply in other number,
add the two of them.

240
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,520
We know what all does operations mean.
No,

241
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,260
but you don't have to memorize all this.
There's only rulers.

242
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,220
Do what comes naturally to what you would
normally do with ordinating numbers in

243
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,750
the seems to work for vectors.

244
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,660
But you should know about multiplying
vector by a number of means.

245
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,220
All right, so this is the
notion of what vectors are not.

246
00:16:06,221 --> 00:16:09,860
We are going to come to
some important concept,

247
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,810
which is the following.

248
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,980
You go back to the same x white plane.
Yeah.

249
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:21,620
There's some vectors. A gonna
introduce two very special vectors.

250
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:28,130
They're called a unit vectors.
And this guy I, that is Jay.

251
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:31,130
If I had a third access, I would
draw a k, but we don't need that.

252
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,760
So I and J are vectors of length
one pointing along x and Y.

253
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,530
Okay?
The claim is I can write any vector.

254
00:16:41,531 --> 00:16:46,300
They give me us a rescale.
I plus a rescale.

255
00:16:46,301 --> 00:16:47,134
Jay,

256
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,950
there's nothing you can throw at me that
I cannot handle with some multiple of

257
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:54,280
ions, some multiple of Jay.
No, it's intuitively clear,

258
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:58,710
but I will just prove it beyond any
doubt. Here's the vector. The A,

259
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:04,310
it is clear that that vector is the sum
of that vector and that vector by the

260
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,540
rules of accurate dish.
Right?

261
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:11,680
Because that plus that is equal
to the a but how about this part?

262
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,200
This part being paralleled to,
I has to be a multiple level high.

263
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,110
We know that because you can stretch.
I buy whatever factory life.

264
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,310
So whatever number it takes a x times.
I use this part,

265
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,980
this part being paralleled to Jay has
to be some multiple of jam going to call

266
00:17:29,981 --> 00:17:34,850
it a y. Therefore, the fact
that aid that you gave me,

267
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,360
I have managed to write as
I times x let's j times a y.

268
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,200
So you can ask yourself, if you
gave me a particular vector, uh,

269
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,070
what do I use for x and a y?

270
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,890
[inaudible] you can see from trigonometry
that this angle will stay there, here

271
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,920
and the, the length of the
vector, I'm going to call by EI.

272
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:09,150
Ei is the length
of the,

273
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,140
if you drop the Arrow,
it's the usual convention.

274
00:18:12,141 --> 00:18:13,700
As you're talking about the
length of the wreck today.

275
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,293
Okay.

276
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:16,791
First of all,

277
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:21,791
it's clear from the Pythagoras theorem
that ey is square root of x squared

278
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,910
plus eight wide square

279
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:34,130
and the angle Taita that it makes with
the x axis satisfies the condition time

280
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,860
Tito a y over the air.

281
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:47,470
So what this means now, here's the main
point. If you give me a pair of numbers,

282
00:18:47,471 --> 00:18:48,430
a x and a y,

283
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:54,300
that's as good as giving me this Arrow
because I can find the length of the

284
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:58,870
Arrow by Pythagoras theorem and I could
find the orientation of the Arrow by

285
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:02,620
saying the angle Taito satisfied.
Stamped it is a boy over there.

286
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:03,603
Yes.

287
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,670
So you have the option of either working
with the two components of a odd with

288
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:12,830
the Arrow?
No,

289
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,170
in practice, most of the time the work
with these two numbers, a x and a y.

290
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,290
Yeah.

291
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:24,400
If you're describing a
particle with location, are

292
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:30,930
the vector be used typically to locate
the particles are than r is just I times

293
00:19:32,591 --> 00:19:35,290
x plus j times.
Why?

294
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,830
Because you all know
that's x and that's why

295
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,690
no, I've not given you any other
example besides the displacement vector,

296
00:19:48,691 --> 00:19:53,691
but at the moment we'll define a vector
to be any object which looks like some

297
00:19:53,701 --> 00:19:55,530
multiple of Aipla,
some multiple of Jay.

298
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,500
So suppose I tell you to
add two vectors a and B

299
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:12,030
equal to c and I say, what's the result
of adding a and B? You got two options.

300
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,600
You can draw the Arrow corresponding to a,

301
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,820
then you make an Arrow corresponding to
be laid on the edge of this one that add

302
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:22,200
them as shown here.

303
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,843
Okay?

304
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,550
But you can also do
something with a drawing.

305
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:30,300
Any pictures that would come by saying,

306
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:35,750
I'm taking I times x Plus j
times a y plus I times dx.

307
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,420
Let Dave Times be why and I'm
trying to add all these guys,

308
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:49,160
but then I combine it time say x was
I times be x because that's the vector

309
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:53,800
paddle to I the length, the x, that's
the vector pilot. Do I with length be x?

310
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:54,940
It's clear if I add them,

311
00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:00,370
I would get a vector parallel
to eye for the links X. Plus bx.

312
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,080
Then Jake will a wife.
Let's be why.

313
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,530
I have to be really careful
when I said I had the lengths.

314
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,250
I'm assuming all the components or
positive x and a y. Some are positive,

315
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:14,770
some are negative.
This is the way by which we are.

316
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,850
We have learned we should
combine multiple supply.

317
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,940
When I give you a multiple of
iron and other multiple of either,

318
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,030
some has got assets coefficient,
the sum of the two coefficients.

319
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,420
This is when you add two vectors.

320
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:33,540
You just add the components so that
if this vector is called I time see

321
00:21:34,491 --> 00:21:36,100
explicitly eight times.
See why.

322
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,050
Then it's worth knowing
that CX is a explicit bx

323
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,670
and see why is a why plus B y.

324
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,840
So most of the time when
we deal with vectors,

325
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,820
we don't draw these arrows anymore.

326
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:57,240
We just keep a pair of numbers and if
you give me another vector that's another

327
00:21:57,241 --> 00:22:01,260
pair of numbers and if you say add
the vectors, I will decide the x two,

328
00:22:01,261 --> 00:22:04,560
the x and the y to the y and I
keeping track of what the summer is.

329
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,830
A very important result is
that if two vectors are equal,

330
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,730
if a equals B,

331
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:20,300
the only way it can happen
is if separately x is equal
to be x and a y is equal

332
00:22:21,721 --> 00:22:22,554
to B.
Why?

333
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,920
That's the very important difference.

334
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:33,830
You cannot have two vectors equal
with exactly the same x component.

335
00:22:33,831 --> 00:22:37,010
Exactly the same way component. That's
pretty obvious. If two arrows are equal,

336
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,540
you cannot be longer than the esthetician
and correspondingly shorter the white

337
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:44,960
election, everything has to completely
match. So back to the equation,

338
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,100
e equals B is actually a
shorthand for two equations.

339
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,770
They export some match
in the white parts mass.

340
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,460
Okay. Now when you work
with components x and a y,

341
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,280
if I didn't mention it,
the other components of the vector,

342
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,680
so you can do all your bookkeeping
in terms of aics anyway,

343
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,460
but he got to be aware of one fact.

344
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,860
If I just come and say to you here,

345
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:20,180
here's the vector whose
components three and five.

346
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,890
Can you draw the vector for me? Can you
draw it or not? Cause anybody have a view?

347
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:30,830
Yes. No, yes, no. Pardon me.

348
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:36,260
Yeah. If if you immediately said,
well, if the vector is three,

349
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:39,230
four then the vector looks like this.

350
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,810
You're making the assumption that I am
writing the vector in terms of I and G,

351
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,440
I see I n g s but in natural direction.

352
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:50,710
For most of us gravity acts this way,

353
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:54,610
defines the vertical direction very
naturally than the blackboard is oriented.

354
00:23:54,611 --> 00:23:55,000
This way.

355
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,540
It should be a natural to call that x
and a call that y and lineup or axes.

356
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:04,090
What do you agree that there is no reason
why somebody else gonna come along and

357
00:24:04,091 --> 00:24:06,760
say, you know what? I want to
use a different set of axes.

358
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,200
Those directions are more natural for me.
In fact,

359
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,820
just because the world is around,

360
00:24:12,821 --> 00:24:17,821
you can already see this is the earth
to somebody that's a natural direction.

361
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,560
If you go to another neighboring country,

362
00:24:20,561 --> 00:24:22,550
that's what they think
is naturally x and wife.

363
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:26,590
There is no reason why x and y
are nailed an absolute space.

364
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,270
It's very important that x and y are
human constructs and we're not wedded to

365
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:34,690
any of them quite often as natural
to pick x and Y in a certain way.

366
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,240
If you're studying a predict
child near the earth,

367
00:24:37,241 --> 00:24:40,120
it makes sense to pick the
horizontal is x and vertical is y,

368
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,020
but mathematically you don't have to.

369
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,370
It's a very important point
that comes up is the following.

370
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,240
What if somebody comes along and has got
a new access and here's a unit vector I

371
00:24:55,331 --> 00:24:56,164
prime,

372
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:01,770
that's unit vector j prime and here's
this vector a and the angle between my

373
00:25:03,761 --> 00:25:07,420
access let's say,
and your access is some angle Phi.

374
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:16,790
The same vector at a can be written either
in terms of I and J are in terms of I

375
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:19,590
prime and j prime.

376
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:28,060
So let's take a minute to just play this
game of asking how were the compliments

377
00:25:28,061 --> 00:25:32,740
of a in the new rotated coordinate
system related to the components,

378
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,880
the old coordinate system. This is a
simple problem but I just want to do it.

379
00:25:36,881 --> 00:25:38,920
So you get used to working with vectors.

380
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,520
So the point is the ADOT a,

381
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:47,970
somebody is chosen the right in terms
of Ip crime and j prime as a prime and a

382
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:53,110
white print.
You guys follow that?

383
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:58,000
I prime a j prime but now rotated unit
vectors and somebody wants to think in

384
00:25:58,001 --> 00:25:59,050
terms of those.
In other words,

385
00:25:59,051 --> 00:26:03,070
the person who wants to ask how much
I've tried him, how my j prime need,

386
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,370
do I need to build up the Vec today?
That person would get a different answer.

387
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:10,990
You're asking how much I and how much
do I need to build the same object.

388
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,660
So the same entity written
in two different ways.

389
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,813
So

390
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,230
she's got a pair of numbers
and you got a pair of numbers.

391
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,640
The numbers are called the prime numbers
and you want to write them in terms of

392
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:25,520
yours. But for that, what do you need?

393
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,560
You need to know what I
primus in terms of ing.

394
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,710
So let's draw a little picture on
the side here. This is Ip crime.

395
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,160
It's got a link to one.
It's an angle Phi.

396
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,293
So

397
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,690
I'm going to write something and I'll
wait till you guys tell me you are

398
00:26:43,691 --> 00:26:44,550
comfortable with this.

399
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:49,551
I try miss I co signed
fi plus j sine fine.

400
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,280
There should not be anybody in this
room is mystified by this statement.

401
00:26:56,281 --> 00:27:01,281
This vector I prime has got a horizontal
part which is it's linked with just one

402
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:06,090
time score signed Phi and the vertical
part, which is one times signed Phi.

403
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,380
This kind of trigonometry you
should know all the time. Okay.

404
00:27:10,381 --> 00:27:13,830
It's not something you're going to go
back and remember he said opposite side is

405
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:14,670
that or do some site.

406
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,840
You got to know that really well so you've
got to be very used to the notion of

407
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:22,410
taking it back it in some oblique.
That action writing it in terms of ing,

408
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:27,900
how bout j Prime Day prime is
pointing in that direction.

409
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,690
It's at an angle Phi

410
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,440
so j prime
would be minus I signed fine.

411
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,960
Plus j equals sign five
if it's not obvious,

412
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:48,250
I think this is the kind
of thing you should fill in
the blanks when you go home,

413
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:51,310
leave aligned there and think about
it and fill in the blanks later.

414
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,390
Very important to know if
these two axes at an angle Phi,

415
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,760
those two axes are also wrangled.
Fine.

416
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,430
That's the design to use
all the time and mechanics.

417
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,040
So once you do that,

418
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:06,070
I think it's fairly clear that it has
got a weight component that's given by

419
00:28:06,071 --> 00:28:10,630
coast sign and x component that's given
by sign fi but x component is negative.

420
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,510
This vector as a little
bit of negative ions.

421
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,400
Here's what I say you should do and this
is the kind of thing I don't want to do

422
00:28:18,401 --> 00:28:21,640
in classroom. It takes time and
I'm probably going to screw up.

423
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:27,120
So imagine taking I prime and j
prime and stick them here and here

424
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,100
do this in your head and
ask what can I possibly get?

425
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,980
I prime and j prime had been banished
everywhere they replaced by I and J so you

426
00:28:40,091 --> 00:28:45,091
can now collect the whole expression as
something something I plus something.

427
00:28:45,251 --> 00:28:48,180
Something Jay and what you will get four.

428
00:28:48,181 --> 00:28:53,181
I will be x course sign fi minus a y sign
fi than here you will get a white Kosa

429
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:04,430
in FY plus x sign five.

430
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,493
Okay.

431
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,300
This is the only part I
don't want to do explicitly.

432
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:15,460
I'm just saying take this and
put it there and combined Imj

433
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,840
but this is the same vector.

434
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,670
We are calling it a
times x plus j times 81

435
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:29,670
and I've totally of two vectors that
equal the components mismatch I made then.

436
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,020
I'm sorry I'm making a mistake here.
This should be primed.

437
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,443
Okay.

438
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:42,880
By the way, when you guys do this,
did anybody notice subprime? Yeah,

439
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,770
so if you noticed it,
you got to stop.

440
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,850
You cannot let me write
anything that's incorrect.

441
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,930
So you've got to follow it in some detail.
I know you couldn't do the details,

442
00:29:52,931 --> 00:29:56,890
but you should at least know that is I
prime and j prime that have been replaced

443
00:29:56,891 --> 00:30:01,180
by I and j. But a experiment, a prime
will continue to be the coefficients.

444
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,150
So if I make the comparison,

445
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,950
I find x is equal to x prime cosigned Phi

446
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:15,540
minus a white prime signed Phi and a
y is equal to minus x prime sign Fi.

447
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,450
Let's say y prime cosigned Phi.

448
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,600
So what's the purpose of the exercise?

449
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,090
Purpose of the exercise
is to make the following

450
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,810
precisely to remark.

451
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:40,410
You can pick your unit vectors are
what are called basis vectors anyway.

452
00:30:40,901 --> 00:30:45,100
You like pick any two
perpendicular directions which
may be related to the ones

453
00:30:45,101 --> 00:30:49,660
I picked by an angle.
Phi. Then the same entity,

454
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:54,870
the same Arrow we test an existence
of its own independent of axes can be

455
00:30:55,241 --> 00:30:57,400
described by you and me
using different numbers.

456
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,240
That's the precise connection between
the numbers you use the numbers.

457
00:31:01,241 --> 00:31:06,220
I use your numbers. The prime on it
are related to mind by this relation.

458
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,910
No.
You can ask the opposite question.

459
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:15,620
How do I get your numbers
in terms of my numbers,

460
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:22,690
so what should I do?
They want inward.

461
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,620
The relation. Anybody have an
idea of what I should do now?

462
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:37,130
No one has a clue on how.
Why can go back from these to that.

463
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:44,790
Let me take a second to ask.
Do you have any idea what you should do?

464
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,190
Okay.
Maybe you are a yes.

465
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:02,020
Yep.
Expressions

466
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:09,330
are a prime x for every eight x and vice
versa and then just using the negative

467
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:15,390
negative a fee. Yes. Okay. All right,

468
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:20,391
so his idea was the formula written for
the opposite one will have the opposite

469
00:32:22,711 --> 00:32:25,350
angle replaces five by minus of that.

470
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,740
Now that turns out to be the
correct answer, but I will.

471
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:33,420
I want you to guys to think about why
it was difficult to do it another way,

472
00:32:33,421 --> 00:32:34,470
which is more pedestrian.

473
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:39,980
I mean if I told you a three x plus two
is nine and four x plus six is six you

474
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:47,150
certainly know how to solve for x and Y,
right?

475
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,540
This is something you've
seen in your high school.

476
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,320
You got to juggle the two equations,
multiply that by four,

477
00:32:54,321 --> 00:32:56,960
multiply that by three and
add and subtract and so on.

478
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,700
Why is it when you saw this,
you didn't realize it's the same problem,

479
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:05,890
but it's the same problem. It's
fine. You said angle sine and cosine.

480
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:08,540
Definitely numbers.
If I pick an angle of 60 degrees,

481
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,320
these are some numbers like half
and root three over to that.

482
00:33:12,321 --> 00:33:14,340
I'm trying to write uh,

483
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:19,010
these two unknowns in terms of these
two loans and they can solve for them

484
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,710
here though, what you will multiply by
would be signed fines and costs and five,

485
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,240
so you can eliminate,
for example,

486
00:33:26,241 --> 00:33:31,220
if you multiply this by sign five and
multiply this by course and fire an add

487
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:33,320
them x prime will drop out.

488
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:37,490
So that's the kind of thing you should do.
Maybe you should,

489
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,820
I will add this on as a problem.
You should do it in the homework,

490
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:46,980
but do you realize that this is pair of
simultaneous equations in which you can

491
00:33:46,981 --> 00:33:50,970
solve for these two unknowns if you like,

492
00:33:50,971 --> 00:33:53,760
in terms of these two nodes
and these coefficients,

493
00:33:53,761 --> 00:33:56,760
which are like these numbers
three to four and six,

494
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,890
you can do that.

495
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:03,500
But we like to get the answer the way
this gentleman described it because we'd

496
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:07,290
like to get an answer more readily
than by doing the mundane work.

497
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,630
And the idea that he had was,

498
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,350
if you go from me to you
with a clockwise rotation,

499
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,420
you go from you to me by
counterclockwise rotation. Therefore,

500
00:34:18,421 --> 00:34:22,740
if I, my angle, if I go by fi to you,

501
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:26,580
then you must go by minus five
to come to me. That's correct.

502
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:31,080
So you will find them.
The result is aix course and fine.

503
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,420
Let's say sign fine.

504
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:38,280
I'm using the fact that when you take a
course sign and change the angle inside

505
00:34:38,281 --> 00:34:40,050
the code sign,
it doesn't care.

506
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,410
But if you go to the sign
and change the angle inside,

507
00:34:43,411 --> 00:34:45,750
the sign becomes minus side.
In other words,

508
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:51,740
sign of minus theta is minus sine
data and of course then of minus data,

509
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,870
this goes same data.
These by the way,

510
00:34:54,871 --> 00:34:59,430
is another property I expect people to
know in this course. You cannot say,

511
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,890
I've never heard of it,
but I don't know where it came from.

512
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,540
We should think about why that is true.

513
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:10,300
Okay? So if you do that, it
will find then this result.

514
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:12,643
Okay.

515
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,520
Okay.
So

516
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,820
that is a way to go from the unprime
coordinates the prime coordinate by

517
00:35:28,821 --> 00:35:31,400
rotating our axes and actually
calculating the component.

518
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:39,330
No, he is a very important
message which is the following.

519
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:44,370
When you go from one set of axes to
another set of axes, the numbers change,

520
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,350
the competence,
the vector are not the same.

521
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:50,400
You might think it's all along x and
somebody can tell me it's all along my new

522
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:53,530
y axis. So the carpenters,
the vector or not invariant,

523
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,620
the depending on who is
looking at the vector,

524
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:02,070
but there's one quantity that's going
to come out the same no matter who is

525
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:06,270
looking at the vector.
Anybody have a guess on yes.

526
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:09,240
The length of the vector is
the length of the vector.

527
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,090
Perhaps it's clear to you that no
matter how your axis are oriented,

528
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,430
when you ask how long is this Arrow,

529
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:20,060
you're going to get the same answer and
that means x squared plus a white square

530
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,170
is a x prime square,

531
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:29,400
just a white prime square and that's
a property of this expression.

532
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:32,250
You can square to this guy and I added
to the square of this guy and you will

533
00:36:32,251 --> 00:36:35,610
find using the magics of
trigonometry that this is true.

534
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:40,230
Now I'm going over at point because
they're very, very important.

535
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,460
When we do relativity,

536
00:36:41,461 --> 00:36:46,461
we'll be dealing with vectors in space
time and that we'll find that a different

537
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:49,530
observers disagree on what
is this and what does that,

538
00:36:49,531 --> 00:36:52,110
but they will agree on certain things.
Yes.

539
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:55,680
So is there a mindset
that have both the a lot

540
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,540
here? Hold on a sec. Here.

541
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:01,903
Lights.

542
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:07,880
This is a minus and that doesn't have
a minus on the other side over here.

543
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:11,090
Yeah, no, he had bought her
plus, but this one has in mind.

544
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:17,960
Oh, I'm so sorry. Yes, that
is correct. Thank you. Yes,

545
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,200
that's right. The minus is
only at, they're very good.

546
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:29,210
So certain things I'd call in variants.
This is an example of an invariant.

547
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:32,620
Okay.

548
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,080
By the way, I want to conclude
with one important point.

549
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:38,980
We learned that the vector is a quantity.
That is a magnitude and the direction.

550
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:45,060
But actually the view of vectors we take
nowadays is that a vector is a pair of

551
00:37:45,851 --> 00:37:49,990
numbers are associated with a pair of
numbers with under rotation of axes

552
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,250
transform like this. Anything
that transformed this
way, it's called a vector.

553
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,193
Yeah.

554
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,610
All right, so now am I want
to ask the following question?

555
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:04,230
Can I manufacture new vectors?

556
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:09,360
We got one vector, which is our whole
board more vectors or position vectors.

557
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,830
So I want to look at that.

558
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:16,950
That turns out to be a very nice way
to produce vectors given one vector,

559
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,170
the position vector,
and that's the following.

560
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,660
Let's take a particle
that is moving in the x,

561
00:38:24,661 --> 00:38:28,140
y plane, so that at one instant, sorry,

562
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,310
let me change this graph you'd
see here, oh, this is bad.

563
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:35,980
Oh,

564
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,750
let's see. It was moving like this.
So I'm here now a little later.

565
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:45,340
I am there. That's what I
meant. So this is called our,

566
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:50,620
this is called Delta r.
This is called our plus Delta R.

567
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:52,750
Yeah.

568
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,050
So the particles moving along this arc

569
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:03,610
initially is location as a function of
time is equal to I x of t plus j times

570
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,413
YFT.

571
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:20,290
If you wait the short amount of time
it goes to the new location which I am.

572
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:23,430
I'm going to call RF t plus Delta t.

573
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,380
What can that be?

574
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:31,070
It can be x of t plus some change in x
plus j times y of t plus the change in y.

575
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,490
Yeah,

576
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:44,490
that'd be recognized to be art at time
t plus everything else which is I times

577
00:39:46,061 --> 00:39:48,910
delta x let's date times delta.

578
00:39:48,911 --> 00:39:53,911
Why I'm going to call this
guy at pioneer vector Delta R.

579
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,750
Yeah. Other words if any more on
the line you wait a small time.

580
00:39:58,751 --> 00:40:02,290
Delta t you move by an amount.
Delta x when they move in the plane,

581
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:08,010
your changes itself. A vector. You started
the vector, you changed by this vector.

582
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:13,000
Delta r it gives you the new location.
Delta Art has got two components.

583
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:15,220
It's garden changing.
Accent has got to change and why.

584
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:21,830
Therefore we will define what's called
the velocity vector, which is a,

585
00:40:21,831 --> 00:40:26,831
if you want the limit as Delta t goes
to zero of Delta r over Delta t and you

586
00:40:30,501 --> 00:40:31,910
can see that it's going to be,

587
00:40:31,911 --> 00:40:36,911
I times Dxdt let j times the windy city.

588
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:44,350
So you can actually take
derivatives of a vector with time

589
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:51,210
and that's also a vector. Why is the
database of a vector also vector?

590
00:40:51,211 --> 00:40:53,370
Because the difference in
the vector between two times,

591
00:40:53,371 --> 00:40:56,610
this is vector dividing by Delta T.

592
00:40:56,611 --> 00:41:00,030
It's like multiplying by one over Delta
t but I know when I multiply the vector

593
00:41:00,031 --> 00:41:02,550
by a number,
I get a vector in the same direction.

594
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,860
So what does really means is that if you
take the limit as Delta t goes to zero,

595
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,450
I cannot dry it that well,

596
00:41:09,451 --> 00:41:14,220
but imagine bringing the second point
closer and closer to the first one, Delta.

597
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,890
Ours getting very small,
Delta t is very, very small,

598
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,370
but by the miracle of calculus, the
ratio will approach the definite limit.

599
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,680
That limit will be some arrow.

600
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:27,390
You can call the velocity at that time
and an always be tangent to the curve

601
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:31,290
because tangents pointing towards the
direction you're headed at that instance.

602
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:33,460
So

603
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,130
if I gave

604
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,040
you the location of a particle
is a function of time,

605
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,790
you can find the velocity by
taking databases. For example,

606
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:46,300
if I say a particle's location is I
times t square flooded times 90 cubed,

607
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,730
but every value of time you can put the
numbers in and you can find the velocity

608
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:53,900
by just taking derivatives.

609
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:59,330
Did a way to have this guy will be two
times I plus what at 2017 square times

610
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:00,884
Jay.

611
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,990
So rule for taking derivatives.

612
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,140
If you want to do just mindless
application of calculus, you can do it.

613
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,850
I and J are constant.

614
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:12,450
Ignore them and you take
derivatives x and y depends on time.

615
00:42:12,451 --> 00:42:17,310
Just take the deliberative and that's
the velocity vector and you can take an

616
00:42:17,311 --> 00:42:20,970
Dell it deliver to off the derivative
and it can get the acceleration vector

617
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:28,970
will be d two are over d t square
and you can also write it as DVD t.

618
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,533
Okay.
Any,

619
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,420
anybody have questions with what I've
done now or what we're doing here?

620
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:48,640
Let me summarize what I'm
saying. Particles moving in
a plane at every instant.

621
00:42:48,641 --> 00:42:53,641
It's got a location given by the vector
are art itself is contained in a pair of

622
00:42:53,711 --> 00:42:55,780
numbers x and y and they vary with time.

623
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:00,910
So when you very time a little bit and
ask how does are changed and you take the

624
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,640
caution of Delta Art,

625
00:43:02,641 --> 00:43:06,820
the Delta t you get the velocity vector
mathematically is done by taking the

626
00:43:06,821 --> 00:43:10,750
expression for r and differentiating
everything in sight that can be

627
00:43:10,751 --> 00:43:12,310
differentiated Spec to t.

628
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:19,030
So even though we started with a single
vector, which is the position vector,

629
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:23,550
we are now finding out that
is deliberative has to be
a vector and the data to

630
00:43:23,551 --> 00:43:27,250
deliver it is also a vector. Again,
when he learned a little nutty,

631
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:30,880
you will find out there's one
vector that staring at you.

632
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:33,430
I'll come to what that is.
That's the analog or the position vector.

633
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:37,270
But more than more vectors can
be manufactured by taking it.

634
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,183
Yes.

635
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:40,360
Okay,

636
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:45,360
so now I want to do one concrete problem
where you will see how to use these a

637
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:48,610
bit of bitters.

638
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:53,680
I'm going to write the particular case
of art of tea and take derivatives and

639
00:43:53,681 --> 00:43:55,180
we'll get a feeling for what's going on.

640
00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:01,530
The problem I have in mind looks like
this RFT is going to be a fixed number of

641
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,103
our

642
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:10,190
I times square sine Omega t time.

643
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,580
Sine Omega t
does Omega as a new creature.

644
00:44:15,581 --> 00:44:16,900
You don't know what it is right now,

645
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,270
but I'm going to just put
that in and Omega time.

646
00:44:20,271 --> 00:44:23,860
Sti is some number and it's of course
saint of the number of times I plus sign

647
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:25,510
of the number of times j times are

648
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:32,580
so what is going on? That's a function
of time. What's this particle doing?

649
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:38,400
First thing you can tell is that if
you find the length of this vector,

650
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,210
you will find the square of the
x and the square or the white,

651
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:44,430
but it's in science squared
plus [inaudible] squared is one.

652
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:49,440
You'll find this back as a fixed length
r that means it can only be rattling

653
00:44:49,441 --> 00:44:52,050
around in a circle of radius r

654
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:55,830
and in fact,

655
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:02,580
what the guy is doing looks like this
at any given time. T drawn angle,

656
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:07,890
Omega t and a radius r and
that's very a particularist.

657
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:13,160
You see that because the x component of
this one in our course and Omega t and

658
00:45:14,251 --> 00:45:19,251
the white part is our sine Omega
three s Omega is a fixed number.

659
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:24,810
As t increases, this angle increases
and the particle goes round and round.

660
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,150
So we're describing the
motion of a polygon. A circle.

661
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:28,803
Yeah.

662
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,690
Now let's understand what Omega is.
Let's get a feeling for omega.

663
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:36,690
As time increases,

664
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:41,310
the angle increases and we can ask how
long does it take for the particle to

665
00:45:41,311 --> 00:45:44,900
come back to the starting point up.

666
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,800
The starting point was here.

667
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,620
So as the increased little t omega t
will increase and I want to come back to

668
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:56,190
where I start.
So you've got to ask yourself,

669
00:45:56,490 --> 00:46:00,450
let the time it takes to do a full circle.
That's the time period.

670
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:05,190
Do a full circle
and what can you say?

671
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:09,420
Abort Omega t what should it be?
The valley of Omega t

672
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:14,680
very good, so you can say it's
three 60 degrees, that's fine,

673
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:17,350
but we like to measure angle and Radians.

674
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:20,830
Now how many people know about radiants?
Okay.

675
00:46:20,831 --> 00:46:24,970
For those who have not seen a radiant
it just another way to measure the angle

676
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,330
with the understanding
that if full circle,

677
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:34,980
which we used to think of three 60 degrees
is equal to two Pi Radians to pious,

678
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:41,010
roughly six so radiant is roughly
60 degrees is 58 and fraction.

679
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:45,370
Why do you like the measure
of angle in the peculiar way?

680
00:46:45,371 --> 00:46:47,170
You will see the advantages of that later,

681
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:52,270
but we'll adapt the convention that will
measure the angle in the radio so that

682
00:46:52,271 --> 00:46:56,110
a half circle,
instead of calling it one 80 degrees,

683
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:01,330
you will call it as pie and a quarter
circle instead of 90 we'll call it pi over

684
00:47:01,331 --> 00:47:03,910
two and 45 is by our Ford and so on,

685
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:08,380
but it's good to know a certain
famous angles. This is Pi over two.

686
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,150
This is Pi is Pi over two
and this is back to two Pi.

687
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:19,840
Therefore Omega t equals two Pi tells
you that Omega is two Pi divided by the

688
00:47:21,641 --> 00:47:23,380
time it takes to complete it.
Evolution

689
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:29,200
in one over the time period
is what we call the frequency.

690
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:33,310
You can write it as f is
just the usual frequency.

691
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,940
60 Hertz means you'll do
60 revolutions per second.

692
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:45,110
All right, so how fast
is this particle moving?

693
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:51,660
It's going to go around the circle.
The angle is increasing at a steady rate,

694
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,940
so we know it's going at a steady speed.

695
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:58,200
I'm asking what's the tangential
speed as it moves along the circle?

696
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:00,843
Yes.

697
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:04,370
How do you reach that conclusion?

698
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,170
I agree,

699
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:15,910
but I want the speed in meters per
second and Omega will be in radiance per

700
00:48:15,911 --> 00:48:20,080
second. Yes. And how did you get that?

701
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:26,803
Okay,
but

702
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,690
that's correct.
But let me did use that in another way.

703
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:32,480
Your answers completely correct.
It is Omega are,

704
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:36,740
but I want to say how you get it. One
way is to say, if I do a full revolution,

705
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,380
I think of the speed as the distance.

706
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:43,940
Over time I'm going to
go one full revolution.

707
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:46,610
This sensor travel is to PR

708
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,890
but two Pi over t was identified as Omega.

709
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:57,290
So the tangential velocity or at any
point is equal to Omega Times are.

710
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,210
That's a useful quantity to know.

711
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:07,920
So now you can take this velocity
and you can take this are the,

712
00:49:08,251 --> 00:49:10,440
let me find the Ft.

713
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:16,660
The FT is obtained by taking deliberate
to this expression and I think you guys

714
00:49:17,261 --> 00:49:22,250
know enough calculus for me to write
is equal to my, it's equal to uh,

715
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,880
our
times.

716
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:29,940
I times minus Omega Sine Omega t
plus j times Omega Cosine Omega t.

717
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,810
That is the velocity of this guy.

718
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:44,830
And I invite you to try this formula
whenever you want. Pick a time.

719
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,160
Let's say if I go a quarter of a circle,

720
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:53,910
I expect to be moving to the left quarter
of a circle means Omega t is Pi over

721
00:49:53,921 --> 00:49:58,921
two course and a Pi over
two is zero because Casa 90
zero sign up by over two is

722
00:50:00,011 --> 00:50:04,420
one. And I get a speed of Omega art
in the negative either direction,

723
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,790
which is an Omega God wants the speed.
That's indeed the correct.

724
00:50:07,791 --> 00:50:11,830
Dan said you can satisfy yourself
at various times is going like this.

725
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:14,490
Yeah,

726
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:16,740
so let's sneak in one
more bit of native here,

727
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:21,180
which is to take the database to off the
derivative and that's a very important

728
00:50:21,181 --> 00:50:25,890
result. If you do that, uh,
let's take one more deliberative.

729
00:50:25,891 --> 00:50:29,900
Let's try to lose part it and the head
so I can just write down the answer for

730
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:33,740
take one more date of it to the sign is
going to become a cost sign and yield

731
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:37,940
and other Omega discourse and is going
to become a minus sign and give me

732
00:50:37,941 --> 00:50:40,160
another omega.
If you do that,

733
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:44,990
you will find the whole answer as
equal to minus Omega Square Times.

734
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:48,530
Just
the vector art itself.

735
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,450
That's a very interesting result. It tells
you when a particle moves in a circle,

736
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:58,680
it has an acceleration in
the negative art direction,

737
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:00,750
namely directed towards the center.

738
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:06,750
What's the magnitude of that acceleration?
I write it without an Arrow here.

739
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:10,890
That's equaled Omega Square Times.
The magnitude of this vector,

740
00:51:10,891 --> 00:51:11,730
which is just our,

741
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:18,360
but now I can also write
it as we squared over r.

742
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:22,830
So here ready.

743
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:25,440
This is a very important formula.

744
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,830
I don't know how many kids generation
after generation get in trouble because

745
00:51:31,831 --> 00:51:33,750
they do not remember the following fact.

746
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:38,670
So I'm going to say it once more with
feeling when a particle moves in a circle,

747
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:44,810
it does an acceleration towards the
center of this size B squared over r.

748
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:46,820
Yeah,

749
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:49,290
but it's simple. It comes from the
fact that velocity is a vector.

750
00:51:49,291 --> 00:51:52,950
Then you can change your velocity
vector by changing your direction.

751
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,650
It's sparkle is constantly
changing its direction,

752
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,840
but it therefore has an acceleration.

753
00:51:57,841 --> 00:52:01,080
And the acceleration we have shown
here is pointing toward the center.

754
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:05,010
And the size of that is we squared over r.
So for example,

755
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,690
if a car is going on a racetrack
and you seeing it from the top,

756
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:13,850
if the gas pedal says 60
miles per hour speedometer,

757
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:17,550
you might say it's not accelerating.
But that's the lay person's view.

758
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,290
But it was going in a circle.

759
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:24,920
You will say from now on that Indian
has an acceleration even though no one's

760
00:52:24,921 --> 00:52:28,710
stepping on the accelerator
of Amount v squared over r.

761
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,800
So that's a very important
thing. That's the part, uh,

762
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:36,110
that's what you're
learning in this course.

763
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,360
The fact that when you step on your gas,
you accelerate.

764
00:52:38,361 --> 00:52:42,260
Everybody knows the fact that when you
go in a circle, you accelerate this.

765
00:52:42,261 --> 00:52:43,280
What we're learning here,

766
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:47,510
and it's coming from the fact the end
velocity is a vector and there's change

767
00:52:47,511 --> 00:52:50,540
can be due to change in the
magnitude or change in direction.

768
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:54,560
This is the problem with the magnitude
of velocity was nailed down and fixed at

769
00:52:54,561 --> 00:52:56,990
Omega are the direction
is constantly changing.

770
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,900
Okay, so I'm going to now, uh,

771
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,013
okay,

772
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:09,790
do a second class of problems.
We will return to this issue later.

773
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,250
By the way,
one thing I should mention to you,

774
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:16,570
suppose the particle is not
moving in a circle, but does this,

775
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:20,530
let's take a circle and just
keep a quarter of the circle.

776
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,830
[inaudible] this part,
when you're doing a of a circle,

777
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,780
the supposed to be quarter of a circle,

778
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:32,640
you have the same acceleration directed
toward the center. In other words,

779
00:53:32,641 --> 00:53:36,390
you don't have to be moving actually in
a circle to have the acceleration at any

780
00:53:36,391 --> 00:53:38,820
instant.
Your motion,

781
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:43,740
if it follows any curve locally can
be approximated as being part of some

782
00:53:43,741 --> 00:53:44,580
circle,
right?

783
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:47,970
You can take circles at different size
and place them against your trajectory

784
00:53:47,971 --> 00:53:49,080
and see which one fits.

785
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:54,180
That's the are we squared over r is the
acceleration directed toward the center

786
00:53:54,181 --> 00:53:55,014
of that circle?

787
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,273
Okay.

788
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,960
One miscellaneous result,
which we don't use very much now,

789
00:54:03,961 --> 00:54:05,850
but which I should mention
to you is the following.

790
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,600
Suppose this is the ground
with some audit in here.

791
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:14,190
That's a plane with some audits
in here and in the plane.

792
00:54:14,191 --> 00:54:18,390
That is some other object.
What's the location of the object?

793
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:26,000
Let us say P for Plain d
for ground o for object.

794
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:32,510
I think it's clear the position of
the object with respect to the ground.

795
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:37,630
This vector is the same as the position
of the object with respect to the plane.

796
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,020
Let's position of the plane
with respect to the ground.

797
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:46,950
You agree?
Okay,

798
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:49,210
this is the pictured here.

799
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:53,450
Maybe we can start taking dinner with
this of this with respect to time and that

800
00:54:53,451 --> 00:54:56,770
will say the velocity of the
object with respect to the ground.

801
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:00,640
The last of the object with the SPEC
that the plane by last year, the plane,

802
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:02,050
it's a Spec to the ground.

803
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:08,610
That means if you're going in a plan
and you throw something up in the air,

804
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:12,930
it seems to be going up and down to you,
but if I see you through the glass,

805
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:17,130
the object is going on some trajectory
which has got both up and down and

806
00:55:17,131 --> 00:55:21,030
horizontal motion and this is
the rule for adding velocities.

807
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,550
So when you have a velocity in the moving
plane frame and you want to find the

808
00:55:26,551 --> 00:55:29,760
velocity on the ground, you should
add to every object in the plane,

809
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:32,490
the velocity of the plane
with a Spec to the ground.

810
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:38,670
That's intuitively clear. You use it all
the time, but maybe along one dimension,

811
00:55:38,671 --> 00:55:41,010
but this is the way to
do it in two dimensions.

812
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:46,790
That may be some simple problem involving
this in the problem with science,

813
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:51,600
so I'm just going over this. Okay.
The problem we wanted to do today,

814
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:53,640
whole family of problems looks like this.

815
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:58,740
I want to consider the particle
which has definite acceleration,

816
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,950
a constant one,
but a is now a vector.

817
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:08,720
The question I have is what does
this location at all future times?

818
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:14,670
I think you can tell by analogy with
what I didn't want to mention that the

819
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:19,671
position of that object or any time t
is going to be the initial position plus

820
00:56:21,301 --> 00:56:24,670
Velocity Times d plus one half

821
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,650
80 square, everything is the same as
in one d except everybody's a vector.

822
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:34,120
No initial position is a pair of numbers.
Initial velocity is a pair of numbers.

823
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,930
Once you know those, you
can find the position of the
object at all future times.

824
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:42,700
So let's take one simple example.

825
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:44,323
Yes.

826
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:50,610
So that if somebody's in a
car and decided to fly off

827
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,330
and we want to know,
as you can tell,

828
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:58,270
our concern is where does
the car hit the ground?

829
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,630
When does the car hit the ground?
That's the problem in two dimensions.

830
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:07,390
So how do we solve this problem?
We pick up origin to be this point here.

831
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:12,070
Let the height of the building be h cod
is traveling with some initial speed,

832
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:14,380
be zero in a horizontal direction.

833
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:20,920
This equation is a part of equation
one along x and one along. Why?

834
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:26,520
Right for the x part I'm going to write
x is equal zero plus v Zero t and s zero

835
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,580
I'm going to be Tuesday to zero
by choice of my origin being here,

836
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:37,760
they scored in the cart is the
zero because this is my audition.

837
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:39,533
Okay.

838
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,280
How about the white coordinate?

839
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,830
The equation for the white cord in
it is the height of the building.

840
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:53,270
The velocity has no vertical component
that is no v y but it has an acceleration

841
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:56,300
of mine is g.

842
00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:02,220
So this is the fate of this person
at any given time, t a t equals zero.

843
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:06,750
You have him right on top of this
edge that all foods at times excellent

844
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:11,190
proceeds as if nothing happened
and then why you're falling.

845
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:14,220
And if you want to know something,
like when do you hit the ground?

846
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:18,270
I think it's fairly clear what
you have to do. For example,

847
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:22,440
if t star is the time you hit the ground,

848
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:25,110
then t star satisfies the equation.

849
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,600
H minus one half g do
you start square to zero?

850
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:35,880
You saw it for the t start from this one
and you put it there and that tells you

851
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:40,830
where you land. I don't think I
have to actually do that step.

852
00:58:40,831 --> 00:58:45,120
I'm assuming you can fill in the blanks,
right? Solve this equation for t star.

853
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:48,490
Put it there and that's where you land.
Okay,

854
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:51,750
that's one class of problems.
So here's the second class.

855
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,080
The second class is the most popular
application of what I'm doing now,

856
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:07,100
but I want you not to
memorize every formula.

857
00:59:07,101 --> 00:59:11,580
The book gives you what this
problem. That's the problem
with predict tidal marsh

858
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:15,470
predict tile motion.

859
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:20,960
You start here and you find a predict
tile with some velocity be not at some

860
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:24,320
data and it's going to go up
and it's going to come down.

861
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:29,580
One question is where
does it go into land?

862
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,650
Other question is at what angle
should you find your project child?

863
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:39,520
So we'll go the furthest
so you can find the equation,

864
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:42,040
but you got to think a little
bit before you solve everything.

865
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:43,630
It's good to have an
idea of what's coming.

866
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:48,520
So you imagine you've got this
monster cannon fire things.

867
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:53,170
It's got a fixed speed being art and how
do you want aim it so you can be most

868
00:59:53,171 --> 00:59:57,550
effective as far as you can.
Well there are two schools of thought.

869
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:02,140
Okay, one says aim at your
enemy and fire like this.

870
01:00:02,141 --> 01:00:05,860
Then it lands on your foot
because assuming the candidate
has said zero height,

871
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:10,000
the cannon balls certainly
comes out towards the enemy
but has no time of flight.

872
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:11,570
Yeah,

873
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:15,590
other one says maximize the time of flight
and you point, it can't end like this.

874
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:19,520
So it goes up, stays in the ad for a very
long time, but it falls on your head.

875
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:25,450
So we know the truth is somewhere between
zero and 90 a naive guests may be 45

876
01:00:26,451 --> 01:00:28,700
but turns out naive is actually correct.

877
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,610
So I just wanted to show
you how that comes out,

878
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:33,620
but I don't want you to cram this formula.

879
01:00:33,621 --> 01:00:35,840
This is the kind of thing
you should be able to deduce.

880
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:38,750
Let's go back to the same
thing I wrote earlier.

881
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,920
X equals zero plus.

882
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,720
What's the hardest onto velocity?

883
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:47,810
Horizontal Velocity is v
zero cost science data.

884
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:54,580
So x is v Zero Course [inaudible] times
t and Y is v zero sine theta famous t

885
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:02,750
minus one half g t square.

886
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:10,220
Okay, so now we know everything about
this particular, I told you once,

887
01:01:10,221 --> 01:01:12,670
you know the three parameters
are not in be knocked.

888
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,510
You know everything about
the future of the object.

889
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:19,370
So let's ask what's the
range ranges that distance.

890
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:23,760
So what's the strategy for rain?

891
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:27,780
You see how long you are in the air and
the whole time you're in the air you're

892
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:31,740
travelling horizontally at the speed.
So again,

893
01:01:31,741 --> 01:01:33,990
let t star be the time
when you hit the ground.

894
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:40,460
So you said Zero Equals v zero
scientists that minus one half g t star

895
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:48,180
[inaudible] star.
I just pulled out a common tea

896
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:52,380
so I'd say so you on the
ground on two occasions.

897
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:55,200
One is initially we are
not interested in that.

898
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:59,730
Well if the time they are interested in
is not zero yet allowed to cancel it and

899
01:01:59,731 --> 01:02:04,731
get the time from here and that time is
t star equals to v zero scientists over

900
01:02:06,541 --> 01:02:10,970
g.
That's how long you had in the air.

901
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,840
This says if you want to be in the air
for a long time, maximize sine theta,

902
01:02:14,841 --> 01:02:19,590
so you may think it's 90 degrees is the
best angle, but that's not the goal.

903
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:24,770
Goal is to get the biggest rain to go
back to x and put your family for t star,

904
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:31,720
which is two v zero scientists over g
and that becomes B Zero Square over g

905
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:38,350
times to sign theotokos sine theta.

906
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,600
If you go back to your trigonometry,

907
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:48,170
you should find that is really
the formula for sign to Tatum.

908
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:52,350
That's another example of where knowing
the true guidance is very helpful.

909
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:01,940
Okay,
so this tells you exactly what you want.

910
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,940
It says make sign to
data as big as you want,

911
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,580
and that tells you who
theta is going to be.

912
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:13,690
90 and data's going to be 45 but it's
not from a naive guests that it's halfway

913
01:03:14,901 --> 01:03:18,410
between zero and 90 turns out to be.

914
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:23,930
This are the fairly complicated balance
between the time of flight and the range.

915
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:27,230
So some people memorize this.

916
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:31,220
I would say don't do that because after
a while you won't have room in your head

917
01:03:31,221 --> 01:03:32,054
for anything.

918
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:37,660
Just go back as often as possible to this
formula and work your way from there.

919
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:43,430
No, there's more variations,
but it's always the same thing.

920
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:47,360
Here's another variation in my days.
They will say,

921
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:52,070
find out when you want an
object to go through that point.

922
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:57,250
And I tell you the muzzle
Velocity v not what are our,

923
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:58,970
I tell you at what angle I fired it.

924
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:01,190
I want you to find the
speed so it'll land here.

925
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:07,570
So how would you do that problem?
You do that problem by saying,

926
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:11,500
suppose this actually happens
at some time. T at that time,

927
01:04:11,501 --> 01:04:14,620
t the x coordinate must
have a certain value.

928
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:18,770
They go to the ECC creation
and demand that this vehicle,

929
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:20,710
the desired x value and find the time.

930
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:25,510
I take the time and put it in the white
equation and demand that the why I get

931
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:30,100
agree with this. Why if you do that,

932
01:04:30,101 --> 01:04:32,470
you will find that it's one
unknown, which is v. Dot.

933
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:34,170
And they can consult for Bina.

934
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:40,860
This is the most general problems.
You can have the textbook,

935
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:44,490
of course people make them interesting.
Suddenly there's a mountain

936
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:50,460
and that's the physicist
hiking on this mountain. See,

937
01:04:50,461 --> 01:04:55,050
you're already laughing. So it's not a
very credible problem that we don't hike.

938
01:04:55,051 --> 01:04:58,860
And when we get stuck, we don't want food.
We want our table of integral switch.

939
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:00,990
What we want somebody to sent to us.

940
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:05,100
So these problems are
embellished in many ways, uh,

941
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:07,830
to make you all feel involved.
For example,

942
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:12,600
instead of a stone dropping nowadays,
there's a monkey that's falling down.

943
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:16,350
So the people in life sciences field,
hey we are, we are represented in this,

944
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:23,440
but all those creatures with a very
interesting, in the end you are told,

945
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:26,830
you know that's a hard set inside a
railway carriage and you cannot see the

946
01:05:26,831 --> 01:05:28,360
horse but the horse is moving.

947
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:31,210
You can deduce it because the
candidate is moving the other way.

948
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:35,320
Does it picked it up? A horse picture
of a carriage, all the glossy stuff.

949
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:40,560
Then it says treat the
horses, appoint particle. See,

950
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:44,640
that's what we learned in the old days.
But nowadays it's a hardest.

951
01:05:44,641 --> 01:05:47,100
But in the end if you're going to treat
this appoint particular seems to meet

952
01:05:47,101 --> 01:05:50,530
the real waste. If you're
the Godfather, right?

953
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:53,620
You want to get the
contract for Johnny Fontane.

954
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:59,290
You don't tell your constant Larry a
Tom put a point particle on Jack's bed,

955
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:03,700
right? When you want a horse, use
ours. When you want to point particle,

956
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:07,240
if you wake up and find a point particle
on your bed, what's the reaction?

957
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:13,810
So I think these extra pictures,
sometimes they're helpful.

958
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:17,860
Sometimes they just,
the cost make the book costs a lot more.

959
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,430
That are problems where
the hearts must be treated.

960
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:23,920
We will see when we study rigid bodies,

961
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:28,690
even their horse is not really a rigid
body unless it's been dead for a long

962
01:06:28,691 --> 01:06:31,630
time. At least there. The fact it's
not a point particular is important.

963
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:35,590
So I think reason books
are bigger and bigger,

964
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:39,670
but still do the same information to set
examples are more than more interesting.

965
01:06:39,671 --> 01:06:42,250
Sometimes they serve a purpose,
sometimes they're distracting,

966
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:47,230
but I haven't written a book in this
field, so I will not say anything more.
