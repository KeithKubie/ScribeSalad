00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:12.670
GUEST SPEAKER: Now good morning,
Navajo Environmental Agency

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.810
members.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.640
Given the proposed
revitalization

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.070
of the nuclear power
industry and the hints

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.670
that uranium mining might be
revitalized in the region,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.150
there's a growing concern
amongst the agency members

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.760
regarding what this means
for us, especially given

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.860
the controversy of historical
precedence happened

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.670
in this area in the 1960s.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.650
I'm here today to explain,
amongst the various measures

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.980
that we are implementing, why
local knowledge should be given

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.970
serious consideration
and why the,

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.580
and why we should
actually be involving

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.910
the local members of community
in the process of developments

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.500
of uranium mining.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.670
Now firstly, the involvement
of local knowledge

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.840
improves and enriches
the scientific process.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.430
Problem framing is an
inherently subjective process,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.930
and it's not something that
science can't solve on its own.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.900
When we look at, what
exactly are the problems,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.480
who are the people who are
exactly going to be affected,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.000
and what do they think about it?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.040
These are questions that don't
lie in science, but rather

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.020
in the people.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.910
And that's why we must
move away from thinking

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.800
about a positivist
view of science,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.520
that science holds all the
answers, and involve the people

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.690
and what they think about it.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.440
And secondly, we understand
from many stories in history

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.590
that science is
inherently uncertain.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.800
There are uncertainties
involved in quantifying effects

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.020
of various measures.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.570
There are uncertainties
involved in determining

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.350
what impacts that a particular
activity, in this case, uranium

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.640
mining, will have on
the future generations.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.440
And therefore, look and one
brings in an important element

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.720
that science is not able to.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.800
And this is ultimately patterns
and trends in time and space

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.230
that people live
in the area have

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.160
been observing over decades
and over a large area.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.050
Ultimately, if you
bring in scientists

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.340
to examine their environmental
impact of uranium mining, what

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.479
will be captured
often tends to be

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.664
a screen shot, a
shot in time of what

00:02:13.664 --> 00:02:14.830
actually is going to happen.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.040
Whereas these people have
had the benefits of decades

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.050
of experience, and
they will be able

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.040
tell us what's most likely to
happen over time and space.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.270
And lastly, democratization--

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.890
The uranium mining activities
that are being taken

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.380
do not involve only the
scientists or only the industry

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.510
members but also the people.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.940
And it's important to ensure
that their views are being

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.160
heard and are being
taken into account

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.470
in the scientific process.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.130
Of course, there will be
opposition to such views.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.716
Firstly, people might
say that in the past,

00:02:47.716 --> 00:02:49.840
the reason for these problem
were that proper rules

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.900
and regulations were ignored,
and the adverse impacts were

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.920
actually minimal.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.110
I would argue that the
reason why proper rules

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.675
and regulations were ignored is
the fact that these people were

00:02:59.675 --> 00:03:02.320
not actually involved in the
development of these rules

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.660
and regulations.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.460
And also, there is
a false dichotomy

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.010
between scientific knowledge
and local knowledge that

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.970
actually, where people
think that scientists

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.650
are the only ones
that are qualified

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.890
to come up with good science.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.590
Whereas people who have not
been trained in this area

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.660
would not be able to do so.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.724
Studies have shown in history
that a lot of this view

00:03:26.724 --> 00:03:28.390
actually stems from
the fact that people

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.610
aren't used to the language
and the technical terms used

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.110
in science.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.070
But when that
barrier is crossed,

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.160
that people, given
their critical thinking

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.410
skills and their
reasoning skills,

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.660
are equally able as
trained scientists

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.690
to be able to contribute
to the discussion.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.720
So ultimately, how should we
ensure that local knowledge is

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.530
taken seriously?

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.870
How should we incorporate this?

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.640
This involves a mindset shift.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.350
Local knowledge does not seek
to supplant scientific knowledge

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.550
but rather strengthen it.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.470
We need to move away
from this false dichotomy

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.470
and allow locals and
scientists to sit at the table

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.080
as equals, not because they
are equally good at something,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.470
but because they bring different
things to the table that

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.730
are of equal value.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.650
We also would like to recommend
that boundary workers be

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.500
searched for and
hired to actually take

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.290
part in this process-- "boundary
workers" meaning people that

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.540
are not only able to
communicate with those

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.970
on the scientific
side of the boundary

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.380
but also with the local
side of the boundary.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.860
These might be
people, locals who

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.560
have been trained
in science and who

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.160
not only understand the
scientific culture but also

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.290
the local culture.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.960
At the same time, people,
just because something

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.170
is local knowledge does
not mean that it is right.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.060
So in that sense,
high standards have

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.880
to be expected of the
presentation and gathering

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.240
of local knowledge, not in
terms of the use of very

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.880
formal technical language, but
in terms of critical thinking

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.540
and reasoning.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.820
And only when these scientific
standard, these high standards

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.700
are enforced on
our local knowledge

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.060
will they be taken
seriously by the scientists.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.710
And ultimately,
this entire process

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.780
is as much a cultural process
is it is a scientific process.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.080
It's not just about the
scientific methods that we use,

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.110
but also in terms of leveraging
the cultural and social

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.870
elements inherent
in the community.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.240
For example, we might look
at the social hierarchy

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.170
in different regions.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.540
And this varies, actually,
from community to community,

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.920
from town to town.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.910
Is there a central
figure of trust that we

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.330
can bring into the discussion?

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.580
Do we have to forge
unity between both locals

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.590
and the scientists?

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.340
And are there certain
social practices

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.430
that might need to be
avoided or adhered to

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.640
in terms of working, or getting
locals and scientists to work

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.090
together?

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.620
So ultimately, our
agency's role is

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.070
to avoid the events that
happened in the 1960s.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.080
And I believe that
one way of doing that

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.240
is to actually bring
in local knowledge.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.820
Not as a form of opposition
to what the scientists have

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.550
been doing, but as enhancement
to their work, to enrich it

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.690
and to ensure that whatever
solution is worked out

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.320
is in the best interest of both
the community and the industry.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.170
Thank you.
