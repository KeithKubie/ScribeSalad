[Captions by Y Translator]
&gt;&gt; Today's video,
we're going to be showing you

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.320
how to make a primitive style glue stick

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.680
using exclusively materials
made out of trees.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.660
[Music]

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.380
This is a hot glue stick.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.520
It's not the kind that you
usually think of that goes in

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.360
a glue gun or you buy at a craft store.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.940
This is sort of the OG
glue stick, if you will.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.060
This is made of pine sap
and charcoal and it's a very

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.800
old recipe for how to make glue.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.080
This stuff works surprisingly
well, and holds on really strong.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.620
The ingredients could not be simpler,
sap from pine trees and charcoal dust.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.420
Here's the basic plan.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.140
We're going to gather up some pine sap,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.080
melt it down and mix in
some finely ground charcoal

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.480
to create a solid mass that can
be melted down into a glue.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.499
To get started, we
need to gather some sap.

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:47.460
Now, I think every kind
of pine tree produces sap,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.100
and it's usually not too hard
to find if you look around.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.920
It will often be leaking out of the trees,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.469
especially if the tree has had
any branches break off

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:55.600
or something like that.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.440
Let's look around
and see what we can find,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.020
and we'll just gather it up in this tin.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.139
This used to be a bean can,
it's cut into this strange shape

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:05.060
so that it has a couple of handles
to easily carry it around.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:14.100
[Music]

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.080
You can see that gathering the sap
is not usually very quick.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.700
Although, this amount
is already a good start,

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.640
and it's only taken
me five or ten minutes.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.240
If you spent a couple hours doing this,
you could probably fill the whole tin.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.460
Sometimes you can get lucky
and you'll actually find spots where

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.780
sap has dripped down off
of the trees in larger quantities.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.480
I think we've got enough.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.220
We can now take this over the fire

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.480
and start melting it down.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.000
We've got our sap in our can,
our modified can with the handles.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.979
So now we're going to take it
over the fire and we have here

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.979
just some charcoal that's burning.

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.149
It's not big flames.

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:45.840
It's not super hot
and that's what we want.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.030
We want fairly low heat because too
high of heat and some of this would burn.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.829
Some of it would start boiling and that can
change the texture in ways we don't want.

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.399
Plus, this is all flammable
and if there's lots of big flames it's

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.160
harder to control and it could ignite.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.320
Very quickly.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.640
Little bits of it start to... melt
and get runny down in there.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.440
That might even be going too fast.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.240
I'm trying to stir it to keepall
of the melted stuff

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.080
together with the unmelted stuff.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.190
It'll help it melt more,
it will help it be more smooth and even.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.880
And it stops the stuff that's already
melted from boiling too much.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.680
Now, depending on
the sap you've gathered.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.360
What it melts down into is
going to be a little bit different.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.560
If all of the sap you gathered
was really nice and clear,

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.540
you're probably just going to have a nice
clear thin syrup textured mixture.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.880
Alright, this is
starting to melt quite nicely.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.670
We're just gonna back it out of the fire.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.690
So it's still in a warm area.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.820
So it's not going to be
boiling as we prepare the charcoal.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.600
So now what we need is charcoal.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.160
And generally the mixture
that we're looking for is,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.200
two to one of sapped charcoal.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.920
So one part charcoal, two parts sap.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.560
And you can kind of eyeball this,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.530
if you're off by a little bit either direction,
it should still work pretty well.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.660
Take me some charcoal and a rock.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.860
I'm just going to start
crushing this up into a fine powder.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.459
That looks...

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.840
I think that will be about enough,
by the time that's all crushed up.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.680
[Music]

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.640
I think that's getting to
be quite a good fine powder.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.190
I'd say that looks
like should be enough.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.920
Let's get our sap all the way melted.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.300
Make sure it's at the consistency we want.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.800
We can go even a little
bit thinner than this.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:34.020
[Music]

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.680
I'm just gonna mix our charcoal in.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.640
We actually need a little bit more.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.260
I'm just gonna crush up a little bit more.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.360
This handle, because I've just
been keeping this in low heat.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.239
These handles are actually cool
enough that I can just hold on to them.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.320
Especially the one that was
farther away from the heat.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.860
Then I can just... add a little
bit more charcoal here.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.000
[Music]

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.780
I'm just going to use one stick to
try and attach it to the other stick.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.540
It's warm enough that I definitely
don't want to just grab it with my hands.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.000
One of the reasons I'm using this can
instead of something else, is

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.190
that whatever you cook this in
is definitely going to get ruined.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.120
This is destructive and messy.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.700
And as this stuff cools off,
it sticks a ton.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.190
And of course it's charcoal.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.280
So it's super dark,

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.860
very noticeable as it builds up on stuff.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:27.760
As this cools down,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.800
it stops sticking nearly as much,

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.660
and it's fairly cool now,
still quite squishy soft.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.020
But definitely getting harder,

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.340
and now, we want to let
this cool down completely.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.140
I've been talking about how we
want to avoid getting this too hot.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.419
Let's try and see what happens

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.449
if I get this too hot.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.540
I'm just gonna put this
right over some coals,

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.060
then I'm gonna blow on it a little bit
to get that going a little more.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:05:02.880
[Music]

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.900
So what I've poured onto there is...
basically turpentine and charcoal.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.160
It burns very quickly
and very readily with a lot

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.540
of smoke as you can see.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.680
Our glue has now
cooled down and at this point.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.690
It's quite hard.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.919
You can barely put a dent
into it with your finger.

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.180
If you use your fingernail,
you can definitely mark it a little bit

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.419
but it's quite rigid, quite hard,
and it holds itself together really well,

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.600
and this still could
cool down a little bit more.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.960
It's a fairly warm day out here,

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.229
which is going to keep
it a little bit more pliable.

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.060
If it's cool or if you cool it off
in cold water or something like that,

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.660
it gets very hard to the point
where I'm not even sure you can

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.960
dent it with your nail anymore.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.980
So now, we have our hot glue stick.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.210
To use it, we warm it back up.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.600
And we saw how flammable
this stuff was when it gets really

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.970
hot and lights on fire.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.030
We don't want to do that.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.980
But we can just use the heat from the fire
to warm it up enough that we can use it.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.160
You can see it definitely
started getting a lot shinier.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.820
It is now sticking to my
glove pretty much immediately.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.380
We're just going to see about gluing
these two sticks together.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.580
Now, that is not the best
kind of use of this glue.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.380
Sticking two surfaces to each other
is not what its best at.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.980
But just to take a look
at it see what happens.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.880
Get some more glue smeared on there.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.280
Press these two together.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.880
Now let's let this cool down.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.380
Let's look at something
that this does really well.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.140
So, I have dowel here and a piece
of 2x4 that I drilled.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.720
And the hole that I drilled
is far too big for this dowel.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.160
It's not a tight fit,
falls right out,

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.360
spins very loose and easily.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.862
That's because I intentionally
drilled this hole too big.

00:06:37.862 --> 00:06:40.700
You can just see there's a gap
all the way around that dowel.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.540
So what we're going to do is we're
going to take some of our glue here.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.540
We're going to melt that down.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.620
We're going to heat up the end of our
dowel just a little bit and cover it.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.850
And then, we're going to wedge
that down in and see how well

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.000
attached it is after the glue cools.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.920
[Music]

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.360
If I we're not wearing gloves,

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.580
I would not be using my
fingers to clean this off.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.440
I just be using a little piece of a stick.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.660
Not even necessarily
for the temperature thing.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.120
Although, the glue was
pretty warm as I was doing that.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.020
But mostly because it
would stick to my fingers.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.039
All right.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.080
Let's let this cool down and we can
see how well these pieces are attached.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.560
I tried to glue these sticks together
and then because I was impatient,

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.720
I ran them under cool water,

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.000
but the water was flowing fast enough
that it just sort of pulled the sticks apart,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.360
and now they're wet.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.860
So I can't glue them
back together very well.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.620
But, I do still have the dowel in the 2x4,

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.460
and as you can see it's stuck.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.420
Like, it doesn't just
hold the dowel into the 2x4.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.580
It holds the 2x4 on to the dowel.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.920
I might be able to tear it out,

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.780
and I'm gonna try, but we're going
to see how much force this takes.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.780
[Music]

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.180
[groaning]

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.260
Oh my gosh, a lot of force is the answer.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.800
And that's still actually
a little bit sticky,

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.020
which means it probably wasn't
even cooled down all the way yet.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.220
And that was in there that was stuck!

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.440
This stuff is powerful.

00:08:01.449 --> 00:08:03.460
I'm going to rewarm
this and stick it back in there.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.780
Just so it holds in but like,
that stuff sticks well.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.720
"Random Fact: Another interesting
product that can be made from trees

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.849
is chewing gum, which got its
start from the rubbery sap

00:08:13.849 --> 00:08:15.560
found in Sapodilla trees."

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.300
A strong, easy to use, easy
to carry, water proof glue.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.260
Fits on a stick and it's
entirely made out of trees.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.660
Just pine sap, charcoal,
and a stick from the ground.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:30.740
In terms of useful primitive
knowledge, this to me is really

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.700
great because like, it's glue!

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:33.820
Who doesn't want glue?

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.400
Not to mention the fact that
once it's cooled down all the way,

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.900
it's sort of a rigid plastic.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.190
So there's probably some other tools
you could make just by sculpting

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.170
this stuff a little
bit into the right shape.

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:46.310
Guys, we love doing this old
technology style stuff.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.320
If you've got anything you'd like to see,
let us know down in the comments.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.180
Guys, there's always more for you to see.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.460
That box up at the top,
it will transport you to our last video.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.620
You should check that out.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.560
The box at the bottom will
show you what YouTube thinks

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.480
you should be watching next.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.640
And if you aren't a subscriber,
hit this bomb in the middle,

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.460
and that way, you'll never
miss out on any of the fun.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.700
Don't forget to ring that bell
and we will see you in the next one.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:04.520
Talk to you then.
