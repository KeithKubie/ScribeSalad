00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.075
Now let's briefly talk optical disks. An optical disk

00:00:04.075 --> 00:00:06.625
is very similar to a hard disk in that

00:00:06.625 --> 00:00:09.515
it has a platter that rotates and we store

00:00:09.515 --> 00:00:12.776
the bits on the surface of the disk. The

00:00:12.776 --> 00:00:16.219
difference is that, instead of there being a head

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.926
that needs to be placed very close to the

00:00:18.926 --> 00:00:21.714
disk surface, we can shoot a laser to the

00:00:21.714 --> 00:00:25.486
surface and the reflection from the material here will

00:00:25.486 --> 00:00:30.574
tell us whether we have a zero or a one. But many of the other properties of

00:00:30.574 --> 00:00:34.350
the optical disks are very similar to hard disks.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.818
They have tracks and so on. Unlike hard drives

00:00:37.818 --> 00:00:40.889
that tends to be closed units, so you don't

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:44.126
just insert a new hard drive into the machine,

00:00:44.126 --> 00:00:47.695
and you don't carry one with you usually, optical

00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:50.849
drives don't need the laser to get that close

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:56.821
to the surface so the smudges or dust are less of a problem for it. Basically if

00:00:56.821 --> 00:00:59.656
there is a speck of dust here, it doesn't

00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:02.653
scratch the laser as it rotates, but a speck

00:01:02.653 --> 00:01:05.407
of dust will scratch the magnetic head as

00:01:05.407 --> 00:01:08.566
it rotates and probably glue itself to the head

00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:12.282
and then the head no longer works. So hard

00:01:12.282 --> 00:01:15.778
drives have much more of a problem with dirt,

00:01:15.778 --> 00:01:19.027
so they need to be an enclosed case. Because

00:01:19.027 --> 00:01:22.310
optical disks suffer less from this problem, we often see

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.253
them in the form of CDs and DVDs that

00:01:24.253 --> 00:01:27.134
we can carry around and even though they get dirty,

00:01:27.134 --> 00:01:30.170
we can still read data from them. But as

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.540
a result of them being portable, they need to be

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.090
standardized so that we can put a CD or

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.804
a DVD into any drive that we want. And this

00:01:40.804 --> 00:01:45.196
standardization helps improve portability and their usefulness, but

00:01:45.196 --> 00:01:48.076
it limits the rate of improvement, because the

00:01:48.076 --> 00:01:51.388
technology improves but then that technology needs to

00:01:51.388 --> 00:01:54.700
make it through a standards process, where companies

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.292
agree that something will be a standard and

00:01:57.292 --> 00:02:00.190
only then make it into products. So really,

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.205
the technology can improve relatively rapidly. But we

00:02:03.205 --> 00:02:05.830
don't see any of that progress until a new

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.755
standard is decided on at which point products

00:02:08.755 --> 00:02:12.426
are released. In contrast, with hard drives, the whole

00:02:12.426 --> 00:02:15.419
enclosure needs to obey some standards about how

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.047
to connect to the rest of the computer, but

00:02:18.047 --> 00:02:20.748
what happens inside the enclosure can be the

00:02:20.748 --> 00:02:25.145
latest and greatest technology in magnetic disks. So usually

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.745
optical disks are used for pretty much carrying

00:02:27.745 --> 00:02:30.630
the data around, storing music, movies and so on.
