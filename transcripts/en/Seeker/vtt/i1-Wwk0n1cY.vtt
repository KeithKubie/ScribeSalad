00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.910
I hear the secrets that you keep.

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.610
When you're talking in your sleep.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.160
All your dreams that you keep inside…

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.230
You're telling me the secrets that you just
can't hide.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.320
Hey there, sleepers.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.770
Somniloquy, is the name given to the sleep
abnormality of talking in your sleep.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.859
For some unknown reason, some people will
snooze comfortably and quietly, whereas others

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.860
will speak gibberish, words, sentences, or
entire speeches whilst sawing their logs.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.430
Understanding somniloquy involves understanding
a bit about sleep first.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.510
As you fall asleep, your brain's reticular
activating system (RAS) hands control over

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.489
to the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO)
for sleepytime.

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.750
During that transition is when you twitch,
btw -- we did a whole video on that!

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.250
Once asleep, the brain goes through a predictable
set of four stages (one of those is famous

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.920
Rapid Eye Movement, or REM sleep, where dreaming
happens).

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.250
During sleep, your brain squirts out two paralyzing
chemicals glycine and GABA.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.189
These keep your vocal chords (and mouth, body
muscles and such) paralyzed.

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.560
Okay, so… scientists don't have any idea
why some people talk in their sleep.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.689
Sleep talking can occur at any time during
REM or non-REM sleep; which means it's not

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.729
necessarily when we voice a dream, it can
be anytime!

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.659
Scientists think sometimes, people might slip
through their own paralyzing net of glycine

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.609
and GABA and end up voicing what's happening
inside their head; called a "motor breakthrough."

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:38.039
Or maybe it's because of "transitory arousal,"
which is when we switch between sleep stages.

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:44.289
It's related to sleepwalking and night terrors
and about half of all children and five percent

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.639
of adults will talk in their sleep; and it's
more common among men than women -- though

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:50.780
sleep researchers don't know why.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.119
Sometimes sleep talking is just a few words,
sometimes it's 30 seconds or more and it's

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.119
hardly ever sensical.

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.159
Sometimes sleep talkers are sweet, sometimes
they're explicit, sometimes they whisper,

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.929
sometimes they shout; and that's where it
can turn into a problem for those sharing

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.439
a bedroom with others.

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.679
A study of over 2000 schoolchildren published
in the journal Brain and Development found

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.210
only 10 percent of children will sleep talk
every night, but 50 percent will do so once

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.210
a year.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.220
According to another study in Pediatrics,
by age 13 most childhood sleep abnormalities

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.599
declined, but not somniloquy!

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.469
The problem with most sleep studies is we
don't remember talking in our sleep; because

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:29.469
we're asleep!

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:34.300
And, even when sharing a bed, instances are
so brief the other sleeping person commonly

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.269
misses it too, unless there's persistent conversation
-- which is possible.

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.469
Look up Sleep Talkin' Man for some entertaining
sleep talking.

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:42.469
So funny.

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:47.340
Other than the possibility of waking your
bedfellow, sleep talking isn't generally harmful.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.319
Though, when people frequently experience
somniloquy after age 25, the National Sleep

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.140
Foundation recommends seeking professional
help.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.720
Somniloquy is not connected to insanity, as
portrayed in films and stories, simply stress.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.060
The National Sleep Foundation says adult somniloquy
can be brought on by stress, fever, sleep

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.079
deprivation, alcohol or drugs, or something
more serious, like depression.

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:19.939
Psychology Today advises partners to invest
in a fan, white noise machine, or good earplugs,

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:24.790
if it's causing sleep interruption, but rest-assured
that you'll rest-assured soon.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.400
Often the behavior is short-lived, either
during a period of waking high stress, poor

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.150
sleep, or just kids being kids.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.980
Practicing healthy sleep behaviors -- limiting
caffeine and screens, and keeping a regular

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.859
bed and wake time -- all decrease instances
of sleep talking in adults.

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:47.150
Oh, and if you ARE worried about spilling
your secrets, courts have ruled talking in

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.740
your sleep is inadmissible as evidence, as
it's not the product of a conscious mind,

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.239
so sleep soundly, criminal friends.

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.260
Have you ever experienced somniloquy?

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.129
Either as the talker or the woken up partner?

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.400
Tell me in the comments and be sure you sub.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.950
And for more on sleep check out this GREAT
video from a handsome devil about how sleeping

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:15.730
pills don't actually help you sleep.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:25.050
Thanks!
