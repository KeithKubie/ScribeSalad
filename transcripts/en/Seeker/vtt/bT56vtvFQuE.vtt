00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.160
There's no two ways about it. Space is trying to kill you. Between the no breathable air

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.380
radiation and rocks hurling around everywhere, space
is a human hazard.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.930
Yet we continue to push boundaries and explore
this perilous place.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.610
And it’s miraculous that in more than 50
years of human spaceflight only three men

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.310
have died in space.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.619
So the caveat here is that it all depends
on how you define space.

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.450
If we want to get technical, space starts
at the Kármán Line, an imaginary line 62

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.259
miles above the planet because we need some
way to determine what’s space and what isn’t.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.070
By that formal definition, most of the fatalities
in spaceflight haven’t happened in space.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.079
On January 28, 1986, a faulty seal in a booster
rocket led the space shuttle Challenger to

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.190
explode 73 seconds after launch when it was
just 9 miles above the planet.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.010
Seven astronauts were killed, though the accident
investigation suggests it was actually the

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.250
impact upon hitting the ocean that killed
them, not the explosion.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.920
On February 1, 2003, the space shuttle Columbia
disintegrated over Texas during re-entry,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.430
38 miles (200,700 feet/61,170 meters) above
the ground.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.660
Another seven astronauts were killed.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.420
On April 24, 1967, the parachute on the Soyuz
1 flight failed to open and Vladimir Komarov

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.100
was killed on impact, so on the ground.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.890
On the commercial side of things, pilot error
led to the breakup of Virgin Galactic’s

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.700
SpaceShipTwo on October 31, 2014, during a
test, killing one pilot.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.610
It’s not clear where exactly he died but
it was somewhere between 50,000 ft, where

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.950
the spacecraft broke apart, and the ground.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.930
But either way, still below the Karman line.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.369
However, three men have died in space, albeit
during reentry, not in orbit on a mission.

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.850
The crew of Soyuz 11 were killed on June 30,
1971, above the Kármán line.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.530
This happened when a valve opened at the top
of the descent module, letting the pressurized

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.950
atmosphere escape.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.040
The open valve exposed them to the vacuum
of space, killing the crew in under a minute.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.270
The spacecraft, meanwhile, executed a flawless
automatic landing.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.049
They were found unresponsive with blue patches
on their faces and blood dripping from their

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.130
noses and ears but one was still warm to the
touch.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.050
But aside from those three cosmonauts, no
one else has died in space in 40 years.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.149
So how is that possible?

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.790
With really good technology and understanding
of the hazards of space.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.670
The basic necessities — food, water, and
air — are either replenished by resupply

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.650
missions or recycled by the International
Space Station’s onboard facilities.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.209
The station and the spacecraft that fly to
it are all built with adequate shielding to

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.430
keep crews safe from small impacts.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.790
Lightweight shields called “multishock”
can cushion the blow of impacts.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.000
The ISS also orbits below the Van Allen Belt
so it does have some natural radiation protection.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.940
If something did happen, the ISS’ modularity
offers a lot of protection.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.920
Essential systems can be commanded from the
ground so crews can take care of themselves.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.270
There are even external locks and docking
ports meaning that unmanned vehicles can dock

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.600
with the station or depart under Houston’s
ground control.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.480
And of course there are alarms and monitoring
systems in place to warn astronauts of any

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.350
problems and flight controllers keeping an
eye on everything on the ground.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.640
Of course redundancies and backups make these
systems that much safer.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.739
Really, it’s during launch and landing that
the astronauts are at the most at risk, and

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.790
there are systems in place for that, too.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.860
Like the Apollo launches in the 1960s and
1970s, todays rockets like the Soyuz have

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.340
launch escape systems on board.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.450
These emergency systems are basically small
rockets on top of a spacecraft that can be

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.370
triggered by an automatic emergency signal
or by a ground controller.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.730
It fires, pulling the spacecraft away from,
say, an exploding booster, giving it distance

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.340
and a safe place to land.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.360
It’s actually only been used once; in 1983,
an escape rocket pulled the crew of Soyuz

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.830
T-10-1 away from an explosion on the launchpad.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.599
So yes, space is dangerous.

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.569
But scores of aeronautical engineers and missions
planners all work together to ensure space

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.360
missions run without a hitch.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.150
Thankfully they’re pretty good at not letting
space kill us.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.099
But as missions go further into the depths
of space, the risks will likely increase and

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.189
engineers and planners will have their work
cut out for them.

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.629
Speaking of close calls in space, how long
did it take the crew of Apollo 13 to realize

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.819
they were definitely not landing on the Moon?

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.659
I’ve got the full story over on Vintage
Space.

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.799
Who out there would go to space, even though
it’s super dangerous?
