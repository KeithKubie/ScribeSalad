MARTIN OMANDER: Hi, my
name is Martin Omander,

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.760
and I welcome you to
"Google Root Access,"

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.960
the show featuring
actionable start-up advice.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.640
My guest today is
Nathan Beckord.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.807
Welcome on the show, Nathan.

00:00:14.807 --> 00:00:16.348
NATHAN BECKORD:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:18.020
MARTIN OMANDER: So
you are the founder

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.572
of the start-up Foundersuite.

00:00:19.572 --> 00:00:20.780
NATHAN BECKORD: That's right.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.890
MARTIN OMANDER: Can you tell
us a bit about your startup?

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.765
NATHAN BECKORD: Sure.

00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:26.070
Foundersuite is a collection
of five web apps and about 80

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.050
templates, spreadsheets,
documents, for entrepreneurs.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.520
And the way it came
about is I was consulting

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.260
the start-ups here in Silicon
Valley for about 10 years,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.820
usually in a finance
or biz dev capacity,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.770
built a lot of these
spreadsheets, templates,

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.020
saw a lot of common patterns
of success and failure.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.160
Worked with about
150 companies, so

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.620
got a good pattern recognition
going with start-ups,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.180
and so I decided to
build a tool and document

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.370
collection for them.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.286
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:54.190
150 start-ups-- did
you get any sleep?

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.398
NATHAN BECKORD: Not much, no.

00:00:55.398 --> 00:00:58.072
You can see, I
still have the bags.

00:00:58.072 --> 00:01:00.530
MARTIN OMANDER: So it sounds
like a big part of what you're

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.495
doing is providing templates
to the start-ups who

00:01:04.495 --> 00:01:05.800
are your customers.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.035
What infrastructure
do use for that?

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:09.910
NATHAN BECKORD: Yeah,
so we use Google Drive.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.330
So we have about 80
templates in this collection.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.770
Some examples are like pitch
decks, financial models,

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.710
co-founders agreement,
hiring plans,

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.050
things like that-- pretty
wide diversity of things.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.210
MARTIN OMANDER: Important stuff
that a lot of start-ups forget.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.500
NATHAN BECKORD: Very
important stuff,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.875
and you can screw up your
company if you do things wrong.

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:29.430
So we're trying to
provide some structure.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.610
These templates are in a
variety of file formats,

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.010
as you can probably imagine,
from Keynote, PowerPoint,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.940
Excel, PDF, all over the board.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.080
And we use Google Drive
to store them all.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.940
We originally chose Google Drive
because it was quick and dirty.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.450
It was kind of a hack to get
started with our document

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.950
storage.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.282
But we've stayed on it.

00:01:49.282 --> 00:01:50.740
MARTIN OMANDER: I
like quick hacks.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.560
NATHAN BECKORD: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.260
MARTIN OMANDER: But
you stayed on it.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.780
How come?

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.730
NATHAN BECKORD: Yeah,
because it works for us,

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.900
because it works great.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.204
It's very reliable,
and we enjoy it.

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:02.120
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.160
So when I go into
your app, I've seen

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.699
how there are directories for my
stage of start-up and all that,

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:14.000
and I can click through, and I
get a listing of the templates.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.390
When I do that, what
happens in the background?

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.440
NATHAN BECKORD: Yeah, so our
software is pinging Drive's API

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.940
to see what files are
in our corporate folder.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.240
And then our software is
presenting all these files

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.730
in a very beautiful,
navigable way.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.820
So we have a section
of our site that

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.470
is all the different templates.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.290
And it's broken into categories
like getting started,

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.190
hiring, fund raising,
things like that.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.932
And then also, when you're
working in our web apps,

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:48.140
we have access to these
documents and templates, too.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.680
So for example, if you're
working in our Investor CRM

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.740
tool, managing your
discussions with investors,

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.710
there's a little tab
on the side that you

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.490
can pull up these docs.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.920
Same with the Media CRM
tool, so it's a great way

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.350
to navigate what's
stored on Google Drive.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.300
And then the user can simply
open up one of these files

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.480
and either store it to
their own Google Drive

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.021
or save it to their hard
drive-- very easy to use.

00:03:13.021 --> 00:03:15.520
MARTIN OMANDER: So then if they
store it on their own Google

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.830
Drive account, you
don't need to deal

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.260
with storage space and such.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.635
It is off on their account, and
they have their own version.

00:03:23.635 --> 00:03:25.760
NATHAN BECKORD: Yeah, we
maintain the master copies

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.090
of all these files,
and they make copies

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.424
and do what they want with them.

00:03:30.424 --> 00:03:31.339
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:33.530
So what does this
integration with Google Drive

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.520
bring to you as a keeper
of many documents?

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.220
NATHAN BECKORD: Yeah,
it's been great.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.920
You know, we don't have
to worry about passwords,

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.565
about security.

00:03:42.565 --> 00:03:44.690
MARTIN OMANDER: Passwords--
I've been in a start-up

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.160
where you spent way too much
time worrying about passwords

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.320
rather than our core business.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.710
NATHAN BECKORD: Yeah, you
can't let things like passwords

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.670
derail your start-up.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.190
That would be horrible.

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.310
It lets us not worry about
hosting costs and things

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.500
like that.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.720
Google is very reliable.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.950
I can't think of downtime
in the past couple years.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.630
And for me as a CEO, and I'm
also kind of the product guy,

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.770
it means that can spend
my time out hunting

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.700
for different new documents
to add to the collection,

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.510
or we build our own sometimes.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.100
And it's very easy for
me to add new things

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.640
to the collection in
the proper folder.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.720
I simply go into our corporate
drive, add the thing,

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.690
and then it magically appears
in the user's accounts

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.430
and folders, which is great.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.010
I don't get engineers involved.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.400
I don't have to get coders
involved when I just

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.534
want to add a new document
to the collection.

00:04:39.534 --> 00:04:40.450
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.033
So you mentioned
some of the documents

00:04:42.033 --> 00:04:45.590
that you were storing,
like co-founder agreements,

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.340
like legal agreements,
pitch decks.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.280
NATHAN BECKORD: Yeah.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.540
MARTIN OMANDER: What other
things are you storing?

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.873
NATHAN BECKORD: Yeah, we've
got all kinds of good stuff.

00:04:52.873 --> 00:04:54.332
We have a lot of
marketing tools.

00:04:54.332 --> 00:04:56.540
For example, if you're
looking to do a press release,

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.880
we have press release templates
and sample docs for that.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.620
In our Getting Started
section, there's

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.655
co-founders agreement,
equity split wizard.

00:05:07.655 --> 00:05:09.280
Think of some of the
high profile cases

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.680
recently of Snapchat
or even Facebook

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.745
where they didn't
have a proper equity

00:05:13.745 --> 00:05:17.000
split agreement in
place, and later on,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.380
the third or fourth
co-founder sues.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.250
Getting that stuff right
early on is important.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.420
In our finance section, there's
some planning templates,

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.449
financial models,
hiring planners,

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:29.990
so you can kind of
map out who you're

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.620
planing to hire over
the next 12 months.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.500
There's things like
terms of service and kind

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.760
of boilerplate things
that most start-ups need.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.860
Hiring-- we have NDAs,
contractor agreements,

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.270
things like that, yeah,
a lot of good stuff.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.020
MARTIN OMANDER: Sounds like a
treasure trove of useful stuff.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.410
NATHAN BECKORD: It is.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.510
I'm very proud of it.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.426
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:05:50.426 --> 00:05:52.580
So finally, what
would your advice

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.630
be, Nathan, to a
start-up that needs

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.185
to store a document as
a part of their service?

00:05:57.185 --> 00:05:58.060
NATHAN BECKORD: Sure.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.851
It's pretty simple.

00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:01.390
Play to your strengths, play
to what your start-up does,

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.980
and piggyback on the
talented army of engineers

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.950
here at Google to manage
storage, passwords, security.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.120
There's no reason to
reinvent the wheel.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.460
MARTIN OMANDER: Ah, yes.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.918
I've seen it
reinvented many times,

00:06:14.918 --> 00:06:16.550
and not always very well.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.640
NATHAN BECKORD: Yeah, well, it's
been a great foundation for us.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.720
We've been on this
almost two years now.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.960
And it's been super
reliable, fast, easy,

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.534
and it saves us money.

00:06:26.534 --> 00:06:27.450
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.320
NATHAN BECKORD: I just hope that
you guys keep your servers on.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.528
That's my one request to you.

00:06:30.528 --> 00:06:32.732
Just keep those servers lit
up, and we're all happy.

00:06:32.732 --> 00:06:33.690
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh yes.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.450
After we shut down
the cameras, I'll

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.650
go in and talk to the guys.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.090
NATHAN BECKORD: Good, good.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.990
MARTIN OMANDER:
All right, great.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.310
Thank you so much for
coming on the show

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.144
and sharing your
experience with us, Nathan.

00:06:42.144 --> 00:06:43.685
NATHAN BECKORD:
Thanks for having me.

00:06:43.685 --> 00:06:44.370
Appreciate it.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.161
MARTIN OMANDER: We hope
you found something

00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:48.090
you can use in your start-up.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:49.390
Your input matters.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:50.990
Please leave your
comments below.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.770
We read everything you write.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.050
To learn how Google
can help your start-up,

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.330
go to
developers.google.com/startups.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.550
If you would like to
be a guest on the show,

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.480
go to bit.ly/applyrootaccess.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.430
That's it for now.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.533
See you next time.
