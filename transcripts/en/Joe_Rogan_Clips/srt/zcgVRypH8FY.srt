1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,130
Happen, the Joe Rogan experience and
uh, got some techno Huntin as well.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,790
But I told you about that game. That
game's very addictive, isn't it?

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,250
I'm already ready trying to get back out
there to do some more when it is over.

4
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:15,390
So itchy, right? Yeah. Yeah. No, it's
amazing man that, that game is incredible.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:16,920
How long have you been bowhunting for?

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,540
I've been bow hunting since I was 16 or
17, but I've been hunting my whole life.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,160
Wow. What switched you over
to bow hunting? I'm a high
school teammate, actually.

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,330
I used to go right behind and stuff with
a shotgun and I've been shooting the

9
00:00:29,331 --> 00:00:32,490
ball since I was like 12 or
11 just three d shooting.

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,430
Are you ever bowhunter will you
can hunt with this like yeah,

11
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,640
like we go hunt all the time. So I,
one day before school he picked me up,

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,060
went over to my buddy's house
and got up in the stand.

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,890
When he got into the stand I couldn't
climb because I didn't know where I was

14
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:47,610
doing. I got stuck at the bottom of the
tree. I knew him a bowl on my lap. So,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,260
but that was my first time and after
that I just kept going every now and then

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,210
in between practices and whatnot.
But now when I've got time between fight,

17
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,640
knowing that I'm all hunting, that's it.
Well I can tell by your Instagram, man,

18
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,850
I follow your Instagram, all your,
you're constantly shooting and hunting,

19
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:07,290
practicing and it's, it gets
in your blood. Lemme just
like fighting. Like I said,

20
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:10,590
we were doing technique. I do
it so much, it's muscle memory.

21
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,140
Like everybody thinks, oh you spent too
much time hunting, you're not training.

22
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,270
When I go win a fight. And I'm
like, oh that was impressive.

23
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:18,930
Like I still train two or three times a
day, but I get off from the gym and my,

24
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,550
I always have a bowl on my truck.

25
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,340
I have three bowls on one is
always on my truck. So I pull up,

26
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:26,250
popped the door is open, grab my
speaker in the targets is right there,

27
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,450
get like 30 to 60 shots and then go
and spend time with the family, eat,

28
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:33,690
go back to the gym, come, go to the
range and shoot indoors and it's dark.

29
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,270
And I'm always shooting.
I just enjoy it. Wow.

30
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,300
So is it like a part of
meditation for you, do you think?

31
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,680
100% come out to OSP fight?
That was actually the first
time I find it in Jersey.

32
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:48,270
I've been in Jersey since 2014 when the
show came out and I have to Osp Phi and

33
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:49,890
all that stuff and everybody told me,
I don't pay it.

34
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:51,360
That you was winning that fight.
You got caught.

35
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,880
Don't let do people get in your
head and tell you you're not there.

36
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,470
So actually the next day I went home,

37
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:58,380
I went and bought him a hunting license
and bought a Stan and high in Jersey for

38
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:00,180
the first time and it helped me.

39
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,050
I didn't think about it all from November
to February 1st I wasn't a Theresa and

40
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:07,480
every day, and I went back to
training, like fool camp, whatever.

41
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:10,410
Everything in my mind I follow,
forgot all about that OSP fight.

42
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,590
And that's what I told my wife. I found
my balance. You know, the thing was,

43
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,310
I was always in the gym and that's why
the name 25 eight came because Corey

44
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:20,340
never at the time I didn't do
anything else with train. You know,

45
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,040
we're trained to go to the
gym and train to go therapy,

46
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:27,060
go back to the gym and train, go home,
ruin, go to garage, hit the heavy bag,

47
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,750
go to mark Henry's hit pads
and go try again. So yeah.
