00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
Good morning my friends! I'm back today with a cool little trick

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.200
that traces back to my childhood.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.280
Now a lot of you have probably seen this done before,

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.700
I'm doing this video for those of you who haven't.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.240
It's really simple , it's really fun, and honestly it's something you can go try right now!

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.880
All your gonna need for this experiment is: a fork, a spoon, a couple of matches or some toothpicks and

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.060
some kind of a glass  or a container that you can set them on.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.240
When you got your fork and your spoon, we simply want to

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.500
push them together, taking the tip of our spoon, and pushing it into the tines of the fork.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.780
What we're looking for here are the two outer tines of the fork on the backside of the spoon and the inner tines right on the center

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.540
What this does essentially is turn your fork and spoon into a little pendulum that you can balance on your finger.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.040
But here is where it gets really cool!

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.740
Take your matchstick and push the back end of it through the center tines of the fork, about an eight of an inch.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.100
Now if you center it just right and hold this by the head of the match you can see the whole

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.000
thing balances. And if you set this down on the edge of a container or a glass, it almost

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.100
seems to do the impossible. It balances in place. The reason this trick works is because we're manipulating the center of gravity. The mass

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.980
in the handles of the fork and the spoon are actually heavier than they are at the heads.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.040
This point of the matchstick is called the center of gravity, Its the exact perfect point where the whole system can be balanced

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.180
and because the majority of the weight is actually below the center of gravity it makes the whole system very stable

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.700
which means you can jiggle it a little bit and it won't fall off.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.500
Now take your fork and your spoon pull out your matchstick and this time we are gonna put it in top tine  here

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.480
Now you'll find that in this configuration when we set it down on the edge of our cup our fulcrum point has shifted to about the center point of the matchstick

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.920
So we got half of the matchstick on the one side and half of the matchstick on the other.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.220
So now here is the question

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.080
If we light the end of this matchstick on fire how much of the wood will have to be burned to tip the balance making the fork and spoon fall off?

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.200
Go ahead and make your predictions in the comments right now.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.860
Will the fork and spoon fall off the second we light the off or do you thing it will actually hang on until the flame burns the wood pass the edge of the glass?

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.620
Lets light it up to find out

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.560
3.....2.....1 
Ignition

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.000
Alright we got our flame.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.020
You can see the matchstick is starting to burn here.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.480
The system hasn't moved. It's not even shaking.
We've consumed about a quarter of the matchstick.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.100
We're coming up on the edge.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.160
And here is the moment of truth.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.280
Flame is a little past the edge,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.280
and it just went out.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.900
Did you guys see that? The flame was burning and then as soon as it hit the edge of the glass it spontaneously went out.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.360
It like extinguished itself

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.080
Look at the black charred match head here and we just tap that with another matchstick

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.480
we can actually break it right off.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.180
Look at that.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.180
And that's the exact fulcrum point of the system

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.500
Perfectly balanced

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.500
Lets try that again and see if we can get it to burn any further

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.900
I'm gonna tilt this one slightly uphill so it burns a little faster.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.500
It's approaching the edge of the glass with good speed.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.140
And there it is...

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.160
And the flame dies out.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.940
Every single time

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.120
Every single time guys the flame hits the edge of the glass the flame goes out.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.920
Let's try one more time just to be sure.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.680
I'm actually gonna stand over here just to make sure that my breath isn't interfering.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.040
The flame is past the edge...

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.800
and...

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.820
Yep,

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.000
every single time.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.480
So guys this is really interesting three times we lit these off and all three times the flame traveled to the edge of the glass,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.360
sometimes beyond but before the thing actually fell off the flame went out.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.540
Why do you thing that is?

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.800
Its very interesting very curious isn't it?

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.360
And here is something else that's cool: if you take another matchstick you can actually balance this right on the tip.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.460
So that's it guys. 
Extremely cool experiment with gravity and center of gravity that you can go try right now.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.160
And if you have already tried this trick before go try it again or share it with a friend.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.760
It's just as much fun the second time.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.080
Thanks for joining me for this experiment guys, and I'll be looking for ya on the next one.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.780
Talk to you then!

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.640
My bad, i just dropped the spoon and the fork and just broke my glass. Cost of doing business.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.960
Bye bye Martini Glass you've served us well.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.900
