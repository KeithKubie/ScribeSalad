00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.840
the first proposition that they make is

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850
the first proposition that they make is
 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.820
the first proposition that they make is
that we should treat the reality that

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830
that we should treat the reality that
 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.099
that we should treat the reality that
we're dealing with as psychologists we

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109
we're dealing with as psychologists we
 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.320
we're dealing with as psychologists we
should treat human experience as that

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330
should treat human experience as that
 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.680
should treat human experience as that
reality and so the reality for you from

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690
reality and so the reality for you from
 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.330
reality and so the reality for you from
a phenomenological perspective is

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340
a phenomenological perspective is
 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.160
a phenomenological perspective is
everything you experience they assume

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170
everything you experience they assume
 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.050
everything you experience they assume
everything you experience is real and

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060
everything you experience is real and
 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.060
everything you experience is real and
they also assume that you can't actually

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070
they also assume that you can't actually
 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.429
they also assume that you can't actually
get more real than that and so your

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439
get more real than that and so your
 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.170
get more real than that and so your
consciousness whatever that is is real

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180
consciousness whatever that is is real
 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.550
consciousness whatever that is is real
and your dreams are real and your

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560
and your dreams are real and your
 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.410
and your dreams are real and your
emotions are real and your pain is real

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420
emotions are real and your pain is real
 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.599
emotions are real and your pain is real
which is a really useful thing to think

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609
which is a really useful thing to think
 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.580
which is a really useful thing to think
if you want to make sure that you're not

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590
if you want to make sure that you're not
 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.500
if you want to make sure that you're not
going to hurt people you know you kind

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510
going to hurt people you know you kind
 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.030
going to hurt people you know you kind
of have to think that maybe faint pain

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040
of have to think that maybe faint pain
 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.770
of have to think that maybe faint pain
should be treated as a fundamental

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780
should be treated as a fundamental
 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.959
should be treated as a fundamental
reality instead of as an epiphenomena of

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969
reality instead of as an epiphenomena of
 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.240
reality instead of as an epiphenomena of
some material substrate and so that's

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250
some material substrate and so that's
 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.040
some material substrate and so that's
their first perspective and they took

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050
their first perspective and they took
 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.690
their first perspective and they took
that from Heidegger because Heidegger

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700
that from Heidegger because Heidegger
 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.240
that from Heidegger because Heidegger
thought that Western philosophy had gone

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250
thought that Western philosophy had gone
 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.799
thought that Western philosophy had gone
got off on the wrong track

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809
got off on the wrong track
 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.770
got off on the wrong track
you know three thousand years ago

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780
you know three thousand years ago
 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.450
you know three thousand years ago
because we didn't really concentrate on

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460
because we didn't really concentrate on
 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.760
because we didn't really concentrate on
being itself as the fundamental mystery

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770
being itself as the fundamental mystery
 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.889
being itself as the fundamental mystery
and so the fundamental mystery is why

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899
and so the fundamental mystery is why
 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.470
and so the fundamental mystery is why
the hell is there anything and since

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480
the hell is there anything and since
 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.560
the hell is there anything and since
there is something experiential being

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570
there is something experiential being
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.990
there is something experiential being
what are its fundamental elements and so

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000
what are its fundamental elements and so
 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.910
what are its fundamental elements and so
that's the phenomenological stance it's

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920
that's the phenomenological stance it's
 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.490
that's the phenomenological stance it's
it's completely it's not the same as a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500
it's completely it's not the same as a
 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.770
it's completely it's not the same as a
scientific approach because it starts

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
scientific approach because it starts
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.719
scientific approach because it starts
with a different presupposition you know

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729
with a different presupposition you know
 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.030
with a different presupposition you know
the scientific presupposition roughly

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040
the scientific presupposition roughly
 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.060
the scientific presupposition roughly
speaking is that things are the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070
speaking is that things are the
 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.399
speaking is that things are the
objectively real elements of things are

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
objectively real elements of things are
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.460
objectively real elements of things are
the most real elements and there's no

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470
the most real elements and there's no
 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.929
the most real elements and there's no
sense complaining about that because

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939
sense complaining about that because
 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.330
sense complaining about that because
it's a approach that works tremendously

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
it's a approach that works tremendously
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.219
it's a approach that works tremendously
well for many many things including

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229
well for many many things including
 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.770
well for many many things including
making hydrogen bonds for example but

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
making hydrogen bonds for example but
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.440
making hydrogen bonds for example but
it's also reasonable to think that well

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450
it's also reasonable to think that well
 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.780
it's also reasonable to think that well
it might not be the it might not be the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790
it might not be the it might not be the
 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.429
it might not be the it might not be the
whole truth and nothing but the truth

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
whole truth and nothing but the truth
 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.740
whole truth and nothing but the truth
and maybe you could also suspect that

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750
and maybe you could also suspect that
 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.300
and maybe you could also suspect that
the fact that we can manufacture

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310
the fact that we can manufacture
 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.609
the fact that we can manufacture
hydrogen bonds also might indicate that

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619
hydrogen bonds also might indicate that
 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.830
hydrogen bonds also might indicate that
there's something a trifle off with our

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840
there's something a trifle off with our
 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.020
there's something a trifle off with our
fundamental belief systems scientific

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030
fundamental belief systems scientific
 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.850
fundamental belief systems scientific
though they may be and that was

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860
though they may be and that was
 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.080
though they may be and that was
certainly something that concerned

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090
certainly something that concerned
 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.550
certainly something that concerned
Heidegger even though he got all tangled

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560
Heidegger even though he got all tangled
 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.160
Heidegger even though he got all tangled
up with the Nazis so the phenomenologist

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170
up with the Nazis so the phenomenologist
 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.499
up with the Nazis so the phenomenologist
were trying to take apart experience as

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509
were trying to take apart experience as
 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.499
were trying to take apart experience as
such and they made some some hypotheses

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509
such and they made some some hypotheses
 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.359
such and they made some some hypotheses
and then some observations so the first

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369
and then some observations so the first
 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.760
and then some observations so the first
is that we're going to assume that your

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770
is that we're going to assume that your
 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.850
is that we're going to assume that your
experience like experience itself is

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860
experience like experience itself is
 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.290
experience like experience itself is
real now

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300
real now
 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.420
real now
you just because dreams are real and

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430
you just because dreams are real and
 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.430
you just because dreams are real and
pain is real doesn't mean and like

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440
pain is real doesn't mean and like
 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.040
pain is real doesn't mean and like
objects that we can all perceive are

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050
objects that we can all perceive are
 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.240
objects that we can all perceive are
real doesn't mean you should put them

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250
real doesn't mean you should put them
 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.580
real doesn't mean you should put them
all in the same category like my dreams

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590
all in the same category like my dreams
 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.070
all in the same category like my dreams
are not in the same category of reality

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080
are not in the same category of reality
 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.710
are not in the same category of reality
as this table because you don't have

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720
as this table because you don't have
 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.840
as this table because you don't have
access to my dreams and you have access

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850
access to my dreams and you have access
 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.490
access to my dreams and you have access
to the table but that doesn't mean that

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500
to the table but that doesn't mean that
 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.170
to the table but that doesn't mean that
my dreams in my pains and my emotions

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180
my dreams in my pains and my emotions
 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.180
my dreams in my pains and my emotions
aren't real they're real

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190
aren't real they're real
 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.010
aren't real they're real
so that's the first now you should note

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020
so that's the first now you should note
 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.330
so that's the first now you should note
that this is a this is a proposition

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340
that this is a this is a proposition
 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.190
that this is a this is a proposition
what they're saying is let's act as if

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200
what they're saying is let's act as if
 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.060
what they're saying is let's act as if
that's true and then work from those

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070
that's true and then work from those
 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.860
that's true and then work from those
premises and see what happens see where

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870
premises and see what happens see where
 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.300
premises and see what happens see where
we can get with it and that that's

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310
we can get with it and that that's
 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.770
we can get with it and that that's
that's a perfectly reasonable thing to

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780
that's a perfectly reasonable thing to
 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.810
that's a perfectly reasonable thing to
do because at the bottom of a theory you

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820
do because at the bottom of a theory you
 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.760
do because at the bottom of a theory you
also have you always have to put an

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770
also have you always have to put an
 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.160
also have you always have to put an
assumption because otherwise your theory

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170
assumption because otherwise your theory
 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.600
assumption because otherwise your theory
would be a hundred percent right and

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610
would be a hundred percent right and
 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.970
would be a hundred percent right and
would cover everything and it doesn't so

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980
would cover everything and it doesn't so
 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.990
would cover everything and it doesn't so
you have to throw an assumption

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000
you have to throw an assumption
 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.580
you have to throw an assumption
somewhere in there at the bottom and say

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590
somewhere in there at the bottom and say
 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.320
somewhere in there at the bottom and say
okay we're not we're not questioning

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330
okay we're not we're not questioning
 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.310
okay we're not we're not questioning
that that's the starting point so and it

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320
that that's the starting point so and it
 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.840
that that's the starting point so and it
you have to do that because you're

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850
you have to do that because you're
 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.070
you have to do that because you're
ignorant you don't have a full theory so

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080
ignorant you don't have a full theory so
 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.870
ignorant you don't have a full theory so
they don't like the idea that mind can

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880
they don't like the idea that mind can
 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.490
they don't like the idea that mind can
be reduced to matter they're not playing

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500
be reduced to matter they're not playing

about when I look at that coke can you
 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.080
about when I look at that coke can you
might say I perceive the object and then

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090
might say I perceive the object and then
 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.390
might say I perceive the object and then
I make inferences about its use and then

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400
I make inferences about its use and then
 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.430
I make inferences about its use and then
I evaluate it and then I use it and you

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440
I evaluate it and then I use it and you
 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.590
I evaluate it and then I use it and you
know that is not actually what you do in

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600
know that is not actually what you do in
 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.410
know that is not actually what you do in
fact it's not obvious at all that what

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420
fact it's not obvious at all that what
 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.020
fact it's not obvious at all that what
you perceive are objects and if you

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030
you perceive are objects and if you
 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.970
you perceive are objects and if you
think about it well people weren't

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980
think about it well people weren't
 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.930
think about it well people weren't
perceiving scientific objects until like

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940
perceiving scientific objects until like
 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.850
perceiving scientific objects until like
1500 AD or 1450 so there was no

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860
1500 AD or 1450 so there was no
 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.990
1500 AD or 1450 so there was no
objective object before then so

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000
objective object before then so
 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.510
objective object before then so
obviously whatever we were perceiving

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520
obviously whatever we were perceiving
 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.790
obviously whatever we were perceiving
was not precisely that because we would

natural engineers and when we look at

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560
natural engineers and when we look at
 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.530
natural engineers and when we look at
the world we don't see objects and then

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540
the world we don't see objects and then
 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.020
the world we don't see objects and then
in further use what we actually see is

in further use what we actually see is
 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.200
in further use what we actually see is
the use so for example when I look at

with blind sight I've told you about
 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.940
with blind sight I've told you about

those people they say they can't see but
 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.650

if you ask them which hand you have held

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660
if you ask them which hand you have held
 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.350
if you ask them which hand you have held
up they can tell you so they might not

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360
up they can tell you so they might not
 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.260
up they can tell you so they might not
be able to see but they can map patterns

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270
be able to see but they can map patterns
 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.909

motor output you know and that's
 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.600

basically what Piaget said we do when we

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610
basically what Piaget said we do when we
 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.220
basically what Piaget said we do when we
deal with the world

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230

we're embodied creatures you know and so

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390
we're embodied creatures you know and so

you know and that's the theory that was
 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.940
you know and that's the theory that was
derived originally from JJ Gibson who

and the pragmatist basically claimed
 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.409
and the pragmatist basically claimed
that you know things including theories

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419
that you know things including theories
 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.510
that you know things including theories
and perceptions have a limited range of

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520
and perceptions have a limited range of
 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.690
and perceptions have a limited range of
truth and the truth that that the

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700
truth and the truth that that the
 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.120
truth and the truth that that the
limited range of truth is determined by

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130
limited range of truth is determined by
 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.370
limited range of truth is determined by
the match between your actions and

no but it's good enough for me if I want
to drink a bit of coke out of it god

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940
to drink a bit of coke out of it god

only knows what it is you know if you go

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:14.850
only knows what it is you know if you go
 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.880
only knows what it is you know if you go
into communist China and you start

into communist China and you start
 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.330
into communist China and you start
advertising these things then what are

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340
advertising these things then what are
 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.030
advertising these things then what are
they because this thing tells a story

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040
they because this thing tells a story
 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.210
they because this thing tells a story
right what's the story like really do

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220
right what's the story like really do
