00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.750
Here is a summary of the kind of Heuristics that an AI agent might use in

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.394
criminal concept learning. You only come across five of them,

00:00:07.394 --> 00:00:13.125
require-link, forbid-link, drop-link, enlarge-set and

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:18.190
climb-tree. Here is another one called close-interval, let's look at it briefly.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.190
Let's go to David's example of a child having a dog and

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.950
suppose that child has only come across dogs that were very small in size.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.810
Now the child comes across a large dog. In that case the child might change

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.090
the concept definition, expand the range of values that the dog can take,

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.080
that dog size can take so that the larger dog can be included. So the difference

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.200
here being that it's values can be continuous like size of a dog and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.260
sort of indiscreet as in the other hero sticks
