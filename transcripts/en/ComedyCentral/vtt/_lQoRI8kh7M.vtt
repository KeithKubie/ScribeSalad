00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:02.802
- Today we remember and
celebrate the friends

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:05.138
who weren't just there for
us during the good times.

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:06.773
- But were also there for the
bad ones.

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:09.108
- To you, we say thank you.

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:09.776
- Thank you.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:10.844
- Thank you.

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.546
- For holding my hair back
as I puked in the toilet

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:14.614
and on your shoes a little bit.

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:17.717
- For letting me borrow
your jacket for five years

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.751
without you knowing.

00:00:18.784 --> 00:00:20.219
- For helping me move

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:23.623
that dead body before anyone
could see.

00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:27.827
- For that time when you
shared your fake ID with me.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.395
- For loaning me money

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:31.664
when I needed to buy
shovels to dig that hole.

00:00:32.598 --> 00:00:33.666
- Is anybody else hearing this
guy?

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.568
- Today we honor you.

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:38.271
- For blocking creepy guys
from talking to me at the club.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.373
- For helping me build
a shed over the hole

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:42.275
so nobody would look there.

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:44.110
- Do you hear that, or is it
just me?

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:45.211
- For taking my phone away

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:48.214
when I started drunk-texting
my ex's new girlfriend.

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:49.081
- Seriously?

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:50.583
- I mean it's not like I'd kill
anybody,

00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:51.484
but this dude,

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:54.153
he was trying to cheat at
checkers.

00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:56.556
- For only posting pics
where I look good too.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.291
- So are we just gonna act
like it's not happening?

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:00.426
- I'm saying, man, board games
is life!

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:02.562
So if you try to cheat
me out of a board game,

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:03.863
you're trying to cheat me out of
life!

00:01:03.896 --> 00:01:06.265
- For that, we say thank you.

00:01:06.298 --> 00:01:07.133
- Thank you.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:07.800
- Thank you.

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:08.901
- Thank you.

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:11.370
And if you ever tell anybody
what you know about me,

00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:14.240
just remember, I know your
secrets too.

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:15.441
- Happy Friendship Day.

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:16.709
- Happy Friendship Day.

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:17.877
- Happy Friendship Day.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.312
- Happy Friendship Day.

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:20.213
- No snitchin'.
