00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.740
[Music]

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.920
We've all experienced sadness, but usually,
our sadness does fade over time and gets better.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.150
But what happens when the sadness lingers?

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.090
Depression goes beyond normal sadness, it
can become an all-encompassing disorder.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.789
There are different types of depression but
the most common is known as Major Depressive

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:25.820
Disorder.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.590
According to the DSM-V, Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, to have major

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.350
depressive disorder, you must meet five of
the possible criteria outlined in the DSM-V

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.930
and at least one of the symptoms must be depressive
episodes.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.220
But what other signs are there of depression?

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.820
How do you spot if your friend or even you
are suffering from this disorder?

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.550
Watch on to find out 7 important signs of
depression.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.920
One; neglecting friends and hobbies.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.120
Another frustrating symptom of depression
is something known as "Anhedonia". This means

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.820
the loss of pleasure from activities which
would usually be fun.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.540
This leads to neglecting activities in people
as they no longer give the person with depression

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.689
any sense of pleasure or fun.

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.420
According to "Psychology Today" writer Faith Brynie, it is one of the most common symptoms

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.750
of depression.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.970
So if your friend no longer seems interested
in their hobbies like Pokemon Go, playing

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.520
guitar or dancing it may be a good time to
check in with them.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.500
Two; changes in sleep pattern.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.170
Our sleep pattern is incredibly important
for our mental health, often changes to our

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.880
sleep pattern are one of the signs that were
suffering mentally.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.310
This is particularly an issue as an irregular
sleep pattern can make depression worse.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.659
Depression can cause insomnia, too little
sleep or hypersomnia, sleeping too much.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.771
These changes in sleep pattern also tend to
result in a decrease in overall energy. This

00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:54.700
symptom is very common.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.250
Nutt Wilson and Patterson found that 75% of
depressed patients reported insomnia and 40%

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.110
reported hypersomnia.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.550
So if you notice a change to your sleep pattern,
it might be a sign you're depressed.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.670
Three; change in appetite.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.650
Another thing that depression can influence
is our appetites. Some people with depression

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.400
find their appetite is much lower, feeling
unable to eat.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.900
Conversely, some people with depression have
an increased appetite and may turn to food

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.430
to comfort eat.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.930
Simmons et al found that certain brain areas
were involved in whether someone with depression

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.370
lost or increased their appetite.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.730
So, if you notice your friends' appetite seems
to have changed drastically, that might be

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.540
a sign they're suffering from depression.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.360
Four; low self-esteem.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.420
Self-esteem is something that is often majorly
affected by depression. Depression can make

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.910
you only see the negative things about yourself
and downplay your achievements.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.569
This is a serious symptom of depression as
it can lead to people feeling worthless.

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.099
It's even been shown in studies that low self-esteem
as an adolescence is a risk factor for depression

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.320
as an adult.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.470
If you feel like there's nothing positive
about you or you have friends who always seem

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.440
to put themselves down, it could be due to
depression.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.420
Five; decrease in hygiene.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.120
One way the lack of energy from depression
can manifest is a decrease in someone's hygiene.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.040
Often those with depression struggle to shower,
clean their teeth or other self grooming habits

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.599
we take for granted.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.010
This is due to their fatigue and lack of motivation
to complete tasks.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.360
So, if your friend is looking less clean and
groomed it might be due to a depressive episode.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.129
Six; irritability.

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.020
Do you ever find that everyone and everything
is getting on your nerves?

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.300
Do you feel like you're tense and pent-up?

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.390
Irritability is one of the symptoms of depression.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.769
When you feel so negative about everything,
it can make even little things feel incredibly

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:53.769
annoying.

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.519
Besharat et al also suggests depression causes
dysfunction in mood regulation, meaning anger

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.060
is more likely to be displayed.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.629
So if you notice you or a friend have a shorter
fuse than usual, it might be worth looking

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.900
into why that is.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.090
Seven; Flat emotions.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.810
There is a misconception that depression is
all about feeling sad all the time. This however

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.530
isn't the case.

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.620
One other symptom of depression is known as
"Flat Mood". This is where a person's mood is

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.680
dull.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.340
Often people say they feel numb or like they
can't feel anything at all. They don't feel

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.560
sad but they also can't feel happy either.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.530
If this feeling is something you've experienced,
you might want to seek help as you may be

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.300
suffering from depression.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.540
If you feel like you strongly relate to the
signs in this video, you should seek professional

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.540
help.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.180
A doctor will talk to you about your symptoms
and may have you complete a self-report questionnaire

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.930
to help diagnose you.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.770
Once your doctor suspects you have depression,
they will discuss treatment options such as

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.960
medication and therapy with you.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.520
