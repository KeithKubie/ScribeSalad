00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.980
 We are asked to take -6x ^ 4 - 3x ^ 2y ^ 2 + 5y ^ 4 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:13.400
 of 2 x 4 - 8 x 2 2 y 2 - y - 4. 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.600
 I also recommend that you pause the video and try to do it. 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.685
 All right, let's solve it together. 

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:23.120
 We'll take out the green polynomial from this purple. 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.791
 So we can write it like ... 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.707
 we can actually write 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:37.200
 2x4 - 8x ^ 2y ^ 2 - y ^ 4 minus ... 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.460
 I will write this in brackets, 

00:00:39.462 --> 00:00:41.227
 I will leave a little space ... 

00:00:41.227 --> 00:00:53.160
 minus (-6x4-4x3x2x2 + 5y4) 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.413
 Note that 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.260
 I remove this green polynomial with two variables 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.918
 of this purple polynomial with two variables. 

00:00:59.918 --> 00:01:02.425
 Which is exactly what we are told to do. 

00:01:02.425 --> 00:01:04.005
 So how much will it be? 

00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:06.118
 Okay, I can just copy the purple part. 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:13.900
 We will have 2 x 4 - 8 x 2 2 y 2 - y 4 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.612
 And then I can uncover the braces and change the signs. 

00:01:16.612 --> 00:01:22.835
 The negative of -6x4 is plus 6x4. 

00:01:22.835 --> 00:01:26.318
 So this will be plus 6x4. 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:38.600
 The negative of -3x ^ 2 ^ ^ will be plus 3x ^ 2 ^ ^. 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.319
 And then, finally, but not least, 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.382
 we have minus or subtract plus 5 ^ 4. 

00:01:45.382 --> 00:01:50.165
 So this will be subtraction of 5u ^ 4 

00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:51.972
 or -SO4. 

00:01:51.972 --> 00:01:55.478
 And now we can try to simplify. 

00:01:55.478 --> 00:01:58.104
 Let's first look at this article here. 

00:01:58.794 --> 00:02:01.221
 We have 2 × ^ 4. 

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:05.920
 And what we see is another member with x degree four. 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.040
 We see it here. 

00:02:08.043 --> 00:02:10.180
 So we have 2 x 4 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.105
 and we can add it to 6x4. 

00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:14.172
 How much will it be? 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.100
 If we have two of something and then add another 6 of this thing, 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.980
 this will be 8x ^ 4 ... 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.651
 ... 2 + 6 is 8. 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.940
 2x4 + plus 6x4 will be 8x4. 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.100
 And now we have this member with x ^ 2 ^ ^. 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.597
 We can say we take 8 of them. 

00:02:33.597 --> 00:02:38.032
 Here we add 3 of these members with x ^ 2 ^ ^. 

00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:39.426
 So we can collect these odds. 

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:41.562
 If we remove eight, but add three, 

00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:43.270
 we can treat it as 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.240
 -8 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × × 2 × 2 × 2. 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.308
 Okay, how much is minus 8 plus 3? 

00:02:51.308 --> 00:02:53.491
 This will be minus 5. 

00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:57.251
 -5 × 2 × 2 ^ 2. 

00:02:57.251 --> 00:02:59.063
 So this is this article. 

00:02:59.063 --> 00:03:00.828
 Let me write it a bit clearer. 

00:03:00.828 --> 00:03:02.720
 This is the article here. 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.540
 Do not forget to include this sign. 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.490
 Removes 8x1, 2u2, 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.895
 you can do that as -8 x 2 2 x 2 2 plus 3 x 2 x 2 x 2 2. 

00:03:13.895 --> 00:03:15.567
 Last, but not least, 

00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:22.394
 subtract one u ^ 4 and then subtract another 5 ^ 4. 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.180
 How much will it be? 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.680
 You can see it as -1x ^ 4 - 5u ^ 4. 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.163
 Minus 1 minus 5 is minus 6. 

00:03:33.163 --> 00:03:37.272
 Minus 6u ^ 4 .. 

00:03:37.272 --> 00:03:39.269
 And we're ready, we're out 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.190
 this one.
