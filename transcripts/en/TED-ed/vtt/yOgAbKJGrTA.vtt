00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:09.621
Think back to a really vivid memory.

00:00:09.621 --> 00:00:10.617
Got it?

00:00:10.617 --> 00:00:14.955
Okay, now try to remember what 
you had for lunch three weeks ago.

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:18.261
That second memory 
probably isn't as strong,

00:00:18.261 --> 00:00:19.928
but why not?

00:00:19.928 --> 00:00:23.207
Why do we remember some things,
and not others?

00:00:23.207 --> 00:00:26.549
And why do memories eventually fade?

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:29.663
Let's look at how memories form
in the first place.

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:32.749
When you experience something,
like dialing a phone number,

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:36.698
the experience is converted 
into a pulse of electrical energy

00:00:36.698 --> 00:00:40.035
that zips along a network of neurons.

00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:42.671
Information first lands 
in short term memory,

00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:45.753
where it's available 
from anywhere from a few seconds

00:00:45.753 --> 00:00:47.369
to a couple of minutes.

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:51.799
It's then transferred to long-term memory
through areas such as the hippocampus,

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:55.391
and finally to several storage regions
across the brain.

00:00:55.391 --> 00:00:58.442
Neurons throughout the brain
communicate at dedicated sites

00:00:58.442 --> 00:00:59.983
called synapses

00:00:59.983 --> 00:01:02.523
using specialized neurotransmitters.

00:01:02.523 --> 00:01:07.276
If two neurons communicate repeatedly,
a remarkable thing happens:

00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:11.481
the efficiency of communication 
between them increases.

00:01:11.481 --> 00:01:14.950
This process, 
called long term potentiation,

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.543
is considered to be a mechanism
by which memories are stored long-term,

00:01:19.543 --> 00:01:22.407
but how do some memories get lost?

00:01:22.407 --> 00:01:24.140
Age is one factor.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.902
As we get older, 
synapses begin to falter and weaken,

00:01:27.902 --> 00:01:30.816
affecting how easily 
we can retrieve memories.

00:01:30.816 --> 00:01:34.835
Scientists have several theories about
what's behind this deterioration,

00:01:34.835 --> 00:01:36.409
from actual brain shrinkage,

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.623
the hippocampus 
loses 5% of its neurons every decade

00:01:40.623 --> 00:01:44.198
for a total loss of 20% by the time 
you're 80 years old

00:01:44.198 --> 00:01:47.149
to the drop in the production 
of neurotransmitters,

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.479
like acetylcholine,
which is vital to learning and memory.

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.564
These changes seem to affect how people
retrieve stored information.

00:01:55.564 --> 00:01:58.425
Age also affects 
our memory-making abilities.

00:01:58.425 --> 00:02:02.153
Memories are encoded most strongly
when we're paying attention,

00:02:02.153 --> 00:02:06.192
when we're deeply engaged,
and when information is meaningful to us.

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:09.955
Mental and physical health problems,
which tend to increase as we age,

00:02:09.955 --> 00:02:13.326
interfere with our ability 
to pay attention,

00:02:13.326 --> 00:02:15.738
and thus act as memory thieves.

00:02:15.738 --> 00:02:19.169
Another leading cause of memory problems
is chronic stress.

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:23.122
When we're constantly overloaded with work
and personal responsibilites,

00:02:23.122 --> 00:02:25.301
our bodies are on hyperalert.

00:02:25.301 --> 00:02:28.066
This response has evolved from
the physiological mechanism

00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:31.351
designed to make sure 
we can survive in a crisis.

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:36.035
Stress chemicals help mobilize energy
and increase alertness.

00:02:36.035 --> 00:02:40.557
However, with chronic stress our bodies
become flooded with these chemicals,

00:02:40.557 --> 00:02:44.869
resulting in a loss of brain cells
and an inability to form new ones,

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:48.140
which affects our ability 
to retain new information.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.169
Depression is another culprit.

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:54.730
People who are depressed are 40%
more likely to develop memory problems.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.629
Low levels of serotonin,

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.298
a neurotransmitter connected to arousal,

00:02:59.298 --> 00:03:03.094
may make depressed individuals 
less attentive to new information.

00:03:03.094 --> 00:03:07.621
Dwelling on sad events in the past,
another symptom of depression,

00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:10.501
makes it difficult to pay 
attention to the present,

00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:13.525
affecting the ability to store
short-term memories.

00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:18.053
Isolation, which is tied to depression,
is another memory thief.

00:03:18.053 --> 00:03:20.073
A study by the Harvard School 
of Public Health

00:03:20.073 --> 00:03:23.165
found that older people 
with high levels of social integration

00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:27.395
had a slower rate of memory decline
over a six-year period.

00:03:27.395 --> 00:03:29.648
The exact reason remains unclear,

00:03:29.648 --> 00:03:30.967
but experts suspect that

00:03:30.967 --> 00:03:34.116
social interaction 
gives our brain a mental workout.

00:03:34.116 --> 00:03:35.493
Just like muscle strength,

00:03:35.493 --> 00:03:38.584
we have to use our brain
or risk losing it.

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:39.989
But don't despair.

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.716
There are several steps you can take

00:03:41.716 --> 00:03:44.136
to aid your brain 
in preserving your memories.

00:03:44.136 --> 00:03:46.226
Make sure you keep physically active.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:49.212
Increased blood flow 
to the brain is helpful.

00:03:49.212 --> 00:03:50.788
And eat well.

00:03:50.788 --> 00:03:54.632
Your brain needs all the right nutrients
to keep functioning correctly.

00:03:54.632 --> 00:03:57.014
And finally, give your brain a workout.

00:03:57.014 --> 00:04:00.063
Exposing your brain to challenges,
like learning a new language,

00:04:00.063 --> 00:04:03.856
is one of the best defenses for keeping
your memories intact.
