00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.940
Great. You're listening to radio man,

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.630
the podcast from New York public radio public radio, w.

3
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.431
Y. C. N. N. P. R. Hey,

4
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:19.410
I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich gcs radio lab pod cast. Yes.

5
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.710
Cool. That was exciting. And this particular turn of our wheel,

6
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:26.970
we are going to be taking up a very odd, odd idea, which is,

7
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.210
um, is it possible for a human, a man or a woman? Probably a mature man.

8
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:37.440
A woman. We'd hope to build their own universe. Yeah.

9
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.790
Do you mean like in theory? No, actually this, I'm going to,

10
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.010
this is a serious proposition.

11
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.570
There are people who are now thinking about it seriously at Stanford, in Israel,

12
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:49.404
in Japan,

13
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.910
a theoretical physicist who are trying to figure out how one might go about

14
00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:56.020
this. Go about building a universe,

15
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.880
a whole universe as in like a carpenter, like an a carpenter,

16
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.000
Correale sort of way. Like, here build a table, carpenter oriel sort of way.

17
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.740
So you know where that's not possible, right?

18
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.760
Because the universe is that which we are apart of.

19
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.010
So how can you build something that is that we are already a part of that gang

20
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.620
sense. To begin this conversation, we do have to consider this word universe,

21
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:20.700
which to most of us, as you just said, means everything that is everything.

22
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.310
And therefore by definition it should only be one of them. Yes, of course.

23
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:26.430
But for physicists like Brian Green, our friend Brian Green,

24
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:28.770
who came to my kitchen so we could have this discussion,

25
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.260
two physicists like him,

26
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.320
he's very comfortable with the idea of more than one universe,

27
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:36.780
and that's been the case for physicists for a while. Now,

28
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.100
I don't know the first time,

29
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.850
but the idea that there might be many universes has surprisingly cropped up in a

30
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:48.600
variety of different contexts. In physics, for example,

31
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.600
Brian Seth see expansion of space.

32
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.750
The blossoming of a universe that we have called the big bang was not a single

33
00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:57.540
event,

34
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.380
but it's an event that happens over and over and over again and distant and

35
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.220
far-flung regions of our universe, other universe sprout out,

36
00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:10.221
have their own new big bangs giving rise to a kind of cosmic bubble bath of

37
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:14.220
little bubble universes of which our universe is simply one.

38
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.900
And then this idea of universe is or multi versus a natural word to use to

39
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:22.110
describe the collection of all these bubbles,

40
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.670
each of which if it hasn't happened,

41
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.790
it's like us would think that that is thug universe,

42
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.150
but now you see it's only one of many and this was something that somebody

43
00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:34.170
thought up in 92019301950 well,

44
00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:39.171
the inflationary theory itself was developed in the early 1980s and this

45
00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:44.610
recognition that it could give rise to this many universes was developed by a

46
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:49.590
number of incredibly creative physicists in the mid eighties into the 90s and

47
00:02:49.591 --> 00:02:52.260
it's still studied today, so it's kind of a new idea.

48
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.150
Then this version of it is new.

49
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.230
No explorer has ever ventured into one of these other universities is the best,

50
00:02:58.231 --> 00:03:00.670
you know? Right. This is simply a mental,

51
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.680
this is a conclusion of a mental process,

52
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.610
not of a Columbus or Magellan kind of process. That's true.

53
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.710
We are confined to our bubble and we really can't get out and explore the other

54
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:14.590
bubbles. So from that point of view, it is a mental exercise,

55
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:15.670
but a powerful one.

56
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.700
But you can see how hard it is for somebody who doesn't read the world through

57
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:22.121
mathematics,

58
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:26.890
but just reads it to his senses or her senses that this explanation seems

59
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:31.300
nonsensical since you've no sensual experience of another universe.

60
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.830
The only one you've got is staring at it at equations.

61
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.821
That's true.

62
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:41.200
But I'd say that the history of physics of the last century has taught us to

63
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.850
strenuously challenge

64
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.750
<v 1>our perceptions strenuously challenge. The things that intuitively seem obvious.</v>

65
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.260
We have learned that the Adam is made up of particles that can be both wavelike

66
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.590
or particle like that. In some sense, it can be two places at once.

67
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.170
None of us have experienced any of those things.

68
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.800
None of those things feel right according to our intuition.

69
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.280
But I assure you the experiments that have been done over the last 80 years have

70
00:04:07.281 --> 00:04:11.270
confirmed each of those crazy ideas over and over and over again.

71
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.020
So I don't think it's a good guide to use our senses and our intuition to

72
00:04:18.181 --> 00:04:20.610
determine what we think is right or wrong.

73
00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:23.400
We have really have to follow the laws of physics and see where they take us.

74
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.900
Okay. You with me here, Chad? I am, yes. All right,

75
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.740
so let's say really? Yeah, no, no, no. I'm here. Really?

76
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.380
Where am I going to be? I'm here to here. All right,

77
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.580
so let's say that you can have just in principle anyway, more than one universe.

78
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.600
Okay? Now the question is how do you go about building one? Yeah,

79
00:04:41.601 --> 00:04:43.040
that's what I want to know. You said at the beginning,

80
00:04:43.041 --> 00:04:46.310
we can build them ourselves, right? So this is not, you know,

81
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.330
anything like a act of magic or a godlike thing.

82
00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:53.720
This is just as far as Brian is concerned, this is a practical,

83
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.370
I'll be kind of crazy. A practical engineering problem.

84
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.100
So then how would you engineer one? Right? Let's get to our main subject.

85
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.870
Well that's what I asked Brian. The question.

86
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.770
The proposition here is not only can you have more than one of them,

87
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.120
but that you,

88
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.060
you and ordinary human being and some pals can make make

89
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.893
<v 0>one.</v>

90
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.390
Is it conceivable to you that there could be something called a manmade

91
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.413
universe?

92
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.130
People have studied this and nobody's really been able to say that it's

93
00:05:23.131 --> 00:05:27.330
impossible and some have even suggested hypothetical ways that you might

94
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.890
actually do it. Well, let me,

95
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.080
I mean the first question I'm gonna ask is how one,

96
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.620
are there several ways to do this? One Way to do this? How many,

97
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.200
how many different paths? Well,

98
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.210
I would say at the moment there's no one way that anybody has been convinced is

99
00:05:42.811 --> 00:05:44.910
really compatible with everything that we know.

100
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.040
There are a number of suggested ways,

101
00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:51.720
but they all rely upon more or less the same physics and that physics has to do

102
00:05:51.721 --> 00:05:56.721
with a strange feature of gravity that none of us have ever experienced.

103
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.850
But the math shows us is true and observations of space seem to confirm.

104
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.030
And that is the gravity can actually be not only attractive,

105
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.280
it can only pull things together. It can also be repulsive.

106
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.040
It can push things apart. If that were the case,

107
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:13.610
then wouldn't we all be combusted? Well,

108
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.850
the repulsive side of gravity only rears its head in very special environments

109
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.000
and everyday life. The earth,

110
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.110
the solar system and so forth are realms in which it doesn't rear.

111
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.260
It's repulsive side strongly enough to have any effect.

112
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.760
But we have learned that on the largest of scales, even in our universe,

113
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.990
we believe that gravity is exerting its repulsive side,

114
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.200
which is what's causing distant galaxies to be rushing away from us at an ever

115
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.100
accelerated rate. They're rushing away faster and faster. So the repulsive side,

116
00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:53.600
there's actually direct observational support for what does that have to do with

117
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:56.660
creating a universe. However, because it seems to me that creating a university,

118
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.180
you'd want to somehow manage the thing and repulsive center,

119
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.250
particularly if it's a fierce repulsive force,

120
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:05.120
which seemed to make it be a kind of a unmanageable situation. Well,

121
00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:07.790
if you want a manageable way of building a universe,

122
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.480
what you want to be able to do is build something pretty small.

123
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.500
But it's small things, not a universe. So it has to expand, right?

124
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.770
For something to expand. There's gotta be some outward push,

125
00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:20.630
there's gotta be some repulsive push.

126
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.960
And that's where this repulsive side of gravity comes into the story.

127
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.460
So I want to build something that is a seed of another universe,

128
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.130
but inside my seed there has to be latently.

129
00:07:31.131 --> 00:07:34.940
And then later actively some expensive thing.

130
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.160
Something that just wants to grow. Yes.

131
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.730
Now is there such a device of such as c?

132
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:46.030
There are conditions which according to the laws of general relativity,

133
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.420
the laws that Einstein wrote down a long time ago, well tested.

134
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.900
Those laws tell us that in this context of the right energy density carried by

135
00:07:56.691 --> 00:07:59.540
the right substance, you will have repulsive gravity,

136
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.330
which means if you can build this little seed,

137
00:08:02.331 --> 00:08:06.290
this little nugget in just the right way, it will on its own,

138
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.573
<v 2>roughly speaking,</v>

139
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.630
<v 1>start to expand, grow faster and faster and faster,</v>

140
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.590
beginning tiny and sprouting into a gigantic unit.

141
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:26.230
So I can have you see an expanding universe that is born in my kitchen and I

142
00:08:27.081 --> 00:08:30.620
don't have to worry about my issue. You're having a lot of fun here,

143
00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:34.400
but you've left me behind a bit. What is the seed thing anyways?

144
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.920
<v 3>The exact nature of the seed thing is, it's actually quite complicated,</v>

145
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:44.210
but just to give, it's a shape for you.

146
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.700
The first thing I learned is that in order to start a university,

147
00:08:46.701 --> 00:08:51.000
any university, even our own universe, the seed has to be very, very sure.

148
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:56.420
<v 0>You can calculate that the nugget that we perhaps gave rise to our universe,</v>

149
00:08:56.761 --> 00:09:00.210
maybe someone created it in their apartment, in some other universe,

150
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.480
was about roughly 10 to the minus 26 centimeters across 10 to the minus 26

151
00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:11.460
enemy. That's small. That's really, really, really small. Yeah. Yeah.

152
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:14.070
And it wouldn't happen. It could grow into a, you know, there was,

153
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:16.920
there's enough, um, push inside it,

154
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.210
repulsive force or push out to then they could grow into a thing like we would

155
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.510
associate with universe, universe scales, our universe,

156
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:26.570
according to this theory. Again, you know,

157
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.760
I'm being facetious that it was created in somebody else's apartment,

158
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:33.840
but who knows. But the seed of our universe,

159
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.440
we believe from our calculations and our observations was roughly 10 to the

160
00:09:37.441 --> 00:09:42.300
minus 26 10 to minus 27 centimeters across wade. You know, a few pounds,

161
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:43.380
about 10 pounds.

162
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.460
You wouldn't really think intuitively that you could build a whole universe from

163
00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:52.320
10 pounds of stuff. I think you would think that to build a whole universe,

164
00:09:52.321 --> 00:09:54.390
I'm talking about a universe of stars and galaxies,

165
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.390
hundreds of billions of stars in hundreds of billions of galaxies.

166
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.030
You think you need more than 10 pounds of this stuff?

167
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.930
But it turns out that that's all you need because the repulsive side of gravity

168
00:10:03.931 --> 00:10:08.931
is so powerful that it actually injects energy from gravity itself into the

169
00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:12.900
expanding space. So from that point of view,

170
00:10:12.901 --> 00:10:16.050
all you need is the seed and then gravity takes over and does the rest of the

171
00:10:16.051 --> 00:10:16.884
work.

172
00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:19.810
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

173
00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.300
<v 0>okay. Jet So that we now know the seat has to be smaller.</v>

174
00:10:22.301 --> 00:10:27.010
The second thing that Brian told me is the seed should come in the form of what

175
00:10:27.011 --> 00:10:31.120
he described as a, as a black hole. The seed as a black hole.

176
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.780
[inaudible] wait a second.

177
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:39.610
You said that it has to be small, but black holes are huge,

178
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:44.350
but it turns out that black holes can be, they don't have to be big. No,

179
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.430
not at all. Relative. What can you get? I mean, I thought that the,

180
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.110
we we use or we can get the black holes cause the star collapses.

181
00:10:50.111 --> 00:10:55.111
So it's a fairly gigantic beginning and therefore it's a fairly gigantic thing.

182
00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.080
Could you get a black hole the size of a wine cup or a a thimble or less?

183
00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:04.330
Oh yeah, absolutely.

184
00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:09.160
You give me any object and if I squeeze it sufficiently small,

185
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.520
then according to the classical laws or general relativity,

186
00:11:12.521 --> 00:11:16.210
if you make it small enough, it will be a tiny black hole.

187
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.660
Now wait a grape. Can you make, can you make a grape into a black hole?

188
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.500
Absolutely. Can you make a raspberry and tobacco?

189
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.650
Can you make a blueberry into black hole? Seriously,

190
00:11:26.651 --> 00:11:30.070
there's nothing that you could give me that I couldn't turn into a black hole by

191
00:11:30.071 --> 00:11:31.570
squeezing it sufficiently small.

192
00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:36.550
Would there be any example of a naturally occurring small black hole? Sure.

193
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:41.200
There are processes where particles can slam into each other at a very high

194
00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:44.980
energies, and the calculations show that if they slammed together,

195
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.520
it's sufficiently high energies in the right geometrical configuration,

196
00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:53.200
they can create a tiny black hole. And this is not just hypothetical,

197
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.310
a new machine to Geneva, Switzerland right now called the large Hadron collider.

198
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:02.620
And one of the things that may happen at the large Hadron collider is the

199
00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:06.580
creation of microscopic black holes in the collision between protons and

200
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:11.110
protons. These will be tiny black holes, but black holes nonetheless.

201
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:16.680
<v 5>Wow. It is getting kind of interesting. So okay, you've got a black hole. Yeah.</v>

202
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:17.860
A tiny one. And you've,

203
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:22.350
which we've somehow have to impregnate with this anti gravity force. Yeah.

204
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.260
Uh, what other ingredients do we need? Now we need a trigger,

205
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.770
something to trigger in the expense of force on. So it'll go,

206
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.590
what's the trigger? Well, the trigger is a very, very complex.

207
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.161
Frankly,

208
00:12:36.161 --> 00:12:39.190
I only kind of 80% got the trigger and I don't want to bore you with it,

209
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:39.911
but it is,

210
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:42.550
it's something about a compass with only one needle or something like that.

211
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.800
But anyway, once you, once your benefit don't ask,

212
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.390
but once you've got the trigger,

213
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:49.750
which you add to the a little black hole and now you've got the expensive force

214
00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:54.940
line that you pull the trigger and you will get a universe of your own right

215
00:12:55.301 --> 00:12:57.700
there in your kitchen. But doesn't that worry you? I mean,

216
00:12:57.701 --> 00:12:59.620
wouldn't that blow up everything?

217
00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:04.770
<v 0>It just seems that if you create one, you would be, um, you would be in danger.</v>

218
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.920
People have studied that issue in great detail and found that at least according

219
00:13:10.201 --> 00:13:14.460
to the proposals that are on the table for how in principle you might create a

220
00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:18.420
universe that wouldn't be a worry that wouldn't happen. Instead,

221
00:13:18.421 --> 00:13:23.220
this universe that you create would in essence create its own space.

222
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:27.570
It wouldn't encroach on your space by expanding into your domain,

223
00:13:27.571 --> 00:13:31.110
into your house, into your region. Instead,

224
00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.510
it would expand like our universe does.

225
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:38.370
But it would expand by creating new space space that hadn't existed before.

226
00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.390
So it would be off on its own if you will, creating a new bubble,

227
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.390
a new bubble universe that would be a universe in its own right.

228
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:46.040
So what do we see

229
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.020
<v 5>from our side? What would we see? Probably,</v>

230
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.020
I'm not sure cause Brian is with me during this particular conversation,

231
00:13:51.021 --> 00:13:54.170
but I think Brian would say what you always see is our little black hole on our

232
00:13:54.171 --> 00:13:56.600
side and something, something we, you know,

233
00:13:56.601 --> 00:13:58.420
going on very large on the other side,

234
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.660
it's staying little on our side but getting bigger on the other side and can we

235
00:14:02.661 --> 00:14:04.670
jump through it? Well that's the interesting,

236
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:05.130
<v 0>you know,</v>

237
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.450
you need to jump in to be able to see what's going on on the other side.

238
00:14:08.451 --> 00:14:12.590
So if you were, if you could make one of these, you might be able to inspect it.

239
00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:19.040
You'd be at a certain cost, you couldn't, you couldn't come back,

240
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:23.710
you couldn't pass through. Um, but you're,

241
00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.880
what you're creating on the other side is there.

242
00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:29.680
And in principle you could go there. So

243
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:35.490
<v 1>if you could make your own universe, um, you would never,</v>

244
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:35.971
ever,

245
00:14:35.971 --> 00:14:40.800
ever be able to come back to visit anyone or anything you ever have known.

246
00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:45.900
Could you ever imagine having made a creation on this scale?

247
00:14:45.901 --> 00:14:50.070
Could you ever imagine visiting it forever and never going back home?

248
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.940
Never. Well, no radio, no, no radio on us.

249
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.470
You know how many people would be sad?

250
00:14:57.471 --> 00:15:02.150
Someone is just a small little sliver of humanity. They'd get over it.

251
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:05.590
If you could actually do this beyond theory, I'm going to have to say,

252
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.130
I think I might have a little trouble resisting this possibility just because

253
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.500
it's so curious.

254
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:17.930
This idea that through your volitional act,

255
00:15:17.931 --> 00:15:19.040
in your kitchen sink,

256
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:24.490
you are creating a universe that would give rise petard perhaps to things like

257
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.590
we see in the world around us. Really,

258
00:15:27.591 --> 00:15:32.591
you can think of our universe potentially as being the outcome of the

259
00:15:32.721 --> 00:15:36.620
hypothetical processes that we're talking about, our universe,

260
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.630
speaking of which we should say,

261
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.960
our universe or our corner of it is funded by the Sloan Foundation of the

262
00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:49.820
corporation for public broadcasting and the National Science Foundation. Also,

263
00:15:49.821 --> 00:15:53.330
thank you to Brian Green, who is professor of, let's see,

264
00:15:53.331 --> 00:15:58.280
physics and mathematics at Columbia University in New York is also the author of

265
00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.730
the elegant universe and the fabric of the cosmos.

266
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.210
One day he may create himself a little bit of cosmos.

267
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.780
Is this probably plausible to you? It's very tough to say.

268
00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.770
I do consider this speculation on speculation,

269
00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.250
so I think I would stress that the reason for thinking about this is not so much

270
00:16:16.251 --> 00:16:20.570
to do it, but it's more to push the laws of physics to their breaking point,

271
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.530
because that's often where we learn new things about how the world works.

272
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.920
Until next time, yes, two weeks, we'll see you then. Bye.

273
00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:32.070
[inaudible].
