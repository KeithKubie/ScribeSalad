00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:02.130
What I want to do in
this video is give you

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.470
a bunch of properties of limits.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.470
And we're not going to
prove it rigorously here.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.420
In order to have the rigorous
proof of these properties,

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.462
we need a rigorous definition
of what a limit is.

00:00:09.462 --> 00:00:11.211
And we're not doing
that in this tutorial,

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.390
we'll do that in the
tutorial on the epsilon delta

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.680
definition of limits.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.180
But most of these should
be fairly intuitive.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.840
And they are very helpful for
simplifying limit problems

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.040
in the future.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.290
So let's say we know that
the limit of some function

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.910
f of x, as x approaches
c, is equal to capital L.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.330
And let's say that we
also know that the limit

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.580
of some other function, let's
say g of x, as x approaches c,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.270
is equal to capital M.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.170
Now given that, what
would be the limit of f

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.820
of x plus g of x
as x approaches c?

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.640
Well-- and you could
look at this visually,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.820
if you look at the graphs
of two arbitrary functions,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.560
you would essentially just
add those two functions--

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.935
it'll be pretty clear that
this is going to be equal to--

00:00:57.935 --> 00:00:59.893
and once again, I'm not
doing a rigorous proof,

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.960
I'm just really giving
you the properties here--

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.760
this is going to be the limit
of f of x as x approaches c,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.630
plus the limit of g of
x as x approaches c.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.670
Which is equal to, well
this right over here

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.880
is-- let me do that
in that same color--

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.620
this right here is
just equal to L.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.190
It's going to be equal to L
plus M. This right over here

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.530
is equal to M.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.890
Not too difficult.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.730
This is often called the sum
rule, or the sum property,

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.167
of limits.

00:01:35.167 --> 00:01:37.750
And we could come up with a very
similar one with differences.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.220
The limit as x approaches
c of f of x minus g of x,

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.550
is just going to be
L minus M. It's just

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.330
the limit of f of
x as x approaches

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.470
c, minus the limit of g
of x as x approaches c.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.594
So it's just going
to be L minus M.

00:01:58.594 --> 00:02:00.260
And we also often
call it the difference

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.720
rule, or the difference
property, of limits.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.550
And these once again, are very,
very, hopefully, reasonably

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.364
intuitive.

00:02:06.364 --> 00:02:08.780
Now what happens if you take
the product of the functions?

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:16.990
The limit of f of x times
g of x as x approaches c.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.820
Well lucky for us,
this is going to be

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.740
equal to the limit of
f of x as x approaches

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.410
c, times the limit of g
of x, as x approaches c.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.110
Lucky for us, this is kind of
a fairly intuitive property

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.022
of limits.

00:02:32.022 --> 00:02:33.480
So in this case,
this is just going

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:41.030
to be equal to, this is
L times M. This is just

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.040
going to be L times
M. Same thing,

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.930
if instead of having a function
here, we had a constant.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.205
So if we just had
the limit-- let

00:02:50.205 --> 00:02:56.110
me do it in that same
color-- the limit of k times

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.310
f of x, as x approaches c,
where k is just some constant.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.520
This is going to be the same
thing as k times the limit

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.820
of f of x as x approaches c.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.960
And that is just equal
to L. So this whole thing

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.070
simplifies to k times L.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.380
And we can do the same
thing with difference.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.520
This is often called the
constant multiple property.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.210
We can do the same
thing with differences.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.100
So if we have the
limit as x approaches

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.200
c of f of x divided by g of x.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.900
This is the exact same
thing as the limit

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.480
of f of x as x
approaches c, divided

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.510
by the limit of g of
x as x approaches c.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.300
Which is going to be equal
to-- I think you get it now--

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:56.750
this is going to be
equal to L over M.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.770
And finally-- this is sometimes
called the quotient property--

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.982
finally we'll look at
the exponent property.

00:04:01.982 --> 00:04:07.090
So if I have the
limit of-- let me

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.284
write it this way-- of
f of x to some power.

00:04:09.284 --> 00:04:10.700
And actually, let
me even write it

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.880
as a fractional
power, to the r over s

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.810
power, where both r and s are
integers, then the limit of f

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.580
of x to the r over s
power as x approaches c,

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.650
is going to be the exact
same thing as the limit of f

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.670
of x as x approaches c
raised to the r over s power.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.620
Once again, when r and s
are both integers, and s

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.670
is not equal to 0.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.350
Otherwise this exponent
would not make much sense.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.905
And this is the same thing
as L to the r over s power.

00:04:46.905 --> 00:04:54.850
So this is equal to L
to the r over s power.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.479
So using these, we
can actually find

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.020
the limit of many,
many, many things.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.060
And what's neat about it is
the property of limits kind of

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.360
are the things that you
would naturally want to do.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.068
And if you graph some
of these functions,

00:05:05.068 --> 00:05:07.450
it actually turns out
to be quite intuitive.
