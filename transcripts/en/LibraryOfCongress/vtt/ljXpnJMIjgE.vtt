&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Welcome to
the Library of Congress

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.310
and the Young Readers Center.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.970
Has anyone been here before?

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.140
Great. Look at that.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.910
We thank you for coming and
we hope you will come back

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.270
to this very special afternoon

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.470
with the European Union
Kids Euro Festival.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.120
The European Union is made

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.150
up of countries very far
away across the big ocean.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.540
There are 28 countries that have
come together to bring artists

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:09.450
and entertainers to come to
America and introduce children

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.530
from the D.C. area about their
country and what they do.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.930
But we have a very special guest
today because we have an ambassador

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.580
from Slovenia which is a country
about the size of New Jersey.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.770
And ask your teachers
to get more information.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.490
And the country, if you
could look at the map --

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.020
The brown part up there that says
Slovenia, it looks like a chicken.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.610
Can you see that?

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.360 position:56%
You can. So you can tell your family
when you go home that you learned

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:59.430
about a country very far away
that looks like a chicken.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.440
Ambassador [inaudible] has
written a book for children called

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.260
"Little Mountain Fish Goes to Sea."

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.470
And he's written it and he has
it with him today and he's going

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.620
to read it to you and tell you
a little bit about himself.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.440
Ambassador, thank you.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:30.650
&gt;&gt; Bozo Cerar: Good
afternoon from myself as well.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.340
Believe me, usually I read books
just for either my children

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.420
or my grandchildren, but
it has never happened

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.690
to read my stories
to such a huge crowd.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.660
So I'm really pleased.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.200
I'm really delighted.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.620
First I will sit down like you.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.200
Take the book.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.770
And the book was written
for -- to my grandchildren,

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.700
Eric and Max [assumed spelling].

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.790
Both are your age.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.130
I wrote it in my language, Slovenia
language, and the gentleman sitting

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.640
over there with that
white beard, you see him,

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.620
he translated it in to English.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:26.550
So I will read it to you in English
so that you're able to understand.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.030
What -- Are we ready?

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.200
Shall we start?

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.880
Okay. Let's do it.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.070
Let's start it.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.010
The name of the story is "Little
-- " The title of the story is,

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.750
"Little Mountain Fish Goes to Sea."

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.810
You know what the fish is.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.330
Yeah. And you know what the sea is.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.360
I hope. If not, I [inaudible].

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:02.270 position:56%
So once upon a time there was a
little fish which lived with his mom

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.730
and dad in a crystal
clear pool in a creek high

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.900
up a mountain [inaudible].

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:17.120 position:56%
Yes. The pool was surrounded by
majestic fruit trees and [inaudible]

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.890
and amid the roots of one of
the fruit trees the little fish

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.260
and his parents had a cozy home.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.700
You see that home up there?

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.480
The little fish was very curious.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.340
He constantly kept asking his mom
and dad about one thing or another.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.940
And one day he began
asking what the world was

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.460
like beyond the nine pools,
beyond the nine creeks.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.010
His parents didn't quite
know what to tell him

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.610
for they had spent all their
lives in their home creek

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.120 position:56%
and they had been quite happy there.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.050
However, the little fish had
heard from a very old fish

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.260
that beyond the nine pools and
beyond the nine creeks lay sea.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.390 position:56%
And the sea was a really large pool.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:13.200
So large that one could not see
across from one shore to the other.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:19.130
And so deep that one could
not see to its bottom.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.510
How is this possible?

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.920
The little fish was wandering.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.200
Even in spring when snow was
[inaudible] the mountains

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.530
or during summer rainstorms
when water in the creek rose

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.680
and grew a little cloudy,
both shores of his [inaudible]

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.090
and his bottom could fill the sea.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.280
"I must go and see this
marvel," decided the little fish.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.180
"I could do that best
during my vacation."

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.250
His mom and dad tried
to talk him out of it,

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.620
but nothing has changed his mind.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.750
The little fish wanted to be
well prepared for his journey.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:07.950
But the very old fish -- The
very old fish didn't know much

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.620
about the sea or the way to it.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.920 position:56%
He had been in the river and even in
a lake, but never as far as the sea.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.440
Anyway, he did not like to
talk about what had happened

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.240
to him during his journey.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.100
Obviously it wasn't pleasant.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.440
But the very old fish heard another
old fish tell to the [inaudible]

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.700
that many years ago in a nearby
creek he met someone who had swum

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.810
from the sea to these
waters under the mountains.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.020 position:56%
He had clearly been just as
curious as the little mountain fish,

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.350
but since he lived in the
sea it was the mountains

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.210
that he was curious about.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:57.280
The little fish got himself a
red traveling bag like this.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:05.490
You see? And put it with some
food and a few useful things

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.510
that a fish might need
most on a journey.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:15.200
He didn't forget to take along
a dictionary of fish languages

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.710
with this, a dictionary
of fish languages.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:28.870
You see? Then the dictionary
of course of fish languages.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:35.780
And a chart, a water map for fish.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.470
And of course a camera.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.560
Where is camera?

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.420
A camera is [inaudible]
camera with a [inaudible].

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:49.560
And because the old fish told
him that at sea the sun is very,

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:58.180
very hot, and glares terribly, so
he borrowed his aunt's straw hat.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:06.090
See? And sunglasses.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:07.810
Sunglasses.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:18.460
These are ordinary glasses,
and these are sunglasses.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:26.280
You see? So the fish was
well equipped for a journey.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:34.290
[Inaudible] has used the hat,
them and the glasses once or twice

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:38.040
in the middle of summer
[inaudible] between two pools,

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.790
although there really was no
need for them in that place.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:46.220
Early next morning he went.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.960
Then he swam away.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.880 position:56%
He really did not even have to swim.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.650
It was enough to just lean
on the red traveling bag

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:02.200
and the creek itself carried
them both downstream toward the

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.340
unknown world.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:10.510
See? Just like this.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:15.140
[ Laughter ]

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:24.360
Now on the banks of the creek
trees were passing by one

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.520
after another like in a movie.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.690
And now and then he saw a
house or a solitary water mill.

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:36.930
He also noticed there were
cows and sheep grazing

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:43.270
and children playing
on the green meadow.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.570
[Inaudible] yeah?

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:54.080
He waved to them with his tail,
this, and the children waved back.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.520
So wave the fish back.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.740
Good. Thank you.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.800
Hardly believing what
they were seeing.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.920
A fish on a red traveling bag?

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.270
You just don't see
such a thing every day.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:13.880
All parents will again think
that we have made this all up.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.140
The creek was joined
by other creeks.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.310
There he ran in to a
group of [inaudible]

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.690
and small fish on their
way to a lake.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:28.280 position:56%
They just could not believe that the
little fish was headed so far away

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:34.970
to the sea and all along there
instead of narrow footbridges

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:38.540
across the creek there
are [inaudible] small

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.760
and then large road bridges.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.080
Suddenly he found himself
in a river.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.630
On this bank there were
even more fields filled

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.860
by hard working farmers.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.190
There are more and more houses.

00:10:54.190 --> 00:11:00.130
And they were bigger and taller.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:04.080
And this was so different from
the neighborhood of his home pool

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:09.660
and everything so interesting out
of curiosity he stretched his neck

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:18.260 position:56%
up out of the water and joyfully
wiggled his tail like a [inaudible].

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:25.260
With his camera he took
many beautiful pictures.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.010
Many beautiful pictures.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:32.930
But he was a little bit concerned
because the mountains he was used

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:37.740
to seeing up close were
getting smaller and smaller

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.290
and ever more lost in the haze.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:43.450
Yet he did not lose his enthusiasm.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:47.060
Traveling with his red traveling
bag was not only interesting,

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.990
but also pleasant.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:51.850
He did not need to
swim even one fin.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:57.520
The current carried him
downstream all by itself.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.050
About the river flittered
countless little flies

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:07.840
and the little fish did not only --
needed only to open his mouth wide,

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:15.690
like this, and there was
a tasty lunch or dinner.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:22.670
There was no need at all to
fear that he would lose his way.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:26.070
Always all streams
led down to the sea.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:31.210
But when the little fish woke
up next morning [inaudible]

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:39.840
but in the morning woke up.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.910
Let's see what has happened.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:50.060
His heart sank.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.960
He was in altogether
new surroundings.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.660
The water hardly moved.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:03.100
He had to fully sway his
fins [inaudible] to keep

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:08.750
on moving with his traveling bag.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.990
He could barely see
the banks of the river.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:16.880
What trees grew, he did not know.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:23.000
The water was murky and deep
and it also tasted different.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.880
It was becoming ever more salty.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.420
The fishes he met there looked
somehow -- somewhat different.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:35.010
And were very difficult
to understand.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:41.620
He was lucky to have brought along
the fish language dictionary.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:45.360 position:56%
So he just looked at the dictionary.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.650
He was lucky to have
this book with him.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.890
The river was slowly
flowing to the sea.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:57.200
The old fish had been right.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.850
All around, nothing but water.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:05.550
And very deep, at that.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.110
Also pretty warm.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.410
Not too clean.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:13.380
And, above all, salty
to make one sick.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:20.180
Oh. Luckily his traveling bag
was somehow light in sea water.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.870
The water was filled with fish.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.790
Wait. Fish.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.580
Big ones. Small ones.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.970
Tiny ones.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.270
Blue and red ones.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.440
Even yellow ones.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.740
Some pretty.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.490
Some ugly.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.300
Some very friendly, but
others you would just

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.560
as soon stay far away from.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:47.260
Above all, the greatest sharks.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.990
Yeah. Sharks.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:53.450
And the sea was packed
with other creatures.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:15:01.680
Other creatures like
stinging jellyfish,

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.670
colorful shellfish,
to playful dolphins.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:12.840 position:56%
In such crowds you have to be really
careful not to bump against someone.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:17.780
But he busily kept taking
pictures with camera.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:28.010
Yes. The surface of the
sea too was very crowded,

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:32.320
full of row boats,
sailboats, and ships.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.360
These were large, larger
than whales,

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.420
larger than the largest fish.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.170
They had been built by
human for various purposes.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.410
They were carrying
all sorts of things,

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:51.040
and mostly they were very
friendly, but as he found later,

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.760
some of the ships were
also dangerous,

00:15:54.760 --> 00:16:01.500
particularly the fishing boats as
those were made for catching fish.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.720
[Inaudible] the shore
people too were swimming.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:08.780
People never waded in to
their pool in the mountains

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.990
because the water was too cold.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:17.800
When the wind began to blow large
waves rose from the sea such as

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:23.440
like many other things
[inaudible] the waves roared

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:31.270
and tossed the little fish every
which way and he felt very sick.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:35.430
He had to watch out not to
be dashed against the rocks.

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:40.400
He held tightly to his
traveling bag, you know,

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:48.030
tightly to the bag
so not to lose it.

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:51.400
That would be a disaster.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:58.500
All the pictures he was [inaudible]
but when the wind quieted down

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.430
and the sea became calm
the little fish wanted

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:06.000 position:56%
to enjoy a little rest and sunshine.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.170
After all, he was on vacation.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:18.530
He put on his glasses.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:20.720
Where are glasses?

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.220
Inside? You think so?

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.410
Yes. Yes. Yes.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:31.090
Oh good. He put on
his glasses like this.

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:34.090
What else?

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:35.390
Let's see.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:40.000
Donned his straw hat.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.510
Yes. Like this.

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:55.960
And stretched out on his red
traveling bag which was now --

00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:03.530
which now swayed lazily under
the hot sun on the blue sea.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:08.240
This was a scene for a picture
postcard with a message,

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.540
"Greetings from a fish of the sea."

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:22.430
The sway and the hot sun
soon lulled him to sleep.

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:27.370
But he did not snooze for long.

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:30.080
He was awakened by the
screeching of seagulls.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:40.730
Seagulls. What did they do to him?

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:47.480
The red traveling bag could
be seen from far away,

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.640
red colors seen from far away.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:55.750
And when the seagulls saw
the little fish sunning

00:18:55.750 --> 00:19:00.400
on it they just could
not believe it.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:06.760
At first they argued
whether they saw it right.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.340
Then they could not
quite agree which one

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:16.830
of them would get the traveling
bag and which one the little fish.

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:22.740
Just long enough for the
little fish to quickly plunge

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:32.050
in to the sea [inaudible] straw hat
set to sea was left to seagulls.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:33.640
This is crazy.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:39.510
Who can know his way around
this world in these waters?

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:44.440
Where you are not safe
either on the water or under?

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.450
The little fish was very scared.

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:49.900 position:56%
But then a friendly crab invited him

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.710
and his traveling bag
in to his home.

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:56.960
That is under this rock.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.470 position:56%
Under this rock there was this home.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:05.250
The crab also taught him about
all the other bad sides of life

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:10.290
in the sea, but also
about the good sides.

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:14.580
The little fish just realized that
the sea's not only interesting

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:20.610
and beautiful, but sometimes also
unfriendly and even dangerous.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:26.350
In the end he decided that
the sea was not for him.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:31.200
Maybe for a day or two since a
fish can see many interesting

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:38.200
and useful things, but he
would not want to live there.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.820
Too hot. Too salty.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.120
Too noisy.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.420
Too crowded.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:46.640
And for a little fish
definitely too dangerous.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.700
He began to miss his folks,
his home pool, the clear,

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:55.660 position:56%
cool mountain waters, the
reflection of the mountains in them,

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.480
the roots of his home's
[inaudible] trees.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:03.660
He made up his mind to turn home.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:07.110
He put some seashells
and other souvenirs

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:10.680
in his bag so that it was full.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:16.740 position:56%
He also took a picture with a
friendly crab in front of this rock.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:20.820
He bid goodbye to his kind
host and under the power

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:26.340
of night swam toward the mouth of
the river and toward his mountains.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:32.550
By sun up he was already in the
river flowing from his mountains.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.580
His travel was hardly easy.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:41.240
He got very tired pushing
his traveling bag,

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.580
especially in the opposite
stretch of the river.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.240
But the nearness of
the high mountains

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:52.780
and of the green forests
was giving him new strength.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:56.590
He was glad to see all the
[inaudible] bridges, the cows

00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:00.490
and sheep, and children
that [inaudible].

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:04.940
This time too they
waved to each other.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:08.290
So wave. Wave to the fish.

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:12.250
Yeah. A few more swishes
with his fins

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:15.050
and he would be back
in his home creek.

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:19.970 position:56%
He would be telling his relatives
and friends about his sea adventures

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:22.500
and show them the pictures.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:27.020
Now he understood much better
why his mom and dad loved

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:32.740
so much their little home amid
the roots of a mighty fir tree.

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:36.410
How right was the very
old fish, he thought?

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:47.190
It is beautiful everywhere, but it
is most beautiful in the home pool.

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:50.090
And [inaudible] the end.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:52.160
Thank you.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.920
Thank you.

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:06.310
Maybe you have any questions?

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:07.750
Yes? What's your name?

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:09.050
Yes. Go ahead.

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:19.750
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Why did the little
fish want to go out to the sea?

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:22.850
&gt;&gt; Bozo Cerar: Because
he was very curious

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:25.540
and the children usually
are very curious.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:30.010
He wanted to see not just
his own, let's say, creek,

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:33.070
his own immediate surroundings.

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:37.740
He wanted to see what is on
the other side of the mountain

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.540
in the deep waters in the sea.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:40.840
So that's why he decided to go.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.140
Here?

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Why does
his head look so much

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.360
like a [inaudible] in that picture?

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:49.950
&gt;&gt; Bozo Cerar: Sorry.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:51.250
I didn't get.

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:57.920
Why is -- Could you help me because
I really -- What was the question?

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.170
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Why does his head --

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:01.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Oh.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:02.770
Why is his head big?

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:05.610
He said why his head is big?

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:06.910
&gt;&gt; Bozo Cerar: Enough.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:12.650
For a small head fish,
everything is big.

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:16.820
Bag. Even sunglasses.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.740
Hat. Everything is big because
they're the small fish like you.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.880
Yes? Hello there.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.180
Yes.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.380
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Why the
snow is melting?

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.450
&gt;&gt; Bozo Cerar: Oh yes.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:32.290
Very good question.

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:36.490
You know, snow falls in winter.

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:37.920
That is very cold.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:42.670
But in spring and summer when the
temperature's high, as you know,

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:48.330
the snow, the ice, melts
away because it is warm.

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:50.090
It is hot.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:51.890
Clarice [assumed spelling]?

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:57.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Why does
it get a tail?

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.260
&gt;&gt; Bozo Cerar: the fish?

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:03.630
Well, we have hands, legs.

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:07.210
Fish have fins and tails.

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:09.960
Yeah. Like any other animal.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.010 position:56%
Animals usually do have [inaudible].

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.090
Thomas [assumed spelling] yes.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:17.290
Thomas, ask.

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.610
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: You should
let him first.

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:21.910
&gt;&gt; Bozo Cerar: Who?

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:24.510
Go.

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:31.050
[ Inaudible ]

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:33.650
Fish is kind of what?

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:37.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Why is
the fish [inaudible]?

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.080
&gt;&gt; Bozo Cerar: Like a pig?

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.140
Do I understand you correctly?

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.460
Like a pig?

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:48.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Why is
the fish that color?

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:50.460
&gt;&gt; Bozo Cerar: Well, look.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:55.190
The others who painted it thought
that it should be that way,

00:25:55.190 --> 00:26:00.270
but you can, as we have
heard in your story,

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:04.710
fish can be blue, red, yellow.

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:06.020
So this one is --

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 11: They
can be any color.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.060
&gt;&gt; Bozo Cerar: Exactly.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.360
Grey. Yes.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.660
Of course.

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.520
I saw a lot of them grey.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.370
Blue? Red?

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:19.200
Red as well.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.010
Which? Green?

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:26.780 position:56%
Green were some of them, but usually
the grass is green and the trees.

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:28.710
White. White.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:32.600
The stones and sand are white.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:37.610
Yes. Go ahead.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:49.490
Go ahead. Ask a question.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:53.800
Will somebody help him?

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.230
Okay. Who else?

00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:59.520
You. Go ahead.

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.820
Go ahead.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:08.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 12: Why did the
fish [inaudible] the other side

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:13.310
of the mountains?

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:16.890
&gt;&gt; Bozo Cerar: Because
he was curious.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:22.060
He wanted to know more
than parents told him.

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.080
He wanted to learn, like you.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:29.290
He wanted to learn
as much as possible,

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:32.420
to be a clever fish,
really clever fish.

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.820
Clever what?

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:39.080
Yeah. Likewise.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:43.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 12: But
why was he curious?

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:46.020
&gt;&gt; Bozo Cerar: Well, I'm not sure

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:50.370
that I will really have
to answer that question.

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:51.670
What do you think?

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:52.970
Why the fish was curious?

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:57.520
Help me. Why the fish was curious?

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:02.430
&gt;&gt; Speaker 13: The fish was
curious because at the other side

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:11.050
of the ocean there were other
things and the fish can't see all

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:14.070
of them just in that little lake.

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.440
&gt;&gt; Bozo Cerar: Exactly.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.190
Bravo. Bravo.

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:21.410
You have to go to see places you
would like to know what is there.

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:22.710
Yes.

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:24.010
&gt;&gt; Speaker 14: Why
the river was blue?

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:25.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 15: Because
all rivers are blue.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:33.170
&gt;&gt; Bozo Cerar: Some of them
-- majority of them are blue,

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:37.440
but some of them unfortunately
are polluted and are grey,

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:42.410
but usually if the water
is clear they are blue.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:44.710
Black water?

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.900
[ Inaudible ]

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:53.110
Yes. You're right,
because the Earth was black

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:55.730
and the Earth colored the water.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:58.850
That [inaudible] all that as well.

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:02.230
Green? Why does [inaudible]
usually the grass is green

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:08.510
or the trees are green, but maybe
some waters are green as well.

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:11.530
Exactly. Yes.

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:19.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 16: Why does the
mountains look like it's cold

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:24.530
and then the other part
looks like it's warm?

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:25.830
&gt;&gt; Bozo Cerar: Well, you're right.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:30.600
The mountains look cold because
they are quite high covered

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.020
by ice and snow.

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:37.930
Yeah. And sometimes in summer
that ice and snow melts

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:45.260
and then the river, the creek,
become much, much larger.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:50.310
And the water sometimes, as I said
in the story, is not that clear.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:56.230
Who is going to ask
the last question?

00:29:56.230 --> 00:30:02.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 17: Who wants
to raise their hand?

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:10.490
[ Inaudible ]

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:11.790
&gt;&gt; Bozo Cerar: Okay.

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:17.300
&gt;&gt; Speaker 18: Why
did the [inaudible]?

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:23.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Speaker 17: What did you ask him?

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:25.090
&gt;&gt; Bozo Cerar: Oh.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:32.390
Well, the fish is -- The
fish swims like that.

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:35.580
Fishes don't have, let's
say, hands and legs.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.870
They have fins and tails
and fish are that way.

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:40.550
That way. Or with [inaudible].

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:47.230
That's the way of swimming.

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.940
That's their way of swimming.

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:51.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 17: Okay.

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.510
Let's give a hand for --

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:56.100

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.110
