economic development I just like to ask

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
economic development I just like to ask
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.500
economic development I just like to ask
all of you how in practical terms do you

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510
all of you how in practical terms do you
 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.110
all of you how in practical terms do you
convince people in the developing world

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120
convince people in the developing world
 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.880
convince people in the developing world
that these two great goals of poverty

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890
that these two great goals of poverty
 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.200

reduction and unclimbed change are not
 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.149
reduction and unclimbed change are not
in conflict I mean how do you convince

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
in conflict I mean how do you convince
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.600
in conflict I mean how do you convince
people the climate change will not be a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610

of the biggest problems we have in the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340
of the biggest problems we have in the
 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.770
of the biggest problems we have in the
world is people don't realize that

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
world is people don't realize that
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.810
world is people don't realize that
technology is the way we solve these

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
technology is the way we solve these
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.390
technology is the way we solve these
problems so I was giving a talk recently

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400
problems so I was giving a talk recently
 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.870
problems so I was giving a talk recently
and we have this great economist who

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880
and we have this great economist who
 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.630
and we have this great economist who
helped start Hal Varian um and he and I

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640
helped start Hal Varian um and he and I
 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.190
helped start Hal Varian um and he and I
was saying well he's saying basically

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200
was saying well he's saying basically
 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.230
was saying well he's saying basically
all the group growth in GDP per capita

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240
all the group growth in GDP per capita
 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.690
all the group growth in GDP per capita
has been to technology and you can graph

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700
has been to technology and you can graph
 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.819
has been to technology and you can graph
it it's like an exponential you know

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829
it it's like an exponential you know
 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.010
it it's like an exponential you know
starts with basically farm improvements

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020
starts with basically farm improvements
 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.289
starts with basically farm improvements
and mechanization and mass manufacturing

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299
and mechanization and mass manufacturing
 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.679
and mechanization and mass manufacturing
and so on and the way we're going to get

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689
and so on and the way we're going to get
 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.270
and so on and the way we're going to get
out of problems like that is by having

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280
out of problems like that is by having
 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.880
out of problems like that is by having
better technology and if you look at you

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890
better technology and if you look at you
 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.709
better technology and if you look at you
know the US has something like you have

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719
know the US has something like you have
 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.350
know the US has something like you have
10,000 people of the equivalent of

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360
10,000 people of the equivalent of
 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.810
10,000 people of the equivalent of
10,000 people helping you every day with

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
10,000 people helping you every day with
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.639
10,000 people helping you every day with
the energy use they're pushing your car

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649
the energy use they're pushing your car
 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.880
the energy use they're pushing your car
they're carrying your water to you if

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890
they're carrying your water to you if
 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.080
they're carrying your water to you if
you work out the number of calories

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090
you work out the number of calories
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.610
you work out the number of calories
you'd have to use as a person

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620
you'd have to use as a person
 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.960
you'd have to use as a person
to do all the things that you do

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970
to do all the things that you do
 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.110
to do all the things that you do
something like 10,000 people in Africa

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120
something like 10,000 people in Africa
 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.690
something like 10,000 people in Africa
you know that numbers like 1 or 2 or not

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700
you know that numbers like 1 or 2 or not
 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.960
you know that numbers like 1 or 2 or not
or 0 right and you know really it's

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970
or 0 right and you know really it's
 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.670
or 0 right and you know really it's
really not fun to have to carry your

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680
really not fun to have to carry your
 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.869
really not fun to have to carry your
water it would be really nice to have

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879
water it would be really nice to have
 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.729
water it would be really nice to have
somebody carry your water for you and

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739
somebody carry your water for you and
 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.009
somebody carry your water for you and
the way we're gonna solve those problems

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019
the way we're gonna solve those problems
 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.710
the way we're gonna solve those problems
is by having more energy not loss and by

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720
is by having more energy not loss and by
 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.839
is by having more energy not loss and by
having it not hurt our environment the

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849
having it not hurt our environment the
 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.089
having it not hurt our environment the
world that we live in and by having it

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099
world that we live in and by having it
 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.789
world that we live in and by having it
be a whole lot cheaper right having more

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799
be a whole lot cheaper right having more
 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.470
be a whole lot cheaper right having more
having it be cheaper those things are

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480
having it be cheaper those things are
 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.000
having it be cheaper those things are
related the way we're going to do that

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010
related the way we're going to do that
 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.589
related the way we're going to do that
is with technology or not there's no

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599
is with technology or not there's no
 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.110
is with technology or not there's no
other magic that's gonna do it and

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120
other magic that's gonna do it and
 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.430
other magic that's gonna do it and
that's the way it's always been done and

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440
that's the way it's always been done and
 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.630
that's the way it's always been done and
if you look at the trends there's been

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640
if you look at the trends there's been
 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.440
if you look at the trends there's been
huge huge advances in all these things

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450
huge huge advances in all these things
 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.699
huge huge advances in all these things
so I think the the way you're gonna

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709
so I think the the way you're gonna
 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.520
so I think the the way you're gonna
solve poverty is by having helpers and

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530
solve poverty is by having helpers and
 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.190
solve poverty is by having helpers and
energy is a great way to have helpers if

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200
energy is a great way to have helpers if
 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.930
energy is a great way to have helpers if
the food cost is probably largely based

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940
the food cost is probably largely based
 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.149
the food cost is probably largely based
on transportation now the cost

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159
on transportation now the cost
 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.680
on transportation now the cost
transportation is largely based on the

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690
transportation is largely based on the
 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.559
transportation is largely based on the
cost of energy and so you know you saw

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569
cost of energy and so you know you saw
 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.210
cost of energy and so you know you saw
you'll solve both those problems at once

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220
you'll solve both those problems at once
 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.069
you'll solve both those problems at once
you'll solve food and you'll solve

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079
you'll solve food and you'll solve
 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.289
you'll solve food and you'll solve
energy and that will help with poverty

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299
energy and that will help with poverty
 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.960
energy and that will help with poverty
and starvation and all those things and

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970
and starvation and all those things and
 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.069
and starvation and all those things and
the way we're going to do that is we're

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079
the way we're going to do that is we're
 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.569
the way we're going to do that is we're
gonna make it cheap and prevalent and

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579
gonna make it cheap and prevalent and
 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.339
gonna make it cheap and prevalent and
you know you can deal a whole take a

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349
you know you can deal a whole take a
 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:23.960
you know you can deal a whole take a
whole anywhere in the world and get tons

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970
whole anywhere in the world and get tons
 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.879
whole anywhere in the world and get tons
of energy um that'd be a great thing

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889
of energy um that'd be a great thing
 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:29.839
of energy um that'd be a great thing
right let's let's go build that can I

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849
right let's let's go build that can I
 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.879
right let's let's go build that can I
make go ahead what I mean you know what

those kind of things how do you measure
 

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.920
those kind of things how do you measure
that at scale and so you know what are

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:28.930
that at scale and so you know what are
 

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:30.210

of those procedures and rules right for
 

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.550
of those procedures and rules right for
these governments and we get the

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:41.560
these governments and we get the
 

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.140
these governments and we get the
accountability and the understanding of

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:43.150

this is a very different challenge we

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:06.130
this is a very different challenge we
 

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:08.130
this is a very different challenge we
actually have to have a mass social

talking about I think again language is
 

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.080
talking about I think again language is
so important that this has to be a

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:22.090
so important that this has to be a
 

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:24.210
so important that this has to be a
social movement foreign investment in

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:24.220
social movement foreign investment in
 

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:24.660
social movement foreign investment in
our future

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:24.670

if it's a social movement for a tax

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:26.860
if it's a social movement for a tax
 

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.550
if it's a social movement for a tax
that's gonna be a really hard sell but

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:29.560
that's gonna be a really hard sell but
 

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.110
that's gonna be a really hard sell but
if it's a social movement for an

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.720
investment
really what what Larry and Sergey and

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:33.730
really what what Larry and Sergey and
 

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:36.390
really what what Larry and Sergey and
Larry been saying that if we can reframe

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400
Larry been saying that if we can reframe
 

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.370
Larry been saying that if we can reframe
this is how do we invest in our future

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:38.380
this is how do we invest in our future
 

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:39.990
this is how do we invest in our future
because we can talk about everything

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000
because we can talk about everything

because we can talk about everything
here without a price signal you will not

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:42.490
here without a price signal you will not
 

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:44.190
here without a price signal you will not
have scale without scale you have a

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.200
have scale without scale you have a
 

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.170

green hobby I like to build model

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:46.180
green hobby I like to build model
 

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.630
green hobby I like to build model
airplanes for hobby not not try to get a

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640
airplanes for hobby not not try to get a
 

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:52.859
airplanes for hobby not not try to get a
gigawatt of clean energy can I add one

00:35:52.859 --> 00:35:52.869
gigawatt of clean energy can I add one
 

00:35:52.869 --> 00:35:54.210
gigawatt of clean energy can I add one
thing to that though I mean I think

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:54.220
thing to that though I mean I think
 

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.190
thing to that though I mean I think
that's what we're doing the getting the

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:56.200
that's what we're doing the getting the
 

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.859
that's what we're doing the getting the
C part up but I do think there's pretty

00:35:58.859 --> 00:35:58.869
C part up but I do think there's pretty
 

00:35:58.869 --> 00:36:00.930
C part up but I do think there's pretty
obvious path to getting the REE part

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:00.940
obvious path to getting the REE part
 

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:04.170
obvious path to getting the REE part
down a lot and in order to solve some of

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:04.180
down a lot and in order to solve some of
 

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.790
down a lot and in order to solve some of
the development issues we really need

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:05.800
the development issues we really need
 

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.069
the development issues we really need
cheaper energy and so if you just

00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079
cheaper energy and so if you just
 

00:36:08.079 --> 00:36:10.500
cheaper energy and so if you just
increase C you know in confusing if you

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:10.510
increase C you know in confusing if you
 

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:12.060
increase C you know in confusing if you
can't wave your hands today and increase

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:12.070
can't wave your hands today and increase
 

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:15.780
can't wave your hands today and increase
C a lot you know you should do that but

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:15.790
C a lot you know you should do that but
 

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:17.819
C a lot you know you should do that but
that that's actually not the only thing

00:36:17.819 --> 00:36:17.829
that that's actually not the only thing
 

00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:19.050
that that's actually not the only thing
we need to do even if you accomplish

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:19.060
we need to do even if you accomplish
 

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:21.390
we need to do even if you accomplish
doing that you've really missed

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:21.400
doing that you've really missed
 

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.550
doing that you've really missed
something important which is that we

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:23.560
something important which is that we
 

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.410
something important which is that we
really want everybody to have a lot of

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:25.420
really want everybody to have a lot of
 

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:30.770
really want everybody to have a lot of
energy okay yeah no I agree but I think

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:30.780
energy okay yeah no I agree but I think
 

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.819
energy okay yeah no I agree but I think
if there's one thought I want to lead

00:36:32.819 --> 00:36:32.829
if there's one thought I want to lead
 

00:36:32.829 --> 00:36:34.890
if there's one thought I want to lead
people with those that I think the

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:34.900
people with those that I think the
 

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.839
people with those that I think the
number number of people in the world

00:36:36.839 --> 00:36:36.849
number number of people in the world
 

00:36:36.849 --> 00:36:39.390
number number of people in the world
that are trying to make REE really small

00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:39.400
that are trying to make REE really small
 

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.300
that are trying to make REE really small
is very very small like if we could

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:42.310
is very very small like if we could
 

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:44.630
is very very small like if we could
probably fit them all into this room and

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640
probably fit them all into this room and
 

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:48.059
probably fit them all into this room and
that's a really serious problem you know

00:36:48.059 --> 00:36:48.069
that's a really serious problem you know
 

00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:50.130
that's a really serious problem you know
if we make that if we make it go from a

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:50.140
if we make that if we make it go from a
 

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:52.800
if we make that if we make it go from a
hundred to 10,000 people we're gonna

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:52.810
hundred to 10,000 people we're gonna
 

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:55.260
hundred to 10,000 people we're gonna
make a lot more progress but just to

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:55.270
make a lot more progress but just to
 

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:56.819
make a lot more progress but just to
quickly add I do think we need policy

00:36:56.819 --> 00:36:56.829
quickly add I do think we need policy
 

00:36:56.829 --> 00:36:59.819
quickly add I do think we need policy
work just to make our e smaller or to

00:36:59.819 --> 00:36:59.829
work just to make our e smaller or to
 

00:36:59.829 --> 00:37:01.530
work just to make our e smaller or to
not increase it I mean the tariffs on

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:01.540
not increase it I mean the tariffs on
 

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:03.920
not increase it I mean the tariffs on
the sugarcane ethanol is the real issue

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:03.930
the sugarcane ethanol is the real issue
 

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:06.300
the sugarcane ethanol is the real issue
the inability to put up windmills

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:06.310
the inability to put up windmills
 

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:07.950
the inability to put up windmills
because you just five miles off the

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:07.960
because you just five miles off the
 

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.599
because you just five miles off the
coast and Tucket they don't look so

00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:09.609
coast and Tucket they don't look so
 

00:37:09.609 --> 00:37:11.640
coast and Tucket they don't look so
pretty you know all those things are

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:11.650
pretty you know all those things are
 

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:13.410
pretty you know all those things are
real obstacles we need to get rid of

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:13.420
real obstacles we need to get rid of
 

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.450
real obstacles we need to get rid of
those just our buildings too you know we

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:15.460
those just our buildings too you know we
 

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.069
those just our buildings too you know we
have to attach the panels to the right

00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:17.079
have to attach the panels to the right
 

00:37:17.079 --> 00:37:18.990
have to attach the panels to the right
building or we can't meter it into the

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.000
building or we can't meter it into the
 

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.670
building or we can't meter it into the
grid and they won't let us connect to it

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:20.680
grid and they won't let us connect to it
 

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:23.400
grid and they won't let us connect to it
this is stuffs garbage I mean so some of

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:23.410
this is stuffs garbage I mean so some of
 

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:25.020
this is stuffs garbage I mean so some of
the some of the I think what circuit is

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:25.030
the some of the I think what circuit is
 

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:26.970
the some of the I think what circuit is
saying is to get real fast action on

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:26.980
saying is to get real fast action on
 

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:28.620
saying is to get real fast action on
these things you got to be able to

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:28.630
these things you got to be able to
 

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:30.150
these things you got to be able to
connect stuff to the grid without it

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160
connect stuff to the grid without it
 

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.010
connect stuff to the grid without it
taking two years and stuff that's a

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:32.020
taking two years and stuff that's a
 

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:34.500
taking two years and stuff that's a
policy issue and one small thing just to

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:34.510
policy issue and one small thing just to
 

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:35.819
policy issue and one small thing just to
remind us what we already know

00:37:35.819 --> 00:37:35.829
remind us what we already know
 

00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:37.589
remind us what we already know
if you're looking at already less than C

00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599
if you're looking at already less than C
 

00:37:37.599 --> 00:37:39.599
if you're looking at already less than C
it's all over the world so you might be

00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:39.609
it's all over the world so you might be
 

00:37:39.609 --> 00:37:41.760
it's all over the world so you might be
able to affect the price of coal by

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:41.770
able to affect the price of coal by
 

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:43.349
able to affect the price of coal by
internalizing in the United States if

00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359
internalizing in the United States if
 

00:37:43.359 --> 00:37:45.430
