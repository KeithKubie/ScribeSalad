00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:11.719
Why is a Final Performance Called a Swan Song?

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.090
When someone performs for the last time, we
often refer to it as a “swan song” which

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.100
seems odd given that swans aren’t particularly
known for their stage presence…

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.060
So where exactly did this phrase come from?

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.900
This expression is generally thought to have
its genesis in the over two thousand year

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.780
old idea that swans sing a beautiful song
just before death.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.149
Although this is technically not accurate,
there is a hint of truth to it in select instances.

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.350
For instance, the Whooper Swan, which as its
name suggests is known for making a bizarre

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.309
honking sound, has been observed to sometimes
make a noise as it expires.

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.809
This is thought to be a byproduct of this
bird having an extremely elongated tracheal

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.589
loop combined with the way the air flows through
it as they die and their lungs expel any excess

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:00.589
atmosphere.

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.320
The sound this sometimes makes has been described
as being akin to “a clarionet when blown

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.960
by a novice in music”…

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.330
Not exactly beautiful song, but it is a sound
upon death at least.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.160
Interestingly, the Whooper Swan is endemic
to Greece, leading some to speculate that

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.780
someone in Ancient Greece heard one of these
birds’ dying sounds and subsequently exaggerated

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.800
the event and attributed the same to all swans,
thus giving rise to the legend.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.160
Perhaps the first known instance of the idea
of swans singing just before death appeared

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.850
in the six century BC in one of Aesop’s
Fables- The Swan and the Goose:

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.650
A certain rich man bought in the market a
Goose and a Swan.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.560
He fed the one for his table and kept the
other for the sake of its song.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.430
When the time came for killing the Goose,
the cook went to get him at night, when it

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.450
was dark, and he was not able to distinguish
one bird from the other.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.410
By mistake he caught the Swan instead of the
Goose.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.730
The Swan, threatened with death, burst forth
into song and thus made himself known by his

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.410
voice, and preserved his life by his melody.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.700
Another potential candidate for the first
reference to this can be found in Aeschylus’

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.879
Agamemnon, written in 458 BC: “That is why
he lies there like this, and she does too,

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.570
his lover, after singing her last death-laden
lament like a swan.”

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.680
Despite the dates I just listed, which of
these is really first isn’t clear because

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.870
none of Aesop’s Fables were actually written
by him as all copies of “his” fable compilation

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.410
have been lost.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.019
Since then, many fables have been falsely
credited to him, but really were simply tacked

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.459
on in the ensuing millennia and others were
re-worked to fit the precise message the teller

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.670
was going for.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.920
(Even much of what we “know” about this
legendary storytelling slave himself is probably

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.280
itself fiction.)

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.840
The first known compilation of Aesop’s Fables
wasn’t even created until 300 BC by Demetrius

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.189
of Phalerum who, among many other things,
was the head of acquisitions at the Library

00:02:58.189 --> 00:02:59.189
of Alexandria.

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.189
(And if you’re curious, see: What Really
Happened to the Library of Alexandria?)

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:01.239
This work has also since been lost.

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.970
The first surviving collections of the fables
didn’t come about until the first and second

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.079
centuries AD.

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:13.560
Needless to say, with a 600+ year gap between
when Aesop supposedly lived and the first

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.239
surviving collection of “his” fables,
it’s difficult to say when the story of

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.670
the Swan and the Goose was first written down,
let alone when it was first spoken.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.769
Whatever the case, from here the notion of
swans singing just before death appeared in

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:24.769
countless pieces of classical literature,
poetry and music.

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.249
For instance, in Plato’s Phaedo, Plato claims
that Socrates stated,

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:31.939
Will you not allow that I have as much of
the spirit of prophecy in me as the swans?

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:37.150
For they, when they perceive that they must
die, having sung all their life long, do then

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.939
sing more than ever, rejoicing in the thought
that they are about to go away to the god

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.299
whose ministers they are.

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.349
But men, because they are themselves afraid
of death, slanderously affirm of the swans

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:54.769
that they sing a lament at the last, not considering
that no bird sings when cold, or hungry, or

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.859
in pain, not even the nightingale, nor the
swallow, nor yet the hoopoe; which are said

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:04.680
indeed to tune a lay of sorrow, although I
do not believe this to be true of them any

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.439
more than of the swans.

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:11.590
But because they are sacred to Apollo, and
have the gift of prophecy, and anticipate

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.609
the good things of another world, therefore
they sing and rejoice in that day more than

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:17.750
ever they did before.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.820
And I too, believing myself to be the consecrated
servant of the same God, and the fellow servant

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.660
of the swans, and thinking that I have received
from my master gifts of prophecy which are

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.160
not inferior to theirs, would not go out of
life less merrily than the swans.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.210
Numerous historical figures have since made
attempts to debunk the idea that swans sing

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.130
upon their death, such as Pliny the Elder
who wrote in the first century AD, “Observation

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.660
shows that the story that the dying swan sings
is false, judging from experience…” in

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.340
his landmark Natural History.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.340
Nevertheless, the notion endured.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.789
Notable instances of this include Chaucer
writing in his fourteenth century Parliament

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:06.270
of Foules, “The Ialous swan, ayens his deth
that singeth.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.800
[The jealous swan, sings before his death]”
(Interestingly, this poem also includes the

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.810
first explicit Valentine’s Day / love connection.)

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.289
Even Leonardo da Vinci got into the swan song
/ death action noting, “The swan is white

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:24.550
without spot, and it sings sweetly as it dies,
that song ending its life.”

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.550
Shakespeare also wrote in his sixteenth century
The Merchant of Venice: “Let music sound

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:36.099
while he doth make his choice; then, if he
lose, he makes a swan-like end, fading in

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:37.099
music.”

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:42.849
So when did this idea of swans singing before
death morph into the specific expression “swan

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:43.849
song”?

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:47.680
The English version of this appears to have
been borrowed from the German Schwanengesang

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.639
(Swan Song), with the first known instance
of the original German version being Georg

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.840
Philipp Telemann’s 1733 concerto of the
same name.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.310
The first recorded use of the phrase in English
didn’t appear in print until a couple decades

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:08.159
later when Scottish priest John Willison in
one of his Scripture Songs (Song VI) noted,

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:13.440
“Being a Prophecy of Christ, and King David’s
Swan Song in views of death…”

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.919
In Sermon II of his 1747 Five Sacramental
Sermons, published in The Balm of Gilead,

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:24.580
Willison also mirrors the sentiment in Plato’s
Phaedo, referring to a swan song upon death

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.580
being one of joy,

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.580
You may sing that swan-song, Psal. xlviii.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.580
14, “For this God is our God for ever and
ever, and he will be our guide even unto death.”

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.580
It is this that gives a believer peace in
his latter end: it made David to triumph in

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.580
the view of approaching death…

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.580
As for how this popularly morphed into referring
to a performer’s final work or performance,

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.270
beyond a few other references very loosely
fitting the bill, the first known more explicit

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:41.490
instance of this was the great Franz Schubert’s
1828 Schwanengesang (Swan Song), which is

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.189
a collection of songs by Schubert written
near the end of his life and published in

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:48.300
1829, a year after his death at the tender
age of 31.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.300
(Not to be confused with Johann Senn’s Schwanengesang
poem that Schubert previously put to music

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.300
in 1822.)

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.389
Schubert did not, however, name this posthumous
work.

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:58.120
Instead, Tobias Haslinger published the collection
under this name referencing the age-old notion

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.969
of swans singing a final, beautiful song before
expiring, with, of course, Schubert being

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:18.410
the swan in this case and the collection his
final “song”.
