00:00:00.306 --> 00:00:01.861
- [Voiceover] Let's say
we have a linear equation

00:00:01.861 --> 00:00:05.065
and we know when X is equal to four

00:00:05.065 --> 00:00:08.456
that Y is equal to nine

00:00:08.456 --> 00:00:11.869
and we've plotted that
point here on our XY plane.

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.189
Actually, I forgot to label
the x-axis right over there.

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:16.768
Now let's say we also know,

00:00:16.768 --> 00:00:19.903
we also know that when X is equal to six

00:00:19.903 --> 00:00:22.271
Y is equal to one.

00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:23.966
And we've plotted that point there.

00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:27.054
And so this green line
represents all of the solutions

00:00:27.054 --> 00:00:28.912
to this linear equation.

00:00:28.912 --> 00:00:30.584
Now what I want to do in this video is

00:00:30.584 --> 00:00:33.648
I want to say, well can we
find that linear equation

00:00:33.648 --> 00:00:37.735
and can we express it
in both point-slope form

00:00:37.735 --> 00:00:40.079
and in slope-intercept form.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.613
And I encourage you, like always,

00:00:41.613 --> 00:00:44.446
pause the video and see if you can do it.

00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:47.069
So let's first think
about point-slope form.

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:48.509
Point,

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:52.921
point-slope form.

00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:55.752
And point-slope form is
very easy to generate

00:00:55.752 --> 00:00:58.655
if you know a point on the line,

00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:01.046
or if you know a point that satisfies,

00:01:01.046 --> 00:01:04.089
where the X and Y coordinates
satisfy the linear equation,

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.456
and if you were to know
the slope of the line

00:01:07.456 --> 00:01:10.614
that represents the solution
set of that linear equation.

00:01:10.614 --> 00:01:12.889
Now for sure we actually
were given two points

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:15.420
that are solutions, that represent

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.369
solutions to the linear equation.

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.109
To fully apply point-slope, or
to apply point-slope easily,

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:22.850
we just have to figure out the slope.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.614
And what we could do is,
we could just evaluate

00:01:24.614 --> 00:01:27.680
well what's the slope between
the two points that we know?

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.511
And we just have to remind
ourselves that slope,

00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:33.136
slope, is equal to,

00:01:33.136 --> 00:01:38.127
slope is equal to change
in y over change in x.

00:01:38.127 --> 00:01:41.208
Sometimes people say rise over run.

00:01:41.208 --> 00:01:42.717
And what's that going to be?

00:01:42.717 --> 00:01:47.533
Well, if we say that this
second point right over here,

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.315
if we say this is kind of our,

00:01:50.315 --> 00:01:52.638
if we're starting at this
point and we go to that point,

00:01:52.638 --> 00:01:56.213
then our change in Y, going
from this point to that point

00:01:56.213 --> 00:01:57.421
is going to be,

00:01:57.421 --> 00:02:01.537
it's going to be equal to one minus,

00:02:02.727 --> 00:02:05.700
one minus nine.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.045
One minus nine.

00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:12.828
This point right over here
is the point six comma one.

00:02:12.828 --> 00:02:15.684
So we started at Y equals nine,

00:02:15.684 --> 00:02:17.587
we finish at Y equals one,

00:02:17.587 --> 00:02:20.699
our change in Y is going
to be one minus nine.

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:22.835
We have a negative eight change in Y,

00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:23.574
which makes sense.

00:02:23.574 --> 00:02:25.617
We've gone down eight.

00:02:25.617 --> 00:02:27.544
So this is going to be equal to,

00:02:27.544 --> 00:02:29.773
this is going to be
equal to negative eight.

00:02:29.773 --> 00:02:31.352
That's our change in Y.

00:02:31.352 --> 00:02:32.769
And what's our change in X?

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.391
Well we go from X equals
four to X equals six.

00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:39.061
So we end up at X equals six

00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:42.428
and we started at X equals four.

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:44.424
We started at X equals four,

00:02:44.424 --> 00:02:46.699
so our change in X is six minus four,

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.371
which is equal to two.

00:02:48.371 --> 00:02:49.928
Which is equal to two.

00:02:49.928 --> 00:02:51.344
And you could have even done it visually.

00:02:51.344 --> 00:02:54.896
To go from this point to
this point your change in Y,

00:02:54.896 --> 00:02:56.940
your change in Y is

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.217
you went down eight.

00:02:58.217 --> 00:03:00.144
So your change in, let me write this.

00:03:00.144 --> 00:03:04.277
So your change in Y is
equal to negative eight.

00:03:04.277 --> 00:03:05.508
And what was your change in X?

00:03:05.508 --> 00:03:07.215
Again to get to this point?

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.462
Well, your change in X is positive two.

00:03:11.418 --> 00:03:15.389
So your change in X is equal to two.

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:16.225
And so what's your slope?

00:03:16.225 --> 00:03:17.432
Change in Y over change in X.

00:03:17.432 --> 00:03:21.891
Negative eight over two
is equal to negative four.

00:03:21.891 --> 00:03:23.377
So now that we have a,

00:03:23.377 --> 00:03:24.840
now that we know the slope

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.820
and we know a point, we know a,

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.957
we actually know two points on the line,

00:03:30.957 --> 00:03:33.856
we can express this in point-slope form.

00:03:33.856 --> 00:03:35.481
And so let's do that.

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:37.200
And the way I like to
it is I always like to

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.164
just take it straight from the
definition of what slope is.

00:03:41.164 --> 00:03:44.090
We know that the slope between
any two points on this line

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.157
is going to be negative four.

00:03:46.157 --> 00:03:50.940
So if we take an arbitrary
Y that sits on this line

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.351
and if we find the difference
between that Y and,

00:03:52.351 --> 00:03:54.928
let's focus on this point up here.

00:03:54.928 --> 00:03:56.437
So if we find the difference between

00:03:56.437 --> 00:03:58.981
that Y and this Y, and nine,

00:04:00.356 --> 00:04:04.165
and it's over the difference between

00:04:04.165 --> 00:04:08.610
some X on the line and this X, and four.

00:04:11.052 --> 00:04:15.233
This is going to be the slope
between any XY on this line

00:04:15.233 --> 00:04:17.392
and this point right over here.

00:04:17.392 --> 00:04:19.852
And the slope between
any two points on a line

00:04:19.852 --> 00:04:21.525
are going to have to be constant.

00:04:21.525 --> 00:04:24.265
So this is going to be equal
to the slope of the line.

00:04:24.265 --> 00:04:27.167
It's going to be equal to negative four.

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:28.723
And we're not in point-slope form

00:04:28.723 --> 00:04:30.929
or classic point-slope form just yet.

00:04:30.929 --> 00:04:34.666
To do that, we just multiply
both sides times X minus four.

00:04:34.666 --> 00:04:37.819
So we get Y minus 9,

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.756
we get Y minus nine is equal to

00:04:40.756 --> 00:04:43.679
our slope, negative four

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:45.931
times X minus four.

00:04:45.931 --> 00:04:47.950
Time X minus four.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.203
And this right over here is our classic,

00:04:50.203 --> 00:04:53.547
this right over here is our
classic point-slope form.

00:04:53.547 --> 00:04:54.562
We have the point,

00:04:54.562 --> 00:04:56.815
sometimes they even put
parenthesis like this,

00:04:56.815 --> 00:04:58.394
but we could figure out the point

00:04:58.394 --> 00:04:59.949
from this point-slope form.

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:01.389
The point that sits on
this line with things

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.198
that make both sides of
this equation equal to zero.

00:05:04.198 --> 00:05:07.078
So it would be X equals
four, Y equals nine,

00:05:07.078 --> 00:05:08.446
which we have right up there,

00:05:08.446 --> 00:05:10.584
and then the slope is right over here,

00:05:10.584 --> 00:05:12.232
it's negative four.

00:05:12.232 --> 00:05:16.494
Now from this can we now express this

00:05:16.494 --> 00:05:20.024
linear equation in y-intercept form?

00:05:20.024 --> 00:05:23.159
And y-intercept form, just
as a bit of a reminder,

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.966
it's Y is equal to MX plus B.

00:05:26.966 --> 00:05:29.382
Where this coefficient is our slope

00:05:29.382 --> 00:05:31.332
and this constant right over here

00:05:31.332 --> 00:05:34.652
allows us to figure out our y-intercept.

00:05:34.652 --> 00:05:37.509
And to get this in this
form we just have to

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:39.761
simplify a little bit of this algebra.

00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:41.665
So you have Y minus nine.

00:05:41.665 --> 00:05:44.590
Y minus nine is equal to,

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.448
well let's distribute this negative four.

00:05:46.448 --> 00:05:47.655
And I'll just switch some colors.

00:05:47.655 --> 00:05:49.559
Let's distribute this negative four.

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:52.555
Negative four times X is negative four X.

00:05:52.555 --> 00:05:56.386
Negative four time
negative four is plus 16.

00:05:56.386 --> 00:05:57.454
And now, if we just want to isolate

00:05:57.454 --> 00:05:59.172
the Y on the left hand side,

00:05:59.172 --> 00:06:01.680
we can add nine to both sides.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.539
So let's do that.

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:04.257
Let's add nine,

00:06:04.257 --> 00:06:06.127
let's add nine to both sides.

00:06:07.084 --> 00:06:08.050
Let's add nine to both sides.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.441
On the left-hand side
we're just left with Y.

00:06:10.441 --> 00:06:13.009
And on the right-hand side we're left with

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:17.982
negative four X and then
16 plus nine is plus 25.

00:06:18.598 --> 00:06:19.511
And there you have it.

00:06:19.511 --> 00:06:22.088
We have the same linear
equation, but it's now

00:06:22.088 --> 00:06:24.480
represented in slope-intercept form.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.756
Once again, we see the
slope right over here

00:06:26.756 --> 00:06:29.147
and now we can figure out
what the y-intercept is.

00:06:29.147 --> 00:06:31.562
The y-intercept when X is equal to zero,

00:06:31.562 --> 00:06:34.302
Y is going to be equal to 25.

00:06:34.302 --> 00:06:36.810
My axis right here, I
haven't drawn it high enough,

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.085
but if I made it even taller
and taller and you see

00:06:39.085 --> 00:06:42.622
this line is gonna intersect the y-axis

00:06:42.622 --> 00:06:45.502
when Y is equal to,

00:06:45.502 --> 00:06:47.614
Y is equal to 25.

00:06:47.614 --> 00:06:50.169
So there you go, we wrote
it in point-slope form,

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:52.839
that is that right over there,

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:54.613
and we wrote it in Y,

00:06:55.718 --> 00:06:57.335
sorry, we wrote it in slope,

00:06:57.335 --> 00:07:00.284
we wrote it in slope-intercept form.

00:07:00.284 --> 00:07:02.884
Point-slope and slope-intercept.

00:07:02.884 --> 00:07:05.061
Hopefully you enjoyed that.
