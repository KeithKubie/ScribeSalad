00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.520
So we're done with lesson one, right?

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.680
So if this is our student, she is now
at IT and at the end of lesson one.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.990
What I do is I just want to take
all of this thing together and

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.750
not focus too much on lesson
one anymore, if that's okay?

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we can move lesson two over.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.400
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.770
Let's say all of this is lesson two.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.880
What should be some of
the big ideas in lesson two?

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.090
&gt;&gt; Well, I think we can
split it up into two parts.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.050
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.940
&gt;&gt; And what do you think we
should do for the first part?

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.340
&gt;&gt; Well, right here we should add
some interactivity to the app, right?

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.840
So, say there's a button on our app,
you press the button,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.070
boom, something happens.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that sounds good.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.270
And then in the second part we can
go into details of what exactly is

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.390
happening and
also learn about variables and methods.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.680
&gt;&gt; So all of the technical jargon
that sounds like magic right now, but

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.190
will not be magic at
the end of this lesson.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.280
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.240
And we can do this by
building up the new app.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.990
&gt;&gt; Wait, what?

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.220
We're making a new app in lesson two?

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
it's going to be a coffee ordering app.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.390
&gt;&gt; Wait, can we call it just Java?

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.314
&gt;&gt; Okay, I get it.

00:00:56.314 --> 00:00:57.756
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

00:00:57.756 --> 00:00:59.282
Yes, let's get started.
