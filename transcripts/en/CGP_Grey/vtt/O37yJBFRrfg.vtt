00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.770
Where, is the European Union?

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.450
Obviously here somewhere, but much like the
the European continent itself, which has an

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.130
unclear boundary, the European Union also
has some fuzzy edges to it.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.080
To start, the official members of the European
Union are, in decreasing order of population:

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.080
* Germany
* France

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.080
* The United Kingdom
* Italy

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.080
* Spain
* Poland

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.080
* Romania
* The Kingdom of the Netherlands

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.080
* Greece
* Belgium

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.080
* Portugal
* The Czech Republic

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.080
* Hungary
* Sweden

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.080
* Austria
* Bulgaria

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.080
* Denmark
* Slovakia

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.080
* Finland
* Ireland

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.080
* Croatia
* Lithuania

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.080
* Latvia
* Slovenia

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.080
* Estonia
* Cyprus

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.080
* Luxembourg
* Malta

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.880
The edges of the EU will probably continue
to expand further out as there are other countries

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.590
in various stages of trying to become a member.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.410
How exactly the European Union works is hideously
complicated and a story for another time,

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.210
but for this video you need know only three
things:

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.210
1.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.300
Countries pay membership dues and

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.300
2.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.490
Vote on laws they all must follow and

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.490
3.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.920
Citizens of member countries are automatically
European Union citizens as well

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.720
This last means that if you're a citizen of
any of these countries you are free to live

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.920
and work or retire in any of the others.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.650
Which is nice especially if you think your
country is too big or too small or too hot

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.650
or too cold.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.130
The European Union gives you options.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.620
By the way, did you notice how all three of
these statements have asterisks attached to

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.719
this unhelpful footnote?

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:10.020
Well, get used to it: Europe loves asterisks
that add exceptions to complicated agreements.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.630
These three, for example, point us toward
the first bit of border fuzziness with Norway,

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.119
Iceland and little Liechtenstein.

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.200
None of which are in the European Union but
if you're a EU citizen you can live in these

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.950
countries and Norwegians, Icelanders, or Liechtensteiner(in)s
can can live in yours.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.950
Why?

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.940
In exchange for the freedom of movement of
people they have to pay membership fees to

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.479
the European Union -- even though they aren't
a part of it and thus don't get a say its

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.479
laws that they still have to follow.

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.350
This arrangement is the European Economic
Area and it sounds like a terrible deal, were

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.170
it not for that asterisk which grants EEA
but not EU members a pass on some areas of

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.659
law notably farming and fishing -- something
a country like Iceland might care quite a

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.520
lot about running their own way.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.260
Between the European Union and the European
Economic Area the continent looks mostly covered,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.529
with the notable exception of Switzerland
who remains neutral and fiercely independent,

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:57.689
except for her participation in the Schengen
Area.

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.249
If you're from a country that keeps her borders
extremely clean and / or well-patrolled, the

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:04.920
Schengen Area is a bit mind-blowing because
it's an agreement between countries to take

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.849
a 'meh' approach to borders.

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:10.940
In the Schengen Area international boundaries
look like this: no border officers or passport

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.230
checks of any kind.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.430
You can walk from Lisbon to Tallinn without
identification or need to answer the question:

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.440
"business or pleasure?".

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.490
For Switzerland being part of Schengen but
not part of the European Union means that

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.710
non-swiss can check in any time they like,
but they can never stay.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.620
This koombaya approach to borders isn't appreciated
by everyone in the EU: most loudly, the United

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.570
Kingdom and Ireland who argue that islands
are different.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.420
Thus to get onto these fair isles, you'll
need a passport and a good reason.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.940
Britannia's reluctance to get fully involved
with the EU brings us to the next topic: money.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.040
The European Union has its own fancy currency,
the Euro used by the majority, but not all

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.650
of the European Union members.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.360
This economic union is called the Eurozone
and to join a country must first reach certain

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.500
financial goals -- and lying about reaching
those goals is certainly not something anyone

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.540
would do.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.650
Most of the non-Eurozone members when they
meet the goals, will ditch their local currency

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.890
in favor of the Euro but three of them Denmark,
Sweden and, of course, the United Kingdom,

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.820
have asterisks attracted to the Euro sections
of the treaty giving them a permanent out-out.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.160
And weirdly, four tiny European countries
Andorra, San Marino, Monaco &amp; Vatican City

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.270
have an asterisk giving them the reverse:
the right print and use Euros as their money,

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.530
despite not being in the European Union at
all.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.210
So that's the big picture: there's the EU,
which makes all the rules, the Eurozone inside

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.440
it with a common currency, the European Economic
Area outside of it where people can move freely

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.560
and the selective Schengen, for countries
who think borders just aren't worth the hassle.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.790
As you can see, there's some strange overlaps
with these borders, but we're not done talking

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.490
about complications by a long shot one again,
because empire.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.910
So Portugal and Spain have islands from their
colonial days that they've never parted with:

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.200
these are the Madeira and Canary Islands are
off the coast of Africa and the Azores well

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.490
into the Atlantic.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.760
Because these islands are Spanish and Portuguese
they're part of the European Union as well.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.530
Adding a few islands to the EU's borders isn't
a big deal until you consider France: the

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.610
queen of not-letting go.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.180
She still holds onto a bunch of islands in
the Caribbean, Reunion off the coast of Madagascar

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.390
and French Guiana in South America.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.360
As far as France is concerned, these are France
too, which single handedly extends the edge-to-edge

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.400
distance of the European Union across a third
of Earth's circumference.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.430
Collectively, these bits of France, Spain
and Portugal are called the Outermost Regions

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.940
-- and they're the result of the simple answer
to empire: just keep it.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.010
On the other hand, there's the United Kingdom,
the master of maintaining complicated relationships

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.490
with her quasi-former lands -- and she's by
no means alone in this on such an empire-happy

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.490
continent.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.570
The Netherlands and Denmark and France (again)
all have what the European Union calls Overseas

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.240
Territories: they're not part of the European
Union, instead they're a bottomless well of

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.310
asterisks due to their complicated relationships
with both with the European Union and their

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.720
associated countries which makes it hard to
say anything meaningful about them as a group

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.720
but...

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.900
in general European Union law doesn't apply
to these places, though in general the people

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.100
who live there are European Union citizens
because in general they have the citizenship

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.190
of their associated country, so in general
they can live anywhere in the EU they want

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.060
but in general other European Union citizens
can't freely move to these territories.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.440
Which makes these places a weird, semipermeable
membrane of the European Union proper and

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.410
the final part we're going to talk about in
detail even though there are still many, more

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.960
one-off asterisks you might stumble upon,
such as: the Isle of Man or those Spanish

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.940
Cities in North Africa or Gibraltar, who pretends
to be part of Southwest England sometimes,

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.340
or that region in Greece where it's totally
legal to ban women, or Saba &amp; friends who

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.210
are part of the Netherlands and so should
be part of the EU, but aren't, or the Faeroe

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.510
Islands upon which while citizens of Denmark
live they lose their EU citizenship, and on

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.860
and on it goes.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.860
These asterisks almost never end, but this
video must.
