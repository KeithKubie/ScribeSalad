into online presentations so I think the
 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.160
into online presentations so I think the
best way to take a look at this is to

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170
best way to take a look at this is to
 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.599
best way to take a look at this is to
actually run through a demo oh good i'm

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609
actually run through a demo oh good i'm
 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.180

and once you create an account you can
 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.100
and once you create an account you can
go to your portal page and there's two

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110
go to your portal page and there's two
 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.430
go to your portal page and there's two
ways to load the media matrix tools one

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440
ways to load the media matrix tools one
 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.830
ways to load the media matrix tools one
is through a series of bookmarks which

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840
is through a series of bookmarks which
 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.210
is through a series of bookmarks which
simply appear in your bookmark folder

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220
simply appear in your bookmark folder
 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.460
simply appear in your bookmark folder
the other way is an installer and media

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470
the other way is an installer and media
 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.430
the other way is an installer and media
matrix is fully supported on firefox on

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440
matrix is fully supported on firefox on
 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.280
matrix is fully supported on firefox on
both platforms in internet explorer and

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290
both platforms in internet explorer and
 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.410
both platforms in internet explorer and
what that does is it adds options to

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420
what that does is it adds options to
 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.470
what that does is it adds options to
your contextual menu ok so once you

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480
your contextual menu ok so once you
 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.210
your contextual menu ok so once you
actually install the tools you're ready

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220
actually install the tools you're ready
 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.310
actually install the tools you're ready
to head out onto the internet and start

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320
to head out onto the internet and start
 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.940
to head out onto the internet and start
gathering stuff and annotating and so

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950
gathering stuff and annotating and so
 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.430
gathering stuff and annotating and so
let's start small and let's grab an

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440
let's start small and let's grab an
 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.590
let's start small and let's grab an
image so once you come to a website and

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600
image so once you come to a website and
 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.740
image so once you come to a website and
find an object that you want you deploy

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750
find an object that you want you deploy
 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.870
find an object that you want you deploy
the appropriate media matrix tool and so

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880
the appropriate media matrix tool and so
 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.970
the appropriate media matrix tool and so
you can do one of two things you can

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980
you can do one of two things you can
 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.130
you can do one of two things you can
click on the page and say I want to find

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140
click on the page and say I want to find
 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.240
click on the page and say I want to find
an image on this page and what this does

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250
an image on this page and what this does
 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.900
an image on this page and what this does
is it goes through it parses to the page

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910
is it goes through it parses to the page
 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.590
is it goes through it parses to the page
and generates a preview and finds the

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600
and generates a preview and finds the
 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.180
and generates a preview and finds the
images so that you can select one to

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190
images so that you can select one to
 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.880
images so that you can select one to
load into the media matrix editor but as

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890
load into the media matrix editor but as
 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.440
load into the media matrix editor but as
a page like this it's got a ton of stuff

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450
a page like this it's got a ton of stuff
 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.659
a page like this it's got a ton of stuff
on it so you can also just right click

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669
on it so you can also just right click
 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.110
on it so you can also just right click
on an object and just go to add to media

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120
on an object and just go to add to media
 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.990
on an object and just go to add to media
matrix and what this does is it loads

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000
matrix and what this does is it loads
 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.670
matrix and what this does is it loads
the object into the editor and once the

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680
the object into the editor and once the
 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.950
the object into the editor and once the
objects into the editor you can work

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960
objects into the editor you can work
 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.830
objects into the editor you can work
with it and so with images you can

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840
with it and so with images you can
 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.040
with it and so with images you can
increase and decrease the size of it and

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050
increase and decrease the size of it and
 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.469
increase and decrease the size of it and
you can also segment it for images that

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479
you can also segment it for images that
 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.450
you can also segment it for images that
just means creating a virtual crop and

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460
just means creating a virtual crop and
 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.870
just means creating a virtual crop and
so I drew this box around a portion of

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880
so I drew this box around a portion of
 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.650
so I drew this box around a portion of
the image and I can preview it and so

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660
the image and I can preview it and so
 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.440
the image and I can preview it and so
that generates on the fly a preview of

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450
that generates on the fly a preview of
 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.950
that generates on the fly a preview of
the crop and then once you have the

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960
the crop and then once you have the
 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.190
the crop and then once you have the
digital object modified you can again

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200
digital object modified you can again
 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:23.240
digital object modified you can again
give it a title

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250
 
 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.110
 
it's always the toughest thing to come

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120
it's always the toughest thing to come
 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:32.340
it's always the toughest thing to come
up with the title and add your

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.350
up with the title and add your
 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.350
up with the title and add your
annotation and what you can do is you

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360
annotation and what you can do is you
 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.000
annotation and what you can do is you
can organize your stuff in the folders

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.010
can organize your stuff in the folders
 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.200
can organize your stuff in the folders
and if you one of the options is we have

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210
and if you one of the options is we have
 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.960
and if you one of the options is we have
a citation layer we quickly look at that

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970
a citation layer we quickly look at that
 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.290
a citation layer we quickly look at that
the citation layer what before you go to

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300
the citation layer what before you go to
 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.700
the citation layer what before you go to
a citation layer you can add additional

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710
a citation layer you can add additional
 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.860
a citation layer you can add additional
metadata to any object so you can create

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:49.870
metadata to any object so you can create
 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.900
metadata to any object so you can create
metadata skins to describe objects that

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:51.910
metadata skins to describe objects that
 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.760
metadata skins to describe objects that
make sense to you and so I just have an

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:53.770
make sense to you and so I just have an
 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.500
make sense to you and so I just have an
example here if I wanted to I could

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:55.510
example here if I wanted to I could
 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.810
example here if I wanted to I could
apply some dublin core fields to the

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:57.820
apply some dublin core fields to the
 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.420
apply some dublin core fields to the
actual information that I'm stayed

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430
actual information that I'm stayed
 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.930
actual information that I'm stayed
storing for this object but once you've

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:03.940
storing for this object but once you've
 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.410
storing for this object but once you've
actually finished the object it takes

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:07.420
actually finished the object it takes
 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.760
actually finished the object it takes
you to the citation layer what the

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770
you to the citation layer what the
 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.650
you to the citation layer what the
citation layer is it's a series of

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:10.660
citation layer is it's a series of
 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.300
citation layer is it's a series of
questions to get undergrads to think

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:12.310
questions to get undergrads to think
 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.680
questions to get undergrads to think
about why they're collecting this

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:13.690
about why they're collecting this
 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.330
about why they're collecting this
resource and how they're going to use it

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:15.340
resource and how they're going to use it
 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.460
resource and how they're going to use it
in their paper yeah I'm in fact one of

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470
in their paper yeah I'm in fact one of
 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.840
in their paper yeah I'm in fact one of
the main things that we developed a tool

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:18.850
the main things that we developed a tool
 

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.910
the main things that we developed a tool
for was research to find out how people

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:20.920
for was research to find out how people
 

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.070
for was research to find out how people
actually use and think about resources

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080
actually use and think about resources
 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.000
actually use and think about resources
they find that in line and that's been

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.010
they find that in line and that's been
 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.780
they find that in line and that's been
our primary primary mission so once

our primary primary mission so once
 

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.600
our primary primary mission so once
you've collected your resource and on a

yeah yeah yeah yeah well we have a hole
that we have some of the presentation

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:21.730
that we have some of the presentation
 

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.030
that we have some of the presentation
layers we're building you know the whole

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.040
layers we're building you know the whole
 

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.440
layers we're building you know the whole
thing that we're dealing with is the

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:25.450
thing that we're dealing with is the
 

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:27.030
thing that we're dealing with is the
fact that there's lots of editors out

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040
fact that there's lots of editors out
 

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.710
fact that there's lots of editors out
there you have the video and it becoming

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720
there you have the video and it becoming
 

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.960
there you have the video and it becoming
easier and easier you can edit it but

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:30.970
easier and easier you can edit it but
 

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:32.070
easier and easier you can edit it but
there's very few things that actually

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:32.080
there's very few things that actually
 

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.690
there's very few things that actually
deal with the things that come out of

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:33.700
