00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.889
What puts the “science” in “social science”?

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:07.399
The things you probably think of as “science”
– like biology, or physics, or chemistry

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.800
– can seem a world apart from sociology
and the concepts we’ve introduced so far.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.420
But sociology is a type of science; it’s
just not one that uses beakers or microscopes.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.220
Rather than investigating the physical, natural
world, sociology explores the social world.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.520
Now, there are different schools of thought
within sociology about the best way to understand
the social world.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.680
But one of the primary means of conducting
sociology uses many of the same, basic principles
and methods as any of your hard, clinical sciences.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.000
Can sociology use the scientific method?
Check.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.080
Does it rely on empirical data?
Check.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.200
And graphs?
Heck yeah!

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:47.980
[Theme Music]

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.360
A science is really any practice that uses
a systematic method of observation to gain
knowledge.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.280
And you probably know that systematic method
as the scientific method.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.580
Basically, you come up with some question
about the world, and then develop a testable theory
about how you could answer that question.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.620
And you develop and test your theory by gathering
empirical evidence;

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.180
that is, verifiable information that’s collected
in a systematic way.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.240
Now, whether you’re using it to explore the natural
world or the social world, the scientific method is
rooted in the philosophy known as positivism.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.380
First laid out by Auguste Comte – yes, the same
Auguste Comte that we introduced as the founder
of sociology a couple episodes ago –

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.120
positivism argues that phenomena can be
studied through direct observation,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.820
and that these observations can be pulled together
into theories or facts that can help us understand
how the world works.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.280
Now, you might be wondering where the “positive”
in “positivist” comes into play.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.740
Was Comte just a glass half-full kinda guy?

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.140
Well, “positive” in this case doesn’t refer to optimism,
and it doesn’t mean “I’m POSITIVE that I’m right!”

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.420
Instead, a ‘positive’ theory is one that’s
objective and fact-based, whereas a ‘normative’
theory is subjective and value-based.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.900
Which brings us to the first of our three
types of sociological inquiry:

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.080
Positivist sociology, or the study of society based
on systematic observations of social behavior.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.240
And here, “objective” is the key word.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.160
As scientific researchers, sociologists must
set aside their own values and beliefs to approach
their work as neutral observers,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.000
and use empirical evidence to answer
questions about how the social world works.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.319
So what kind of evidence are you looking for?

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.800
If you’re doing quantitative research, you
want data.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.940
Quantitative research is the study of observable
relationships in the world, using mathematical
or statistical methods.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.060
Basically, quantitative evidence is information
that you can count or tally up.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.300
But this doesn’t just mean number-based
data, like income or age.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.800
You can also use it to categorize people or
things, like the state you live in, your gender,
or your race.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.340
And quantitative evidence can be used in lots
of different ways.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.680
For example, there’s descriptive data, which
does just what it sounds like:

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.380
It describes facts relevant to the question
you’re researching.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.160
Like, maybe you want to know how
income is distributed across households in the
United States.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.920
Quantitative data are your friend here.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.140
This graph is the distribution of household incomes
in 2014, produced by the US Census Bureau.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.780
The height of the bars in the graph indicate the
number of households at a certain income level.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.560
And the point labelled “50th” is an important
one because it’s the median income, the absolute
middle observation in the sample.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.480
That means that 50% of households have lower
incomes than that level, and 50% have higher incomes.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.600
In this case, the median income is $53,700.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.300
But, be careful about the conclusions you
draw from this graph!

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.340
The median may be the observation in the middle,
but it’s not the same as average household income.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.680
That distinction goes to the mean, which is the sum
of all the values, divided by the number of observations.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.080
So in 2014, the mean household income was
$75,700.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.840
That’s a lot higher than the median!

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.920
What’s up with that?

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.980
Why is there a gap between the mean and the
median?

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.040
Well, think back to the group that the Occupy Wall
Street movement was concerned with: “the 1%”

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.099
That political label is actually a descriptive
statistic!

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.240
It describes the percent of the population
with the highest income.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:43.880
And the fact that the income of that 1% is so much
higher than the incomes of the other 99% – that’s why
we have a gap between the mean and median.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.880
And I’m not being political here; it’s
pure mathematics:

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:54.360
If you have 99 people making $50,000 per
year and 1 person making $50 million per year –
what’s gonna happen to the mean income?

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.660
It’s gonna be pulled way up by the one,
very rich person.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.980
Even though the mode – or the most common
observation in your sample – is the same as the median
income, $50,000, the mean will be over $500,000.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.800
Another type of evidence that sociologists
use is qualitative data – or information that’s not
in numerical form.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.160
Where quantitative data try to measure, qualitative
data try to illustrate, or characterize.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.940
Sometimes the information that you need
can’t, or shouldn’t, be distilled into a number in
a spreadsheet.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.040
Instead, you use descriptions of the world,
gathered through interviews, questionnaires,
and first-hand observation.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.420
Like, why do some people get married and
some people commit to a long term partnerships
without getting married?

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:35.760
Maybe some of that is quantifiable, but a lot of the
process behind making a decision like that is going to
come down to how the couple feels about marriage.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.940
And that can’t be easily stated in a statistic.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.480
There are, of course, limitations to sociology
as a positivist discipline.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.260
Not everything you want to know about society is
going to fit into observable, measurable categories.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.760
And what’s worse: I don’t know if you’ve noticed this,
but human beings are pretty unpredictable.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.560
In much of the natural sciences, the
environment in which research is done in is
completely controlled by scientists.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.880
Like, microbes in a petri dish: They’re probably
not going to develop free will and mess around with
your carefully designed experiment.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.180
But if you’re studying human behavior, you
can’t control the environment or how your
subject interacts with that environment.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:13.240
So if you’re interested in, say, the effects
of quality parenting on child development,
you can’t randomly assign babies to parents.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.020
Because, ethics. Parents apparently
want to raise their own spawn.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.560
But more than that, you might not want to
be controlling the environment so much.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.600
If you’re interested in how humans behave in the real
world, you don’t want your research methods to make
them act differently than they otherwise would.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.940
Because the fact is, subjects might change how
they behave if they know they’re being observed.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.460
For a really fun and fascinating example of
this let’s go to the Thought Bubble!

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:39.720
In the late 1920s, Austrian sociologist Elton
Mayo went to a telephone factory known as
the Hawthorne Works in Cicero, Illinois.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.820
His goal was to help the Western Electric
company figure out how to make its workers
more productive.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:50.320
So Mayo split the factory staff into groups: a control
group who kept working under the same conditions as
always, and an experimental group.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.980
For the experimental group, Mayo made a series
of changes to their working environment.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.540
He gave them different work hours, changed
up their rest breaks, even turned up the lights
on the factory floor.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.720
And lo and behold, the changes seemed to work!

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.340
The workers in the experimental group became
more productive, and absenteeism dropped.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.080
But the truth is, the changes to the physical
environment weren’t what made the difference.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.740
Yes, brightening up the room made the
workers more productive – but it turned out,
so did dimming the lights!

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.560
And so did reversing all the other changes
that Mayo made.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.640
Eventually, Mayo realized that the workers were
working harder because he was observing them.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.500
The fact that the workers knew someone was
watching how hard they worked made them want
to work harder.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.640
And this finding at the Hawthorne Works led
future researchers to be much more aware of how
their own presence influenced their findings.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.860
And to this day, the influence of an observer
on the behavior of her participants is known
as the Hawthorne Effect!

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.020
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.800
So, yes, studying humans and their behavior
scientifically can be challenging.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:48.420
But yet another problem with positivist
sociology is that not all social facts can be
applied to all people, in all time periods.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.659
In other words, truth is not always objective.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.100
It’s like when you tell someone about your
favorite book.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:59.980
If you’re trying to convince them that Harry Potter is
“objectively” the best book series ever written, then you
don’t know what the word “objectively” means at all.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.060
There is no objective truth about what the
best book is.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.980
That’s strictly subjective – an idea that’s
built on your own experiences and feelings.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.980
But as sociologists, we still find subjective
experiences to be valid, and important,

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.960
and even worth studying – even if we can’t
generalize them into some capital-T truth
about the world.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:21.500
Instead, we might be interested in how
patterns in people’s subjective experiences form
the structures that make up our social world.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:26.340
In sociology, we talk about subjectivity as
the meaning that people give their own lived
experiences.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.000
And this brings us to another way of doing
sociology:

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.360
Interpretative sociology is the study of society
that focuses on the meanings that people attach
to their social world.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:41.200
While positivist sociology is more interested in
whether a person acts a certain way – something
you can see as an outside observer –

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.780
interpretative sociology asks:
Why this behavior?

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.440
What’s the meaning behind it?

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.980
And how do people view their own actions and
thoughts?

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:55.620
Interpretative sociologists approach their subjects
with the aim of seeing the world from their subject’s
perspective, rather than through quantitative data.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.280
So, there are fewer statistics involved in
this type of research.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:03.980
Instead, interpretative sociologists often
use interviews or face-to-face interactions with
their subjects to understand the world.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:07.700
Now, there’s one more school of thought
about how the science of sociology can be
conducted.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.880
And it actually relaxes some of the
assumptions we made early on about the
objectivity of the researcher.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.060
These thinkers believe there’s plenty of room in
sociology for subjectivity – especially, for values.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.620
Values are the ideas a person has about what’s good,
and the attitudes they hold about how the world works.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.560
And curiosity about a research topic often
springs from these very values.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:31.040
Many researchers are drawn to the study of
sociology out of a desire to understand moral or
political questions about how societies work.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.260
Like, what’s the relationship between race
and poverty in the United States?

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:38.400
How can understanding that relationship help
break the connection between race and poverty?

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.480
The argument for value-driven research,
rather than value-free research, is one of the
origins of Critical Sociology,

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.600
or the study of society that focuses on
the need for social change.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:52.040
These ideas go back a long time, starting
as early as the 19th century when Jane Addams
developed the Hull House,

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:57.300
an organization that not only provided
things like housing and education to low-income
people in Chicago,

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.160
but also researched the causes of, and
solutions to, the ills of poverty.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.140
We’ll explore all of these schools of thought
throughout the rest of series.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.760
But for now, we talked about sociology as
a science.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:12.260
We discussed positivist sociology and how
sociologists use empirical evidence to explore
questions about the social world.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:17.160
And we introduced two alternatives: interpretative
sociology and critical sociology.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.280
Next time, we’re going to learn about how
sociologists actually do their research.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.520
Crash Course Sociology is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl
C. Kinney Crash Course Studio in Missoula, MT,

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.240
