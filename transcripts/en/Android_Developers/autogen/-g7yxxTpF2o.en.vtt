when we talk about businesses we talk
 

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.609
when we talk about businesses we talk
about conversion rates but we have a

00:11:06.609 --> 00:11:06.619
about conversion rates but we have a
 

00:11:06.619 --> 00:11:07.929
about conversion rates but we have a
different lens that you might not have

00:11:07.929 --> 00:11:07.939
different lens that you might not have
 

00:11:07.939 --> 00:11:09.759
different lens that you might not have
seen before because we're also the ones

00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:09.769
seen before because we're also the ones
 

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:12.129

that serve the apps so what happens

00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:12.139
that serve the apps so what happens
 

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:14.829
that serve the apps so what happens
after a user taps install well they

00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:14.839
after a user taps install well they
 

00:11:14.839 --> 00:11:16.929
after a user taps install well they
still have to download the app right so

00:11:16.929 --> 00:11:16.939
still have to download the app right so
 

00:11:16.939 --> 00:11:19.030
still have to download the app right so
we can also measure what percentage of

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.040
we can also measure what percentage of
 

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.600
we can also measure what percentage of
apps by size and actually fully make it

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:22.610
apps by size and actually fully make it
 

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.129
apps by size and actually fully make it
to the device you have a hundred percent

00:11:24.129 --> 00:11:24.139
to the device you have a hundred percent
 

00:11:24.139 --> 00:11:26.230

transfer rate and are ready for install

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240
transfer rate and are ready for install
 

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.749
transfer rate and are ready for install
and that's what this graph shows here so

00:11:28.749 --> 00:11:28.759
and that's what this graph shows here so
 

00:11:28.759 --> 00:11:31.239
and that's what this graph shows here so
you can see that as app size increases

00:11:31.239 --> 00:11:31.249
you can see that as app size increases
 

00:11:31.249 --> 00:11:33.040
you can see that as app size increases
the success of a download it drops

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.050
the success of a download it drops
 

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.400
the success of a download it drops
precipitously now this could be for a
