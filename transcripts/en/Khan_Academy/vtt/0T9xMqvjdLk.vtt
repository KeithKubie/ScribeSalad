- [Voiceover] Hello, grammarians.

00:00:01.351 --> 00:00:03.626
Today I'd like to
introduce you to the verb,

00:00:03.626 --> 00:00:05.786
which is another part of speech.

00:00:05.786 --> 00:00:08.154
But I suppose the most
fruitful place for us to begin

00:00:08.154 --> 00:00:12.984
is by asking, "What is a verb?"

00:00:14.184 --> 00:00:16.142
A verb is a part of
speech that has a bunch of

00:00:16.142 --> 00:00:19.196
different functions, but one
of its most important functions

00:00:19.196 --> 00:00:23.363
is that it can express or show action.

00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:28.363
Verbs can show action.

00:00:29.052 --> 00:00:30.933
In order to demonstrate
this, I have brought along

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.767
a little cartoon bear,

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:35.438
and I'm going to use this
bear in several sentences,

00:00:35.438 --> 00:00:37.806
each of which will contain a verb.

00:00:37.806 --> 00:00:41.846
Because all sentences contain verbs.

00:00:41.846 --> 00:00:44.075
So I'm gonna write a couple
of sentences about the bear,

00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:45.910
and every time I use a
verb, I'm gonna write it

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.000
in yellow like that.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.184
Here we go.

00:00:49.184 --> 00:00:51.061
The bear roars.

00:00:55.151 --> 00:00:57.650
The bear runs.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.741
The bear sleeps.

00:01:04.811 --> 00:01:08.768
Now, each one of these
words in yellow is a verb.

00:01:10.848 --> 00:01:13.356
Each one of them is an action,

00:01:13.356 --> 00:01:15.747
and this is the first
thing that verbs can do.

00:01:15.747 --> 00:01:18.952
Verbs can show action in sentences.

00:01:18.952 --> 00:01:22.876
And, in fact, all sentences
must contain verbs.

00:01:22.876 --> 00:01:24.408
You can learn anything.

00:01:24.408 --> 00:01:25.868
David out.
