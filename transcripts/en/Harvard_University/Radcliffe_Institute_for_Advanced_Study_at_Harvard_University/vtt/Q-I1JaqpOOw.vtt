00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.800
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.820
Thank you Judy for his
generous introduction.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.820
Because today I actually
have for the first time

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.580
the opportunity to talk
about all of the things

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.560
that you flagged you
will see Neurath up here.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.220
We will talk about
current settlements,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.730
and we'll also talk
about resistance.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.610
And of course, the
narrative and the lens

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.800
through which I
will tell the story

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.540
is Margarete Schutte-Lihotzky.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.590
So I want to thank associate
dean Judy Vichniac and Dean

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.370
Lizabeth Cohen for
the true privilege

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.370
it is to pursue writing
and research here

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.440
at Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.830
I also want to thank Associate
Director of the Fellowship

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.490
Program Sharon Bromberg-Lim
and Administrator

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.730
for Fellows, Rebecca Haley.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.980
I feel that your work really
makes us all feel at home here,

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.730
which is wonderful.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.400
One of the amazing aspects
of working here too,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.460
is working with
research partners.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.110
Elizabeth Keto,
Spencer Gillespie,

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.710
and Laura [INAUDIBLE]
are all here today.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.950
And I really want to
point out how important it

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.810
has been to work together.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.630
Elizabeth's original
and thoughtful feedback

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.820
brightens every line
of my ESL writing.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.250
Spencer always reminds me of
the big picture when we cherish

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.560
the meaning of small words.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.990
Laura Ty has added sparkle.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.120
She always does that
to presentations.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.330
She literally
illuminates my images.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.560
I also want to acknowledge
the collaboration which PhD

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.470
candidate, [? Raphael ?]
[? Kunig, ?] who is here today

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.280
as well from the Department
of Comparative Literature here

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.240
at Harvard.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.910
And Christiana Bunyan from MIT.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.240
Both of them have been
invaluable in starting

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.490
to conceive a translation
project, which is really

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.400
something foreign to me.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.110
Finally, I also
want to acknowledge

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.289
one of the things that seems
crucial about this fellowship.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.900
And that is the friendships
that have been built here.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.950
So I think that really
needs to be acknowledged

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.560
first and foremost.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.670
But here at Radcliffe,
as Judy mentioned,

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.540
I've been working on a new
project, a book in translation

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.900
project that makes
Austrian architect Margaret

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.729
Schutte-Lihotzky's 1985 German
language Erinnerungen aus dem

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:35.770
Widerstand available to
English speaking audiences.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.800
I will only do
this very shortly,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.870
but Schutte-Lihotzky
lived from 1897 to 2000.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.080
So she became 103 years old.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.840
She's arguably one of the
better known female designers

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.020
of modern architecture, and
modern architecture commonly

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.320
understood of having its
heyday in such institutions

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.480
as the Bauhaus in
Germany, though I really

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.340
want to resist such
categorizations as you

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.630
shall see.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.450
Today, Schutte-Lihotzky
however remains associated

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.960
predominantly with
a single work,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.480
that is the design of
her Frankfurt kitchen.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.870
Systematized and rationalized,
the Frankfurt kitchen indeed

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.960
became implemented
in 10,000 households

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.170
in the city of Frankfurt,
Germany in a vast undertaking

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.400
to produce modern
housing in the 1920s.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.050
Yet Schutte-Lihotzky's work life
spans more than eight decades

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.230
and includes work as a
designer, as a writer,

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.910
and as an activist.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.740
So in the beginning
of this talk,

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.310
I want to take a few minute
to discuss the larger

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.190
stake of my project and what
Memories from Resistance

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.970
raises.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.150
Memories from Resistance
follows Lihotzky's decision

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.240
to return to Austria in
1940 from relative safety

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.410
in Turkish exile to join
the communist resistance

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.980
against the Nazi
regime, as Judy said.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.180
After a month of active
work in January of 1941,

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.450
Schutte-Lihotzky was captured
by the Gestapo, together

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.870
with the head of the
Communist Party, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.890
After her seizure, she spent
more than four years interned

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.950
first in Vienna, and then
in a notorious women's labor

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.290
camp in Aichach,
Germany where she

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.690
was liberated by American
troops in the spring of 1945.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.870
First recorded as a
briefing by Americans

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.140
in the summer of
1945, her memories,

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.860
which focus on life during
internment in my view,

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.040
represent a critical
re-approach to remembering

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.190
that offers a glimpse into
the collective practice

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.490
of resistance, or what
has been characterized

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.650
as quote, "collective
opposition"

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.330
to the system in Holocaust
and resistance studies.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.350
The book, I argue, provides
significant records and facts

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.220
about the specialization
of sustained dissent,

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.700
and the experience of
collectivities of resistance.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.530
And in Schutte-Lihotzky's
case, particularly by women

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.820
that defied succumbing to the
reality of totalitarianism.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.960
Hannah Arendt reminds
us about this need

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.380
when she writes, quote, "the
conviction that everything that

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.920
happens on earth must
be comprehensible to man

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.900
can lead to interpreting
history by common places.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.050
Comprehension does not mean
denying the outrageous,

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.260
deducing the unprecedented
from precedent,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.330
or explaining phenomena by
such analogies and generalities

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.720
that the impact of reality
and the shock of experience

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.380
are no longer felt. It means
rather examining and bearing

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.880
conscious the burden which
our century has placed on us,

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.240
neither denying its existence,
nor submitting meekly

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.560
to its weight.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.480
Comprehension in short means
the premeditated attentive

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:13.080
facing up to, and resisting of
reality, whatever it may be."

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.060
Schutte-Lihotzky's
work in the resistance

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.490
could be understood
in those terms.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.670
In one of the important
passages of the book she states,

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.500
quote, "after 1945,
many people, including

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.190
some who were in no way
compromised by Nazism,

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.580
have asked me why I had
left the relative safety

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.280
of my Turkish exile to
come back to Austria.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.750
I am invariably outraged
that they would even think

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.730
of asking such a question.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.860
And time and again,
I am appalled

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.110
by a world in which
this question can

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.550
be a question at all."

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.460
So in today's
presentation, I want

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.190
to show how thinking
about this need

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.240
to face up against
reality, about building

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.200
collectivities self-consistent,
and about human solidarity,

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.610
have made me reconsider
Schutte-Lihotzky's design

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.770
work too.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.310
Although in much
subtler ways, I have

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.600
started to see her commitment
to cooperation in the efforts

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.450
to create discrete
places of dissent,

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.050
particularly for women, through
the production of objects

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.750
and architecture in
the interwar period.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.410
And that kind of leads
up to the political work.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:33.060
And I find relationships between
the experienced solidarity

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.600
among political dissidents
and the activism she engaged

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.300
in in the women's
and peace movement

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.480
aligning her ideas
about translatability

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.580
and ending exchange,
and her hopes

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.690
for a true internationalism
in the postwar years.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.730
Though in the
discussion today, I

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:55.020
seek to pivot really,
from overspent debates

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.010
about kitchens to counterspaces,
to paraphrase colleagues

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:01.770
in the feminist art and
architecture collaborative.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.810
This means discussing
spaces that

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.600
were disputed,
challenged, and liminal,

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.290
but that also opened up
room for encounter, dissent,

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.060
and ultimately, resistance.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:16.140
And sometimes that did include
kitchens as you shall see.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.860
And in addition, I
want to highlight

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.770
that studying the
variety of realms

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.950
in which Schutte-Lihotzky
worked, for me, has revealed

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.920
moments of uncovering
multiplicity,

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.390
local specificity, collectivity,
and attention to the everyday

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.150
from within the project
of modern architecture,

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.549
and against the claim
that it was aesthetically

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:41.789
doctrinaire, technologically
deterministic, culturally

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.070
homogenizing, and
at last, also failed

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.560
to deliver on the
social promises

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.990
is championed
naively envisioned.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:53.880
So I want to tell two stories
today about counterspaces

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.150
as they were designed,
as they were written,

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.100
as they were imagined.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.810
The first, on the
surface about the kitchen

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.650
will take us into
where we are now.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:07.470
And the second one is
about a book manuscript

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:12.090
that on the surface, that
would take us to Beijing

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.790
in the post-war years.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:18.290
So building co-operative
spaces for dissent.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:23.460
In 1923 Irene Witte, the head
of Berlin's Research Institute

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.310
for Labor Science
and Psychotechnology

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.640
sent a letter to Margarete
Schutte-Lihotzky.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.830
Quote, "I've worked
through your plans

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.340
meticulously, and regard
them as a critical step

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.550
in the direction of practical
household rationalization

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.740
with the road.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.320
The single law that the
science of home management

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.100
has given us, such as time,
and motion efficiency,

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.950
and material economy
are adhered to

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:53.460
in the best manner in your
cooking niche and scullery.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.900
I hope that your plans can be
extensively used and realized,

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.840
because they would be
able to alleviate somewhat

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.330
the housing shortage
we're facing almost

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.930
everywhere in the world."

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:07.410
So you see this
cooking scullery she's

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.860
talking about here on the left.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.820
The German translator of
American Home Economist,

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.460
Christine Frederick knew
housekeeping, Witte, who

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.560
was writing, had
helped published

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.230
the first substantial text
about efficiency studies

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.350
in the domestic realm in 1921.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.040
And for months, Lihotzky
studied Frederick's suggestions

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.220
in an effort to design a
small functional kitchen

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.620
for a settler house
meant to be realized

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.150
in the context of a sell help
building movement in Vienna.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.920
By 1923, the
recites of the study

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.690
were on display in Vienna.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.600
And Lihotzky had contacted
Witte for feedback

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.990
to improve the design.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.920
So now it was on display, and
she wanted to improve them.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.610
It's really a precursor
to the Frankfurt kitchen.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.330
Witte's comments echoed the
laudatory modernist credo

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.820
of functionality
and rationalization

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.180
that would only a few years
later become celebrated

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.340
in Lihotzky's Frankfurt kitchen.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.190
But proposed in the
context of a citizen driven

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.650
building and settlement
movement, the kitchen

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.360
and the entire house
is on display in fact,

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.550
were more than that.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:15.990
There were counterspaces.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:20.340
Spaces that resistance
dominant norms of living.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.620
Lihotzky had come to
the task of designing

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.550
for a citizen driven settlement
movement in Vienna in 1920.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:30.480
Working for a settlement
office whose chief architect

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.560
was prominent cultural critic,
the designer Adolf Loos.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.870
The purpose of the
newly founded office

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:40.290
was to create small row houses
for thousands of families

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.240
who had formed dispersed
allotment garden

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.780
communities during World War
I on the outskirts of the city

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.190
to support themselves
through vegetable production.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.030
I should note that
undernourishment

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.930
was a contributing cause
to 30% of deaths in Vienna

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:55.500
at the time.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:00.240
So it was really crucial to
actually farm these allotment

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.010
plots.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:03.990
Lihotzky's first
assignment became

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:06.960
to devise plans
for a co-operative.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.760
Some of them were
wounded veterans

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.460
that had squatted on the
former imperial hunting grounds

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.320
to build permanent settlements.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:17.100
And so also bear in mind,
really the appropriation

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.050
of these imperial
hunting grounds

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.660
really is a distinctive marker.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.630
After 600 years
basically, the arrival

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.120
of democracy universal
suffrage that also

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.980
puts the Social Democratic Party
in the municipal government

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.480
with an absolute majority.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.110
So this is the
political backdrop

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:39.330
against which this happens.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.880
Working from makeshift
at building the row,

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.870
Lihotzky and Loos developed
a series of row houses

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.720
that considered formal,
but also pressing

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.690
social and economic concerns.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.330
From a material
perspective, there

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.770
were designed in
wood constructions

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.560
and not typical in
Vienna, because it

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.090
allowed them to harvest building
materials cheaply and manual

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:04.450
labor on site.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:08.370
So what you see here is them
actually harvesting the forest

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:12.180
around the grounds where they
had squatted to produce housing

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:16.320
from the harvested wood.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.250
In addition, houses relied
on simplified floor plans

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.160
that lend themselves easily
to manual construction

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.790
by unskilled and sometimes
impaired workers.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:33.660
Besides, they also incorporated
allotment parts and row houses,

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.930
at least in design featured
espalier fruit to make

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:41.640
the whole building's
facade productive over all,

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.850
the design of row houses
followed Loos's principle

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:48.120
that living and sleeping should
be divided on two floors,

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.490
and that quote, "the
house should lend itself

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.350
to all later possibilities."

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:56.010
So that means it
should be able to be

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:58.440
altered due to family size.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:04.560
But I should note here that Loos
conceived of these buildings

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.470
as predominantly for
families, and predominantly

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:11.430
for families with
multiple children.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:15.960
Despite the completion of
a row of houses in 1921,

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.330
the larger scheme for
the whole facility

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.690
was dismissed by the
municipality on the grounds

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.580
of being too modern.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:27.150
And consequently,
settlers [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:30.210
opted to self build their homes.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:33.930
And I will bother you with one
architectural detail for a half

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:34.530
minute.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.290
And I won't do any
architecture tricks otherwise.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:41.247
But that one I want to explain.

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:43.080
So one of the things
that's really important

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.420
for them is to create
what are called types.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:51.310
So the houses become variable
entities of themselves.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:54.240
So here on the left,
you see a type six that,

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.540
towards the facade is
only six meters wide.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:02.070
And on the right, you see a type
9, that then consequently has

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:05.900
a similar layout, also has
similar building materials,

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.790
building elements,
but then it allows

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.990
them to create some variety.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:16.730
And that is important because
it brings down building costs

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:21.380
while not drawing
on industrialization

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.140
along the lines, or
kind of standardization

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.040
along the lines of industry.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.680
So it can be done
in manual labor.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.390
That is the point.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:35.870
Then this is the first row
of houses that was completed.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.990
And then the whole
plan of the facility

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:43.850
was dismissed as
being too modern.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:48.920
But in the absence of a
large scale building program,

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:55.130
settlers took to building
houses themselves, especially

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.550
in Lyons, as we can see here.

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:02.690
But the approach of producing
housing with limited material

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:06.810
means and a maximum use
of co-operative labor,

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:09.010
which was abandoned,
was theorized

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:13.280
more proudly and systematized
by Lihotzky's colleague

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.070
and good friend Otto Neurath.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:19.570
An economist, philosopher,
and Austria Marxist Neurath

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:23.450
in fact, unified hundred of
dispersed settlement clubs

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.510
in an umbrella
organization in 1921,

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:29.480
and embedded then in a large
tenants and construction union.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.760
Again, a tool to
bring down prices.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.860
He helped create a co-operative
municipal developer,

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.300
the so-called GESIBA,
which was charged

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.910
with the distribution
of materials

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:42.560
for the production
of settlements.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.660
Again, to bring down costs.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.840
Meanwhile, newly
devised building methods

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.410
were implemented citywide with
various sediments cooperatives

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.980
fabricating hollow brick
on site in manual labor.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.280
Again, it is distinct choice
against the implementation

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.780
of technology.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:03.660
Henceforth, all settlements
were built cooperatively

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.869
with settlers
usually contributing

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:10.280
1,000 to 3,000 hours of the
overall labor process, which

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.440
also is said to
have strengthened

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.500
their sense of community
in the settlement.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.770
All of these efforts
consciously drew on 20th century

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:19.900
Marxist debates.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.390
Neurath held for example, that
important branches of industry,

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.310
such as the
construction industry,

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:29.390
could prepare paths
towards socialization

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:33.020
in the absence of a
fully socialized economy.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.510
But he also envisioned-- and
this is important and kind

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.250
of a solid distinction--

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.410
that within the
context of scarcity,

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.530
cooperatives were
unique organizations

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:45.030
to build use value
centered economies.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:48.540
So that is what is being tested.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.610
The founding of the
GESIBA in any case,

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.340
on a much more immediate
level, provided

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.860
Lihotzky with the
opportunity to devise

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.200
a new design for
a problem she felt

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.410
had remained
unresolved at Lyons.

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:04.890
While working at the
building borough with Loos,

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:06.990
she had observed that
many people in fact,

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.900
could not always afford
the required expenses

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.920
or even commit the time to
build row houses at once.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.680
So there was really a
problem for certain families

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.090
and single people
as we shall see.

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:22.220
But she had that especially
poor seetlers should organize

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.500
as cooperatives, be able to
draw on the power of community,

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.530
and the services of the
architects they employed.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:33.270
In 1922, she therefore
designed a minimum settler hut

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.490
that provided basic
living amenities,

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:40.050
but could be expanded
to become a full house.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.890
She also helped create
a cooperative band

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.840
by hand, a cooperative
furniture store that

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.040
provided advice to settlers
and the Viennese public

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.790
more broadly.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:53.250
The outcomes of these
efforts and those

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:56.280
of hundreds of
organizations I should say,

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.910
were exhibited in 1923 during
a large allotment garden

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:01.680
settlement and housing
exhibition here,

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.200
staged in Vienna City Hall.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.800
The highlight of the show
included seven full scale model

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.100
houses, four of them
so-called core houses

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.470
designed by Lihotzky.

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:17.580
The core houses could be
built in four distinct phases,

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.940
and building elements could
be obtained at reduced rates

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.280
through the
co-operative developer.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.270
So for these minimal homes

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:28.830
Lihotzky also designed a first
fully prefabricated kitchen,

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:32.910
which we have seen in the
beginning, type furniture--

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.700
that is standard
furniture that also could

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.700
be purchased cooperatively.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.530
These services
and amenities were

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:42.780
aligned with the
idea that quote,

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.720
"housekeeping and the
habits of residents

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.840
are always at the core,
regardless of whether house

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.910
is large or small."

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:53.010
This comment naturally
points to Frederick,

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:56.250
and with this work on
household efficiency,

00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:00.760
but it also is really a critique
of the modern architecture

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.230
that she saw information
in these years.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:06.870
She followed up on the
statement, noting quote,

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.510
"the house must grow
from its inner core

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:11.850
until it reaches its
last, the facade,

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:13.870
not the other way around."

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.970
This was a distinct
critique of Loos, too,

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:21.480
who held that these designs
give too much agency to users.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.585
And he really dismissed
them publicly.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:31.320
Lihotzky then posited that core
houses provided more flexible

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.650
living arrangements for people
with a variety of family

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.860
circumstances within a
co-operative framework,

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.800
including non-nuclear
families, single people,

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.190
and young couples, as well
as elderly women, all of whom

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:48.120
had previously been completely
ignored by the settlement

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:48.870
movement before.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:58.340
Thee gutter here
marks the border

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:02.120
between a core house in
the first stage, which

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:06.320
you see on the right, and a
core house fully built outwards.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.980
So what that really does is, you
start with a tiny, tiny living

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.670
kitchen and some
sleeping arrangements,

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:16.820
and then here are some
sleeping on the first floor.

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:20.300
So this is the smallest
unit in the first phase.

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.910
And then in multiple phases
you can build outwards,

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:26.552
enlarging the house
with the spaces.

00:21:26.552 --> 00:21:28.760
On the bottom here again,
you see the living kitchen,

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.100
which was previously this.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:37.730
So it's now aggrandized, and
with multiple other learning

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.800
and sleeping
possibilities here on top.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:47.780
I also should say
that Lihotzky insisted

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.690
that this was only
an emergency measure,

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.490
and that it should
not be understood

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.050
as an ideal form of living.

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:58.970
So she really worked
hard to overcome

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.670
some of these
shortcomings in the larger

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.770
houses that were designed.

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:07.070
The close attention to
core houses living kitchen

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:11.240
and a scullery, furthermore
not only showcased attention

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.280
to everyday concerns
about housework,

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:18.050
so that is the critique
of Witte and Frederick--

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:20.600
but it proposed
simple design tricks

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.950
that could easily be
implemented in every household.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:29.120
So for example,
all of this, this

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.790
is in some way, a precursor
to the other kitchens.

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:36.150
But it pays more attention to
how vernacular kitchens were

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:40.580
built. So in all of the tiny
spaces, storage for wood,

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:44.750
and then in the next
slide we will see here

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:49.880
that, for example, this is a
bath tub that can be warmed up

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.800
with fire from below.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:56.480
And then there's a possibility
to recycle the water

00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:00.120
for washing dishes and so on.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.510
So it's really like a
scarcity based approach,

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:06.350
which she also recognized.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:10.190
The co-operative furniture
store provided services, advice,

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:12.980
and solid designs at small cost.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.560
And it highlighted women
as important bearers

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.590
of the cooperative movement,
and Viennese women over all,

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:22.320
it was open to all citizens.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.740
Quote, "how should
people with limited means

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.380
obtain good furniture?"

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.730
Lihotzky wrote in 1922.

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.220
The [INAUDIBLE] is the
cooperative response

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.410
to this question.

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:36.260
Architects will devise
new plans for furniture

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:40.370
when settlers and members
of the public need it.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:44.110
The popular press impressed
core houses at the exhibition.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:47.630
They lauded them for their
amazingly convenient designs.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:51.290
The great advantage of the
Austrian Garden City movement

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:55.130
is that houses are being
built by people themselves

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:57.350
for themselves, and
not by contractors

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:00.275
whose first objective is money,
wrote a female journalist

00:24:00.275 --> 00:24:02.700
in the [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.800
Otto Neurath, who was a chief
promoter of the core houses

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:09.920
similarly attested that they
embodied the possibility

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:14.540
of alleviating housing shortage,
even in a state of emergency

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.390
through large scale
co-operative organization.

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.190
He wrote, in severe
times of crisis,

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:23.570
core houses allow for the
construction of small dwellings

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:26.880
to continue according to
plan a series of construction

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.150
cooperatives whose building
projects could not be continued

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:33.020
have already begun the
construction of core houses

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.350
instead.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:37.100
Embedded in the larger
cooperative work

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:41.210
that emerged citywide
core houses continued

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:44.660
to build community
and provided services

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.960
to marginalized members within
the co-operative framework.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.610
These efforts of building
strong communal and cooperative

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:58.450
economies over all,
I would say can

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:03.700
be understood along [INAUDIBLE]
lines, more or less.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:07.480
As an alignment of
diverse interests really,

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:12.040
that includes the
power of politicians,

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.520
but more importantly the ideas
of a number of institutions,

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:19.150
of community institutions,
of the GESIBA, for example,

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.820
grassroots groups,
allotment gardener settlers,

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.550
groups of individuals,
and also groups

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:27.880
that have an aligned interests,
such as women's groups

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:32.200
who worked with the GESIBA
and existing stakeholders,

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:37.670
such as tenants, unions,
and leisure groups.

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:40.780
The attention to community
then, the attempt to push

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:43.600
if subtly against
gender boundaries,

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.610
and a will to
studying the everyday,

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:49.500
is what I now see in Lihotzky's
further [INAUDIBLE] work.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.860
I'll let this run for a second.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.300
So that is a
cooperative meeting.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:05.980
You will see that eventually
became a museum that showcased

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:08.380
the achievements of
the settlement movement

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.470
within the municipality
of Vienna that's

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:15.510
Neurath explaining the new
settlements to first visitors.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:19.690
So what does that mean
for the other work?

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:22.720
In Frankfurt, I should
say, Schutte-Lihotzky not

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:26.380
only designed kitchens,
but hundreds of apartments,

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.830
among them an apartment
for the single woman.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:31.960
Also, to add thousands
of women were

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.490
homeless at the turn of
the century, single women.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:40.450
Were also provisioned allotment
garden huts that opened up,

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:43.600
I would argue, a sphere for
women that was completely

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.410
detached from the household.

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:49.030
The work in the
Soviet Union, where

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:50.950
she became the head of
an independent design

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:54.130
unit devising
kindergartens, seems

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.620
on first sight, relatively
rigidly modernist,

00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:01.420
but in time, you do see kind
of an attention in her own work

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:06.370
to habits and vernacular
furniture that she found.

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:09.250
And in Turkey, where she
emigrated with her husband

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:12.250
in 1937, she developed
community centers

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:14.380
and rural educational
institutions,

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:17.230
as well as housing
for migrant women.

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:19.900
After returning
to Vienna in 1945,

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.630
the first task she took
on was the provision

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:26.200
of core houses in the
process of reconstruction.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.180
And in a new
position as president

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:31.000
of the Austrian federation
of Democratic Women, that

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.940
is the women's organization
within the Communist Party,

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:38.490
you will see that is really
where she finds her foothold.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:41.260
In terms of power, she
maintains that Austria

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:45.280
had been reconstructed by women
and should not only now fight

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.260
for fair wages,
women shouldn't but

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.870
hold steadfast
about the attainment

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:52.780
of the post-war years,
neutrality in Austria,

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:55.440
and peace in Europe.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:00.120
So the question of writing
a sort of humanizing

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.050
internationalism.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:04.740
If that can leads to that.

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.920
This book seeks to be only
a small example of how

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.650
we can learn from each
other and become closer

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.740
on the basis of
professional, scientific,

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.260
and artistic interaction
wrote Schutte-Lihotzky

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:19.770
in a book manuscript entitled
Million Cities in China

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:22.330
in 1956.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:24.840
The book was an
attempt, as she noted,

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.390
to encourage European
architects to learn

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:31.020
from the immense undertakings
in city planning then underway

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.120
in the People's Republic.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.540
Schutte-Lihotzky collected some
of those materials for the book

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:41.130
during a five-week study
excursion to China in 1956,

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:44.730
on the invitation of the Chinese
Society for Cultural Relations

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:46.220
Abroad.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:50.100
Overall, the group was
composed of scientists,

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.330
social scientists, artists,
and a humanist, seven men

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:54.210
and two women.

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:57.210
And Schutte-Lihotzky was invited
for her role as architect,

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:59.800
but also the head of the
Federation of Democratic Women,

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.850
so within the Communist Party.

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:05.670
This opportunity to
study Chinese cities

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.950
was a unique
professional opportunity

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:10.540
to be sure in the
realm of architecture

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:12.700
for Schutte-Lihotzky
at this time.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.940
In fact, finding
regular employment

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.910
in architecture in
Vienna was no small task

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:19.860
in the post-war years.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:22.680
Other colleagues were joining
the ranks of the Viennese

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.380
municipality as city
architects, advancing

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.890
despite and because of
their age and experience.

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:31.620
But against the backdrop
of Cold War divides,

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.690
the Viennese
municipality was varied

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:36.720
to employ a female communist.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.720
Former Nazis, still
in positions of power,

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.960
ostracized Schutte-Lihotzky
from the architectural community

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.970
for which she longed.

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:47.580
By the early 1950s,
the only position

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.650
that produced steady
work was the role

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:51.870
in the Federation
of Democratic Women

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:56.050
whose elected president
she'd become in 1947.

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:59.010
This work allowed her to
travel and to envision herself

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:01.320
as a political
organizer, but also

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.450
as an architectural
critic, a role

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:06.000
she admitted she felt
quite uncomfortable

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.010
with to become a writer
and a critic to comment

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:12.150
on other people's work.

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:15.720
In writing about cities
and urban life in China,

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.170
she could draw on some
previous, but very modest

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:21.600
architectural experience.

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.180
Schutte-Lihotzky had in fact,
already traveled to China

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:28.800
for two months in 1934,
so 22 years prior,

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.940
on the invitation of a Chinese
educational delegation working

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:36.840
for the nationalist government
on the Chiang Kai-Shek

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.240
and the Kuomintang,
famously later

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.730
to retreat to Taiwan with
the seizure of Beijing

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:45.540
by the Communist government.

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:47.880
The delegation had
encouraged Schutte-Lihotzky

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.770
and her husband,
Wilhelm Schutte,

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:51.600
then working in
the Soviet Union,

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:55.560
to move to Nanking to apply
their respective expertise

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.290
school and kindergarten
to sign in the context

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:02.400
of an expansive educational
modernization program.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.640
While the couple declined to
work in the Republic of China

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:10.770
permanently in 1934, I would
assume for political reasons,

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:13.440
they agreed Schutte-Lihotzky
would establish guidelines

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.140
for the design and
construction of kindergartens

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.150
and public nurseries.

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:23.650
And to present those
during the expanded trip.

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:26.590
Over several weeks
in May of 1934,

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:28.870
she traveled with the
trans-Siberian railway

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:33.040
from Vladivostok to Tokyo, and
then from Shanghai to Beijing.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.510
Then to the capital Nanjing,
Hangzhou, and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:40.840
Aside from meetings with public
officials and giving lectures,

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.390
she visited numerous
educational facilities

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:46.420
across the Republic
of China, including

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.690
already existing modern
schools and cities, as well as

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:53.110
temple schools, where most
children in rural regions

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:56.230
receive primary education.

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:58.210
In the guidelines
later submitted,

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:01.240
Schutte-Lihotzky
was adamant really,

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.320
without questioning her
role as a foreigner engaged

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.650
in a vast developmental
undertaking,

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:11.500
that no matter if an
urban or rural site,

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:14.020
it was crucial to create
spaces for small groups

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:17.380
of children, even in a
large kindergarten, at least

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.040
with one pedagogical staff.

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:23.150
So there is really kind
of a sort of homogenizing

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:25.960
of the design principles.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.510
She also gauged the
success of the construction

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:31.960
of kindergartens
based on the degree

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:35.550
of achieved systematization,
so firmly in line

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:38.270
with what other modernist
would have argued.

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:41.500
Quote, "Dear Minister of
Education Wong Shing,"

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.320
she wrote to one of the high
ranking officials in Nanjing,

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.270
"after visiting
many kindergartens

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:49.240
in various cities, I have
come to the conclusion

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.860
that it will be
necessary to review

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.990
the question of the
organization, construction,

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:55.000
and establishment
of kindergartens

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.520
in the near future,
and systematically

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.670
work through design schemes.

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:02.320
This thorough systematization
should ideally

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.690
be carried out in
the current state

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:09.790
at a time when kindergartens
are constructed on a vast scale

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:11.800
throughout the country become.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.260
Only through
systematic execution

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:17.200
of all fundamental
preparations with development

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.440
of kindergartens with
the existing means,

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.710
be truly economical."

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:25.090
Also, there is an underlying
question of systematization

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:27.600
and economics.

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:31.140
But in crucial junctures,
she veered away

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.170
from such assertions
of design expertise.

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:38.130
She existed for example,
that local architect

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:40.530
knowledgeable about
diverse regional building

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:43.140
techniques and existing
building typologies

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.935
should need all
projects, especially

00:33:45.935 --> 00:33:49.160
if kindergartens and nurseries
were conceived as types.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.400
So again, it goes back
to the systematic design.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.020
They should be attuned
to climatic conditions.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:58.210
And this is really important
because it's different.

00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:01.050
It's not only about
technology and environment.

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:03.590
It's about customs and culture.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:06.600
Quote, "the old locally
customary construction,

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.370
which is open to nature, but
protect spaces from the sun,

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:13.230
will have to form the basis
of the architectural design

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:16.440
without copying previous
styles," she wrote.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.530
Likewise, it is necessary to
avoid copying and importing

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:21.630
European and American styles.

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:23.760
Rather, it is necessary
to try to create

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.520
with existing and
climatic conditions means,

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.500
materials, and
construction methods,

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:33.210
together with the
experiences of Europe

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:39.090
and American building types
that document the free spirit

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:43.120
of future generations of China.

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:46.469
This attention to not only
climate and technology,

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:48.570
but culture and
history, is noteworthy

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:51.810
because it was not at the
impetus of other modernist

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:53.190
at the time.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:55.800
Loos had held that
improvement was never

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.380
warranted where time
and custom had already

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:01.050
found a sufficient
solution, but only

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:05.730
when technical progress had
found a more convincing answer.

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:08.520
But Schutte-Lihotzky's
view of this idea

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.340
extended to forms
of translation.

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:14.520
And a cherished cultural
customs, social life,

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.200
and everyday practice.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:20.200
As we shall see, I think
there are also limits to it.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.250
In photos indeed,
she try to gain

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:25.220
insight about the variety
of existing kindergartens,

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:28.670
but also the everyday lives
of children and young people.

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:30.500
She studied
vernacular children's

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:34.070
furniture, existing play
structures, and landscapes

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:37.870
inhabited by grandfathers,
mothers, and kids.

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:41.930
While documenting the immense
artistic achievements of China,

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:44.480
she also created a
series of images,

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.990
recording quotidian
domestic architecture.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:50.000
She paid attention
to urban street

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.430
life, as well as
landscapes, and how

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:54.830
people organized
their daily lives

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:58.040
in cities and in rural regions.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:01.790
She documented working
conditions of urban workers,

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:05.930
and those in the country,
and the role of the young

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:08.960
and the elderly in the
production of housing.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.830
Overall she was interested
in the elements and objects

00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:14.540
that shaped everyday life,
and how these elements

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.660
could potentially reconcile
modern and traditional

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:19.850
lifestyles.

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:23.210
I do think there are really
some problematic aspects here

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:26.870
that call to mind the long
entanglements of photography

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:27.860
and Orientalism.

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:31.250
And I would really like
to discuss that in the Q&amp;A

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.502
if you have thoughts.

00:36:33.502 --> 00:36:35.210
But I also want to
acknowledge that there

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:38.870
is an overarching narrative
of Chinese achievement

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:42.110
and progress that underlines
the produced documents,

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:46.710
and in particular,
the book manuscript.

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:53.130
In fact, in the second trip to
China 22 years later in 1956--

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:56.400
and both of these trips
become combined for the book--

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.660
the issue of modernity's
relationship to tradition

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.830
became a question of
urbanism at large.

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:05.340
Previously it was about
objects and architecture.

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:09.270
Visiting Beijing, Nanking,
Shanghai, Gansu, and Wuhan,

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:11.640
Schutte-Lihotzky's
photographs now

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:15.970
depict a distinct story of
Communist progress, political,

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:19.420
economic, and cultural,
doubtlessly also shaped

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:22.680
by the organization of
the trip, that pointed

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.480
to vast modernization efforts.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.150
But this is also
really hard doing.

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:31.650
Over six weeks, the group
visited construction sites

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:33.840
and large infrastructural
developments,

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:37.950
research extraction
plants, coal, petroleum.

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:41.400
Additional trips
included meetings

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:46.600
with party officials
and municipal officials.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:52.140
Here, there were multiple
meetings with housing officials

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:52.695
in Beijing.

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:59.170
Schutte-Lihotzky
also met [INAUDIBLE]..

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:03.070
Aside from documenting these
encounters, what is recorded

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:08.120
is rapid modernization, and
the production of new housing

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:11.350
a cultural, educational,
scientific institutions.

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:14.110
Once again, she spends
considerable time

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:16.600
studying spaces for
children, but now

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.690
in a large cultural
institutional network

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:23.350
that includes schools,
hospitals, factory nurseries.

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:25.450
She did those
modernization efforts

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:28.780
with prefabricated elements
and traditional construction

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:30.520
techniques.

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:35.140
But what she also does-- and
I think that is something

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.060
in the future work that I
would like to theorize a little

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:38.560
more--

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.840
she translates modern
and traditional

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:43.990
architectural
vocabularies into what

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:46.975
she sees as this unique form
of language to has emerged.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:53.140
Having studied the
colonial oppression

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:55.420
by Western powers
in China, admittedly

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:59.740
through a distinctly communist
lens, Schutte-Lihotzky by 1956,

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:03.610
now is careful to point to
China's intrinsic history

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:05.100
of modernization.

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.420
And twelve lectures
after the trip,

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.520
and in the eventual
book manuscript,

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:13.270
she arrives at a thesis, if
not completely made explicit,

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:15.760
that China had always
been modern, and thus,

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.700
unique position to reconcile
tradition and modernity.

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.860
That is what she
writes in the book.

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:25.090
Tall walls are part and
parcel of Chinese urbanism,

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:27.280
but they were not
zigzagged garrisons.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.400
So she actually
kind of compares it

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.570
to European history, which
she dismisses, but perfectly

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:37.570
perpendicular orientation
systems that regulated

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:41.080
and systematized the
interior life of the city.

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.500
Domestic architecture, she
adds in the written account,

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.560
follows the pattern
on a smaller scale.

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:50.140
The courtyard topology of
the domestic architecture

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.920
of the hutongs allows for
social and communal life

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.450
to grow and reinvent
itself over generations.

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:59.110
And she provides a
number of design schemes

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:01.600
where she seeks
to understand how

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:07.420
families grow within the
constraints of the hutongs.

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:10.810
Being distinctly urban,
it sheaths the family

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:15.130
from public view, while allowing
people to shape the city.

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:17.320
In the eventual
book manuscript, she

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:21.840
considers Beijing's urban
domestic architecture--

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.390
the hutongs-- it's
kind of sort of types.

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:28.720
These types, she
says however, had not

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:32.200
arrived in the present at the
hand of a number of architects.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.300
But they had
developed over time,

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.390
based on the ingenuity of
designers, of craftsmen,

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:39.040
of builders, and inhabitants.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:44.470
So it really supersedes
what she feels

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:49.300
they had achieved in all
the previous employments.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.010
They are extensive
and significant works

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:53.590
of art historians and Chinese
architecture and specialized

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:55.690
literature, she writes
in the introduction

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:57.920
to Cities of Millions in China.

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.280
But there are hardly
any works written

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.700
from the point of view of the
architect or the city planner,

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.970
who today has to make decisions
about the future development

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:08.350
of big cities.

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:10.630
Work that shed light on
urban planning, but also

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:13.510
the way of life of Chinese
people, in the context

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:16.990
of current social and economic
realities, in the context

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:20.230
of rapidly advancing changes
in social life, in the life

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:22.480
of women, of families,
and in the context

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.430
of great industrialization.

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:26.530
In short, with the
current transformation

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:28.790
of the entire country.

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:31.180
However, this is
especially necessary

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:35.020
if one wants to have an overview
of the task of urban planning,

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.960
and to do so in such a
way that these views can

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:42.481
be instructive and fruitful
for our work in Europe.

00:41:42.481 --> 00:41:46.120
It has previously been remarked
that Schutte-Lihotzky somewhat

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:49.870
naively believed in both the
transformational potentials

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:57.470
of Communist ideas, even as
the limits became more clear.

00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:00.760
It's important to keep in
mind that the manuscript was

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:03.910
completed in 1956.

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:08.740
A unique moment five years
after the Communists and Mao had

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:11.560
ceased power, but
two years before

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:14.880
what is still euphemistically
called the Great Leap Forward,

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.050
and more than a
decade before the peak

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:19.300
of the cultural revolution.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.910
So Schutte-Lihotzky
found herself

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:25.360
in an already radically
altered politically altered

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:30.430
China, but in which some
of the repressive extents

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:32.290
were not completely known.

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:35.020
It is estimated that during
the Great Leap Forward,

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:38.920
alone 50 million people were
killed or died from starvation.

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:43.270
That is not even to speak of
forced rural collectivization,

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:45.550
which did exist when
Schutte-Lihotzky visited

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:47.990
in 1956.

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:51.160
So we might ask
the question, how

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:53.860
somebody who resisted
totalitarianism

00:42:53.860 --> 00:43:00.770
accepted the normalization
of dehumanisation elsewhere.

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:02.330
So in conclusion,
I want to offer

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:06.830
three final thoughts on
this last contradiction, not

00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:09.950
answers, but maybe
more questions.

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:12.650
What kind of resistance?

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:14.790
And also what kind
of solidarity?

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:17.150
What kind of feminism
can we see here?

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:25.590
At least since the publication
of feminist Marxist analysis,

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:28.600
such as Nicole Cox and
Silvia Federici's essay

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:32.340
Counter Planning from the
Kitchen Waitress for Housework,

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.070
it has become clear that
especially the most lauded

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:39.540
aspects of Schutte-Lihotzky's
work in architectural history

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:41.880
has been criticized.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:46.340
They write without
very much in 1977,

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:49.470
that schools,
nurseries, and day cares

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:52.800
have taken away from mothers
much of the socialization

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.980
of their children, and that
the decrease in house size

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:57.900
and the mechanization
of housework

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:00.810
has meant that the housewife
is potentially left

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:02.770
with much greater leisure time.

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:05.430
So that has been dispelled
that that is not true.

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:12.460
Yet I think I've
tried to argue here

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:15.300
that architecture history
has until now, really

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:19.680
incorrectly overemphasized
rationalization and tailorism.

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.660
And it's kind of
been my attempt here

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:25.190
to show that the spaces and
services that Schutte-Lihotzky

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:29.040
helped build first in a
co-operative framework,

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:33.390
encouraged the advancement of
women within that framework,

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:36.110
encouraged solidarity.

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:40.110
Cox and Federici
acknowledged such aspects

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:41.940
within their fury
of wage struggle

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:46.350
when they write, quote, "wage
struggles take many forms,

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:48.690
and is not confined
to wage raises.

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:52.160
Reduction of work time and
more and better social services

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.540
are wage gains."

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.840
But they also acknowledge
that only wages for house work

00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:01.710
really opened up a perspective
of conceiving quote,

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:04.830
"women's work in the
home within the struggle

00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:08.040
of the overwhelming majority
of the world's population,

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.920
millions of women and
men in fields, kitchens,

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:14.070
prisons who are wageless.

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:21.540
So, solidarity, how can we know
other structure in the world?

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.790
In his Pedagogy
of the Oppressed,

00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:25.980
Paulo Freire
provides ideas that I

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:32.820
find useful in discussing
the question of solidarity.

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:35.010
When he says persons
should not be

00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:39.120
afraid to confront, to listen,
to see the world unveiled.

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:44.460
But he continues, so the person
is not afraid to meet people

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.530
or to enter into
dialogue with them.

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:49.920
He does not consider himself
the proprietor of history

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.830
or of men or the liberator
of the oppressed,

00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:55.470
but he does commit
himself within history

00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:57.570
to fight at their side.

00:45:57.570 --> 00:46:02.040
He adds, while both
humanisation and dehumanization

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:07.920
are real alternatives, only the
first one is man's vocation.

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:11.740
Which brings me back to our rant
and the question of resistance.

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:15.390
Here, I have to admit that
the diagram I showed you

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:21.710
in the very beginning of this
talk that women in internment.

00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:24.000
It set quite
uncomfortably with me

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.280
for a long time because of
it's innocuous appearance.

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.380
It felt normalized.

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:34.490
But today, I think
it indeed does

00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:37.410
perform another type of labor.

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:44.300
It is to normalize I think not
oppression, but resistance.

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:47.650
[APPLAUSE]
