ANDY CAVATORTA
(VOICEOVER): They say

00:00:02.467 --> 00:00:03.500
that every new
technology has some

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.834
potential military application.

00:00:04.834 --> 00:00:08.200
But I like to think that
most new technologies

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.033
seem to have musical
possibilities

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:12.266
and applications also.

00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.233
[music playing]

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:18.734
For about 300
years, the pipe organ

00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:22.367
was the most complex thing
that human beings were making.

00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:24.433
So it was the pinnacle
of technology.

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:27.367
And if you were
living in the 1700s

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:28.800
and you were some
sort of genius,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.633
you couldn't engineer
microchips or a spacecraft.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:36.100
But you could work
on pipe organs.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.734
The type of art that
I make involves sound

00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:41.467
and it involves machinery.

00:00:41.467 --> 00:00:44.266
And I do both of those things
together because I'm really

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:47.033
fascinated by this
experience where objects

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:48.967
appear to have this inner life.

00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:51.867
The dervishes is the name
for a musical instrument.

00:00:51.867 --> 00:00:55.767
It has 14 large spinning
sort of wing-like arms.

00:00:55.767 --> 00:01:00.433
And each arm has a corrugated
plastic tube on it.

00:01:00.433 --> 00:01:01.934
And the tubes are of
different diameters,

00:01:01.934 --> 00:01:03.867
and I cut them to different
lengths to tune them.

00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:07.433
There are big motors, and
they have sensors on the back

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:09.867
to show exactly where they're
pointing so we can measure

00:01:09.867 --> 00:01:11.467
their position and their speed.

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:15.667
And all that is hooked up to
a big stack of software that

00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:17.834
controls the voltages
going into the motors

00:01:17.834 --> 00:01:20.767
to bring them to very,
very specific speeds.

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:24.066
At certain levels of
energy, it will play

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.900
in different sort of modes.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.033
One of them is its
fundamental mode

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:30.934
where you have one
long sound wave that

00:01:30.934 --> 00:01:32.333
goes the whole length of it.

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:35.867
And you go a little faster
and it will double up

00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:37.500
into two sound waves like this.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.600
And you go a little faster
and it will go into three.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.667
And they go up through what
they call the harmonic series.

00:01:44.734 --> 00:01:47.467
So when it comes to new
sort of musical expression,

00:01:47.467 --> 00:01:50.600
there's this constant churn
in human history of wanting

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.166
to come up with
newer forms of music

00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:54.467
and newer forms of expression.

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:56.800
There's this desire to
always be inventing.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.834
But oftentimes, we're
also telling old truths.

00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:01.333
But we always want to
say them in a new way

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:04.700
because the world around
that music from 500 years ago

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.433
has changed.

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:10.300
So the pyrophone I built because
I wanted to actually hear

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.300
what a pyrophone sounds like.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.200
It's a very, very
unusual instrument,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.567
but I didn't invent it.

00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:17.600
There are photos of this
beautiful instrument

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.033
full of glass tubes
with a little keyboard--

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:23.800
a stately sort of portly man
with a handlebar mustache,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.266
of course, playing it.

00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:27.734
And I understand
what the concept is.

00:02:27.734 --> 00:02:29.934
He has gas flames
inside these tubes.

00:02:29.934 --> 00:02:33.600
The tubes are set to different
lengths and different diameters

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.367
to help create different
timbres and different pitches,

00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:40.200
similar to an organ on a
smaller scale, except the thing

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.300
that actually vibrates in
this case is the flame.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.100
And it's a very different sound.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.033
It's sort of like if
you had a whale fronting

00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:50.900
for a death metal band.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.734
[music playing]

00:02:58.867 --> 00:03:01.567
The work that we were doing
on it here in my studio

00:03:01.567 --> 00:03:04.300
was to use robotic
technologies-- little stepper

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.934
motors and little
measurements of about exactly

00:03:05.934 --> 00:03:08.834
how far they've gone-- and
carefully measure the ranges

00:03:08.834 --> 00:03:11.400
in each tube and where
the timbres change,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.300
how you get different
harmonics at different heights.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.133
And so that's a bunch
of the new research.

00:03:18.133 --> 00:03:21.367
So what happens next is
that we're going to have

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:22.867
music that's interactive.

00:03:22.867 --> 00:03:25.500
And we're going to have
music that is at least

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.433
partially if not
completely generated

00:03:27.433 --> 00:03:29.400
by artificial intelligences.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.667
And it's going to exist in
spaces that are somewhere

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:34.166
between the physical
world that we live in now

00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:36.400
and the virtual universe.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.967
I hope that music continues
to play a really powerful role

00:03:39.967 --> 00:03:44.333
in shaping society and in how
we figure out what is true

00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:46.200
and what's meaningful.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.633
