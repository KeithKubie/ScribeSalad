00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's try our hand at interpreting function definitions.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'll do the first part, you fill in the rest.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In JavaScript, function definitions are top level elements of a JavaScript program.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
They're not statements and they're not expressions,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so we're going to have a new evaluation function, evaluate elements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Here's the abstract syntax tree for the element, here's the current environment.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
As usual, we get the type of our tree node by looking at part 0.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If it's a function definition, then we're going to pull out the function name,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the function parameters, the function body,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and then we're going to make up a function value out of that.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It's going to be a for tuple, and then we're going to add that to the environment.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Fill in each one of these 4 blanks so that the code works correctly,

00:00:39.000 --> 09:59:59.000
so that we return the right sort of function value and then add it to the environment.
