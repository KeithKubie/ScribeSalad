ANDREW ELLIOTT:
Thank you very much.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.720
Thanks.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.220
Yes.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.160
Yes, I'm-- I'm Andrew Elliott.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.110
And I've worked
all my life in jobs

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.280
that have required a
certain degree of numeracy,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.720
so a lot of stuff in IT, a
lot of stuff in insurance.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.340
And I've always regarded
myself as a numerate person.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.020
And I suppose this whole project
came about from frustration

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.500
at seeing the way numbers
are handled in the media,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.470
and in politics, and in
public life in general.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.800
And it seemed to me that it sets
your teeth on edge sometimes

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.049
some of the stuff you hear
and you read in the way

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:47.090
that numbers are handled.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.180
And sometimes it's
matters of subtlety

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.990
in the way in which the
things are presented.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.760
Sometimes it's very, very basic.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.640
Sometimes it's just a question
of people not understanding

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.920
what the scale of a
certain problem is.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.330
And small issues get magnified.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.240
Large issues get minimized.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.540
And it got me to thinking that
sometimes the question that

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.370
just needs to be
asked and answered

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.110
is, is that a big number?

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.360
And so I, as one does these
days, I set up a website.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.190
And the website had
one function only.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.000
And that is it's a
single input field.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.540
You can type in a number and
press a button that says,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.220
is this a big number?

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.530
And it goes and it compares
it to a whole bunch

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.750
of reference numbers that
it's got in a database.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.640
And it comes back
and says, yes, it's

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.697
10 times the diameter of
Jupiter or something like that.

00:01:39.697 --> 00:01:41.780
All it does is it goes
back, retrieves the number,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.780
and brings up some pleasant
entertaining comparisons.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.350
But doing that work made me
think about the way in which we

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.600
regard numbers, the way in
which we relate to numbers,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.060
the way in which we understand
numbers and big numbers

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.380
in particular.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.070
And thinking about
it, I started writing

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.050
some of this down, and hence
the book which you see here.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.770
So today is all about numbers.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.600
It's not maths.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.210
It's about numbers and
the way in which we think

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.270
about and relate to numbers.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.724
I mean you guys, Google,
you're the masters of big data.

00:02:18.724 --> 00:02:21.140
But today I want to talk a
little bit about what you could

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.050
do with just a
little bit of data,

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.100
and not with high tech
processing of data

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.141
but just the stuff that
you've got in your heads,

00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:28.850
just thinking about
numbers, and thinking

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.260
about how we relate to numbers,
and how we understand numbers.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.580
So how numbers help us
understand the world.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.330
Now you may think I'm
being metaphorical there,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.990
but I'm not.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.781
I'm going to start off
by literally talking

00:02:40.781 --> 00:02:43.160
about the size of the Earth.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.840
And I was always told that
when you do a talk like this,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.256
you start with the
ancient Greeks.

00:02:47.256 --> 00:02:50.364
Well, there's your ancient
Greek Eratosthenes.

00:02:50.364 --> 00:02:52.280
Now you may know him
because of his connection

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.710
with prime number.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.000
Eratosthenes had a simple
way of filtering out

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.940
the compound numbers leaving
behind only the prime numbers.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.020
But he was much more than that.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.270
He was, in fact, the third chief
librarian at the famous library

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.000
of Alexandria.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.670
And put yourself
in his position.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.210
He's there.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.600
This is a relatively
recent institution

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.130
being founded
after the conquests

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.460
of Alexander the Great, 200 BC.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.850
The scope of the
world- his world

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.040
has expanded because of this.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.990
And he's dealing with
new information coming

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.772
in from all over the place.

00:03:28.772 --> 00:03:30.730
And he's trying to
assimilate this information.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.630
He's trying to manage it.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.250
He's trying to pull it
into a form of a framework.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.190
He's trying to aggressively
collect this information

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.135
and deal with it.

00:03:41.135 --> 00:03:44.990
Does that sound familiar
at all to you guys?

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.980
So there he is.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.990
He's running the
Library of Alexandria.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.700
And he's trying to make
sense of the world.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.960
And he's using
numbers to do this.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.700
Now that's a map
that he made, or it's

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.160
a reproduction of a map that
he made, of his known world.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.150
And he's known as the parent
of scientific geography.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.530
And while we may
look at that map

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.680
and think that's a
little bit dodgy,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.340
it represents only about an
8% of the globe as we know it.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.480
And it's seriously deficient
when you get down to the south.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.630
You'll find that that word
over there on the bottom

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.199
says equator.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.220
And he runs out at round about
India over to the right there.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.680
And let's forget about
what's going on to the west.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.982
But that was his known world.

00:04:31.982 --> 00:04:34.190
But there's a lot that's
going on there that's right.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.020
So you can see around
the Mediterranean basin

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.835
there are some familiar
shapes there, this stuff.

00:04:37.835 --> 00:04:39.668
I mean, put yourself
in this guy's position.

00:04:39.668 --> 00:04:41.480
He doesn't have surveys.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.400
He doesn't have
telecommunications.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.050
He doesn't have
measuring devices.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.570
He's building this from stories.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.560
And the thing that
he introduced here

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.600
are these lines of
latitude and longitude.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.400
So what he's doing
is he's using numbers

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.950
to put these things
into the right place.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.420
Now the two points that are
particularly of interest here,

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.420
that's where he is in Alexandria
there on the Nile Delta.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.730
And down below,
down south there's

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.382
a place called Syene,
which is, if you

00:05:11.382 --> 00:05:12.840
can read the word
that says tropic,

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.390
it's on the Tropic of Cancer.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:21.660
And that means that that, on
the summer solstice in Syene,

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.760
the sun would have
been overhead.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.680
So that is what he used
to measure the earth.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.510
Now that's not Eratosthenes.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.740
That's Carl Sagan.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.970
But he's showing you the
technique Eratosthenes used.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.680
So you can see they're in
Syene there is a column.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.930
And there in Alexandria
there's a column.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.670
Now when the sun is
directly overhead

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.410
in Syene on the summer solstice,
the column casts no shadow.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.460
The sun shines directly down
a web shaft-- a web shaft--

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.360
a well shaft, whereas
in the same day,

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.527
in Alexandria, there is a
shadow that's being cast.

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:02.610
Now this is because of the
curvature of the earth,

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:03.510
of course.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.370
And that let him calculate
the size of the Earth.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.140
Geometry.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.110
Of course, it comes
from the Greek.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.710
Everything comes from the
Greek-- well, not everything.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.040
But it's a measurement
of Earth or land.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.150
So he's measuring the earth.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.620
The unit he's using
are feet, podes.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.900
And if you like foot
traces, a stadion

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.050
was the length of a stadium.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.174
And it's around 200
meters in today's terms.

00:06:30.174 --> 00:06:32.090
And he had a measurement
there from Alexandria

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.896
to Syene of 5,000 stadia.

00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:39.770
If I look on Google Maps, I
see that's approximately 850

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:40.420
kilometers.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.990
So you can get the equivalency.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.170
And of course, we understand
geometry in a different way

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.822
as well, as shapes,
and scales, and sizes.

00:06:52.822 --> 00:06:54.530
And so there's a bit
of geometry for you.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.610
There's some parallel lines
coming in, the rays of the sun.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.870
In the southern
location in Syene,

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.420
you can see that it's falling
directly in line with a column

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.130
there.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:08.480
Up in Alexandria, there's
a shadow being cast.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.580
And if you remember your
geometry from school,

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.250
that angle there must be
the same as the angle there.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.690
So if he measures the
angle in Alexandria,

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.840
he can work out what
proportion of the circle

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.270
of the earth that represents.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.641
And he measured it to be 1/50th.

00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:27.140
Multiply the two
together and you've

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:34.200
got 250,000 stadia, in our
terms about 42,500 kilometers.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.230
Now that's pretty accurate.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.260
For the time, and
for the techniques,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.275
that's very accurate.

00:07:40.275 --> 00:07:41.900
And there are a couple
of things I just

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.080
wanted to point out here.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.760
One is that he's using very
simple mathematics to do this.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.090
There's only a few data
points that he needs.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.300
Secondly, he's
got a big picture.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.410
He's got a view of
what's going on.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.650
He's got a concept of
what's going on here that he

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.009
can put those numbers into.

00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:01.550
And the third thing
I want to mention

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.860
is quite a subtle
point in a way.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.800
We saw his map of the known
world, 8% of the globe.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.860
So that was all that
he knew about in terms

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.260
of places, and peoples,
and things like that.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.580
But he also knew that the
world was that much bigger.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.935
So he knew how much
he didn't know.

00:08:19.935 --> 00:08:21.560
And I think that's
an interesting thing

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.440
to think about.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.960
Now we jump forward
some 1,600 years

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.799
to a fellow called
Toscanelli in Florence.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:33.799
He's also an astronomer.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:34.909
He's also a mathematician.

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:35.809
He's also geography.

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:38.929
He was one of the guys
behind the development

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:43.429
of the mathematical theory of
perspective in the Renaissance.

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:47.520
He was involved in the building
of the Duomo in Florence.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.980
And he's also dealing with
a flood of new information,

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.900
because this is after Marco
Polo's voyages to the Far East.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.090
And in fact, he spoke
to the first merchant

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:00.910
after Marco Polo, a guy
called Niccolo de Conti.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.620
And he got stories
from this guy.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.350
And he was also trying to
assimilate this information

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.670
and pull it together.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:10.290
And he too made a map.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.250
And when he looked at his map,
and when he thought about this,

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:17.056
he was convinced that you could
reach east by sailing west.

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:17.680
And guess what?

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.930
He sent that map to Columbus.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.570
And it's a map that
Columbus relied upon.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.280
Now there in orange you can
see what his map looked like.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.430
And behind it you can see
what the reality looks like.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.200
And I think you can
see the problem.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.940
He thought that the ocean
between Europe and the east

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.830
was about 130
degrees of the globe.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.669
In fact, it's about 210 degrees.

00:09:41.669 --> 00:09:43.210
There was a whole
chunk of Earth that

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:46.070
was missing as far
as he was concerned.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.450
And of course, the
rest is history.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:52.420
Columbus ended up
in the new world

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.330
as he thought of
it at that time.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:59.780
And in fact, that's
what Toscanelli wrote.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.132
The ocean to be
crossed is not great.

00:10:02.132 --> 00:10:03.590
Therefore by bringing
up at Antilia

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.650
the Asiatic character
is easily reached.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:08.680
Well, numbers make a difference.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.110
Yeah.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.950
So Eratosthenes around 40,000.

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.780
Toscanelli and Columbus we're
working to around 30,000,

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.270
25% difference.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:24.020
Now it's easy to
romanticize this and think

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:28.072
of the wise old ancient being
the guy who got it right.

00:10:28.072 --> 00:10:30.530
But you've got to admit there's
some dodgy numbers floating

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:34.790
around there, the 5,000
stadia exactly, the 1/50th

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.790
of the globe exactly.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.790
You know, maybe
he had got lucky.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.297
But still he got the right
answer, or something close

00:10:42.297 --> 00:10:43.130
to the right answer.

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.110
So there's that to be said.

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:51.640
Now if we look at what the
actual measurements are,

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.010
we get two numbers there,
one around the equator, one

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.020
over the poles that
are slightly different,

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.080
but they're both very, very
close to 40,000 kilometers.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.120
And you may think, well,
that's a bit dodgy.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.700
That's a bit close
to a round number.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.750
And of course, you'd
be absolutely right.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.500
And that comes from
the original definition

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:14.480
of the meter, which is one
ten millionth of the distance

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.389
from the pole to the
equator along the line going

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:19.430
through Paris, of course.

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.460
And now we start
getting into numbers

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.310
that are not to
do with body parts

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.567
and how long you can walk.

00:11:30.567 --> 00:11:32.900
You're talking about measuring
the globe and a numbering

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:37.760
system that's derived from
scientific measurements.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.222
And we start getting into what
we might call big numbers.

00:11:41.222 --> 00:11:42.680
I'm just going to
take a moment now

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.638
to think about what do
we mean by a big number.

00:11:44.638 --> 00:11:48.000
What makes a big number?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.180
40,000 kilometers around the
world, 350 million, a number

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.470
we've heard about a lot
in this last few years,

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:59.750
but very seldom is it
asked, is that a big number?

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.760
7 and 1/2 billion
people in the world.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.100
Is that a big number?

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.720
And I think there's a gap in
our society in our understanding

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.699
and the way we think
about numbers here.

00:12:10.699 --> 00:12:11.490
So we go to school.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:12.448
We learn about numbers.

00:12:12.448 --> 00:12:13.430
We learn to count.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:16.400
We learn about bigger
numbers that that.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.330
We go into hundreds.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.580
We go perhaps into thousands.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.380
We become very
familiar with numbers

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.890
in a fairly limited range.

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.050
And there's an example.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:32.930
Highest ever single innings test
cricket score, 952 runs for 6

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:34.870
declared.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:39.290
That's India versus Sri
Lanka, Colombo 1997.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:42.110
And I can imagine that
number building up.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.027
I can imagine sitting
and watching that match.

00:12:44.027 --> 00:12:45.860
And there'd be a six,
and there'd be a four,

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.510
and there'd be a
couple of singles.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.250
And slowly that number
would accumulate.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:53.390
I can grasp that process
that takes me to that number.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:55.307
But it's almost
slipping away from me.

00:12:55.307 --> 00:12:56.390
It's almost slipping away.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.541
It's a big number
in those terms.

00:12:59.541 --> 00:13:01.040
And now you have,
on the other side,

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.777
you have these young
scientists working in the lab.

00:13:03.777 --> 00:13:06.110
And for them, a big number
may be a very different thing

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.860
entirely.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.250
They may be thinking or taught
about Avogadro's number,

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:14.270
6.02 times 10 to the
23, the number of moles,

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:18.770
the number of carbon-12
atoms in 12 grams of carbon.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.590
That's a very big number.

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.280
600 billion trillion.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.460
And when I start saying
billions and trillions,

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.010
I've got to be careful
not to trip over my words,

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:30.980
because this is where
confusion comes in.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.650
And of course,
the scientists use

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:35.270
that notation,
scientific notation.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.154
And that's fine.

00:13:36.154 --> 00:13:37.320
They learn those techniques.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.290
They learn those algorithms
for working with those numbers.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.400
And everything is fine.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.039
But not everybody
thinks in those terms.

00:13:46.039 --> 00:13:48.080
And not all numbers are
expressed in those terms.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.130
And in between those
two, there is a gap.

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:54.560
And we're talking about numbers
that relate to government,

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.130
numbers that relate to
corporations, and resources,

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.080
and populations.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.980
And these numbers are
beyond the thousands.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.960
They're into the millions,
billions, trillions.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.850
And you know, I have to
watch myself even now

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:09.800
talking to you not
to say billion when

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.170
I mean million or trillion.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:15.240
And it's confusing.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.980
And I don't think any of
us really grasps numbers

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.330
very well in that gap.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.779
We've got a good understanding
of small numbers.

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:25.070
We've got techniques for
dealing with very big numbers.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.320
But those are only techniques.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.090
It's not really a relationship
with those numbers.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.480
But in the middle, there
are some important numbers.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.060
They're important because we're
called upon to make decisions

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:38.430
based upon those numbers.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.420
So what I'm going to do
today is really try and just

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:44.270
focus on one of those
numbers, the global population

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:47.630
there, the last
of those, and just

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:53.592
try and bring that to life
for you in a simple way.

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:55.830
We're going to start by
saying how big is a billion.

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:57.740
Well, we all know
how big a billion is.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:02.000
It's a thousand million
since 1974 in this country.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.375
You know, 10 to the
9, 1 with nine zeros,

00:15:04.375 --> 00:15:05.860
however you want to out it.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.690
We all know what a billion is,
but can we imagine a billion?

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:11.600
Can we conceive of a billion?

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.170
We're going to get there.

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.170
We're going to start with
how big is a thousand.

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:17.450
I wanted to make this
come to life for myself.

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:18.950
So I phoned up my
kid at university.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.770
And I said, can I
play with your Lego?

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:23.390
And I started
building a Lego strip.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:24.140
There you go.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.460
That's the start of it.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.880
10 yellow, 10 white,
10 yellow, 10 white,

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:33.680
trying to build a strip
1,000 Lego studs long.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.770
Two wide, of course, because
that's how Lego comes.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.539
And there it goes.

00:15:38.539 --> 00:15:40.580
I'm going from outside
the house, into the house.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.270
You can see my toe sticking
into the picture there.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:44.180
And so I go.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.440
And so I build that strip.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.540
And you can see
right in the middle

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.960
there I put a little red
brick just to mark the point.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.216
There is another view of it.

00:15:53.216 --> 00:15:54.590
Now forgive me
for flogging this,

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:58.070
but I'm just trying to
put this in context.

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:02.330
I'm just trying to give you a
visible idea of what a thousand

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.980
looks like compared to one
in-- a 1,000 to one ratio.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.280
And there's the whole thing.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.220
And as you can see,
I've numbered that up

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.164
to prove it to myself.

00:16:12.164 --> 00:16:14.330
And there's a little brick
in the middle to show you

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.440
the one compared to thousands.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:21.410
Now it's also the length
of the River Nile compared

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:25.490
to the Oxford, Cambridge
boat race, 6,800 kilometers

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.080
versus 6.8 kilometers.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.210
It's also the height
of Kilimanjaro compared

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.830
to a pole vault record.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:32.450
It's also the height
of Niagara Falls

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.460
when measured in pool balls.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:39.221
So just trying to give
you some feel for--

00:16:39.221 --> 00:16:42.890
a 1,000, we treat it so lightly.

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:44.180
We dismiss it so easily.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.980
But it's actually
quite a big number.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.550
If you look at your
screen, one in 1,000

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:53.090
is maybe one or two
pixels across your screen.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:56.370
A thousand is a big number.

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.749
But we're going to build
up to a billion now.

00:16:58.749 --> 00:17:00.290
To build big, we
need to start small.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.248
So we're going to start
with a tiny little ant.

00:17:02.248 --> 00:17:04.300
It's just a four
millimeter ant there.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.690
And that's our starting point.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.689
But we're going to now
need to step to something

00:17:07.689 --> 00:17:08.849
a little bit bigger.

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:11.221
Maybe we want a Beetle.

00:17:11.221 --> 00:17:13.849
And there's your Beetle.

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:17.839
And just luckily that happens
to be about 1,000 times bigger

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:19.220
than the ant here.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:23.180
So imagine a thousand ants lined
up alongside that Volkswagen

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.460
Beetle.

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.099
Now in another step, what's
going to be 1,000 times bigger

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:29.660
than a Beetle?

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:33.500
Well, it turns out that Central
Park isn't a bad choice.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.360
Just over four kilometers.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:39.110
And very conveniently,
it's set in a place

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.100
where they number the streets.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.786
So there are 50 street
blocks there from--

00:17:43.786 --> 00:17:44.870
what's the time?

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.870
60th to 110th Street.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.140
That makes 80 meters per block.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:55.100
And you can imagine 20 Beatles
on each block of New York

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.890
bumper to bumper jammed up all
along Central Park West there.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.950
A 1,000 cars.

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:03.440
And perhaps you can
imagine each of those cars

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.990
has got 1,000 ants next to them.

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:08.821
So now you've got a
million ants going there.

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:09.320
OK.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.070
So far, so good.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.900
What's 1,000 times
bigger than Central Park?

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.380
Turns out Australia
is not a bad guess.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.950
It's just over 4,000
kilometers east to west.

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:25.310
Google Maps coming
to our rescue there.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:28.990
So that's 1,000 Central Parks
stretching across Australia

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:31.650
coast to coast.

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:33.520
It's a million beetles.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.420
And it's a billion ants.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:39.890
So a billion ants
to cross Australia.

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:43.310
But I can't resist going
one step further and closing

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.630
the circle here.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:47.465
Because if we know that
4,000 kilometers is

00:18:47.465 --> 00:18:49.490
the width of
Australia, we also know

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.490
that 40,000 is the equator.

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.305
So 10 billion is
going to take you

00:18:55.305 --> 00:19:00.770
a line all around the
world circling the earth.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.720
A little deviation here.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.480
How fast can we
circle the earth?

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:15.670
Now I don't know how good
your literature knowledge is,

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:21.040
but there's an
itinerary from a book.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.655
And we're going from the London.

00:19:22.655 --> 00:19:24.755
We're going via Hong Kong.

00:19:24.755 --> 00:19:26.005
We're going via San Francisco.

00:19:26.005 --> 00:19:28.240
We're ending up back in London.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.640
And the giveaway, of course,
is the title there of 80 days.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.720
So this is the planned
itinerary in Jules Verne's book

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.460
"Around the World in 80 Days."

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.000
That's how Phileas Fogg
planned to get around the world

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.550
and how he calculated that
he could make it work.

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:45.810
I found a map of the
route that he took.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.850
And two things that are
interesting about that to me.

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:57.020
One is that it's by no means
a straight line or even

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.660
a great circle.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.680
He's having to do a fair
bit of zigzagging especially

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.660
around about
Southeast Asia there.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:10.190
And secondly, it's
actually almost entirely

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:11.990
in the northern hemisphere.

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:14.180
So the southernmost point
there is Singapore, which

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.920
is pretty much on the equator.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.107
And so for two reasons.

00:20:18.107 --> 00:20:19.940
Well, there's two
counteracting forces here.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:24.200
One is he's going
longer than 40,000,

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.060
because he's going in zigzags.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.950
And he's going shorter
because he's actually

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.520
only going in the northern
part of the earth.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.180
So again, Google Maps
came to my rescue.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:40.280
I measured the point to point
distances on key points there.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:44.040
And actually it comes out not
far off, 38,000 kilometers.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.730
So I reckon that was all right.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:50.170
So he could do around
the world in 80 Days.

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:54.350
Steam and rail were what
is driving him there.

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:56.960
Now Eratosthenes
would have known

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.290
that you could walk around
the world in about 1,000 days

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:02.640
if you had a road, of course.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.940
We can drive a bit
faster than that.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:09.485
Last year a fellow
called Francois--

00:21:09.485 --> 00:21:12.430
I can't think of
the surname now.

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:16.500
A French sailor did a
trip around the world.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.000
Gabart.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.590
Francois Gabart did a trip
around the world in a trimaran.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:23.030
It took him 43 days to
go around the world solo.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:26.399
A commercial flight, you
can do it in 2 and 1/2 days.

00:21:26.399 --> 00:21:27.440
And I checked up on this.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.690
You can take Air New
Zealand from London

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:32.720
to Auckland via
Los Angeles, then

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.500
2 and 1/2 hours on the
ground in Auckland.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.370
And you can take a BA flight
back via Sydney and Singapore.

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:44.490
And it takes you exactly
60 hours, 2 and 1/2 days.

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:46.160
A plane has actually--
a B-52 bomber

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.040
has actually flown around
the world in 42 hours,

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.990
refueling on flight.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:55.430
The fastest plane that's flying
is the Blackbird recon plane.

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:57.320
It didn't actually
go around the world.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:02.060
It did a 24,000 kilometer
journey, 60% of the way,

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.280
in about 10 and a half hours.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.446
So that would have been
equivalent to getting around

00:22:05.446 --> 00:22:06.942
in 17 and 1/2 hours.

00:22:06.942 --> 00:22:08.900
And the International
Space Station, of course,

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.350
goes around about every hour
and a half, so about 15 times

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:14.309
a day.

00:22:14.309 --> 00:22:16.100
But then I came across
one more measurement

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.730
that I couldn't leave out,
which was from Shakespeare.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.320
And he said that
he-- he has Puck

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.970
say in "Midsummer
Night's Dream,"

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:26.090
"I'll put a girdle round about
the earth in 40 minutes."

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:30.740
And when I saw that 40,
it chimed with my 40,000.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:35.150
So there's 1,000
kilometers a minute,

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:36.500
one mega meter per minute.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:40.850
I think we should have a new
unit of speed called a Puck.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:44.570
A mega meter per minute.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:47.330
Anyway, that's a
bit of diversion.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:49.280
Let's talk about the
number of people,

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.010
the 7 and 1/2 billion people.

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:54.770
Now you guys, I'm sure, will
know all about this guy called

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.030
Hans Rosling.

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:58.040
Died sadly last year.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:04.130
A Swedish doctor,
statistician, talker, thinker.

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:04.880
Wonderful fellow.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.600
If you've not seen his
videos or read his book

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.980
"Factfulness," go
out and get it.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.990
It's a fantastic book.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.910
And this is him talking
about the world's population.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:18.410
And in the first
picture there, he's

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:22.280
showing 7 billion people
as he had it at the time,

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.140
and the age distribution
of these people.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.900
So you've got two billion
people under the age of 15,

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.720
two billion children, 2
billion in the next tranche

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.660
up to the age of 30, and
then a billion, a billion,

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:36.260
a billion going up to 75.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.630
And he's talking about the
way in which population grows

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.985
and the way in which
it's a predictable thing.

00:23:40.985 --> 00:23:43.610
And he says what's happening now
is that the number of children

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:46.820
is not significantly
increasing in the world.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.070
What's happening is that
people are getting older.

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.050
And so those columns
are growing upwards

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:53.630
but the whole structure
is not getting wider.

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:57.340
So he's taking it there
from 7 to 10 billion

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:01.930
by aging those young people.

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:04.180
And that is the change that
we're seeing in the world.

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:08.360
And that is the way that the
population is progressing.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.790
And he takes a
little bit further.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:13.809
And he says, yes, people are
going to be living longer.

00:24:13.809 --> 00:24:15.350
And he's putting
another block on top

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:17.960
there to make it
into 11 billion.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.780
And that would cover
the age 75 to 90.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.962
This is obviously in very
crude and simple terms,

00:24:22.962 --> 00:24:24.920
but nonetheless it helps
you to focus the mind.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.300
It helps you to think
about these numbers.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.300
In the background there,
he's got a little chart

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.610
based on the United
Nations projection.

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:34.890
And he talks about having
reached peak child.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.400
In other words,
for several decades

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.920
now, the number of
children in the world

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.180
hasn't been increasing.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.910
What's been happening is that
adults are getting older.

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:48.320
More people are
living to old age.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.300
And I mean there's
a whole discussion

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.304
to be had here and
a whole discussion

00:24:53.304 --> 00:24:54.470
of the implications of this.

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:56.510
I just want to pick
out one thing here.

00:24:56.510 --> 00:25:00.260
And that is around 2050, around
the middle of the century,

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:04.640
we are going to pass the
number of 10 billion people

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.671
in the world.

00:25:05.671 --> 00:25:07.420
Whether we go beyond
that, whether it be--

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.940
whether it tops out,
we're not talking

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:17.210
about that here now, just a
question of, at some point, we

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.670
will hit 10 billion and
what will that look like.

00:25:23.369 --> 00:25:25.410
Now we've already got a
reference point for this.

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:27.540
We've already covered
this, because we know

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.720
what 10 billion ants look like.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.120
The 10 billion ants wind their
way around the world once.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.540
Now I need a bit more
space than an ant.

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:40.640
If an ant gets 4 millimeters,
maybe I need a meter.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.730
So a line of people would
then be 250 times as long,

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:48.000
would wind around
the Earth 250 times.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.100
Can we visualize that?

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.890
Let's take some Central Parks.

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:56.730
If we put 10,000 Central
Parks around the world,

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.740
Central Park is
850 meters across.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.480
That's enough
space for 250 lines

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.120
of people to have three
meters between them.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.940
And that would be 1 billion
people sitting in each park.

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:11.040
So one million people in
10,000 parks around the world.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.810
Is that realistic?

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:13.320
Well, yes.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:17.820
I'm showing my age here,
but 1981 Simon and Garfunkel

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:19.830
reunion concert.

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:23.790
They pulled 500,000 people onto
the great lawn in Central Park.

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:26.570
And they've had bigger
crowds than that since then.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:29.670
So there we are pushing
towards a million people

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:31.170
in Central Park.

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:32.460
Is that realistic?

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.630
Yes, it is to think about that.

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:36.190
Do our numbers agree?

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:37.080
Yes, they do.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.500
Just a few validity checks.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:45.880
We were happy that we're in the
right order of magnitude here.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.505
How dense are those people?

00:26:47.505 --> 00:26:50.310
It works out to about
300,000 square kilometers

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:51.330
in that situation.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:53.280
Now, obviously, we're
not going to say

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:57.880
that all the people in the world
can accumulate at that density.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.510
But how densely can people live?

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.390
Well, the place on the earth
with the greatest population

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:07.410
density is Macau,
the sister city

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:10.400
to Hong Kong on the
Chinese Sea there.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.390
And they've got 21,000
people per square kilometers.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:16.560
That's only 15 times as
much as those poor fellows

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.690
in Central Park had.

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:20.610
So it's pretty dense.

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:26.480
But you can see there is
some green space there.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.280
It is a working
city, a viable city.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.330
It is a viable way of living.

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:33.750
So let's just do a thought
experiment here and say

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:34.950
what happened--

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:37.950
what if all the world lives as
densely as they did in Macau?

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:40.980
How much space would that need?

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:46.579
Well, 480,000
kilometers squared.

00:27:46.579 --> 00:27:48.120
Now you can see what
I've done there.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:53.550
I've factorized that into my
favorite number, 40,000, by 12.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:57.720
So you can imagine that as
being a ribbon city stretched

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:02.550
around the world only
12 kilometers wide.

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:06.090
So think about
this for a moment.

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:10.350
Even from the center of that,
you could walk six kilometers--

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:12.230
what's that, two hours' walk?

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:14.370
And you'd get to the
edge of the city.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:17.404
And there would be nothing
between you and the pole.

00:28:17.404 --> 00:28:18.570
Of course, there'd be farms.

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:21.270
There'd be everything that
we need to sustain ourselves.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:24.360
But in terms of people, we
could put everybody in the world

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.740
into a 12 kilometer wide
strip around the world.

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:31.110
But, of course, we don't want
to live at that level of density

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:34.260
that they live in Macau.

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:37.170
You know, for good
or for bad, we've

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:43.350
chosen to live in England
where the density is about 420

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:44.230
per square kilometer.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:46.980
So that's about 50
times as much space

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.590
as the inhabitants
of Macau have.

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:52.470
And those 10 billion people
would need around 24 million

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:54.330
square kilometers.

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:56.940
And again, I'll factorize that.

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.100
40,000 by 600.

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.220
And so we get--

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:03.510
it's a belt nation there.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:08.790
So a country, it's about
the same north to south

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:09.990
as the length of England.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:14.070
It's about the same as Ecuador,
which is on the equator.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:17.290
And again, that would
have space for the lake

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:19.800
districts, and the national
parks, and the cities,

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:25.740
and the suburbia, and no
more than 300 kilometers,

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.760
half a day's drive
to get to the edge.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:31.390
Nothing between
you and the pole.

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:36.916
Now I'm not going to suggest
this is a practical plan.

00:29:36.916 --> 00:29:38.790
But it's just to get
these ideas in your head

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:40.170
of how much space it takes up.

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:42.000
Here's another way
of expressing it.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.776
80% of Africa.

00:29:43.776 --> 00:29:45.150
Everybody in the
world could live

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:48.810
in that living at the density
that we live in England.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:51.725
Of course, I'm oversimplifying
like crazy here.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:56.640
And 10 billion people.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.000
Is that a big number?

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.260
Well, of course it is.

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.840
Does the world have space
for 10 billion people?

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:08.970
Well, of course it does,
but that's not that simple.

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:11.360
We've not talked about
distribution of people here.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.080
We've not talked about
the food that they

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:18.036
need, the water they need,
the waste they produce,

00:30:18.036 --> 00:30:22.140
what is needed to give those
10 billion people meaningful

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.070
and fulfilling lives.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:31.260
Really, I'm not here to tell you
that 10 billion people is not

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.310
a problem.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:33.010
Of course it is.

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:35.490
There are massive problems.

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:39.780
But until we start
measuring the problems,

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:41.760
they are very hard to deal with.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.680
Unless you can actually
start putting numbers

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.860
to some of those
ideas, you don't

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:51.300
have a chance of actually
dealing with any of the issues.

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:55.260
And I like that quote
from Isaac Asimov.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.790
Great science fiction writer.

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:58.560
"If knowledge can
create problems,

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:02.370
it's not through ignorance
that we can solve them."

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:06.202
So what solutions that come,
where will they come from?

00:31:06.202 --> 00:31:08.160
When we talk about the
10 billion people and we

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.670
think in terms of problem,
but 10 billion people

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:14.070
is also 10 billion minds
to think of solutions.

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:19.080
It's also 10 billion
people with inspiration,

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.870
with determination, with drive.

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:27.540
And it's people like you where
those solutions will come from.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:28.920
It's smart people.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:33.200
It's people who are practical,
are problem solvers.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.910
It's people who--

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:39.504
I think it comes down to
people who are numerate.

00:31:39.504 --> 00:31:40.920
Those are the
people who are going

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.530
to get to grips with the
issues and deal with them.

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:54.440
Yeah.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.800
And it's not just the techies.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:59.040
It's not just guys like you
who can grasp the problems

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.960
and deal with them.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.940
But there needs to
be a political will.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:05.540
And the people with
political power and people

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:08.190
with financial power
also need to be on board

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:09.710
to make these things happen.

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:11.850
And they need to be persuaded.

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:14.844
And they need to be persuaded
sometimes not through big data

00:32:14.844 --> 00:32:16.260
but sometimes
through little data,

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.980
sometimes through little
points that they can focus on,

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:22.290
that they can latch on to, that
they can rest in their minds.

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:24.390
And it's this communication
aspect, I think,

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:26.555
that is very important.

00:32:26.555 --> 00:32:28.930
You know, the reporters and
the journalists of the world,

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:31.410
they like to sensationalize
things sometimes.

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:33.750
And it's a question of
trying to ground these

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:38.340
and trying to bring these
issues to a measurable level

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.320
to where we can
think about them.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.450
And sometimes it's complex.

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:43.800
And sometimes it's simple.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.920
Sometimes it's as simple
as asking the question,

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.470
is that a big number?

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:53.490
And really that simple
question is what's

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:56.170
behind what's in the book.

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:58.020
I talk about various
ways of getting numbers

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:00.369
in perspective-- how
do you compare numbers,

00:33:00.369 --> 00:33:01.660
ways of thinking about numbers.

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.320
There's lots of
visualization in there.

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:06.090
There's stories about numbers.

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:09.600
And it's a question of getting
our brains around and being

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.900
able to express those numbers
in ways that are meaningful

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.720
and those that are
useful to people.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.470
And yeah.

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:21.580
So there we are.

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.080
That's the book.

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.830
There's a website,
isthatabignumber.com.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:27.000
And AndrewCAElliott.com.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.350
I've also got a
Twitter feed there.

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:33.010
And those of you who've
picked up a copy of the book,

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:35.200
I hope you enjoy it.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.774
And if anybody got any
questions, I'm happy to answer.

00:33:38.774 --> 00:33:42.183
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.080
AUDIENCE: You say it's important
to get a grip of numbers,

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:52.450
and understand and put them
into relation, big numbers

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:54.540
especially.

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.690
How do you suggest
we help people

00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:03.330
do that, because lots of
people, probably all of us,

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:05.947
struggle with very big numbers
and putting them in relations.

00:34:05.947 --> 00:34:07.530
ANDREW ELLIOTT: I
mean, I talk through

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:09.420
in the book various techniques.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.330
The top one there, landmark
numbers, is one that I think

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:13.419
is very important.

00:34:13.419 --> 00:34:15.210
What I mean by landmark
number is something

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:17.856
that sticks in your brain.

00:34:17.856 --> 00:34:19.230
You don't set out
to memorize it,

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.940
but it sticks in your
brain as a reference point.

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.510
And I hope that all
of you will leave

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:29.382
knowing that 40,000 kilometers
is the length of the equator.

00:34:29.382 --> 00:34:30.840
And that can be a
reference number.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:34.880
So when you see that, you may--

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.480
Australia is 1/10 of that.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.340
Africa north to south
is one fifth of that.

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:41.440
It becomes something
that's in your head that

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:46.730
is a ready reference
for you to relate to.

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:50.429
And the 7 and 1/2 billion
people in the world.

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:54.919
These are numbers which, if
you have them ready to hand,

00:34:54.919 --> 00:34:56.460
they help you to
make these yardstick

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.510
comparisons against things
that you hear about.

00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:59.520
And it may be budgets.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.609
It may be populations.

00:35:01.609 --> 00:35:04.150
It's stuff that when you hear
something on the news, you say,

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:05.040
hold on a minute.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.960
That's not a big number,
because it compares

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.937
with that number in this way.

00:35:09.937 --> 00:35:11.520
And that's one of
the techniques here.

00:35:19.134 --> 00:35:21.050
AUDIENCE: You were saying
that on your website

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:23.865
you have like a database
of numbers you compare to.

00:35:23.865 --> 00:35:24.740
ANDREW ELLIOTT: Yeah.

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:27.040
AUDIENCE: Can you tell
us what some of them are?

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:29.607
I assume one is the 40,000.

00:35:29.607 --> 00:35:30.440
ANDREW ELLIOTT: Yes.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.439
Well, they come from all
sorts of things really.

00:35:32.439 --> 00:35:35.630
I mean, what I tried to do
is to find numbers that would

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:37.250
make meaningful comparisons.

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:43.730
So some of them are just routine
household or everyday objects,

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:46.160
like the size of a Post-it note.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:49.204
Some of them are
things like landmarks,

00:35:49.204 --> 00:35:50.870
the height of the
Empire State Building,

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:57.050
or the height of the Eiffel
Tower, or something like that.

00:35:57.050 --> 00:36:00.020
And one of the things that is
on the website and in the book

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:02.960
is I try and find pairs
of those numbers that

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.120
compare in an interesting way.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.420
So for example, the Empire State
Building is 5,000 Post-it notes

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.970
high almost exactly.

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:15.110
I do the comparison
to within 2%.

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:17.810
And you get some really
interesting numbers

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:18.720
that come through.

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.990
And this has an
interesting function,

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:24.570
because it makes you think
about the numbers themselves.

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:26.100
But it's almost like a triangle.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.120
Here's the Empire
State Building.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.190
Here's a Post-it note.

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:29.656
And here's the number 5,000.

00:36:29.656 --> 00:36:31.280
And it gives you a
little bit of a feel

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.390
for each of those
points of the triangle

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:35.450
when you think about them
in that relationship.

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:37.940
Of course, it means
nothing in terms

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.930
of if there is a
conspiracy theory here

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:44.070
that they've designed it
to fit the Post-it note,

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:47.210
but it's still something
that sticks in the mind.

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:50.000
And that's an interesting
way of going about it.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.460
But, yes, the numbers
on the website

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:57.140
are things like the length of
the Nile River, the population

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:58.639
of Brazil.

00:36:58.639 --> 00:37:00.680
There are numbers that
you can compare things to.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:09.469
That may or may not be
intriguing when you see them.

00:37:09.469 --> 00:37:10.010
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:11.450
Thanks for the
talk and the book.

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:13.479
So it seems that
most of the things

00:37:13.479 --> 00:37:15.020
you've talked about,
at least so far,

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.728
I don't know if in
the book there's more,

00:37:16.728 --> 00:37:18.470
but it's like about
physical quantities.

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:22.509
And you can compare like
look at one versus the other.

00:37:22.509 --> 00:37:24.050
Do you think that
the same strategies

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:27.941
apply to things that are more
immaterial like information

00:37:27.941 --> 00:37:28.440
and so on?

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.946
Like maybe a few years ago
like thinking in megabytes

00:37:30.946 --> 00:37:31.820
would have been fine.

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:34.430
Now we're talking gigabytes.

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:37.610
Maybe it's a different-- like
it's almost like unbounded

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:41.090
in a way like the
amount of numbers,

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:43.190
the size of the numbers
that these things require.

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:44.297
ANDREW ELLIOTT: Yeah.

00:37:44.297 --> 00:37:45.880
So the first book
of the book is more,

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.360
as you say, physical
things around us.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.780
It's weights and it's
measures and things like that.

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:52.760
Second half of the book firstly
gets into certain numbers

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:53.320
from science.

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.880
So we talk about how
you can visualize

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.730
or start to grasp,
for example, the size

00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:59.930
of the observable universe.

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:03.060
You know, get there by stages.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:06.020
And there's a chapter
on information.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.880
And we go into things like
how do you measure information

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.650
at all, how much information
is contained in the text, how

00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:14.836
much information is stored
in physical devices,

00:38:14.836 --> 00:38:15.710
and things like that.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:17.870
Of course, that part of
the book is out of date

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:20.600
before it's published.

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:24.110
But nonetheless, in the sense
that the principles remain.

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:27.272
And then there's a chapter on
mathematical numbers as well.

00:38:27.272 --> 00:38:28.730
It's really not a
book about maths,

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:33.020
but we have to touch on things
like explain that infinity

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:35.870
is not actually a number
on the number line,

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:37.730
or you'll talk about
Graham's number, which

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:40.640
is an interesting-- you
know Graham's number?

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.450
AUDIENCE: The name.

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:42.324
ANDREW ELLIOTT: Yeah.

00:38:42.324 --> 00:38:44.330
I mean, it's a number.

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:46.640
I first came across it
when it was in the Guinness

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:49.880
Book of Records as the
largest number ever used

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:52.240
in a serious
mathematical context.

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:52.740
OK.

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:55.520
So Graham's number
is just a recipe

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.400
for taking powers of numbers
an unbelievably large number

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.750
of times.

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:01.730
You could not write
down Graham's number.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:05.180
The universe would
not have space for it.

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:08.600
So the question is, is it even
a number if all that it is

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:12.340
is an algorithm for
doing computation

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:15.170
that you could never carry out.

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:19.530
But actually even if
I go and buy a coffee,

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:22.760
and it cost me two pounds
50, that number two pounds

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.260
50 is just an algorithm.

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:26.690
It's not the number itself.

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:28.119
There are some digits there.

00:39:28.119 --> 00:39:29.660
And we, our heads,
have the algorithm

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.290
for turning that into a number.

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:35.060
So there's no point of principle
difference between the two.

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:37.320
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for the talk.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:40.730
I have a question,
because, I mean, my family,

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:44.720
like half of the kids don't
understand math, you know.

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.820
I was fortunate to
understand it a bit.

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:50.180
But do you think this
like understanding

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:53.030
numbers should have a
bigger role in school,

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:55.200
because how math is
taught in Germany,

00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:00.410
for instance, is still very
basic and very on the numbers,

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:02.540
rather than on what
the numbers mean.

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.915
ANDREW ELLIOTT: I think that's
an interesting thing here,

00:40:04.915 --> 00:40:08.430
because I think maths
is a thing of beauty.

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:12.560
Math is an abstract
thinking skill

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:15.770
of subtlety and profundity.

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:18.710
And what we call--

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:23.050
I mean what I call numeracy,
of course it touches on maths,

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:23.907
but it is not maths.

00:40:23.907 --> 00:40:24.990
It's dealing with numbers.

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:27.070
It's the way in which
those abstractions of maths

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:28.540
connect to the real world.

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:29.550
Yeah.

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:30.700
And I think--

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:31.670
I mean, I'm no teacher.

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:32.770
I'm no educational expert.

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:34.750
I can't speak with
authority on those matters.

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:40.890
But it seems to me that we
leave behind numbers too soon

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:42.550
and move on to maths.

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:44.320
And I think that some
of the things I've

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.600
been looking at
here suggest to me

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:50.620
that there's much more that we
can do in terms of what I would

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:54.400
call adult numeracy
or advanced numeracy

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.500
to actually think about
numbers into the millions

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:59.950
and billions and trillions.

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:04.300
And there's a shift that
happens, I mean we all,

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.790
when we start thinking--

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:10.210
in junior school, we're thinking
in terms of linear numbers,

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:12.479
in linear scales.

00:41:12.479 --> 00:41:14.020
But truthfully, the
interesting stuff

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:16.180
happens when you
start looking at more

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.250
like logarithmic
scales, when you start

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:22.040
thinking of things in terms
of multiples of each other,

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.592
and when you--

00:41:23.592 --> 00:41:26.050
the way to understand things
like the size of the universe,

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:27.466
you can't do it
if you're thinking

00:41:27.466 --> 00:41:28.660
in terms of a linear scale.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:31.570
You've got to think in terms
of orders of magnitude in terms

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:33.100
of powers and so on.

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:37.180
And I think that that
numerate thinking--

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:40.970
I'm not aware that that's much
part of school mathematics.

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:42.700
And I think it's
actually very important.

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:47.500
And it's very useful to
think in terms of proportions

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.990
rather than linear scales.

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:52.252
SPEAKER 1: Thank you
again, Andrew Elliott.

00:41:52.252 --> 00:41:54.040
ANDREW ELLIOTT: Thank you.

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.530
Thank you all for
your attention.
