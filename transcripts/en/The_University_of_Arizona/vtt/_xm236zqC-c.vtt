BASHAR RIZK: Normally,
one would use

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.000
one camera to try to
accomplish the goals that you

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.150
want to do when you're
trying to gather a sample.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.520
You want to find
out about the place,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.320
you want to identify
the hazards,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.720
make sure that it's safe
to operate around it,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.850
identify the places
you'd like to go

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.880
and pick a sample off, and
then watch yourself picking

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.740
a sample off the surface.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.990
You can't do that
all with one camera.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.280
It took us three.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.840
The three cameras of OCAMS
are a low-resolution camera,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.550
a medium-resolution camera,
and a high-resolution camera.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.950
What we did was write
down all of the things

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.230
that we had to do at
the asteroid Bennu,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.867
and then we conceived
of cameras that

00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:43.700
would address those
requirements, that would

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.310
satisfy those requirements.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.810
And it just so happened that
they have these properties that

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.300
are very similar to
sending a person along

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.650
with a pair of
binoculars on a mission,

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.650
and telling them to look
out to what's out there

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.700
and inform us what's happening.
