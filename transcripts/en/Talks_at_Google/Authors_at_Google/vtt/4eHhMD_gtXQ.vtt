FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi everyone,
I'm Kat.

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.980
I am with the Authors@Google
program here

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.610
at Google Los Angeles.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:07.380
Welcome.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.900
We're very happy to host
professor Kal Raustiala today.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.450
Professor Raustiala is a
professor at UCLA Law School

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.380
and also a director at Ronald
W. Burkle Center for

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.980
International Relations
at UCLA.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.160
Professor Raustiala is a
graduate of Harvard Law

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.260
School, and he is also a
frequent media contributor to

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.100
publications like "The Wall
Street Journal," "The New

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.910
Yorker," "The New York Times,"
and "The Financial Times." His

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.810
latest book, written with
Christopher Sprigman, is

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.440
called "The Knockoff Economy,"
and it was published in

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.580
September 2012, this year.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.850
And we're very happy
to have him today.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.980
He's going to talk a little
bit about how copying and

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.680
imitation actually spurs
creativity and innovation.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.076
Welcome, professor.

00:00:57.076 --> 00:00:58.534
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:58.534 --> 00:00:59.506
KAL RAUSTIALA: Thank you.

00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:03.394
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:03.394 --> 00:01:06.310
KAL RAUSTIALA: OK,
thanks, everyone.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.120
As Kat just said, this book,
which I did write with a

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.140
co-author who teaches at UVA,
is really about copyright,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.710
patent, and how they connect to
innovation and creativity,

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.980
so issues that I think would be
of interest here at Google.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.220
So I'm really glad to have the
opportunity to come here.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.570
I've never been to
this building.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.830
I've driven by it
a million times.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.170
So it's great to be here.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.310
Let me start off with a few just
basic points about what

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.670
we try to do in the book.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.680
And then I'm going to run
through some examples to give

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.320
you a taste.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.820
But the basic gist of the book
is that we are interested in

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.620
how copying affects the
incentives to create and how

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.620
it helps sustain or undermine
creativity.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.150
So I think, as many of you
know, the underlying idea

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.680
behind our intellectual property
system is that

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.230
copying is bad for creativity.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.950
That's the basic concept.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.250
Copies usually out-compete
originals because they're

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.880
cheaper than the originals.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.949
And so we restrict that form of
competition by awarding a

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.550
copyright or a patent.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.785
I'm going to mostly talk
about copyright today.

00:02:12.785 --> 00:02:15.550
But we restrict that competition
and give the

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.650
originator a window of time in
which they have a monopoly

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.960
over that design.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.350
So in the case of patent,
it's 20 years.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.140
In the case of copyright, it
sort of depends, but it's

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.610
much, much longer.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.780
So that's the basic gist of our
system, and it's been that

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.910
way since the framers of the
Constitution first put in a

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.000
clause about the need to promote
progress in the useful

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.740
sciences and arts.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.430
So that's the underlying
concept.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.050
So what we're interested in in
this book is not whether or

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.760
not that's true.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.170
We think that that's generally
true, and we're generally

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.290
supportive of intellectual
property.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.570
Some people do actually argue
for the abolition of copyright

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.470
and patent.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.810
We don't really do that.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.230
But we are interested in whether
it's truly necessary

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.440
to have these copyrights and
patents in place, these

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.890
monopoly rights protected by the
government, to have those

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.570
in place to have sustained
creativity.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.150
When that's true, why it's
true, to what degree it's

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.680
true, some of those sorts
of questions.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.270
And the way that we come at it
in the book is a little bit

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.180
different than most work
that's been done.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.910
So a lot of people who look at
these issues focus on things

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.130
like the music industry.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.180
This has been a hot issue for
a long time, really, ever

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.440
since Napster.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.650
And so people have been really
interested in, what happened

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.880
to the music industry,
and is online

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.370
downloading a bad thing?

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.810
Most people say yes, some
people say it's a

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:32.750
good thing, et cetera.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.350
They debate it by looking at
copyright-protected industries

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.830
or, increasingly, the film and
television industries.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.850
We don't really do that, though
we do have an epilogue

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.230
at the end of the book
about music.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.220
What we do instead is look at
industries that don't have

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.890
intellectual property
protection, and we try to

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.650
understand what happens
in those industries.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.550
How do they operate?

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.030
How do they sustain
their innovation?

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.500
And those industries are
somewhat unusual.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.970
So I'm going to start off today
with one that I think

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.280
exemplifies sort of the
flavor of the book.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.010
And that's the fashion
industry.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.960
So I'm going to guess that a
lot of you are not frequent

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.960
shoppers at Faviana.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.610
Maybe you've been to
other stores--

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.520
so Faviana actually does
not even have a

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.260
brick-and-mortar store.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.170
It's just a website.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.589
They sell to other places.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:20.170
And you directly
order dresses.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.680
But what's important about
Faviana, and you can see from

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.780
this website, is its
whole business

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.080
model is knocking off.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.340
So typically, one of their
big business areas are

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.170
girls going to a prom.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.640
They go to one of these
pictures, they say oh, I saw

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.250
Angelina Jolie on the red carpet
at the Oscars last year

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.990
wearing this great dress.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.900
I want to have that dress.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.690
And then they can order it.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.650
It's not the same dress.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.220
It's going to be significantly
cheaper.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.945
It might be a few hundred
dollars rather than a few

00:04:49.945 --> 00:04:52.300
thousand dollars or maybe even
tens of thousands of dollars

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.830
for the original.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.730
It's not going to look
exactly the same.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.750
The material might not
be exactly the same.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.800
But it's a pretty
close facsimile.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.670
And that's their basic
business model.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.980
You can see similar sorts of
things if you walk into

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.750
Forever 21.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.220
Now, some of you may
have done that.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.780
So if you go into a Forever
21, you'll see lots of

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.920
examples of knocked-off
designs.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.250
And I want to pause for a moment
just to explain what I

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.900
mean by a knockoff versus
a counterfeit.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.100
So if you buy a dress or a pair
of sunglasses in a place

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.720
like Santee Alley downtown or
Canal Street in New York, and

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.490
you see a fake label that says,
like, Prada, or maybe

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.100
Prado, or some version like
that, that's a counterfeit.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.870
So what they're trying to do is
say, hey, you think you're

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.995
buying this Prada handbag or
pair of sunglasses, but you're

00:05:36.995 --> 00:05:37.310
really not.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.498
You're buying something else.

00:05:39.498 --> 00:05:41.520
That's counterfeit, and that's
really dealing with trademark

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.060
and the brand.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.070
What we're talking about here
is the actual design.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.400
So the look of the dress that
Angelina Jolie's wearing in

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.820
that picture, or Megan Fox, the
way it's cut, the design,

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.060
the shape, et cetera--

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.310
those things are all completely
legal to copy.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.890
So the counterfeit example
is absolutely illegal.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.500
The design, however, is
completely legal to copy.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.070
And it's been that way in the
United States forever.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.760
We've never protected fashion
designs from copying.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:18.300
So the fashion industry has for
decades operated without

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.830
any effective intellectual
property protection over its

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.680
core product, which is the
look of the actual--

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.370
and it's not just dresses,
obviously.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.670
Any kind of clothing, accessory,
and so forth,

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.900
without any protection
for that.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.380
And what's interesting
about that is it's a

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.790
pretty vibrant industry.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.050
And I want to just take a
moment just to say that

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.760
knocking off is not limited to
companies like Faviana or, for

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.840
that matter, Forever 21.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.365
So this is drawn from "US
Weekly" a few months ago.

00:06:44.365 --> 00:06:47.910
And you can find features like
this in a lot of these kinds

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.490
of magazines.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.130
So one actress is wearing
the original.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.350
One's wearing a copy.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.460
The copy's always
much cheaper.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.400
I shouldn't say always--

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.830
often much cheaper.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.780
It depends.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.420
But typically, it is
significantly cheaper.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.440
And these kind of knockoffs
are everywhere.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.570
And since I mentioned Forever
21, I'll give you an example,

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.500
in a moment, of a Forever
21 example.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.060
But so you can see these outfits
look pretty similar.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.750
From a distance, you could
not tell the difference.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.130
So these copies are
quite similar.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.800
Now again, just to step back
to where I began, I think

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.930
you've all seen this warning.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.780
And this warning gets at the
underlying principles of our

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.970
system of intellectual
property.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.730
So why is it not only illegal
but, in fact, a criminal

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.450
offense to make a copy?

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.190
Because we think that protecting
against copies is

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.530
such a significant factor in
our intellectual property

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.960
system that we have to police
it in that way.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.580
So that makes the fashion
industry really unusual--

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.800
though it's only one chapter
in the book, and I'll go

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.400
through some of the
other examples.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.300
It's not unique.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.760
It's just unusual.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.560
So I mentioned Forever 21.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.360
So this is an example we talk
about in "The Knockoff

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.940
Economy." So the dress on
the left, I believe--

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.620
I can't even tell, because they
look so much alike-- is

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.160
the original.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.340
The one on the right is the
Forever 21 version.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.270
So the original sold for maybe
$400 a few years ago.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.810
The copy sold for about $40.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:20.080
Paris Hilton wore the dress on
David Letterman, and all of a

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.350
sudden, orders started flooding
in to Forever 21.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.600
It became a big thing.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.680
But again, the designers
could do absolutely

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.360
nothing about it.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.670
That's just the way
of the industry.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.900
OK, so how does fashion work?

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.600
What makes it work
as a system?

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.549
To make the point clear, why
is it that this kind of

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:41.470
copying is not destroying the
incentive to create in the

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.090
fashion industry in the way that
our intellectual property

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.070
system supposes?

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.430
And I'll give you two
basic answers.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.620
There's a much longer version
of this, obviously, in the

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.810
book, but two basic things
to think about.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:56.590
The first is that fashion has
some special qualities that

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.320
are grounded in the fact that
it is something that's

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:04.210
expressive and public and has
a status component to it.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.360
Now, a lot of us don't pay
attention to fashion.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.490
We don't really care about it.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:09.850
That's sort of one end
of the spectrum.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.530
There's a middle group of people
who do care a little

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:12.620
bit, and then there's
a small group of

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.080
people who care a lot.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.370
So people divide up
in those ways.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.400
For people who really care
about fashion, this

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.930
status-expressive component is
really significant for the

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:23.900
following reason.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:28.000
So we've known for, really,
centuries that things come

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.550
into style, and they
go out of style.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.120
So Shakespeare talked about the
fashion wearing out more

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.990
apparel than the man in "Much
Ado About Nothing."

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:36.990
And what Shakespeare was getting
at was the idea that

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.310
you don't typically
wear your clothes

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:39.220
until they're destroyed.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.500
You wear them until you're kind
of sick of them, or until

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.850
somebody tells you you've
really got to

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.010
get rid of that thing.

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:50.110
And you get something new, or
you just feel like it's time.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.220
So that's how most of us change
our clothes, for the

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.570
most part, especially in a place
like the United States.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.090
It's not because we're
wearing them out.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.610
It's because there's something
new out there, some

00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:59.810
new style out there.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:01.680
So things come into style, they
go out of style, that's

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.470
the fashion cycle.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:06.020
That's been long recognized.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.450
What's important, and I think
relatively unrecognized--

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:11.840
this is what we emphasize in our
book-- is that the freedom

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.130
to copy that flows from the fact
that our copyright law

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:18.960
does not address fashion, means
that that fashion cycle

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.820
can turn even faster.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.900
And the reason that it turns
even faster is that once a

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.720
dress like this comes into style
and Forever 21 copies

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.810
it, now the original might have
sold a few hundred, maybe

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.900
even a thousand, maybe a couple
of thousand copies.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.920
That's it.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.060
But the copy sold tens of
thousands, maybe hundreds of

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:39.960
thousands of versions.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.040
So it spreads out into the
marketplace very quickly.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.760
And so now the people who spent
$400 on the original

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.890
start to see, maybe, the girl
down the street wearing the

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:49.630
$40 version.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.360
And they're kind of annoyed
about that, and they're

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.690
annoyed that it's everywhere.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:56.030
And we spoke to the designers
of this original dress, and

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.640
they were peeved.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.510
And they talked about customers
coming in and

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.765
complaining that they had chosen
it for some event or a

00:11:02.765 --> 00:11:05.640
bridesmaid's dress or whatever
it might be, and now the

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.690
specialness had been destroyed
by the copy.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.460
So what effect does that have?

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.050
Well, it drives people to
go and say, well, I want

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:13.390
something new.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:13.880
I want something different.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.660
I'm not going to keep wearing
this dress anymore.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.740
So in other words,
it makes that

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.580
fashion cycle turn faster.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.910
And so designers then have to
offer something faster.

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:24.840
So in fashion, unlike
technology, the new, new thing

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.350
is not better in any way.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:27.600
It's just different.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.590
Clothing doesn't improve
in any meaningful way.

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.865
Sometimes people come up with a
new fabric that repels heat

00:11:33.865 --> 00:11:36.040
or water or something--
that's unusual.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.970
Most of it is just
sort of changes.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:43.200
And so how you get people to
get a new phone is you tell

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.340
them, hey, this newer phone has
a million features that

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.860
your old phone didn't have, so
get rid of your old phone.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.960
With clothing, you have to
have some other means to

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.160
induce that desire for
consumers to buy.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.820
And that's partly driven
by the ability to copy.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.350
And that relates to a second
point, which is trends.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:02.910
So if we think about the fashion
industry, it's a

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.520
trend-driven industry.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.990
There are trends, and if you
read magazines like "US

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.170
Weekly" or "Vogue"--

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:10.880
again, I'm going to guess
a lot of us don't.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.730
But if you do, if you look
in those, you'll see that

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:15.970
there'll be discussions of
what's in style this season,

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.090
what's coming in next season,
what was on the runway, et

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:19.170
cetera, et cetera.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.620
So trends are a major
part of fashion.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.580
And if you think about a trend,
a trend is just a

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.890
series of things that
look alike.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:28.960
That's what makes it a trend.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.270
It's a bunch of things that
are similar in some way.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.990
So here again, the freedom to
copy that our copyright system

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:38.560
allows the fashion industry also
allows trends to develop.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.370
And as those trends develop,
they give people something to

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.610
latch onto if they want to
be stylishly dressed.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.210
So they could say, OK, the trend
this season is X. I'm

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:48.430
going to follow X.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:53.130
So it also helps with the kind
of information gathering issue

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.300
for fashion consumers.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.280
What is it you buy in a
marketplace that offers

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.670
thousands of choices?

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:59.710
Trends help kind
of define that.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:03.990
So the bottom line is copying
has a paradoxical effect in

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.790
the fashion industry.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:07.090
It doesn't drive
out creativity.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.380
It actually promotes it.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.940
It acts like this turbocharger,
spinning that

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.890
fashion cycle faster and faster
and leading designers

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.860
to come up with new designs
even faster.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:20.360
So far from destroying
innovation, it's promoting it.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.800
Now, fashion is not alone
in doing that.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.970
Here's an example of something
I'm guessing a lot of you have

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.060
eaten at some point
or another, right?

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.280
So the molten chocolate cake.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.260
If you look at the world of
cuisine, it's surprisingly

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.100
similar to the fashion world.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.150
The molten chocolate cake,
whether the recipe or the cake

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:43.430
itself, is unprotected by
copyright or patent.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.530
So for example, a recipe
is, strictly speaking,

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.340
uncopyrightable.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:51.520
So if you buy a cookbook, the
cookbook is copyrightable.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.200
And the stuff around the recipe,
where the chef says,

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.340
well, I was vacationing in
Tuscany, and I saw this

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.240
wonderful--

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.750
that kind of stuff is
all copyrightable.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.110
But the actual recipe
itself is not.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.610
So that's why you can go
online to a place like

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.060
Epicurious or cooks.com or any
of these websites and find

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.080
tons and tons of examples
of recipes.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.360
Totally legal.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.420
Likewise, you can walk
into a restaurant and

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.870
say, I love this dish.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.290
And if you're a good chef, you
can reverse engineer that

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.370
dish, figure out what the
components are, what the

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:20.180
techniques are, and then make
it yourself, and maybe even

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.240
serve it at the restaurant
across the street.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.440
Totally legal to do.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.710
And as a result, things like
this get invented and then

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.070
migrate around.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.990
So there's a little bit of a
dispute over who the true

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:36.900
inventor of the molten
chocolate cake is.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.260
But many people would place it
in a restaurant on the Upper

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.860
East Side of Manhattan in
sort of the late 1980s.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.000
And now you can find
this in Chili's.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.610
And you can, in fact, find the
Chili's recipe online.

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:50.710
You can find it in almost
any restaurant today.

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.210
If you've had miso-glazed
black cod--

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.580
I'm guessing some people
have eaten that dish.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:59.550
Somebody invented that somewhere
in Japan, and it

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:00.130
spreads out.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:01.910
And there are example after
example like that.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:06.590
So nothing stops the
copying of cuisine.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.290
Does it mean that copying
has driven out

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:09.400
creativity in cuisine?

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:09.810
No.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.030
I think actually the opposite.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.560
I think today we live in
probably the most creative

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.170
time ever for cuisine.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:20.020
And there's incredibly inventive
cooking going on.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.920
So there's some very basic and
delicious and excellent

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.170
cooking going on.

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:26.240
If any of you have been to
Bazaar on La Cienega, you know

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.240
what I'm talking about, right?

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.720
So people are coming up with
extremely creative dishes

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.140
using new techniques,
in some cases.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.130
And just as a footnote, some
of those techniques can be

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:39.110
patented, but most aren't.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.560
But the dishes themselves, as
long as you can figure out how

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.910
to do it and you have
the right tools, you

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:44.610
can recreate them.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:48.800
So just like in the fashion
world, the culinary world has

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.550
not been destroyed by copying.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.740
And in fact, if you talk to
chefs-- and in the book, we

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:56.850
discuss many examples and also
quote from many of the chefs

00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:00.610
that we interviewed, great chefs
here and in New York.

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:04.380
And also, we draw on some other
studies that looked at

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.150
places like Paris.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.840
If you talk to chefs, they're
very divided on this issue.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.600
Some of them feel that they're
artists, much like fashion

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.580
designers sometimes feel.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.330
They're artists, and their art
should be protected the same

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.330
as music would be protected,
the same as poetry is

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.340
protected, the same as novels
are protected, et cetera, et

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:25.090
cetera-- paintings.

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:27.890
Others think-- and I think this
is the majority view--

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:33.720
that innovation is assisted by
an open framework, which you

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:40.360
can view as roughly akin to a
kind of open-source model of

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:40.900
innovation.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.210
So rather than saying, I own
this molten chocolate cake,

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:46.820
and you cannot copy it, or for
that matter, produce anything

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.730
that's substantially similar,
which is our legal standard

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.230
for copyright, to it, instead
a lot of chefs believe that

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.400
the ability to share and to
trade and to tweak and to

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.480
improve upon what others have
done actually produces more

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.810
creativity and better products
in the long run.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:07.060
And that openness is promotive
of innovation, not destructive

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.750
of innovation.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:12.119
So the world of chefs
is quite similar.

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:13.750
Let me just add one other
point about chefs.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:14.960
I mentioned Paris.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.080
One of the things we talk about
in the "The Knockoff

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.910
Economy" is a very interesting
study by two people at MIT who

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.859
went and interviewed high-end
chefs in Paris.

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:25.290
These are chefs that had
Michelin-starred restaurants.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.510
If you know about the Michelin
system, you know even one star

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:28.660
is a huge deal.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.600
So these all had at least
one star or more.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.810
And these chefs had a system
of social norms amongst

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.630
themselves, so the
study argued--

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.780
and we think it's a
well-done study--

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.060
that constrain the types of
copying that took place, but

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:47.850
really focused not so much on
restricting copying but on how

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:48.520
you copied.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.480
And the key issue is
really attribution.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.400
It was perfectly fine to copy a
cake or much more elaborate

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.270
dishes, as long as you
attributed it to the

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.690
originator.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.895
So it's a little bit like the
labeling issue I talked about

00:17:59.895 --> 00:18:00.630
with fashion.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.170
As long as you don't tweak the
trademark, that's fine.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:05.750
So I'll come back to this
issue of brands

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:10.100
versus designs later.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.720
This is a football formation.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.810
Now again, football is not an
industry we normally think of

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.130
as being driven by
or undergirded by

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:19.620
intellectual property.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:24.030
But actually, the NFL has been
involved in a lot of IP cases.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:25.990
They have huge investments
in their brands.

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.320
They have very good and very
high-priced lawyers.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.370
They know all about intellectual
property.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:37.210
However, what they haven't done
is been able to copyright

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:41.270
a formation, even though in
theory, there is a category

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.650
for choreographic works in our
copyright statute in the

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:44.800
United States.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.520
And a football formation is
a form of choreography.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.160
It just happens to involve
throwing a ball and hitting

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.950
people, rather than dancing
on a stage.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.790
But is choreographic.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:54.240
No one's been able to
successfully make this

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.650
argument to the copyright
office.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.250
But substantively, they're
quite similar.

00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:59.700
So put that aside
for a moment.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:04.490
The fact is, formations and
plays are fully copyable.

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:06.830
Totally legal to copy a
formation and play.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:09.720
Now again, does that stop
football coaches from coming

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.010
up with new formations?

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:11.710
No.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:14.930
So we go through many examples
in the book where we talk

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.120
about things like--

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.070
some of them are very simple,
like the no-huddle offense,

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.030
where as it sort of suggests,
there's no huddle.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:24.290
You just go from play to play
to play very quickly.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.600
Quite effective.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.230
To things that are more
complicated and variants on a

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:32.740
theme, so the spread, the spread
option, et cetera,

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.070
pioneered both at the college
level, sometimes even at the

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.500
high school level,
and in the NFL.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.570
Now again, why is it that the
ability to copy a formation

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:46.420
doesn't stop coaches or
constrain them from creating

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.700
the way that our copyright
system assumes in most cases?

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.800
We think the answer is really
two-fold, and I'm going to

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.940
focus on one in particular.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.070
The first is football is an
intensely competitive

00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:59.040
enterprise.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.590
So particularly when you're
talking about college football

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.050
and pro football, winning
or losing a single

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.550
game is a big deal.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:07.970
And especially if that game is
something like the Super Bowl,

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:12.230
that's a career-winning issue.

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:14.420
There's also a powerful
first-mover

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.880
advantage in football.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.370
So if you think about a
formation or a play, it's easy

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.180
to say, hey, I see this play,
I understand it, I'm

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.240
going to copy it.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.210
What's difficult to do is
actually to get your team to

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:29.610
execute it well, and in some
cases, to build the proper

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:32.690
team that can execute this
type of play well.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.560
So in other words, you may
need bigger or smaller

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.350
players, faster players,
different types of players.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.070
That may take some
time to recruit.

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.990
So that's a marginal issue, but
it's not insignificant.

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:44.070
You also have to train.

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:45.230
You have to perfect it.

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:48.960
So there's a period of time
between the moment a new play

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.540
is unveiled on a field and the
time that competitors can

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.480
really use it to their
advantage.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.300
So economists call that
first-mover advantage.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.480
We see that in a lot
of industries.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:03.950
And here, that natural
advantage, no laws involved in

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:07.300
that, gives enough of an
incentive, especially in a

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:11.000
very competitive industry, for
coaches to continue to create.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.310
So here again, we see creativity
coupled to copying,

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:19.060
and the two seem to fit
very well together.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.200
Now, is that a unique thing?

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.550
I'm going to argue
that it's not.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:25.470
I'm going to just play
you something

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:26.540
quickly from this guy.

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:26.860
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:28.190
-Good artists copy.

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:30.090
Great artists steal.

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:34.040
And we have always been
shameless about

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.700
stealing great ideas.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.050
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:38.540
KAL RAUSTIALA: OK, I don't know
if you could hear the

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.930
first thing.

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:41.220
He thinks he's quoting
Picasso.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.135
It's not really clear that
Picasso ever said this.

00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:48.620
But he's saying, good artists
copy, great artists steal, and

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:52.110
we at Apple have always been
shameless about stealing.

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:55.175
Now, that was Steve Jobs in the
'90s, I think roughly 1994

00:21:55.175 --> 00:21:59.070
or so, when Apple was not
quite what it is today.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.210
And of course, their
attitude--

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:02.940
in particular, his attitude--

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:06.130
about copying underwent quite
a transformation as Apple's

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:07.830
size and influence grew.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.870
I think you all are familiar
with that.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:13.280
But let me say a little bit
about this issue of stealing

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:18.110
and copying in other arenas, and
especially in technology.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:21.280
So the examples that we talk
about in the book are

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.770
obviously unusual ones.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.630
So food, fashion, et cetera,
these seem quite different

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:30.700
from something like inventing
the iPad.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:34.020
And they are, but there are some
interesting similarities.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.220
And I think when you step back
a little bit and think about

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.500
it, one of the things that all
of the examples that I've

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:43.400
given you so far feature is that
there's a system, a kind

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.860
of ecology of innovation in
which people can borrow from

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:48.760
what others have done
and improve upon

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.980
it by refining it.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:55.620
So we call that in the book
tweaking versus pioneering.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.430
So we kind of divide the world
of innovation into two types--

00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:59.810
tweakers and pioneers.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.910
And I think for most people,
their conventional

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:05.080
understanding of innovation is
that you want big new ideas

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:05.725
that are pioneering.

00:23:05.725 --> 00:23:08.000
And so people think about
someone like Thomas Edison and

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.390
the light bulb, and
that's the kind of

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:10.460
thing we want to promote.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:13.440
That's why we have a patent
system, to do that.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.180
Now, if you stop and think
about even that example,

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:20.910
Thomas Edison didn't really
invent the light bulb.

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:24.180
So when he was putting out his
light bulb, there were already

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.660
over a dozen examples of light
bulbs in existence

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.590
that he drew upon.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:30.360
What he did is he figured out
a better filament, bamboo,

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.990
that worked a little bit better
inside, so he was not

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:36.620
actually a pioneer in the way
that our lore has it.

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:40.420
He was tweaking existing ideas
and making them better and

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.260
making them workable.

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.040
Someone like Steve Jobs--

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.900
and I'm not limiting
this to him at all.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.725
He's just a high-profile
example of this--

00:23:51.725 --> 00:23:53.380
did a lot of the same things.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.300
And I think a lot of innovation
is of this sort.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.820
Now obviously, it's a
matter of degree.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:02.620
But so I think most of you are
probably familiar with this.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.810
Not a great picture, but if you
look at the top, you see

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:06.890
this crude early mouse.

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.300
And then at the bottom,
you see a series

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.310
of early Apple mice.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:14.980
So that top mouse is the one
that was in the Xerox PARC

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:19.950
research facility that Steve
Jobs visited in the late '70s

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:21.950
in a famous trip.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.860
The ones at the bottom are some
of his early, I would

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.260
say, tweaks of that mouse.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.980
So if you think about both the
graphical user interface, the

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:32.360
mouse, the whole way that we
tend to think of computing

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.620
today, this is something that
the early components could be

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.210
found at Xerox PARC, the
things like this

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:41.340
kind of crude mouse.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.000
And Jobs, being someone who,
as he said, was shameless

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.260
about stealing, didn't
hesitate to say, hey,

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.470
I really like that.

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:50.570
That's an amazing idea,
but it's not

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:51.520
that wonderfully executed.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.450
I'm going to execute
it better.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:57.420
And so over time, he slowly
executed it better and better

00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:58.880
and better.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.770
And I think that's
a good example of

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:01.990
the power of tweaking.

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:06.360
Now to do that, he had to copy
some fundamental attributes.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:10.080
And in those days, yes, patents
were available for

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:14.030
hardware, but they were not
nearly as thick or as commonly

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:15.910
given or as broad as
they see today.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:21.130
So if you were to try to do
the equivalent in today's

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:25.140
legal climate, you would run
into a thicket of patents.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.220
And that's the phrase that
lawyers often use-- "patent

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:31.040
thickets." There's so many of
them in each component,

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.710
whatever it might be-- a mouse,
a computer, the CPU--

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:35.830
thousands and thousands and
thousands of patents

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:40.530
overlapping and interacting and
causing barriers that you

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:43.730
have to overcome through
licensing deals or worry about

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:45.440
being sued by a patent troll.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.320
So there's a lot of difficulties
involved in this

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.800
kind of basic improvement, which
presupposes some degree

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.080
of copying.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.260
Likewise in the copyright
context.

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:57.360
Same kinds of thing.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.440
And also, by the way, in the
design context, when design

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.650
patents are at issue.

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:05.170
So in the Samsung-Apple
litigation that's been going

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:08.540
on all over the world, with
many different results--

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.640
I think most of you know,
up in Silicon

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.510
Valley, Apple prevailed.

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:14.830
In other countries, it's
been different.

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:16.220
So it varies.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.580
There's been litigation in
Korea, in Japan, in the

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.790
Netherlands, in the
UK, et cetera.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.960
But in those cases, what's
at stake are a

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.010
number of design patents.

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:28.020
And a design patent is a very
particular type of thing.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.810
It is a patent, but it's
over a design feature.

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:32.680
So the ones that often get
talked about are things like

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.960
pinch-to-zoom.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.210
But also included are the
actual shape of the eye

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:38.420
pattern in the iPhone.

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:42.690
So I have an iPhone
right here.

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:45.350
When you look at the shape, is
there anything really special

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:46.250
about the shape?

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.780
Well, it's a rectangle.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:52.060
It's got rounded corners.

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.370
And this is very similar
to shape of the iPad.

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:58.240
The rectangle itself is not an
unusual shape for content

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:58.970
consumption.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:03.160
So here's another example of a
rectangular content device.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:03.720
Very basic.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.040
I think when Moses brought the
tablets down, they were also

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.440
rectangular.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.970
So this is not a new idea.

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:14.400
It's a tweak on an
existing idea.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.900
Let's round the corners
a little bit.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:16.980
Let's do a few other things.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.940
Let's put this big
Home button here.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:20.520
But that's it.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.320
Nonetheless, Apple is claiming,
and in some cases,

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.220
succeeding on claiming, that
it has a design patent over

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.460
that particular shape--

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.220
I'm exaggerating
only slightly--

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.990
with some certain kind
of attributes.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:34.540
And it's been able to uphold at
least some of those against

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.230
Samsung, in certain cases.

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:41.090
So I think the big point to take
home is that tweaking--

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:42.640
and the ability to tweak--

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.700
depends, in many cases, on
the ability to copy.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.680
So whether we're talking about
industries where there's free

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.543
and legal copying like the
fashion industry, or we're

00:27:50.543 --> 00:27:53.460
talking about things like high
technology, where there's not

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:56.170
free and legal copying, we still
want to think about what

00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:58.890
is the right balance between
the ability to copy and

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:02.490
therefore to improve, to refine,
and the protection

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:05.440
that is often needed so that
innovators who are putting

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.830
money up, investing in their
innovation, can reap the

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:10.650
proper reward.

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.720
Not a fair reward, but the
reward that will keep them

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.880
innovating over time.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.910
That is the critical issue.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:21.470
So just to give you an example,
I was in Shanghai a

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:22.340
couple weeks ago.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:25.220
Now if you take a close look,
you may notice that is not a

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:29.140
picture of an Apple on the
back of that phone.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.670
It's the Peach.

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:35.010
So I think as some of you know,
in China today, there's

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:39.190
a vibrant, what's called the
"shanzai," culture of copying

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:41.770
in which a lot of copying
is taking place.

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:44.650
Now, this is a major issue
for American companies.

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:47.460
And there's a lot of
attention to it.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.280
Since I'm at Google, I'll
throw out one anecdote.

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:53.160
We tried to get on Facebook in
our hotel in Shanghai, and you

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.200
know, just weren't really
thinking, little jet lag.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.520
Try to get on Facebook, not
working, not working.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.070
After the second time, a little
message popped up on

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:03.040
the Google page saying, "In
our experience, if you

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:06.570
continue to try to reach
Facebook, your access to the

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.880
internet will be shut
down." And we

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.590
stopped right after that.

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:14.180
And that was in a
Western hotel.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:18.950
So thank you, Google,
for letting us know.

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:21.600
In any event, there's a lot of
copying like this going on.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.540
Now, some of it is just
blatant mimicry.

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.790
But in some cases, there's some
interesting innovation.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:31.680
So for example, the dual
SIM card cell phone.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.064
So you have two SIM cards
inside, and that way you can

00:29:35.064 --> 00:29:35.840
have two phone numbers.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.560
It can work in two
jurisdictions, so this is a

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.490
big deal in China, where Hong
Kong actually is treated

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:41.980
administratively quite
differently

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.210
than the rest of China.

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:46.050
So in Shenzhen, right over the
border, there are all these

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:47.780
factories where they're putting
these things out.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:51.200
And they are, in some cases,
tweaking and improving.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.300
So there's a vibrant world
of that going on.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:58.220
Now again, it is a problem to
some degree, but it's also a

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:01.030
solution in a sense, because
it's bringing us ideas that

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:02.860
hadn't existed before.

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:06.550
So I just want to come back to
what I said a moment ago.

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:09.630
It's about a question of
calibration and balance.

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:13.720
So we recognize-- and we talk
about this, I think, pretty

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.430
forthrightly in "The
Knockoff Economy"--

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:18.140
that copying has destructive
effects.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.190
That's why we have intellectual
property laws.

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:21.900
But it also has productive
effects.

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:23.220
It has an upside.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.830
And that upside is often
not appreciated fully.

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:27.890
So in part, the point
of the book is to

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:30.300
say, there is an upside.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.550
And moreover, in a world in
which copying is ever more

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:36.180
common, like this, we want to
understand copying, because

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:39.150
fighting it doesn't actually
work very well.

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:40.150
Look at the music industry.

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:43.270
The music industry's been
fighting copying through

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:48.830
copyright law for over a decade,
and it has done very

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:49.700
little good for it.

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.480
I'll close on this note.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.560
The music industry has, I think,
failed miserably at

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:59.410
stemming the perils
of copying for it.

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:01.550
Has that destroyed music?

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:02.900
Quite the opposite, right?

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.900
So if you think about music
today from the point of view

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.300
of us as consumers,
it's a golden age.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.880
There's more music available,
online and elsewhere, than

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.000
ever before.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.800
So 20 years ago, you walked
into the biggest record

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.260
store-- let's say Tower
Records up on Sunset--

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:21.900
it didn't have 1/100th of what
you could find in a second on

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.750
Amazon and iTunes and
any number of

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:25.830
other legal music sites.

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:27.730
So from a consumer's point of
view, there's tons of music,

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:29.650
great music, it's all out there,
much more accessible,

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:31.590
much more easily found.

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:34.580
From a producer point of view,
is it a worse situation?

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:35.910
Well, it depends.

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:38.720
If you ask certain acts who've
be around for a long time,

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:39.830
they'll say, yes,
it's terrible.

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:42.410
If you ask music industry
executives, they'll tell you

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:43.500
it's horrible.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.960
But if you ask musicians,
it's divided.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.150
So a lot of the same
technologies that allow for

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:50.990
the basic idea of the
internet, of digital

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:53.380
technologies, of home computing,
all those things

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.950
that permitted online copying
also permit production in your

00:31:56.950 --> 00:32:01.510
bedroom with a couple of
software packages of an entire

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:04.930
album that would have, in the
past, required a studio,

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:08.200
expensive engineers, a
distribution network, physical

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.120
shipping of discs to places,
all of that.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.010
Whereas today, you can do that
on your own, and you see many

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:15.130
examples of this.

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:18.500
So music has been both enabled
and disabled by these

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:19.980
disruptive technologies.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.160
So even in the poster child for
the perils of copying, the

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.150
music industry, it's a more
mixed story than I think we

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:27.350
often acknowledge.

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:29.450
So I just want to close with
that, to say it's not just

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:33.510
about unusual industries like
the fashion industry.

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:36.430
There are important lessons,
I think, to be drawn across

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:37.040
these industries.

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.390
And that's what we try
to do in the book.

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:42.110
And I'm happy to talk about any
of those or spin out any

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.020
of these connections
in the Q&amp;A.

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.770
So with that, I'm happy
to take questions.

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:48.630
Should I take my
own questions?

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:50.040
OK, sure.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.320
AUDIENCE: Well, I was thinking
in particular with the fashion

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.020
and the food industry, and one
of the characteristics seemed

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:59.450
to be that innovation was
relatively quick and

00:32:59.450 --> 00:32:59.840
inexpensive.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.197
You didn't have to invest
a lot in designing a

00:33:02.197 --> 00:33:02.770
new recipe or dress.

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:03.780
KAL RAUSTIALA: Absolutely.

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.290
AUDIENCE: Is that a
characteristic of the areas

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:09.660
where copying works better than
in places where you have

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.890
to invest a lot?

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:12.260
KAL RAUSTIALA: Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:13.840
Yes, it is a characteristic.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.460
And one of the things that
we're careful to do is to

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.450
illustrate and to underscore
the point you just made.

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:22.350
There is a spectrum of
costs to creation.

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:24.840
So at one end of the spectrum,
if we think of this across all

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.660
forms, we might put the
pharmaceutical industry, where

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:29.920
there's maybe hundreds of
billions of dollars of upfront

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.420
cost into a particular
pharmaceutical.

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:34.575
Film can be almost
as expensive.

00:33:34.575 --> 00:33:35.630
You think about a movie like

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:38.110
"Avatar," incredibly expensive.

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:39.835
So that's one end
of the spectrum.

00:33:39.835 --> 00:33:42.410
The other end of the spectrum
is something where something

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:43.980
pops into your head
in a second.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:46.410
That could include the music
industry, which has always

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:47.530
been fully protected.

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:51.880
Certainly poetry, other
forms of short-form

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.460
writing, and so forth.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:57.480
But fashion and cuisine and
others that we discussed have

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.650
that attribute.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:00.930
So there is definitely
a spectrum of cost.

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:04.080
Now the question is, what
do we do with that fact?

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.780
Our current intellectual
property system does

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:07.030
nothing with that.

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:12.340
If something falls under
copyright, whether it's music,

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:14.580
film, whatever, we treat
it the same way.

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:15.250
Likewise with patent.

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:19.719
We don't distinguish between
the patent length for--

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:22.080
there are some minor doctrines
that may allow for some

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.830
extension, in certain cases.

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:27.500
But for the most part, patents
are 20 years for everything

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.190
regardless, and copyrights
are life of the author,

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:30.840
that kind of thing.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.699
It's the same.

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:32.679
So we don't really
distinguish it.

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:35.032
So I think one thing that would
be really useful is if

00:34:35.032 --> 00:34:38.449
our intellectual property system
had more fine-grain

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:41.290
calibration along those lines.

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:44.820
Now does that mean you can't
learn anything from these

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.080
lower-investment examples?

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.389
I don't think so.

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:50.909
I think you have to be careful
about the lessons you draw.

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:52.989
So you can't just simply
kind of extrapolate.

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:55.230
So we don't look at the fashion
industry and say, oh,

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:59.100
that means we can get rid of
software patents, for example.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.700
Though, actually, that might
not be a bad idea.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:05.190
But they don't flow from
one another in any way.

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:07.270
But it does suggest that we need
to be careful about those

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.720
sorts of things.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.210
You're absolutely right.

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:14.280
I think if we think about the
cost issue, though, we also

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:16.540
want to think about
the benefit side.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:20.840
And when we start thinking
about benefits, this is a

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.250
bigger topic, but it's
not so much what

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:23.800
you actually receive.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.700
It's what you think you will
receive through your

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:30.440
creativity or your innovation
that spurs your moment of

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.780
creation, your investment
in creation.

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.890
And I think we know from a
lot of work in behavioral

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:38.830
economics that people are very
bad at guessing in the future

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:39.510
how they will do.

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:42.600
So I know when I ask my
students, how will you do on

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.025
the exam in this class?

00:35:44.025 --> 00:35:46.330
They're all going to get an A.
If you ask people who are

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:48.680
getting married, will
you get divorced?

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.280
People say no, even
though close to

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.650
50% will get divorced.

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:55.450
So we have optimism bias
built into us.

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:58.250
And that optimism bias
also plays out.

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:00.070
So cost is very important, but
you also want to think about,

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:01.820
how are benefits distributed?

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:05.020
This is a bigger topic, but
I'll leave it at that.

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:06.270
Other questions?

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.670
AUDIENCE: So the canonical
example that you're using of

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:13.450
places where there's been a lot
of fight about copying is

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:16.410
the music industry, but it
occurs to me that the copying

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:19.020
they're talking about is more
the counterfeit situation that

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:22.400
you described, versus the kind
of institutionalized way of

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.085
doing knockoffs.

00:36:23.085 --> 00:36:28.290
Like cover recordings of a
same composer's work is

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:30.240
licensed, basically,
automatically.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.920
KAL RAUSTIALA: Correct.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.680
AUDIENCE: So it's interesting
to me that on the one hand,

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.700
they're fighting tooth-and-nail
this one kind

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.460
of copying, but they're really
good at benefiting from this

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:40.235
other kind.

00:36:40.235 --> 00:36:44.070
I was wondering, are there
examples of places where an

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:49.270
industry was harmed before they
took on these kind of

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:50.550
copy protections?

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:52.960
Or is it mostly in places where
the copy protections

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.060
became part of the business
model, and then there was some

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:58.040
kind of tension?

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.930
KAL RAUSTIALA: Yeah, that's
a really good question.

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:02.540
So first of all, on the issue
of cover songs, just so

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:03.810
everyone understands.

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:06.970
So it's completely legal
to make a cover

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:08.360
version of a song.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.460
The story's actually
really interesting.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:10.900
We talk about it in the book.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:13.950
It all stems from player pianos
and player piano rolls

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:15.500
back in the early
20th century.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.780
That was the hot technology
at the time.

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:19.940
And as it was coming out, there
was a lot of concern

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:23.520
about this company called the
Aeolian Company, which maybe

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.215
was like the Google
of its day.

00:37:25.215 --> 00:37:26.370
It was the dominant company.

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:28.710
Everybody was a little bit
worried about how much control

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:29.960
they would have.

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:35.060
And as a result, Congress,
lobbied by Aeolian's

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:39.190
competitors, passed this law
that basically said, you can

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:41.350
make a cover version of a song
as long as you pay a certain

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:43.470
statutory amount.

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:47.180
So the cover has always been
a part of recorded

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:48.830
music as we know it.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:52.820
And by the way, there's no
evidence that covers--

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.690
of which, again, there
are many examples--

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:56.990
have in any way stopped
or constrained

00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:58.240
creativity by musicians.

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:03.080
It's hard to know how to come at
that, but there's certainly

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:06.960
no evidence in favor of that
proposition that we can find.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:07.270
OK.

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:12.610
So you started off by saying
that the online downloading

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:14.470
example is a little bit more
like counterfeiting.

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:16.040
It is, in some ways.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:19.580
But that's not the only way
that copyright constrains

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:20.380
copying and music.

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.260
So if you think about sampling,

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:25.380
sampling is maybe a hybrid.

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:28.430
So you can take a short little
signature bit of a song--

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:31.110
and this was much more
common in the 1980s--

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:33.670
and plug it into your song, and
that was perfectly legal

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:34.580
at the time.

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.950
The courts have rapidly
constrained that to the point

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:39.660
where sampling is almost
always illegal today.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:40.850
Even three notes--

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:43.580
just three notes of another
song-- have been held to be

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:47.190
illegal copying, infringing
of the copyright in

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:48.250
the original song.

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:51.720
So that's an extreme
understanding of it.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.140
So it's just to say, yes, if you
just think about a digital

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:57.930
file that you find on the Pirate
Bay, or something,

00:38:57.930 --> 00:38:59.560
that's one thing.

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:01.040
But there are many
other gradations.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:04.640
And again, we talk about
this in greater detail.

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.880
The underlying question is
really, as I understood it, is

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.890
were there industries where
there wasn't copyright

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:09.935
protection, and then
they gained it, and

00:39:09.935 --> 00:39:11.185
did anything change?

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:14.940
There are some.

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.350
Architecture's a good example.

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:18.710
So you didn't used
to be able to

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:20.820
protect the actual building.

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:23.560
So this building is pretty
unusual, right?

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.220
Binoculars.

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.350
You don't often see that.

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:29.905
Until the Architectural
Works Protection Act--

00:39:29.905 --> 00:39:31.580
I can't remember the exact name
of that statute-- went

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:34.230
in, I think, 1990,
that changed it.

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:37.060
Now, are there more creative
buildings today than there

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.890
were before then?

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:40.640
That's a judgment call I
probably can't really make.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:43.080
But my gut sense is no.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.590
Not a big difference.

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:47.390
But you can also look
cross-nationally.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:51.700
So fashion is unprotectable in
the United States, but it's

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:53.140
protected in Europe.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:57.020
Is there a big difference in
terms of creative designs in

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:59.080
European designers versus
American designers?

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.865
Again, I don't think so.

00:40:01.865 --> 00:40:05.450
The people who argue in favor of
changing American law point

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:07.820
to the ways in which, for
example, French law is more

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:10.790
protective of designers as
artists, and that that's more

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:12.010
appropriate.

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:14.050
But they don't really point to
the fact that the industry's

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:15.730
more vibrant, more
successful, more

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:17.400
creative, or anything else.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.170
So there aren't that many over
time examples, but there are

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:22.130
cross-national examples,
and I think they tend

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:24.120
to support our view.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.350
AUDIENCE: So if the two classic
industries described

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:31.710
as not having much copy
protection are cuisine and

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:36.200
fashion, if they were in the
process of potentially finding

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.985
out that they were about to come
under, let's say, design

00:40:39.985 --> 00:40:42.390
patent coverage, which they
currently don't have.

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:44.470
So suppose they were going to
find out they were going to

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:49.445
get this, what would be the
reaction of the industry?

00:40:49.445 --> 00:40:51.360
And how would the industry
change if that turned out to

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.810
be successful?

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:54.750
KAL RAUSTIALA: Good question.

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:56.640
By the way, just to mention the
other things we do talk

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.070
about in the book--

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:00.360
fonts, databases.

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.410
So databases are another one of
these cross-national ones

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:03.620
where they're unprotected.

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:06.440
The content, the layout
organization of the content,

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:09.240
unprotected in the United
States, protected in Europe.

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:12.380
Our database industry is
much more vibrant.

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:14.730
I mentioned fonts, financial
innovations,

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:16.970
and stand-up comedy.

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:18.790
So those are some of the other
ones we looked at.

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:21.200
But you're right, these are
some core examples.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.150
The best one is really fashion,
because fashion,

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:25.190
that's actually a live issue
right now, not for design

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:26.240
patent but for copyright.

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:30.540
So there was currently a bill
introduced most recently by

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:34.920
Senator Schumer of New York to
amend the copyright statute to

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.650
create a three-year
quasi-copyright.

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:43.380
So it'd be very short and very
specific, but it would allow

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:47.950
for protection of some
of these dresses,

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:49.470
something like that.

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:52.180
It would allow for protection of
the overall design of that

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:56.340
dress, again, something that
was sort of quite similar.

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.610
So in other words, this kind
of knocking off would be

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:01.120
illegal, this kind of
exact knocking off.

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:03.220
Congress has considered
this several times.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:08.350
And in fact, if you go back to
the Depression, you can find

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:10.860
examples of discussions about
the perils of copying.

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:14.080
So we quote this in the book,
a very interesting story in

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.720
"Time Magazine" from the 1930s
called "Dress Wars," which was

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.720
all about the New York garment
industry and the fact that

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.640
copying was happening
so rapidly--

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:25.280
within 24 hours, somebody would
copy a design from one

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.850
house to another house--

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:28.440
and how terrible that was.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:30.640
At the time, there was something
called the Fashion

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.580
Originators' Guild, which was
what today we would consider

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:35.630
to be a kind of cartel,
a cartel of

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:37.570
designers and retailers.

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:41.700
And that policed copying
within its membership.

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:43.940
Ultimately, the Supreme Court
said that's an illegal

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:44.920
restraint of trade.

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.690
It violates the antitrust
laws.

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:49.390
It was overturned, 1941.

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:51.720
When it gets overturned, it's
the middle of World War II.

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:53.090
People aren't that focused
on fashion.

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:57.500
By the end of the war, the
original head of the guild and

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.490
the leaders of the fashion
industry in New York are

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:03.300
agitating before Congress to
say, we need a Fashion

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:07.093
Protection Act, a copyright
amendment, or else we're going

00:43:07.093 --> 00:43:08.510
to lose hundreds of thousands
of jobs and

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:10.250
we're going to be destroyed.

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:11.930
And they've been saying
that ever since.

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:15.030
And again, it's continued to
be, in many ways, a very

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:16.910
vibrant industry.

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:18.910
Now, that's not to say they
won't get it this time.

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:21.590
So first of all, the industry
itself is split.

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:23.450
So if you talk to people here
in California, which is the

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:25.530
biggest center of garment
manufacturing in the United

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:28.800
States, the California Fashion
Association is totally opposed

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.310
to this bill.

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:33.870
The New York equivalent is in
favor, and is in fact the

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:34.760
motive force behind it.

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:38.940
So there's a division amongst
the industry about it.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.200
If it were to pass, I think a
lot of bad things would occur.

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.120
I don't think it'd be terrible,
but I think there'd

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:43.860
be some bad things.

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:45.980
I think the main bad thing
would be, you would have

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:50.630
litigation over these kinds of
cases, which would be costly.

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:53.040
You would have to have a kind of
pre-clearance, if you were

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:53.730
a designer.

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:55.410
And a lot of these are small
mom-and-pop kind of

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:56.520
operations.

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.280
You'd have to have lawyers
around or lawyers on contract

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.270
to come and say, well, would
this be violative of--

00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:05.120
you can find some differences,
if you look closely.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.460
These are not great images,
but there are some

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:07.290
differences.

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:10.670
Would this be violative
of that?

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:12.650
And you'd have to be
consulted on it.

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.870
And then what happens
if you weren't sure?

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:16.900
And you'd start to get the kind
of clearance culture that

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:20.020
you see today in the film
industry in this town, where

00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:22.790
people are very worried about,
in a documentary, let's say,

00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:24.920
oh, if the TV's on in the
background, we gotta get

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.510
license because they're playing
"The Simpsons" or

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:29.310
something like that, or there's
a work of art or

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:30.370
whatever hanging on the wall.

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:33.055
So I think it would lead to--

00:44:33.055 --> 00:44:35.850
it would be a boon for lawyers,
but I think it would

00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:37.240
be costly for the industry.

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:39.910
And I think ultimately, it would
lead to less vibrant and

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:40.530
more creative industry.

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:43.020
And the reason I think that is
not that it's so terrible in

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.610
Europe, because it's not.

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:46.870
But Europe is a very different
legal climate.

00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:48.640
There are many fewer lawyers.

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:51.550
There are often loser-pays
provisions.

00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:54.280
So in other words, if I sue
you because I think you're

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:58.100
copying me, but you win, now I
have to pay all your fees.

00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.950
We don't have that in
the United States.

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:04.050
So that's a constraint on
plaintiffs bringing cases.

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:06.500
And just in general, we're much
more litigious, and there

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:07.750
are many other features,
I think, that

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:09.080
make this more dangerous.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.890
So I think the results would
ultimately not be--

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:14.440
I think the cure would be
worse than the disease.

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:15.710
Not that it wouldn't
stop certain--

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:18.350
this is kind of an egregious
example, and I feel bad for

00:45:18.350 --> 00:45:19.930
the designers.

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:21.850
But I think at the end of the
day, as a policy matter, we're

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:23.270
better off with this system.

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:26.640
So actually, we testified before
Congress about this

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.620
very issue in opposition.

00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:31.030
And my prediction is it's not
going to go anywhere, because

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:32.960
it hasn't for 75 years.

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:37.230
But someday, it might, and I
think it would be unfortunate.

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:38.810
Anything else?

00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:41.080
Yes.

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:43.195
AUDIENCE: So one area that I
think is kind of interesting

00:45:43.195 --> 00:45:46.920
with this sort of thing is video
games, where for some

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:50.770
types, like the web games, often
a smaller company will

00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:54.160
innovate, and then a bigger
company will copy but with

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:57.190
better graphics and sort of lock
out the smaller company,

00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:59.890
like in the case of the
"Farmville"-style games.

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:02.930
Then there's other areas, like
first-person shooters, where

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:05.840
the smaller companies innovate
and succeed based on that

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:08.380
because the bigger companies
are fighting over best

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:10.930
graphics or best story or things
that are peripheral to

00:46:10.930 --> 00:46:12.700
the actual game.

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.405
And this sort of exists because
rules to a game are

00:46:15.405 --> 00:46:17.410
one of those things you
can't copyright.

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:20.435
So I'm curious if there's other
industries where whether

00:46:20.435 --> 00:46:23.960
you're small or big matters
to people's

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:25.810
attitudes about copying.

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:27.696
KAL RAUSTIALA: Yeah,
that's interesting.

00:46:27.696 --> 00:46:30.360
Video games were one of the
things we wanted to look at,

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.490
and we just kind of
ran out of time.

00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:33.650
I think it's a really
interesting area for it.

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:35.630
I do think smallness and
bigness does matter.

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:37.820
So I just mentioned
New York versus

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:40.610
California, in terms of apparel.

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:46.910
For the most part, the big
names, the names that you see

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:49.700
advertised in, let's say,
in "Vogue Magazine," are

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:51.000
concentrated in New York.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.330
The LA apparel industry
is different.

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:56.970
We tend to focus here on
things like jeans--

00:46:56.970 --> 00:47:01.160
virtually all denim products are
made here in LA County--

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:04.430
sportswear, surfwear obviously,
a lot of casual

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:08.900
clothing, often with labels that
are not that well-known

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:10.510
or not that big.

00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:13.490
So you could argue that that's
an example where there's a

00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:15.250
small/big kind of issue.

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:17.630
Now that said, the arguments
that are often given in

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:21.710
Congress for apparel protection
are that small

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:24.760
designers are hurt by the
current system and would be

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:25.870
better off if they
were protected.

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:29.610
Because they get swallowed by
the big guy, who says--

00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:30.510
Forever 21--

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:33.330
it was Foley &amp; Corinna who were
the designers for this

00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:36.080
dress, small designers
with a store in New

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:37.780
York and one in LA.

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:40.720
Not a big operation, a few
million dollars a year, versus

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:42.880
Forever 21, which
is a monster.

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:45.820
So that's often the
way it's seen.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:47.180
But I don't know that
that's really true.

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:50.130
Because again, I think big
companies have big lawyers,

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:51.910
and big lawyers know how
to write letters

00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:52.850
that intimidate others.

00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:54.950
And so I'm not sure that
that's actually

00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:57.285
how it would work.

00:47:57.285 --> 00:48:00.190
You know, in the culinary
context, it's similar.

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:03.590
The people who really care about
patent and copyright in

00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:06.760
cuisine are not the chefs
at great restaurants.

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:09.940
It's the people who own big
food companies that sell

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:11.630
things like frozen foods.

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:13.220
So someone who kind of
crossed over would be

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:14.600
like Wolfgang Puck.

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.860
So he started off with
restaurants like the one down

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:17.440
the street.

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:21.220
But then he now has a gigantic
empire, and those people tend

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:23.390
to start to care more, because
they have bigger investments.

00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:26.370
So I think there is a divide,
but I think it's sort of

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:27.550
industry by industry.

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:28.590
It is an interesting issue.

00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:30.630
And then it's an interesting
question, do we always want to

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:34.210
protect small businesses
versus big ones?

00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:36.930
And if so, why?

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:37.740
That's across the board.

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:41.220
I don't think there's an
obvious answer to that.

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:41.935
Yes.

00:48:41.935 --> 00:48:44.585
AUDIENCE: So it seems like
there's a couple things that

00:48:44.585 --> 00:48:50.020
I've noticed that maybe color
the copying, or aren't exactly

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:51.450
just sort of the
act of copying,

00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:53.520
that affect the situation.

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.210
Maybe in fashion, it's
that the trademark

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:57.320
sometimes is the product.

00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:00.990
With football and the small
chefs, there's a big execution

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:02.390
component to it.

00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:03.700
KAL RAUSTIALA: Absolutely.

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:06.380
AUDIENCE: The small chefs and
the big food industries.

00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:08.970
Are there other things like
that, in other industries,

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:11.130
that affect the copying
or the trade-offs?

00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:12.670
KAL RAUSTIALA: Yeah.

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:12.970
Yeah.

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:17.270
I think just to riff on the
execution point for a second,

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:18.350
that's a really good point.

00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:20.540
So execution is really
important.

00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:24.250
And I think one of the points we
make is that if you want to

00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:27.380
protect yourself against
copying, the more you can

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:31.210
shift your product from a
digital or easily-copied

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:32.950
product-- especially
a digital product--

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:36.950
to an analog product, the
better off you are.

00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:41.750
Another thing we talk about in
the book, kind of at the end

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:46.220
of the chapter on food, is
cocktails and high-end bars.

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:48.070
So those are a really good
example, where bartenders have

00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:53.770
a very open culture, again, a
kind of quasi-open-source

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:55.380
environment for bartenders.

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:58.590
There's a lot of creativity
in cocktails.

00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:00.010
But the execution is
really important.

00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:02.620
But even more important is that
when you get a drink,

00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:04.380
it's really like-- sitting
at a bar is like a live

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:05.680
performance venue.

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:06.930
That's really what it's about.

00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:09.350
You could take that same exact
drink and put it in your

00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:12.840
cafeteria here, and you're not
going to pay $12 for it.

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.222
You probably don't pay anything
for your cafeteria.

00:50:15.222 --> 00:50:16.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:17.390
KAL RAUSTIALA: But you
know what I mean?

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:18.180
It's not the same thing.

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:19.260
And the same thing
with restaurants.

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:20.820
It's not the same thing.

00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:25.200
And so that live element
is difficult to copy.

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.680
Same thing with music.

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:29.530
So one of the most successful
areas of the music industry

00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:31.370
right now is live performance.

00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:34.020
And I think the ability to copy
is pushing things more

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:36.240
and more into live
performance.

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:39.530
And so that has advantages if
you're concerned about ease of

00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:42.090
copying in a world where
bandwidth is increasing, and

00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:43.760
you're just going to be
able to kind of--

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.640
yes, you can record live
concerts, but it's not the

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:46.720
same thing as being there.

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:50.510
So experiential factors become
increasingly significant.

00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:52.640
And that can play a role for
a lot of industries.

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:56.560
So even the movie industry,
it's under siege by the

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:58.060
ability to stream at home.

00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:02.340
And obviously, all the torrent
sites make it really easy.

00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:06.580
But yet the Arclight Cinemas are
doing really well and have

00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:10.440
gone from being one location
on Sunset Boulevard to now

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:13.900
having four, even though they
charge almost double what the

00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:15.920
national average is
for a ticket.

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:17.135
Why is that?

00:51:17.135 --> 00:51:18.890
I'm sure a lot of you have
gone to the Arclight.

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:20.440
It's because you go, it's
kind of special.

00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:21.800
The seats are great,
the viewing is

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:23.020
great, you get a drink.

00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:24.370
It feels like an event.

00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:26.880
It's not just a consumption
of a digital product.

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.105
It's a live performance, even
though it's not really a live

00:51:29.105 --> 00:51:30.410
performance.

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:35.700
So all of those things, I think,
make those industries

00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:37.910
more successful.

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:41.450
So the more you can shift in
that direction, towards

00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:44.170
something where it's live and
execution-oriented and

00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:45.430
personalized, the better.

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:47.890
That doesn't work for
everything, but it does work,

00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:51.500
I think, for many industries,
if you're creative about it.

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:52.460
Well, thank you, everyone.

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:59.615
[APPLAUSE]
