00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.930
They were an
all-American family.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.680
Our life in Boston was like
a typical suburban family.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.530
I had a pretty stressful job.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.350
I had a long
commute in the city.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.100
But they weren't happy.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.870
It made me feel like
an absent father.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.090
It felt kind of like we were
in different worlds sometimes.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.925
So they decided to make
a change, a drastic one.

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:29.440
Esther Emery and Nick vouched
their family, their entire life

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.726
savings, and left everything
they've ever known.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.160
Hi Esther.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.660
Hi.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.820
Nice to meet you.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.736
Nice to meet you too.

00:00:41.736 --> 00:00:42.236
Hi.

00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:43.070
Nick, hi.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.365
The family moved deep into
the backwoods of eastern Idaho

00:00:46.365 --> 00:00:50.680
into this 314 square foot
yurt with no electricity,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.020
no running water, and no
means of communication.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.555
So you guys literally
built all of this?

00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:57.180
Yeah, all this.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.560
All the structures that
are on the property.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.820
Wow.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.860
We heat the yurt with just
this small, wood burning stove.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.710
You just feed from the top.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.150
It's got a cast iron
bottom and a cast iron top.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.000
And those heat up quite a bit.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.350
Each person in the
family gets one drawer.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.210
It's easier than you
think, and Nick and I

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.697
don't change our
jeans every day.

00:01:17.697 --> 00:01:19.280
Are standards of
cleanliness, I think,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.100
are completely
acceptable, but also

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.810
not entirely what everyone
else in America is doing.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.500
And then this is where
we have our sink.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.250
We run water into just a bucket,
and then under the bucket

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.685
is my worm bin.

00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:34.810
And how many worms do
you think are in here?

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.050
10,000.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.925
10,000 worms in here?

00:01:36.925 --> 00:01:38.276
There's about 10,000
worms in here.

00:01:38.276 --> 00:01:38.775
OK.

00:01:38.775 --> 00:01:40.940
And so what goes in
here with the worms?

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.790
Just any organic material.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.020
They make this
wonderful black soil.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.655
And then so you'll use the
soil for your garden and--

00:01:48.655 --> 00:01:50.102
And for our trees especially.

00:01:50.102 --> 00:01:52.260
And the trees.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.020
Whose idea was it to
move off the grid?

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.630
Esther planted a
lot of the seeds

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.290
of thinking independently
and thinking

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.860
outside of the societal norms
of what people need to have.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.300
And then I think I just kind
of took that all the way

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.105
and wanted to actually do it.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.550
We knew that we weren't
going to have a septic system

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.780
out here at all, so we
knew we needed an outhouse.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.500
There's a six foot deep hole.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.390
We put paper in a
basket, and we add

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.442
sawdust each time we use
it, which helps add carbon

00:02:29.442 --> 00:02:32.610
into the carbon
nitrogen balance,

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.480
and it also helps
to mask the smell.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.530
What was your biggest fear?

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.355
I couldn't have
necessarily articulated it.

00:02:42.355 --> 00:02:44.480
I didn't really think there
would be a bear coming.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.720
I didn't think that we'd
be eaten by cougars.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.090
You know, I think I was the
most afraid of the unknown.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.030
So this is a natural spring,
and there is a concrete holding

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.124
tank under the ground.

00:03:04.124 --> 00:03:05.790
And every day you
come out here, and you

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.475
collect about this much?

00:03:07.475 --> 00:03:09.272
Yeah, we use about
15 gallons a day.

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:11.230
That's still pretty
insignificant in the scheme

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.790
of things.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:12.290
Well, right.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.000
Compared to suburban
household, which

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.740
would be using 300
gallons at least.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.500
I'm in training.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.725
I'm in off the grid
training right now.

00:03:20.725 --> 00:03:21.970
It's not going so well.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:22.470
No.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.991
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:25.464 --> 00:03:29.440
Oh, yes, we made it.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.100
Thank you.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.811
Do you member your
life back in the city?

00:03:35.811 --> 00:03:36.310
Yes?

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.240
You do?

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.455
Well, some of it.

00:03:38.455 --> 00:03:40.850
The TV was really awesome.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.540
And you got to watch a lot, but
now I don't get to watch a lot,

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.480
because we don't have
electricity here.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.870
Did your dad used to work a
lot when you lived in the city?

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.670
Yeah.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.150
Would you see him very often?

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.880
No.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.160
Sometimes I missed him a lot.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.620
But now I get to spend
more time with him.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.040
Did you ever think
that you would

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.960
be living a life without
electricity, without hot water?

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.460
No.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.610
To tell the truth, it
wasn't until I got out here

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.280
and realized that I
could survive and have

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.390
so much happiness and so much
satisfaction that I realized

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.430
this is the long-term plan.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.130
But after just a few months
when winter started setting in,

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.190
the family's dream of
a life closer to nature

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.680
started to unravel.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.790
What I felt was a
sense of being trapped.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.120
I want you to calm down.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.640
Find something else to do.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.750
When the bear came, my
husband was out of town.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.760
And I have no communication,
so I couldn't call someone.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.630
