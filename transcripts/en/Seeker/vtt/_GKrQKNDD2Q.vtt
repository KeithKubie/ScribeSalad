00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.110
Thirsty?

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.770
Would you like coffee, tea, or pee?

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:10.160
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.959
I've seen it in movies and heard it a bunch
of times, perhaps even from doctors: urine

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:16.300
is sterile.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.300
Right?

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.300
Riiiiiight?

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.300
WRONG....actually.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.500
Researchers at Loyola University have presented
yet another study about bacteria in your pee.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.190
But first, let's back up a bit.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.110
Urine is composed of 95% water.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.400
The remaining 5% contain over 3,000 compounds
-- most of which are your kidneys disposing

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.400
of waste.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.250
This includes extra nitrogen from the liver
in the form of urea, and excess electrolytes

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.910
like calcium, sodium, and potassium.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.900
Electrolytes serve an important function in
the body: they help conduct electrical impulses

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.900
between your cells.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.960
The impulses need to stay in check because
they control your hydration, blood acidity,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.960
and muscle function.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.010
Buuuut when you have too many electrolytes,
they can do ya dirty.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.660
Too much sodium causes dehydration, and too
much potassium can cause a heart attack.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.730
Urine also contains trace amount of acidic
toxins from your kidneys ANNND...bacteria.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.110
Research recently presented at the American
Society for Microbiology found that healthy

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.690
bladders also have certain bacteria in them
that are excreted through your pee.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.920
The researchers at Loyola also found that
people with bladder problems have a *different*

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.159
type of bacteria in there.

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.390
They say the idea that urine is "sterile"
simply isn't true - and those bacteria are

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.390
important!

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.740
What does this mean for those of you hellbent
on drinking your own pee?

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.810
Obviously you CAN drink your pee.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.380
Nobody is going to physically stop you.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.840
And we've all seen 127 Hours right?

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.159
If you haven't, you should, that was a good
movie.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.280
But we've all heard these crazy stories of
people surviving off their own pee.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.130
The thing is...the likelihood that they survived
BECAUSE of the pee is debatable.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.790
When you drink your urine, you put back into
your body all the waste that it was trying

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.680
to dispel, thereby forcing your body to reprocess
it.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.631
With each successive cycle of pee there is
more and more waste, and continuing to drink

00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:51.640
it will quickly take a toll on your body as
the toxins build up and your body becomes

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.040
more --not less-- dehydrated.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.740
This is especially true if a muscle is torn
because it can leak potassium and phosphorus

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.740
into the bloodstream.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.560
Still, that doesn't stop some hardcore believers
in the practice of drinking your own urine

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.330
-- the real guy behind 127 Hours himself believes
it helped save his life.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.910
There are also people who do it because they
believe it's healing.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.050
"Urine therapy" is an ancient practice where
people drink their own urine to cure diseases

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.050
and cancer.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.010
They also use it to moisturize their face
and fight wrinkles.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.420
It's a practice that has been around for thousands
of years.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.540
Urologists and the American Cancer Society
say that there's no data behind it.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.530
In other words, if you have cancer, you should
probably see a doctor instead of drinking

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.489
a nice warm glass of your own pee.

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.349
Thanks for joining me for DNews: would you
drink your own pee if your were desperate?

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.720
Or for healing?

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.530
Tell me down below and we'll see you again
soon with more DNews updates.
