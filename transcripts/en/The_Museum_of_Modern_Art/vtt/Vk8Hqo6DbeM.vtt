00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.780
What we're speaking about is not
something that's actually tangible.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.860
My personal experience with it was
when I first arrived at MoMA years ago.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.920
It's been more than two handfuls of years.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.260
When I first arrived, I had heard of
the stories of the MoMA ghost if you will.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.740
MoMA being as old as it is and having as
many changes that have taken place here

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.200
you expect these things to occur, I imagine.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.640
Let's make our way inside...

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.840
Right here, in this specific space

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.920
I remember...

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.800
it's just like right on queue.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:02.760
What's to say that there isn't a whole other world
that maybe we can't see or we don't want to see?

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.120
It was just here about the figure of
an average-sized man I think

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:20.880
but it was just this grayish embodiment
of something spectral and I won't forget it.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.120
It was very clear, and I did this doubletake.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.200
And when I looked back, that's when the
projectionist said to me, "Did you see it?"

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.800
And I said, "Yeah, I think I saw a shadow,"
and he said, "That's the ghost."

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.760
I believe there is an area of the museum;
I can't remember which gallery specifically

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.920
but there used to be a hotel in that location
and that there is a "lady in white" that security

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.320
has encountered late at night.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.600
Dave?

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.320
Yeah?

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.900
Oh, good, you're here.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.880
We have some people inquiring
about the MoMA ghost.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.320
I've seen ghosts.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.360
You know, there's this theory
that ghosts can't cross water.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.800
So I grew up on an island off the coast of
Maine, and so if you live on an island

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.480
all the people who've died there are trapped on
that island because they can't cross water.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.920
So, it was pretty haunted island.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.000
That's all I'm going to say.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.560
Yeah, I was pretty much down here with a
Cimex machine which is used to clean this.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.280
And for some reason in the middle of it I
looked up and the person was standing right

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.400
there on the top looking just down.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.320
It was like an old lady dressed in white.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.800
I looked back again and then I just went downstairs.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.160
I didn't even wait for the elevator
I just ran down.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.880
Security was making the rounds, and one time
late at night a guard apparently saw a ghost.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.760
It was up in this area and apparently they
left the building and quit their job at that point.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:18.080
My sense is that this is related to the liquid
nitrogen because it's not a familiar sound

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:25.109
and so I think somehow my tank of
liquid nitrogen actually played a role.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.600
And it looks a little bit like a ghost, too.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.840
If you believe in something, it will happen,
but if you don't believe in it, it's not existent.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.760
So, Mike Moen was an official.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.680
He used to work here.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.240
That's a long time ago.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.720
I used to have hair in my head then.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.800
So he told me that this curtain at night,
it opens and closes by themselves.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.480
Close and open, close and open.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.960
The reason why I kind of believe what he said
to me because no one is here and there was

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.960
no one to turn that on back and forth.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.000
I would be running!

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.120
It was only myself and a
gentleman by the name of Sixto

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.360
only persons who have access to this.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.520
As I stand on that side of the door, you'll hear
a bunch of banging and commotion going on.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.200
This door but from the inside, and that was the
scariest thing when those doors start shaking.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.560
It was almost impossible.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.920
As big as I am, I ran out of this building.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.040
It is very creepy because one does feel a
kind of presence, and I think that has to

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.800
do with the fact that the building
was built over 100 years ago.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.400
It was a school for decades and decades, and
then all of a sudden it wasn't a school

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.520
and it was abandoned.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.960
And all these experiences and memories kind
of accumulated in the crevices of the building.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.880
And one can actually feel that especially
when you're here alone and sometimes at night.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.400
All art has to do with ghosts in some ways
because art is about persisting past the life

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.000
of the person who made it.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.640
So you're feeling the presence of something
that should be absent or is absent, and that's

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.440
really what a ghost is; it's when
something appears that shouldn't be there.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:21.080
This is not something that you can actually
discuss unless you have some experience in it

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.160
or unless you know people who have
because I've known people, but...

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.440
[nervous laughter]

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.440
Whatever the entity is,
it has a sense of humor.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.160
And if that is the case, I'm okay with it!
