JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Hi,
I'm Jarek Wilkiewicz.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.670
And I want to tell you about
the fun holiday project

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.730
I got to work on last year.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.990
Every year, a few
Googlers get together

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.560
to pinpoint where Santa is
on his journey from the North

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.410
Pole.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.720
To help users pass the time
while waiting for Santa,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.120
we built the open source Google
Santa Tracker app for Android.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.580
The app contains several fun
activities for its users.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.950
For example, one can balance
sweets on candy canes,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.990
try to find the matching bunny,
or snap a jet pack on an elf

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.510
and catch flying candy,
my personal favorite.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.530
In addition to my fondness
for the elf jet pack game,

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.440
let me share another
little secret with you.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.850
I am a pretty forgetful person.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.190
Oftentimes, I use
and enjoy an app,

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.630
and then I forget all about it.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.020
What's even more scary is
knowing that I am not alone.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.140
While users install more
and more mobile apps,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.570
many of the apps just
sit there, forgotten.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.380
So I thought to
myself, I can't let

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.090
this happen to Santa Tracker.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.185
I need to save elf jet
pack from obscurity.

00:01:05.185 --> 00:01:07.140
But how?

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.790
Personally, I often
rely on the Google app

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.800
to keep track of stuff
I'm likely to forget.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.390
Wouldn't it would be nice
if the Google app knew

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.320
how to take me back
into the elf jet pack

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.680
without having to remember
which app to launch

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.260
and what button to tap?

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.630
But how can a developer make
it possible for the user

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.340
to find the elf jet
pack with Google Search?

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.400
Let's think about
it for a second.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.580
To get me back into the
elf jet pack activity,

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.470
the Google app needs
to know that a,

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.580
I use the Santa Tracker app
to play elf jet pack and b,

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.330
how to get me back
into the game I played.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.020
The former can be achieved
using the App Indexing

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.020
API, the latter, by adding
support for deep links.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.780
Let's start with the deep links.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.970
What are deep links?

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.470
Think of them as a way to
identify a specific piece

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.270
of content or
functionality inside

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.220
of the mobile application, much
like web URLs, but for apps.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.070
You can see an example here.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.080
The deep links supported
by Santa Tracker

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.350
are exposed using
intent filters.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.240
In this instance,
the intent filter

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.820
tells Android to route view
intents matching the deep link

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.850
to the jet pack activity.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.690
OK, we're done
setting up deep links.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.210
Now, we need to let the Google
app know that I actually

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.090
play the elf jet pack.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.160
We can do this by integrating
the App Indexing API

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.130
into the activity life cycle.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.910
Here's what we need to do.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.810
First, create the
Google Play services API

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.920
client in onCreate.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.870
Next, when the activity starts,
use the App Indexing API

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.550
to provide the screen title and
the corresponding deep link.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.800
Finally, when the
activity stops,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.020
we record the end of the view.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.530
And that's all there is to it.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.590
By adding just a
few lines of code

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.510
and configuring the
AndroidManifest.xml,

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.820
Google Search can help users
reengage with apps they already

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.070
have.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.000
There are many ways
the App Indexing

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.950
API can apply to your app.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.750
For instance, if you are
building a recipe app,

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.020
Google Search could
let your user jump back

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.900
into the recipe
they forgot about,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.090
or if you were developing
a hotel reservation app,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.350
your user could return to
the hotel view they were

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.850
in before they got distracted.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.710
If you would like to learn more
about how you can integrate

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.500
the App Indexing API into your
own app, check out the docs.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.270
To play the elf jet pack
and examine the source code,

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.980
you can clone the Santa
Tracker repo from GitHub.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.990
See you next time.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.040
