00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:18.619
A running joke, a conspiracy, a challenge,
a raspberry to authority and (at least formerly)

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.179
an exclusive club, the members of the Order
of the Occult Hand are those journalists who

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:28.630
have successfully snuck the meaningless phrase
“occult hand” past their editors and into

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.740
published newspaper articles.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.689
How did this all start?

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.260
According to two of its founding fathers,
Joseph Flanders and R.C. Smith, in the fall

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.829
of 1965, a group of Charlotte News reporters,
while purportedly enjoying a few alcoholic

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.359
beverages, began to critique a recent piece
written by their colleague, the aforementioned

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:50.660
Joseph Flanders.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.949
Into a “complicated story of evil-doing,”
Flanders had placed the phrase “It was as

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.739
if an occult hand had reached down from above
and moved the players like pawns upon some

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.230
giant chessboard.”

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.290
One of the contingent supposedly teased, “Now
that is what I call prose.”

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.729
From that point on “The Order of the Occult
Hand” was formed and Flanders’ colleagues

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.020
became committed to secreting the phrase into
their work.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.060
According to founding father R.C. Smith, “virtually
all succeeded.”

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.430
And as they moved on to other papers, word
spread, and the Order grew.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.189
In 1967, Victor McElheny, a reporter with
the rival, Charlotte Observer, who was apparently

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:35.399
aware of the Order, if not a member, moved
to Boston where the phrase became so popular

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.770
that eventually it was banned from The Boston
Herald.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.280
One of the Order’s early evangelists was
Jay Sharbutt, who had picked up the “occult

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.759
hand” while in Boston and joined the Order
in 1978 (when he put it in an article published

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.670
by the Associated Press).

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.909
Not long after, he moved to The Los Angeles
Times, and in 1983 Sharbutt told several Times

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.430
reporters about it.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.829
These Los Angeles Times reporters were among
the most successful with getting the phrase

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:09.810
into their publication, putting it into stories
in 1983, 1985, 1989 and 1994, as well as eight

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.890
times between 1996 and 1998.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.709
In 1999, it was even placed into a story of
President Clinton’s impeachment.

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.171
The “occult hand” has also appeared in
The New York Times, The Boston Globe (9 times

00:02:23.171 --> 00:02:30.370
between 1987 and 2000) and The Washington
Times (4 times between 1996 and 1998).

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.760
At least four of its manifestations in The
Boston Globe came from M.R. “Monty” Montgomery.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.730
As a master of the Order, Monty seamlessly
placed the phrase with sentences like “If

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.020
a president of Harvard ever intervenes in
something like a promotion or a course outline,

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.519
it is well disguised, the work of an occult
hand.”

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.080
So how do we know about this “secret”
society today?

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.550
Information about the Order had been published
at various times over the years, including

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.930
by former president of the American Journalism
Review and dean of the University of Maryland’s

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.030
journalism school, Reese Cleghorn (who had
learned of the Order while working in Boston

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.150
in the 1970s).

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.430
Cleghorn wrote two columns about it, and as
a result, he received letters from Joseph

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.409
Flanders and R.C. Smith detailing the Order’s
origins (as relayed above).

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.170
In more recent years, the Order has become
less popular, although the “occult hand”

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.689
continues to pop-up occasionally, including
in weather coverage (Mark Lane of the Daytona

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:34.420
Beach News-Journal 2006), entertainment editorials
(Don Kaplan of the New York Daily News 2013),

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.850
political stories (Chase Purdy in The Roanoke
Times 2013), and even student sports reporting

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.250
(Michael Cheiken for the University of Chicago’s
Chicago Maroon 2014).

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.740
On the other hand, many former Order members
have moved on to other challenges.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.720
Pulitzer Prize winner Paul Greenberg, Order
member six times over, wrote in 2006 that

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.400
because of the exposé on the topic and “the
lazy types who threw the magic phrase into

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.110
their copy so artlessly [that it] . . . gave
the whole conspiracy away,” he was giving

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.720
up on the “occult hand,” in lieu of a
new phrase.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.459
With the criteria that it had to be “bad
enough to be spotted by the cognoscenti but

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.260
likely to get past the casual copyreader,”
Greenberg and other Order members considered

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.950
(and presumably rejected) phrases such as
“like a soft, warm weird breeze blowing

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.690
aimlessly through the palms,” and “hanging
over the scene like a shroud.”

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.951
They eventually settled on a phrase currently
unknown to the public, and as of 2006, there

00:04:33.951 --> 00:04:50.010
were supposedly 11 “certified members”
into the new secret Order.
