and eight of me today and it will speak
 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.240
and eight of me today and it will speak
about my cycle problem so probably many

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250
about my cycle problem so probably many
 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.990
about my cycle problem so probably many
of you attended yesterday at a gift talk

of you attended yesterday at a gift talk
 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.330
of you attended yesterday at a gift talk
where he introduced new architecture

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340
where he introduced new architecture
 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.179
where he introduced new architecture
components he introduced like that have

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189
components he introduced like that have
 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.040
components he introduced like that have
your own new persistence live renamed

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050
your own new persistence live renamed
 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.160
your own new persistence live renamed
room and today we will focus on life

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170
room and today we will focus on life
 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.979
room and today we will focus on life
cycle part of this architectural

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989
cycle part of this architectural
 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.590
cycle part of this architectural
components so we will stick again about

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600
components so we will stick again about
 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.389
components so we will stick again about
like that energy model we will stick

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
like that energy model we will stick
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.310
like that energy model we will stick
about life cycle owners and the check

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320
about life cycle owners and the check
 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.510
about life cycle owners and the check
events that are basis for this libraries

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520
events that are basis for this libraries
 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.430
events that are basis for this libraries
but we will have more details we will

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440
but we will have more details we will
 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.590
but we will have more details we will
have some reasoning behind our decisions

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600
have some reasoning behind our decisions
 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.920
have some reasoning behind our decisions
so if you attended yesterday it's really

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930
so if you attended yesterday it's really
 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.020
so if you attended yesterday it's really
still interesting if you did it at end

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030
still interesting if you did it at end
 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.150
still interesting if you did it at end
yesterday we will reintroduce all of the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160
yesterday we will reintroduce all of the
 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.139
yesterday we will reintroduce all of the
things so you're going to send

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149
things so you're going to send
 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.179
things so you're going to send
everything and so let's see what we have

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189
everything and so let's see what we have
 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.080
everything and so let's see what we have
today and today we have a in activity a

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090
today and today we have a in activity a
 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.920
today and today we have a in activity a

light lines and this lines are results
 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.580
light lines and this lines are results
of very natural process like Google Play

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590
of very natural process like Google Play

services ask you to register them in all

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960
services ask you to register them in all
 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.440
services ask you to register them in all
start methods your own components need

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
start methods your own components need
 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.870
start methods your own components need
to know about its lifecycle events so

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880
to know about its lifecycle events so
 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.020
to know about its lifecycle events so
you need to forward them in some kind of

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030
you need to forward them in some kind of
 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.640
you need to forward them in some kind of
API and correspondingly and on stock

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650
API and correspondingly and on stock
 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.940
API and correspondingly and on stock
method you have to call all pairing

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950
method you have to call all pairing
 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.310
method you have to call all pairing
stock methods and it's very easy to

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320
stock methods and it's very easy to
 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.130
stock methods and it's very easy to
forget one and this will result in sub

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140
forget one and this will result in sub
 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.929
forget one and this will result in sub
feedback it will drain a users battery

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939
feedback it will drain a users battery
 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.319
feedback it will drain a users battery
and they will enjoy your app a bit less

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329
and they will enjoy your app a bit less
 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.480
and they will enjoy your app a bit less
which is probably helpful for them but

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490
which is probably helpful for them but
 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.780
which is probably helpful for them but
you think that's bad and I think that

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790
you think that's bad and I think that
 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.780
you think that's bad and I think that
answer on this situation is introduced

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790
answer on this situation is introduced
 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.910
answer on this situation is introduced
by cycle aware components so components

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920
by cycle aware components so components
 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.160
by cycle aware components so components
which handle life cycle and the first

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170
which handle life cycle and the first
 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.440
which handle life cycle and the first
step in this direction is to introduce

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450
step in this direction is to introduce
 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.809
step in this direction is to introduce
life cycle the first class citizen so

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819
life cycle the first class citizen so
 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.000
life cycle the first class citizen so
it's a very simple of which answer you

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010
it's a very simple of which answer you
 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.250
it's a very simple of which answer you
question what is the current state right

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260
question what is the current state right
 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.039
question what is the current state right
now and notify you about new events and

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049
now and notify you about new events and
 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.440
now and notify you about new events and
then note which is important but sounds

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450
then note which is important but sounds
 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.670
then note which is important but sounds
ridiculous right now

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680
ridiculous right now
 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.220
ridiculous right now
events and states are different things

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230
events and states are different things
 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.210
events and states are different things
so let's see what I mean your case is it

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220
so let's see what I mean your case is it
 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.300
so let's see what I mean your case is it
associated in initialized state and all

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310
associated in initialized state and all
 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.170
associated in initialized state and all
creation phases

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180
creation phases
 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.259
creation phases
fans very recently on create created

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269
fans very recently on create created
 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.000
fans very recently on create created
state i'll start started state same

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010
state i'll start started state same
 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.520
state i'll start started state same
thing for resume but the row down is

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530
thing for resume but the row down is
 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.589
thing for resume but the row down is
between more interesting so on pulse

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599
between more interesting so on pulse
 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.069
between more interesting so on pulse
event leaves you from resume state back

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079
event leaves you from resume state back
 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.050
event leaves you from resume state back
to the started state let's do the new

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060
to the started state let's do the new
 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.479
to the started state let's do the new
bow state or something like that and a

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489
bow state or something like that and a
 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.149
bow state or something like that and a
reason for this is from a system

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159
reason for this is from a system
 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.330
reason for this is from a system
perspective this stay state after on

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340
perspective this stay state after on
 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.280
perspective this stay state after on
pulse event and a certain event are the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290
pulse event and a certain event are the
 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.979
pulse event and a certain event are the
same because the sets of actions if you

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989
same because the sets of actions if you
 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.160
same because the sets of actions if you
are allowed to do is the same and the

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170
are allowed to do is the same and the
 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.309
are allowed to do is the same and the
same is true for on stop and the created

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319
same is true for on stop and the created
 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.460
same is true for on stop and the created
state and last event is on destroyed

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470
state and last event is on destroyed
 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.740
state and last event is on destroyed
it's pretty straightforward it brings it

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750
it's pretty straightforward it brings it
 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.750
it's pretty straightforward it brings it
to destroyed state your activities

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760
to destroyed state your activities
 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.580
to destroyed state your activities
destroy it is going to be thrown away

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590
destroy it is going to be thrown away
 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.479
destroy it is going to be thrown away
and garbage collected well so let's make

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489
and garbage collected well so let's make
 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.069
and garbage collected well so let's make
our component life cycle where that's

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079
our component life cycle where that's
 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.930
our component life cycle where that's
super straightforward we take it with

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940
super straightforward we take it with
 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.170
super straightforward we take it with
life cycle observer interface it sends

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180
life cycle observer interface it sends
 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.689
life cycle observer interface it sends
the interface to get actual events we

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:35.699
the interface to get actual events we
 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:40.339
the interface to get actual events we
add annotation and pass the events that

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349
add annotation and pass the events that
 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.349
add annotation and pass the events that
we are interested in you can pass

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359
we are interested in you can pass
 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.150
we are interested in you can pass
multiple events if you want some like

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160
multiple events if you want some like
 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.939
multiple events if you want some like
last step is to add ourselves as an

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949
last step is to add ourselves as an
 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:51.349
last step is to add ourselves as an
observer and we may have a potential

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359
observer and we may have a potential
 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.020
observer and we may have a potential
problem here

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030
problem here
 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.150
problem here
what if activity is already started at

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160
what if activity is already started at
 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.330
what if activity is already started at
this point does this mean that we are

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340
this point does this mean that we are
 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.020
this point does this mean that we are
going to receive on stop event and we

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030
going to receive on stop event and we
 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.210
going to receive on stop event and we
are not even we didn't receive on start

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220
are not even we didn't receive on start
 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.789
are not even we didn't receive on start
and our component probably is not ready

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799
and our component probably is not ready
 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.409
and our component probably is not ready
for this but we took care of it and we

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.419
for this but we took care of it and we
 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.059
for this but we took care of it and we
bring them observer to the correct state

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069
bring them observer to the correct state
 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.710
bring them observer to the correct state
so what does this mean let's take this

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720
so what does this mean let's take this
 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.110
so what does this mean let's take this
example which I just discussed from a

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120
example which I just discussed from a
 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.810
example which I just discussed from a
teaching perspective on start and

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820
teaching perspective on start and
 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.879
teaching perspective on start and
uncreate already happen and after that

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889
uncreate already happen and after that
 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.350
uncreate already happen and after that
we add an observer

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360

many of you may be interested in it lets
you do things like session management to

00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:17.279
you do things like session management to
 

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:18.919
you do things like session management to
track a particular session across

00:08:18.919 --> 00:08:18.929
track a particular session across
 

00:08:18.929 --> 00:08:21.949

for this it's the composite lifecycle of
 

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.110
for this it's the composite lifecycle of
all the activities in your app so

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120
all the activities in your app so
 

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.639
all the activities in your app so
there's no configuration changes to

process of lifecycle owner just stays

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:46.230
process of lifecycle owner just stays
 

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.079
process of lifecycle owner just stays
alive through the whole process but that

00:08:48.079 --> 00:08:48.089
alive through the whole process but that
 

00:08:48.089 --> 00:08:48.920
alive through the whole process but that
also means that you don't

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:48.930
also means that you don't
 

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.750
also means that you don't

death like we mentioned earlier so that

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680
death like we mentioned earlier so that
 

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.030
death like we mentioned earlier so that
means that you don't have to handle

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.040
means that you don't have to handle
 

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.200
means that you don't have to handle
saving and restoring that state but at

saving and restoring that state but at
 

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:58.490
saving and restoring that state but at
the same time you need to remember to

00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:58.500
the same time you need to remember to
 

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.350
the same time you need to remember to
re-register these process life cycle

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360
re-register these process life cycle
 

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.510

you don't want to do that if the
 

00:10:13.589 --> 00:10:15.320
you don't want to do that if the
activity happens to become visible again

then you want to do it so we realize

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:18.510
then you want to do it so we realize
 

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.420
then you want to do it so we realize
that this is a very common problem and

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:20.430
that this is a very common problem and
 

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.220
that this is a very common problem and
we wanted to solve this with a

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:22.230
we wanted to solve this with a
 

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.260
we wanted to solve this with a
higher-level component which we call

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:24.270
higher-level component which we call
 

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.560
higher-level component which we call
light data we look at the light data in

it's actually an observable data holder
it just holds on to some information

it just holds on to some information
 

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:37.160
it just holds on to some information
that you can observe now the difference

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:37.170
that you can observe now the difference
 

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.750
that you can observe now the difference

aware it knows about Android life cycles

00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279
aware it knows about Android life cycles
 

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:49.610
aware it knows about Android life cycles
and when you want to observe a light

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:49.620
and when you want to observe a light
 

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.800
and when you want to observe a light
data you can pass in this life cycle so

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:51.810
data you can pass in this life cycle so
 

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:54.139
data you can pass in this life cycle so
that it can manage your subscription

00:10:54.139 --> 00:10:54.149
that it can manage your subscription
 

00:10:54.149 --> 00:10:56.150
that it can manage your subscription
nice thing about light it is that you

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160
nice thing about light it is that you
 

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.630
nice thing about light it is that you
observe and that's all you do so we look

00:10:59.630 --> 00:10:59.640
observe and that's all you do so we look
 

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.490
observe and that's all you do so we look
at the usage example let's say we have

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.500
at the usage example let's say we have
 

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.809
at the usage example let's say we have
an activity receiver

00:11:02.809 --> 00:11:02.819
an activity receiver
 

00:11:02.819 --> 00:11:04.519
an activity receiver
like data from somewhere doesn't really

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:04.529
like data from somewhere doesn't really
 

00:11:04.529 --> 00:11:08.059
like data from somewhere doesn't really
matter and then we call observable and

00:11:08.059 --> 00:11:08.069
matter and then we call observable and
 

00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:10.429
matter and then we call observable and
we are calling observe we are passing

00:11:10.429 --> 00:11:10.439
we are calling observe we are passing
 

00:11:10.439 --> 00:11:13.639
we are calling observe we are passing
this which is the lifecycle owner this

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:13.649
this which is the lifecycle owner this
 

00:11:13.649 --> 00:11:15.349
this which is the lifecycle owner this
all you need to say I want to observe

00:11:15.349 --> 00:11:15.359
all you need to say I want to observe
 

00:11:15.359 --> 00:11:18.079
all you need to say I want to observe
this fly data within this lifecycle

00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:18.089
this fly data within this lifecycle
 

00:11:18.089 --> 00:11:21.169
this fly data within this lifecycle
which also means if this lifecycle is

00:11:21.169 --> 00:11:21.179
which also means if this lifecycle is
 

00:11:21.179 --> 00:11:23.299
which also means if this lifecycle is
gone I don't want to observe it or if

00:11:23.299 --> 00:11:23.309
gone I don't want to observe it or if
 

00:11:23.309 --> 00:11:25.939
gone I don't want to observe it or if
this lifecycle is stopped I don't want

00:11:25.939 --> 00:11:25.949
this lifecycle is stopped I don't want
 

00:11:25.949 --> 00:11:31.340
this lifecycle is stopped I don't want
to receive events and then once you do

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:31.350
to receive events and then once you do
 

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.049
to receive events and then once you do
this this all you do you don't need to

00:11:33.049 --> 00:11:33.059
this this all you do you don't need to
 

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:35.389
this this all you do you don't need to
write on start on so we want Android to

00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399
write on start on so we want Android to
 

00:11:35.399 --> 00:11:37.639
write on start on so we want Android to
want to more look like this you

00:11:37.639 --> 00:11:37.649
want to more look like this you
 

00:11:37.649 --> 00:11:38.960
want to more look like this you
initialize think is more like

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:38.970
initialize think is more like
 

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.029
initialize think is more like
fire-and-forget you initialize and you

00:11:41.029 --> 00:11:41.039
fire-and-forget you initialize and you
 

00:11:41.039 --> 00:11:41.979
fire-and-forget you initialize and you
are done

00:11:41.979 --> 00:11:41.989
are done
 

00:11:41.989 --> 00:11:44.929
are done
so let's look at what happens when our

00:11:44.929 --> 00:11:44.939
so let's look at what happens when our
 

00:11:44.939 --> 00:11:46.999
so let's look at what happens when our
activity starts observing that live data

00:11:46.999 --> 00:11:47.009
activity starts observing that live data
 

00:11:47.009 --> 00:11:49.969
activity starts observing that live data
so on create it called observe with it

00:11:49.969 --> 00:11:49.979
so on create it called observe with it
 

00:11:49.979 --> 00:11:53.269
so on create it called observe with it
live data is observable and as soon as

00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279
live data is observable and as soon as
 

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:55.699
live data is observable and as soon as
activity start it starts receiving data

00:11:55.699 --> 00:11:55.709
activity start it starts receiving data
 

00:11:55.709 --> 00:11:58.279
activity start it starts receiving data
changes so whenever the light its value

00:11:58.279 --> 00:11:58.289
changes so whenever the light its value
 

00:11:58.289 --> 00:12:01.249
changes so whenever the light its value
changes we dispatch that event back to

00:12:01.249 --> 00:12:01.259
changes we dispatch that event back to
 

00:12:01.259 --> 00:12:03.590
changes we dispatch that event back to
your observer inside the activity it can

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600
your observer inside the activity it can
 

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.989
your observer inside the activity it can
also be a fragment let's say user

00:12:05.989 --> 00:12:05.999
also be a fragment let's say user
 

00:12:05.999 --> 00:12:08.239
also be a fragment let's say user
decides rotate the activity at this

00:12:08.239 --> 00:12:08.249
decides rotate the activity at this
 

00:12:08.249 --> 00:12:10.340
decides rotate the activity at this
moment so you know that the activity

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:10.350
moment so you know that the activity
 

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.409
moment so you know that the activity
will be stopped and what happens at the

00:12:12.409 --> 00:12:12.419
will be stopped and what happens at the
 

00:12:12.419 --> 00:12:14.689
will be stopped and what happens at the
same time the light Atta happens to be

00:12:14.689 --> 00:12:14.699
same time the light Atta happens to be
 

00:12:14.699 --> 00:12:17.719
same time the light Atta happens to be
updated if that happens we are not going

00:12:17.719 --> 00:12:17.729
updated if that happens we are not going
 

00:12:17.729 --> 00:12:19.669
updated if that happens we are not going
to tell the activity about this change

00:12:19.669 --> 00:12:19.679
to tell the activity about this change
 

00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:22.189
to tell the activity about this change
because there cannot be any reason for

00:12:22.189 --> 00:12:22.199
because there cannot be any reason for
 

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:24.739
because there cannot be any reason for
you to update the UI because it's

00:12:24.739 --> 00:12:24.749
you to update the UI because it's
 

00:12:24.749 --> 00:12:28.249
you to update the UI because it's
already stopped similarly if the

00:12:28.249 --> 00:12:28.259
already stopped similarly if the
 

00:12:28.259 --> 00:12:29.869
already stopped similarly if the
activity's destroy it we will

00:12:29.869 --> 00:12:29.879
activity's destroy it we will
 

00:12:29.879 --> 00:12:31.879
activity's destroy it we will
automatically remove the subscription

00:12:31.879 --> 00:12:31.889
automatically remove the subscription
 

00:12:31.889 --> 00:12:33.649
automatically remove the subscription
because that activity is gone we know

00:12:33.649 --> 00:12:33.659
because that activity is gone we know
 

00:12:33.659 --> 00:12:36.079
because that activity is gone we know
about it there is no reason to keep a

00:12:36.079 --> 00:12:36.089
about it there is no reason to keep a
 

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:39.319
about it there is no reason to keep a
reference back to that activity now we

00:12:39.319 --> 00:12:39.329
reference back to that activity now we
 

00:12:39.329 --> 00:12:41.389
reference back to that activity now we
say the activity was rotated so you know

00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:41.399
say the activity was rotated so you know
 

00:12:41.399 --> 00:12:43.189
say the activity was rotated so you know
that Android is going to recreate that

00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:43.199
that Android is going to recreate that
 

00:12:43.199 --> 00:12:46.309
that Android is going to recreate that
activity and then we are observing the

00:12:46.309 --> 00:12:46.319
activity and then we are observing the
 

00:12:46.319 --> 00:12:48.799
activity and then we are observing the
same light data back as soon as the

00:12:48.799 --> 00:12:48.809
same light data back as soon as the
 

00:12:48.809 --> 00:12:50.719
same light data back as soon as the
activity starts it's going to receive

00:12:50.719 --> 00:12:50.729
activity starts it's going to receive
 

00:12:50.729 --> 00:12:55.159
activity starts it's going to receive
lost available data so your UI is going

00:12:55.159 --> 00:12:55.169
lost available data so your UI is going
 

00:12:55.169 --> 00:12:57.529
lost available data so your UI is going
to have the data before it gets a chance

00:12:57.529 --> 00:12:57.539
to have the data before it gets a chance
 

00:12:57.539 --> 00:13:01.939
to have the data before it gets a chance
to draw so similarly I say user hit the

00:13:01.939 --> 00:13:01.949
to draw so similarly I say user hit the
 

00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:03.439
to draw so similarly I say user hit the
home button which means the activity

00:13:03.439 --> 00:13:03.449
home button which means the activity
 

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:06.079
home button which means the activity
will be stopped again if the lighting

00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:06.089
will be stopped again if the lighting
 

00:13:06.089 --> 00:13:08.719
will be stopped again if the lighting
changes while the activity stops it's

00:13:08.719 --> 00:13:08.729
changes while the activity stops it's
 

00:13:08.729 --> 00:13:10.939
changes while the activity stops it's
not going to receive any event even if

00:13:10.939 --> 00:13:10.949
not going to receive any event even if
 

00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:12.649
not going to receive any event even if
the data changes we are not going to

00:13:12.649 --> 00:13:12.659
the data changes we are not going to
 

00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:15.349
the data changes we are not going to
tell it but as soon as if the user comes

00:13:15.349 --> 00:13:15.359
tell it but as soon as if the user comes
 

00:13:15.359 --> 00:13:16.460
tell it but as soon as if the user comes
back to the application

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:16.470
back to the application
 

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.220
back to the application
we will give it the last available data

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:19.230
we will give it the last available data
 

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.230
we will give it the last available data
so it's why we called live data is not

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240
so it's why we called live data is not
 

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.780
so it's why we called live data is not
just a stream of events it holds on to

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:23.790
just a stream of events it holds on to
 

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.270
just a stream of events it holds on to
the data so that if any web server comes

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:26.280
the data so that if any web server comes
 

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:30.550
the data so that if any web server comes
it receives the last available value and

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560
it receives the last available value and
 

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.780
it receives the last available value and
eventually the user backs out of that

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:32.790
eventually the user backs out of that
 

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.520
eventually the user backs out of that
activity and then we remove that

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:34.530
activity and then we remove that
 

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:38.900
activity and then we remove that
subscription you can also extend the

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:38.910
subscription you can also extend the
 

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:41.000
subscription you can also extend the
live data class when you accept because

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:41.010
live data class when you accept because
 

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:44.090
live data class when you accept because
my data provides two very handy

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:44.100
my data provides two very handy
 

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.970
my data provides two very handy
callbacks the first one is called on

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:46.980
callbacks the first one is called on
 

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.430
callbacks the first one is called on
active which means you have an active

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440
active which means you have an active
 

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.950
active which means you have an active
observer and the other one is called on

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:51.960
observer and the other one is called on
 

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.570
observer and the other one is called on
inactive which means you don't have an

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:53.580
inactive which means you don't have an
 

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.880
inactive which means you don't have an
observer so don't bother changing your

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:55.890
observer so don't bother changing your
 

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.160
observer so don't bother changing your
value if it is something that you care

00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:58.170
value if it is something that you care
 

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.610
value if it is something that you care
about you probably know what is an

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:01.620
about you probably know what is an
 

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:05.150
about you probably know what is an
active observer actor-observer is an

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.160
active observer actor-observer is an
 

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.490
active observer actor-observer is an
observer who's attached life cycle is

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:07.500
observer who's attached life cycle is
 

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.070
observer who's attached life cycle is
started or resumes so it's like a

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:10.080
started or resumes so it's like a
 

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.080
started or resumes so it's like a
fragment that's currently visible to the

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:12.090
fragment that's currently visible to the
 

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:14.360
fragment that's currently visible to the
user if the fragment is on the back

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:14.370
user if the fragment is on the back
 

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.640
user if the fragment is on the back
stack the user is not seeing it it's

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:16.650
stack the user is not seeing it it's
 

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:17.150
stack the user is not seeing it it's
stopped

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:17.160
stopped
 

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.950
stopped
so it's not active there is no reason to

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:18.960
so it's not active there is no reason to
 

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.850
so it's not active there is no reason to
do any work for that fragment we see how

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:22.860
do any work for that fragment we see how
 

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.500
do any work for that fragment we see how
we can take advantage of these new

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:24.510
we can take advantage of these new
 

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.600
we can take advantage of these new
callbacks so we are going to create a

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:26.610
callbacks so we are going to create a
 

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.850
callbacks so we are going to create a
new location live data class which

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:28.860
new location live data class which
 

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.770
new location live data class which
represents the location of something on

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:30.780
represents the location of something on
 

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:34.460
represents the location of something on
the device so we say this is an is this

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:34.470
the device so we say this is an is this
 

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:38.120
the device so we say this is an is this
data holds an instance of a location in

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:38.130
data holds an instance of a location in
 

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.010
data holds an instance of a location in
constructor we just get the location

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:40.020
constructor we just get the location
 

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.930
constructor we just get the location
manager from the system service there's

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:41.940
manager from the system service there's
 

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.940
manager from the system service there's
nothing fancy here and we have a

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:43.950
nothing fancy here and we have a
 

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.460
nothing fancy here and we have a
listener whenever the system server

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:46.470
listener whenever the system server
 

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.250
listener whenever the system server
sends us a new location we just call set

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:49.260
sends us a new location we just call set
 

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.830
sends us a new location we just call set
value on us this will you do there is no

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:51.840
value on us this will you do there is no
 

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.810
value on us this will you do there is no
lifecycle handling here you just call

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:53.820
lifecycle handling here you just call
 

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.300
lifecycle handling here you just call
set value and live data takes care of

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:56.310
set value and live data takes care of
 

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.160
set value and live data takes care of
handling the lifecycle and you may have

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:58.170
handling the lifecycle and you may have
 

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:00.470
handling the lifecycle and you may have
any number of observers it doesn't

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480
any number of observers it doesn't
 

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.620
any number of observers it doesn't
really matter so we want to all right on

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:03.630
really matter so we want to all right on
 

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.420
really matter so we want to all right on
active right the way the very first

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:05.430
active right the way the very first
 

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:08.030
active right the way the very first
active observer comes we want to start

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040
active observer comes we want to start
 

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.910
active observer comes we want to start
listen to the system service similarly

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920
listen to the system service similarly
 

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.670
listen to the system service similarly
when the last active observer goes away

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680
when the last active observer goes away
 

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.310
when the last active observer goes away
we want to stop observing the system

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320
we want to stop observing the system
 

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.480
we want to stop observing the system
service now if you look at that location

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:20.490
service now if you look at that location
 

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.579
service now if you look at that location
live data cost we just created in the

00:15:22.579 --> 00:15:22.589
live data cost we just created in the
 

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:24.140
live data cost we just created in the
previous example let's look at the

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:24.150
previous example let's look at the
 

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.780
previous example let's look at the
properties of that cost first of all it

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:26.790
properties of that cost first of all it
 

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:29.150
properties of that cost first of all it
is lifecycle area it knows when to start

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160
is lifecycle area it knows when to start
 

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:29.660
is lifecycle area it knows when to start
it

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:29.670
it
 

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:32.000
it
when to stop itself you just don't need

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:32.010
when to stop itself you just don't need
 

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.790
when to stop itself you just don't need
to babysit it anymore it is self

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800
to babysit it anymore it is self
 

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.430
to babysit it anymore it is self
sufficient like you started you forget

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440
sufficient like you started you forget
 

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.550
sufficient like you started you forget
about it it can even be a single - like

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560
about it it can even be a single - like
 

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.960
about it it can even be a single - like
all of these subscriptions are

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:41.970
all of these subscriptions are
 

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.150
all of these subscriptions are
automatically managed for you so if the

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160
automatically managed for you so if the
 

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.310
automatically managed for you so if the
data is logically singles in your code

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:46.320
data is logically singles in your code
 

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.530
data is logically singles in your code
base you can make the live data is the

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:48.540
base you can make the live data is the
 

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.930
base you can make the live data is the
singleton so there's this thing where

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:50.940
singleton so there's this thing where
 

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.030
singleton so there's this thing where
like normally if you keep a reference

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040
like normally if you keep a reference
 

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.980
like normally if you keep a reference
key and activity or a fragment from a

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:54.990
key and activity or a fragment from a
 

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:56.900
key and activity or a fragment from a
static context that will be a big no-no

but if you are using live data it is yes

00:15:59.750 --> 00:15:59.760
but if you are using live data it is yes
 

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.630
but if you are using live data it is yes
yes because we manage the subscription

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:02.640
yes because we manage the subscription
 

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.680
yes because we manage the subscription
for you so you also don't need to

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:06.690
for you so you also don't need to
 

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:08.840
for you so you also don't need to
subclass it like that all the time so if

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:08.850
subclass it like that all the time so if
 

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:11.180
subclass it like that all the time so if
you just need an instance of it but you

you just need an instance of it but you
 

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:13.370
you just need an instance of it but you

alright so anyone anyone who has

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640
alright so anyone anyone who has
 

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.590
alright so anyone anyone who has
received one of these exceptions

00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:12.600

trying to do something when you just

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640
trying to do something when you just
 

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.980
trying to do something when you just
completely stopped and you absolutely

know it these exceptions tend to come in

00:17:21.649 --> 00:17:21.659

life cycles so we wanted to make sure to

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000
life cycles so we wanted to make sure to
 

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.970
life cycles so we wanted to make sure to
be very thoughtful about defining how

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:28.980
be very thoughtful about defining how
 

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.770
be very thoughtful about defining how
the lifecycle observer callbacks are

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:30.780
the lifecycle observer callbacks are
 

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.899
the lifecycle observer callbacks are
invoked and when so in a case like this

00:17:34.899 --> 00:17:34.909
invoked and when so in a case like this
 

00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:39.110
invoked and when so in a case like this
what happens you have defined to define

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120
what happens you have defined to define
 

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.649
what happens you have defined to define
handler for the stop event so in the

00:17:42.649 --> 00:17:42.659
handler for the stop event so in the
 

00:17:42.659 --> 00:17:45.230
handler for the stop event so in the
container your activity on stop you want

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240
container your activity on stop you want
 

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.490
container your activity on stop you want
to make sure that you don't get a non

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:46.500
to make sure that you don't get a non
 

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.320
to make sure that you don't get a non
changed event after the on stop has

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:48.330
changed event after the on stop has
 

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:53.840
changed event after the on stop has
happened but in but in order for that to

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:53.850
happened but in but in order for that to
 

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:55.700
happened but in but in order for that to
happen what needs to be true about when

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:55.710
happen what needs to be true about when
 

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:58.100
happen what needs to be true about when
we actually invoke all of the on stop

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:58.110
we actually invoke all of the on stop
 

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.830
we actually invoke all of the on stop
listeners and that are attached to these

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840
listeners and that are attached to these
 

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.500
listeners and that are attached to these
observers so we have to define a really

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:03.510
observers so we have to define a really
 

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.020
observers so we have to define a really
strict order for this so as we go

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:06.030
strict order for this so as we go
 

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.779
strict order for this so as we go
through create and start and on resume

00:18:08.779 --> 00:18:08.789
through create and start and on resume
 

00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:11.390
through create and start and on resume
we know that we need to invoke the

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400
we know that we need to invoke the
 

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.610
we know that we need to invoke the
lifecycle observers after the container

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:13.620
lifecycle observers after the container
 

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.549
lifecycle observers after the container
event happens so you know in your

00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559
event happens so you know in your
 

00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:18.409
event happens so you know in your
observer that everything about your

00:18:18.409 --> 00:18:18.419
observer that everything about your
 

00:18:18.419 --> 00:18:20.330
observer that everything about your
lifecycle owner has been configured if

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:20.340
lifecycle owner has been configured if
 

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.980
lifecycle owner has been configured if
you check any state about it you know

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:21.990
you check any state about it you know
 

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.720
you check any state about it you know
that you're already completely in that

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:23.730
that you're already completely in that
 

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:26.600
that you're already completely in that
state but that means something really

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:26.610
state but that means something really
 

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:28.130
state but that means something really
special for coming back down the other

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:28.140
special for coming back down the other
 

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.250
special for coming back down the other
direction it means that when we when the

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:31.260
direction it means that when we when the
 

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.560
direction it means that when we when the
activity starts to become paused you

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:33.570
activity starts to become paused you
 

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.510
activity starts to become paused you
want your lifecycle observers to be able

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520
want your lifecycle observers to be able
 

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.830
want your lifecycle observers to be able
to shut down anything that they're doing

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840
to shut down anything that they're doing
 

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.930
to shut down anything that they're doing
before the activity does all of the work

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:38.940
before the activity does all of the work
 

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.960
before the activity does all of the work
to actually become paused similar for

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:41.970
to actually become paused similar for
 

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.390
to actually become paused similar for
stop and this is where this becomes

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400
stop and this is where this becomes
 

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.860
stop and this is where this becomes
really important for the fragment

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:45.870
really important for the fragment
 

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.539
really important for the fragment
transaction exception you want to make

00:18:47.539 --> 00:18:47.549
transaction exception you want to make
 

00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:50.029
transaction exception you want to make
sure that you that you're recording that

00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039
sure that you that you're recording that
 

00:18:50.039 --> 00:18:52.399
sure that you that you're recording that
you're fully stopped before the fragment

00:18:52.399 --> 00:18:52.409
you're fully stopped before the fragment
 

00:18:52.409 --> 00:18:54.500
you're fully stopped before the fragment
system goes through and flags everything

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:54.510
system goes through and flags everything
 

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.250
system goes through and flags everything
is being completely locked out so what

00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:58.260
is being completely locked out so what
 

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.289
is being completely locked out so what
that means is that the stop event of

00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:00.299
that means is that the stop event of
 

00:19:00.299 --> 00:19:01.049
that means is that the stop event of
your light

00:19:01.049 --> 00:19:01.059
your light
 

00:19:01.059 --> 00:19:02.669
your light
cycle observer will always be invoked

00:19:02.669 --> 00:19:02.679
cycle observer will always be invoked
 

00:19:02.679 --> 00:19:05.100
cycle observer will always be invoked
before the activity on stop or before

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:05.110
before the activity on stop or before
 

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.009
before the activity on stop or before
the before the full stop event for your

00:19:08.009 --> 00:19:08.019
the before the full stop event for your
 

00:19:08.019 --> 00:19:11.759
the before the full stop event for your
container happens so this seems really

00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:11.769
container happens so this seems really
 

00:19:11.769 --> 00:19:13.139
container happens so this seems really
similar to some other libraries that

00:19:13.139 --> 00:19:13.149
similar to some other libraries that
 

00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:14.820
similar to some other libraries that
some people may have seen in the past

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:14.830
some people may have seen in the past
 

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:18.810
some people may have seen in the past
but can you talk about that yep yes so

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:18.820
but can you talk about that yep yes so
 

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.389
but can you talk about that yep yes so
when we create Europe terrible pattern

00:19:21.389 --> 00:19:21.399
when we create Europe terrible pattern
 

00:19:21.399 --> 00:19:24.289
when we create Europe terrible pattern
like nowadays this question is

react on the changes of the state so it

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:45.610
react on the changes of the state so it
 

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:47.220
react on the changes of the state so it
means that it's reactive programming

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:47.230
means that it's reactive programming
 

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.379

fit here well as well so we decided to
 

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:32.550
fit here well as well so we decided to

tackle this problem once again and
 

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.920
tackle this problem once again and

contents of an email so that if you're
 

00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:45.190
contents of an email so that if you're
on the phone you can reuse the same

need to create an interface but then

00:31:59.799 --> 00:31:59.809
need to create an interface but then
 

00:31:59.809 --> 00:32:02.259
need to create an interface but then
what if one fragment gets created before

00:32:02.259 --> 00:32:02.269
what if one fragment gets created before
 

00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:04.509
what if one fragment gets created before
the other one an activity needs to talk

00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:04.519
the other one an activity needs to talk
 

00:32:04.519 --> 00:32:07.060
the other one an activity needs to talk
to each other or like when the activity

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:07.070
to each other or like when the activity
 

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:09.009
to each other or like when the activity
is restored you don't really know which

00:32:09.009 --> 00:32:09.019
is restored you don't really know which
 

00:32:09.019 --> 00:32:11.560
is restored you don't really know which
fragment will be restored first it is

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:11.570
fragment will be restored first it is
 

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:14.150
fragment will be restored first it is
really hard to manage this same

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:14.160
really hard to manage this same
 

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.520
really hard to manage this same
well we can't really solve this very

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:16.530
well we can't really solve this very
 

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:21.860
well we can't really solve this very
elegantly using every model so let's see

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:21.870
elegantly using every model so let's see
 

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:23.900
elegantly using every model so let's see
so these two fragments actually want to

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:23.910
so these two fragments actually want to
 

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:26.450
so these two fragments actually want to
talk about a selected email right this

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:26.460
talk about a selected email right this
 

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.039
talk about a selected email right this
is what this the information they want

00:32:28.039 --> 00:32:28.049
is what this the information they want
 

00:32:28.049 --> 00:32:30.260
is what this the information they want
to share so let's put it inside the

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:30.270
to share so let's put it inside the
 

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.000
to share so let's put it inside the
v-model and we are going to call this

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:32.010
v-model and we are going to call this
 

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:34.700
v-model and we are going to call this
shared via model so it has a mutable

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:34.710
shared via model so it has a mutable
 

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:37.460
shared via model so it has a mutable
live data inside it should call selected

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:37.470
live data inside it should call selected
 

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:41.330
live data inside it should call selected
and it provides two-way simple API the

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:41.340
and it provides two-way simple API the
 

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.789
and it provides two-way simple API the
first one says said to select that email

00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:43.799
first one says said to select that email
 

00:32:43.799 --> 00:32:46.970
first one says said to select that email
to the CML and other one says get the

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:46.980
to the CML and other one says get the
 

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:50.120
to the CML and other one says get the
selected email as a live data so really

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:50.130
selected email as a live data so really
 

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:53.480
selected email as a live data so really
simple we model but now once we have

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:53.490
simple we model but now once we have
 

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:55.940
simple we model but now once we have
this let's go back to our fragments and

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:55.950
this let's go back to our fragments and
 

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:58.850
this let's go back to our fragments and
see how we can use this so inside the

00:32:58.850 --> 00:32:58.860
see how we can use this so inside the
 

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:00.950
see how we can use this so inside the
content fragment which is the one that

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960
content fragment which is the one that
 

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.539
content fragment which is the one that
wants to display the contents of the

00:33:02.539 --> 00:33:02.549
wants to display the contents of the
 

00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:04.940
wants to display the contents of the
email so it wants to know when the

fragment but we actually want the V
models not from this fragment we want it

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:19.500
models not from this fragment we want it
 

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:22.010
models not from this fragment we want it
from our activity so all we have to do

time one of the fragments call this we

00:33:35.779 --> 00:33:35.789
time one of the fragments call this we
 

00:33:35.789 --> 00:33:37.730

other fragment comes to life is going to
 

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:43.190
other fragment comes to life is going to
receive the same V model instance and I

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200
receive the same V model instance and I
 

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.539
receive the same V model instance and I
know you do the same thing so this one

00:33:44.539 --> 00:33:44.549
know you do the same thing so this one
 

00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:46.909
know you do the same thing so this one
says get the selected email start

00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919
says get the selected email start
 

00:33:46.919 --> 00:33:49.549

the content of the right but if you look

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200
the content of the right but if you look
 

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.139
the content of the right but if you look
at the details actually both of these

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:21.149
at the details actually both of these
 

00:34:21.149 --> 00:34:23.119
at the details actually both of these
are talking to shared via model they

00:34:23.119 --> 00:34:23.129
are talking to shared via model they
 

00:34:23.129 --> 00:34:25.490
are talking to shared via model they
