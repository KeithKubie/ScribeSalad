00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.680
ANNA PATTERSON: My dad was a
NASA engineer, so he brought

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.040
us on a tour at Johnson Space
Center, and they asked my

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.450
brother what he wanted to be,
and he said an astronaut.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.820
And then they asked me
what I wanted to be,

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.940
and I said an astronaut.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:14.895
And they said, what?

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:17.030
Girls can't be astronauts.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.170
In their mind, they
were right.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.150
They just didn't realize that
the future would be different.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.500
GAYATHRI RAJAN: It's hard when
you're young, when you're a

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.210
teenager, there's a lot of
peer pressure to conform.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.300
ANGELA LAI: There is a certain
astigmatism to being a woman

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.890
in technology.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.220
It doesn't seem to be something
that you do.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.640
JEN FITZPATRICK: I didn't want
to be stuck as my desk

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.090
programming on a computer eight,
10 hours a day every

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.070
day for the rest of my life.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.740
That's just not how
I saw myself.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.170
But so much of it is also
collaborating with other

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.800
people and brainstorming
and problem solving.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.600
GAYATHRI RAJAN: It's
working as a team.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.170
It's building things together.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.700
ANGELA LAI: It always
feels like play.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.570
It doesn't feel like work.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.910
SUSAN WOJCICKI: I'm always
surprised that there are not

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.630
more women going into tech,
because I think it's growing,

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.190
and there are just lots
of opportunities.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.290
ANGELA LAI: There is no
roadblocks being a woman in

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.170
technology.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.420
PAVNI DIWANJI: There are
a lot of naysayers.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.600
They're like, don't do that,
you're never going to be

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.740
successful.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.873
And so one of the things I
learned very quickly is you've

00:01:15.873 --> 00:01:18.220
got to stay focused, and you
just have to believe in

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.410
yourself and just
make it happen.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.710
GAYATHRI RAJAN: I come into work
everyday excited about

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.200
the challenges and the
possibilities.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.460
JEN FITZPATRICK: It's incredibly
satisfying to know

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.740
that you're doing something that
has that type of impact

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.150
and that type of reach.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.210
SHERRY LISTGARTEN: You really
feel like you're doing

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.080
something that's helpful and
that's making a difference.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.160
PAVNI DIWANJI: I'm able to
create something that most

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.920
universities in the world use.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.820
How impactful is that?

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.500
GAYATHRI RAJAN: Five million
businesses use the products

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.750
that I've been working on.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.490
ANNA PATTERSON: Every time
you type in a query,

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.920
you're using my code.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.110
And that means that
I'm reaching

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.520
billions of people a day.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.670
JEN FITZPATRICK: You see the
impact every single day on

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.670
real people and your friends
and your family.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.245
And that's just magical.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.160
MEGAN SMITH: Hello, welcome to
Women Techmakers live on

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.110
location at Google I/O. It's
incredible to be here.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.170
We have a fabulous lineup
of speakers.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.760
We've set up this session as a
series of lightning talks.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.280
So we want to ignite and inspire
with that topics

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.570
around Search, of course, but
also Google Glass, some

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.010
product insights, AI, knowledge,
and other topics.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.440
I've asked all of our speakers
to tell personal stories as

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.970
they walk through
these topics.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.430
And we have a bit of a theme of
past, present and future.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.251
But before we start--

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:50.253
I don't know if my slide thing
is advancing, so I'm going to

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:53.440
come over here.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.020
No.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.640
Sorry guys.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.230
There.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.520
So this is the lineup.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.920
And before we start, I want to
talk a little bit about why we

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.040
started Women Techmakers.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.700
Last night, we had a fabulous
gathering of the women, a

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.930
pre-gathering of the women
who are here at I/O.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.290
And we might be in the minority,
but we're fierce.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.420
And it was really fun, a
good social experience.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.060
And we want to build community
amongst women with our male

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.800
colleagues.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.740
We also are working
on visibility.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.520
And women are largely invisible
in technology is

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.030
part of our feeling.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.090
And so our goal is to
increase visibility.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.870
Our industry is probably 10%
or 20% technical women,

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.030
sometimes a little higher.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.110
We want to get to 50%.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.790
We want to match
the population.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.040
Products are just better when
they're built by diverse

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.750
teams-- companies are better,
the world is better.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.550
And that's part of our goal.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.400
I wanted to give a shout out
to real progress that's

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.780
happening this year.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.555
Sheryl Sandberg, who is a
fabulous colleague, Google

00:03:51.555 --> 00:03:56.170
alum now, leading Facebook with
Mark, has really driven

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.390
the national and international
conversation up.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.320
We need to be talking
about these things.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.970
I don't know if people are
familiar with the "Maker

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.420
Series." Maker.com, AOL and
PBS have launched this.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.080
It's the modern women's rights
movement's history

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.110
documentaries and really shining
a light into actual

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.940
fabulous stories, the
backstories, on women that you

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.380
haven't really heard before.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.240
And you just saw a video clip,
a montage, of something we've

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.380
done, which is called "MAKERS
at Google" down here, which

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.150
you can get to on
google.com/diversity/women.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.960
We really want people to know
the stories of the women who

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.400
build YouTube, the women who
build Android, the women who

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.800
build Search.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.960
And so we've launched this
series starting today.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.520
As part of celebrating what's
going on and some momentum, we

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.810
have a long way still to go, but
we've come a long way in

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.600
really upping the
conversation.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.440
I just want to shout out to some
of the giants we stand on

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.440
the shoulders of.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.470
This is Katherine Switzer, first
woman to run the Boston

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.065
Marathon officially.

00:04:52.065 --> 00:04:53.770
I encourage you to
watch her story.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.180
The race director tried to
rip her numbers off.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.910
It's on makers.com.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.180
And this is Elizabeth Cady
Stanton, and she's delivering

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.820
the Declaration of Sentiments in
the mid 1800s at the first

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.770
women's rights convention,
back when women weren't

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.870
allowed to go to university
and were not allowed to do

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:10.730
many things.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.750
How many people in this room
have ever heard of the

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.440
Declaration of Sentiments?

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.140
There's one, two.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.810
Looks like for people on
Livestream, we're probably at

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.320
about 10%, which brings me to
the point I want to make,

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.880
again, about visibility
and invisibility.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.030
We really have a problem
with how visible

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.170
technical women are.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.830
And so I want to jump into two
things before we start.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.680
There's symptoms of a problem,
and sometimes

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.940
there's roots of a problem.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.360
And I stumbled across this when
I met Gina Davis, the

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.960
famous Academy Award-winning
actress.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.990
Gina was watching TV with her
children when they were young,

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.320
and as an actress, she could
see that TV was biased.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.630
And she'd say in the industry,
there's not enough women and

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.725
girls on children's
television.

00:05:55.725 --> 00:05:57.690
And people would say, yeah, of
course, there's plenty, like

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.570
Dora, the "Scooby Doo" girls,
lots of people.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.570
But then she thought,
no, there's not.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.850
Let's measure.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.160
You manage what you measure.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.410
So she measured it together
with USC Annenberg.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.620
And the studies were showing--
and they had grad students

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.090
counting by hand--

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.810
it's actually three to one
across all of children's

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.610
television, the corpus of
children's television of men

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.240
and boys versus girls.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.850
And so the girls aren't equally
represented, and you

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.810
see amazing things that you
wouldn't even notice.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.890
But how many women in the
whole ocean in the film

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:33.000
"Nemo?" How many Muppets were
in "Sesame Street" who were

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.890
girls into the '90s?

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.760
That will be zero.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.090
"Nemo?" One.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.460
So we're not accurately
depicting the world, and we're

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.960
skewing it.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.714
So one of things we've been
looking to do-- and also, one

00:06:44.714 --> 00:06:46.340
more stat, the 80% stat.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.740
80% of the jobs that were held
by characters in the

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.420
television our children watched
were held by male

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.380
characters.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.830
So we taught our kids that
girls and women don't do

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.840
stuff, which just doesn't happen
to be true, as we'll

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.080
show in this session.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.120
And so we really need
to get in here.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.920
We are now working with Gina on
trying to automate some of

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.730
this, so that we can have a
gender disparity measurement

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.383
ability to look at our media.

00:07:09.383 --> 00:07:12.010
And I encourage everybody who
has technical background, look

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.490
at ways we can use technology
to count bias so we can

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.040
measure and see things.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.140
The last thing I'll point out
before we start about things--

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.010
oh, one more example.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.670
This is so insidious, like our
bias, that I was looking in a

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.190
catalog recently, and this was
a dresser for a boy and a

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.180
dresser for a girl.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.010
And the colors are different.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:35.060
But really, the big difference
to me that I saw because of

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.040
being aware of Gina's work
was that the boy got the

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.340
microscope and the
girl didn't.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.840
So as you now know this fact,
you're going to notice it

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.540
everywhere.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.830
And it's something we
need to work on.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.020
And if we could use technology
to help ourselves see it, we

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.160
could get out of this historic
bias that we inherited.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.320
The last thing I would say
before we start is around

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.380
becoming visible, includes not
only seeing the technical

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.880
women who are here today, but
also the historic women.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.320
How many people recognize some
of the people on these slides?

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.650
I see a couple hands, but really
probably these people

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.990
are pretty unknown to you.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:08.920
Ada Lovelace is represented
in the Doodle.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.940
She's from the 1800s.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.010
She's actually the first person
in world history to

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.020
think of programming
something.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.710
She's the founder
of our industry.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:19.660
There's the women who were
Astronaut Corps.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.600
Nobody knew about them.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.520
We know about the men.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.520
Some of the most decorated
Americans, of course, are the

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.050
astronauts from the Apollo
and Mercury times.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:26.570
They were there.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.180
They just weren't
allowed to fly.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.330
Grace Hopper--

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.180
this is the Woman
Project at MIT.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.070
The Bletchley code crackers, the
enigma code crackers from

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.860
World War II, more than half
women, mathematicians.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.130
Hedy Lamarr.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:43.200
Hedy Lamarr helps you have
your cell phone work.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.860
Up on the top, there's a
wonderful thing that

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.470
Singularity University launched
last weekend.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.200
I encourage all of us to help.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.340
It's a crowdsourced
history idea--

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.790
and so innovatingwomen.org.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.810
Please go there, please help
capture these stores.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.210
And last, I want to
point to this

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:57.710
picture down in the bottom--

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.690
University of Pennsylvania,
World War II.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.520
I want to bring Kathy
Kleiman on stage.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.520
She's going to share an
extraordinary story from

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.560
history that I was lucky Brad
Feldman alerted me to.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.440
He's here.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:08.980
Kathy.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:15.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.110
KATHY KLEIMAN: Thank
you so much, Megan.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.540
I'm thrilled to be here
with all of you today.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.830
And I have an amazing story
to share with you.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.970
But first, I have
two questions.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.610
The first one is, does anybody
here know who invented the

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.860
first sort routine?

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.860
It was Betty Holberton.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.700
Another question--

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.630
who invented the first
software application?

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.940
That was Betty Holberton, too.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.210
We don't know about her, because
she was never written

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.230
into formal computer history.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:51.040
In fact, her story was almost
completely untold

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.040
for a very long time.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.985
I know, because I found it.

00:09:54.985 --> 00:09:56.660
Can we go to the
slide, please?

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.740
Thank you.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.660
I know because I found it.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.330
When I was an undergraduate and
a computer programmer, I

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:02.950
felt very isolated.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.510
I didn't see women around me.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:05.700
I didn't see them
in my classes.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.980
I didn't see them
as faculty in my

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.850
computer science classes.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.840
So I turned to history to see
if I could find role models.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.500
And I found this picture.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.950
This is of the ENIAC,
the first all

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.680
electronic digital computer.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.360
It was a secret project during
World War II at the University

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.830
of Pennsylvania.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.960
And when I found the pictures,
the men were in the captions.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.270
That's J. Presper Eckert and
John Mauchly on the left and

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:29.250
right front.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.250
And they're the co-inventors
of the ENIAC-- very famous.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.770
But there are women
in these pictures.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.410
And I wanted to know who
they were, and they

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:36.890
weren't in the captions.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:39.480
So I took the picture,
and I went to a

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.720
leading computer historian.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.260
And I asked her who they were.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.872
And she said the refrigerator
ladies.

00:10:44.872 --> 00:10:46.240
I said, a refrigerator lady?

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.530
She said they're models posed
in front of this machine to

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.470
make it look good, like the
Frigidaire models used to open

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.960
the new refrigerators with
such a flourish.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.830
Well, they didn't look
like models to me.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:58.970
These women look like they
belong in this picture.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:02.110
And they look like they know
exactly what they're doing.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.300
So I set out to find
them, and I did.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.900
That's Jean Bartik in the
far back and Ruth

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.840
Lichterman-Teitelbaum
in the front.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.990
They were two of the original
ENIAC programmers.

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:14.400
And I was thrilled to learn that
all six of the original

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.270
programmers were women.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.320
So now I'm going to
take a pause.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.550
Thanks to the wonderful Women
Techmakers, I've been able to

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:27.010
bring you a short video of the
ENIAC programmers telling you

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.630
a bit of their story
themselves.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:29.870
It's part of oral
histories I've

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:31.380
collected over many years.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.963
And I'm thrilled to be able
to share this with you.

00:11:33.963 --> 00:11:38.893
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:38.893 --> 00:11:40.340
BETTY SNYDER HOLBERTON: From
the very beginning, you're

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.320
going to a first in
a lot of things.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.070
JEAN JENNINGS BARTIK: I've never
since, never been in as

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:48.350
exciting an environment.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.880
We knew we were pushing
back frontiers.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.130
NARRATOR: In February of 1946,
six months after World War II

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.350
had ended, America learned
of a secret army

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.220
project called ENIAC.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.090
It was the first

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:02.760
all-electronic digital computer.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.070
Yet the tale of ENIAC's
programming by a group of

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:10.450
young women has been all but
erased from computer history.

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:13.540
During World War II, the US had
assembled a crew of nearly

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.800
100 mathematically trained
women whose

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.380
official title was computer--

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.040
women who were computing complex
ballistic trajectory

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.770
equations by hand and using
mechanical desktop

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:24.980
calculators.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:28.500
In the spring of 1945, six were
selected to figure out

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.780
how to program the
ENIAC machine--

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:35.230
Fran Bilas, Betty Jean Jennings,
Ruth Lichterman,

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:39.650
Kathleen McNulty, Betty Synder,
Marlyn Wescoff.

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.510
MARLYN WESCOFF MELTZER: We
were competing ballistic

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.710
tables on a hand calculator.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:47.392
We were computing, and
we were computers.

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:49.500
JEAN JENNINGS BARTIK: There were
logical diagrams on the

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.100
ENIAC, and we were supposed to
study them to figure out how

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.465
to program it.

00:12:55.465 --> 00:12:57.485
The ENIAC was a son of
a bitch to program.

00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:57.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.610
NARRATOR: ENAC [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.290
Eckert and Mauchly
became famous.

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:04.770
However, the ENIAC programmer
story, the story of these six

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:08.290
women founders who created the
first sort routine, the first

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.400
software application, and became
the first teachers of

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.230
modern programming,
was never told.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.140
Their work dramatically altered
computing in the 1940s

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.450
and 1950s as they paved
the path to

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.640
modern computer science.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.250
JEAN JENNINGS BARTIK: At that
time, the emphasis was on the

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.750
invention of the ENIAC,
developing and the mechanics,

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.110
the hardware.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.060
KATHLEEN MCNULTY MAUCHLY
ANTONELLI: We were like

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.240
fighter pilots.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.980
Here was this great, great
machine, but you couldn't just

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.240
take an ordinary pilot and
stick them into a fighter

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.340
pilot and say, go
to it now, man.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.120
That was not the way
it was going to be.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.020
BETTY SNYDER HOLBERTON: I
had a fantastic life.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:51.480
Everything that I did was the
beginning of something new.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.450
KATHLEEN MCNULTY MAUCHLY
ANTONELLI: I really loved

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.034
working with those girls.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:59.569
KATHY KLEIMAN: Aren't
they amazing?

00:13:59.569 --> 00:14:06.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.230
KATHY KLEIMAN: And their work
didn't stop with ENIAC.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:11.840
They became the first teachers
of modern programming.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.730
They became the first modern
professional programmers.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:18.250
And Betty and Jean went on to
program BINAC and UNIVAC, the

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:19.800
first commercial computers.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.510
And they created innovative
tools that changed the face of

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:24.020
programming forever.

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:25.730
Absolutely amazing.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.290
And in a very nice twist,
Betty Holberton actually

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:30.960
interviewed Grace Hopper to
invite her down to Eckert

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.220
Mauchly Computer Corporation,
the first commercial modern

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.660
computing company.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:36.970
And Grace, of course,
accepted.

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.210
Thank you.

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:45.940
So now, today, I have an amazing
announcement to make.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.650
After so many years of
recording their oral

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:52.990
histories, researching their
accomplishments, and working

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:56.190
so closely with the ENIAC
programmers, I'm thrilled to

00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:00.250
tell you and I'm thrilled to
announce here that final

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.900
funding has finally been put
together so that I can produce

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.790
a documentary and finish my book
on the ENIAC programmers

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.950
and share the story
with all of you.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:17.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.410
KATHY KLEIMAN: This is happening
because Megan Smith

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.760
introduced me to two remarkable

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.400
technical women of vision--

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.520
Anne Wojcicki and Lucy
Southworth Page.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.840
And they're providing wonderful
support through

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.640
their foundations, the
Brin-Wojcicki Foundation and a

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:38.810
donor-advised fund on behalf
of Lucy Southworth Page.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.100
And I really want to applaud
them, because this is amazing.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:46.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.040
KATHY KLEIMAN: And thanks to
this support, I will be in

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.710
production this summer with the
Paul Freeman Film Group,

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.690
and we will be producing a
documentary, and we'll have a

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.470
book for you very,
very shortly.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:58.590
I can't wait to share this
story in its full form.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.880
And now I want to share just a
personal story about how I

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.170
learned firsthand what history
and visibility can do to shape

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:06.430
our viewpoints.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:09.840
Ten years ago, when my son was
five, he came over to me with

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.300
a very confused look
on his face.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.730
He had grown up with my work on
the ENIAC programmers, and

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:17.000
he had even met and actually
played with four of the

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.220
original six ENIAC
programmers.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:19.800
And he looked upset.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.480
And he said, mom, I know that
women can be computer

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.580
programmers.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.070
But can men be programmers
too?

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.690
KATHY KLEIMAN: I assured him
that, of course, women and men

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:32.820
could be programmers.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.090
And in fact, technology
was better when

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:36.290
we created it together.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:39.570
And when I left him two nights
ago, he was programming.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:43.610
And so what I want to do and
conclude is say stay tuned for

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.400
more about the ENIAC
programmers.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.520
And please join me in the quest
to capture wonderful

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.820
stories of women in technology
so we don't lose any more.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.338
And on behalf of all of us,
I want to thank you.

00:16:55.338 --> 00:17:03.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.319
MEGAN SMITH: So now we're
going to start into the

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:05.950
lightning talks.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.890
And I have the honor of
introducing Susan Wojcicki.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.420
Susan has been at Google
since the start.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.910
She's actually our
first landlord.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:17.569
And I hope she's going to tell
you a little bit about that.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:20.609
But Susan is our senior vice
president of advertising.

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:24.180
And she really runs all the
products that make all of the

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.810
money that allow us to do all
the amazing things that we're

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:28.810
able to do.

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.970
She's an extraordinary executive
and extraordinary

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.500
visionary strategic leader.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.040
One of my favorites is
the personal stories.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.190
My favorite experiences are--

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.240
Susan is always double
and triple-booked.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.710
And she adds a lot of value,
so we get her everywhere.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:45.430
And often, if you're in a
meeting and there's a lot of

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:48.150
people debating ideas and ideas
are flying around, but

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:51.790
you can't really get moving,
when Susan walks in the room,

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.360
it just changes.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.670
Within five minutes, people are
focused on a screen and

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.780
narrowing in on where
we're going to go.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.340
She just knows how to lead.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.150
She knows how to see the
future, and she's an

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:03.750
extraordinary leader of Google
and of our industry.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.494
And I welcome Susan Wojcicki
to the stage.

00:18:06.494 --> 00:18:13.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.790
SUSAN WOJCICKI: Good
evening, everyone.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:17.540
It's really great to see such
a wonderful turnout

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.580
for our talk here.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.500
And since this is a developer
conference, I thought I would

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.750
talk about a few key principles
that we use when

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.030
we're developing Google's
products.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.030
And I've been involved
for a long

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:32.590
time in a lot of products.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.460
So I summarized this
down to two.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.430
But before I do that, I'm going
to talk a little bit

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:39.420
about my personal story.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.910
And since Megan talked about me
being a landlord, I thought

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:44.020
I would start there.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.690
And so when people ask me the
question, well, how did you

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:50.930
decide to join Google, I
sometimes have to say, well,

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.900
my story is kind of unusual.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:56.320
It's not really like everybody
else's story.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.040
I actually lived with
the company

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.290
Google for five months.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.480
I don't think really anyone else
can say that, expect for

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.440
my husband.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:13.590
And so what happened was I was
renting rooms in my house, and

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:15.010
Sergey and Larry
had just gotten

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:16.590
funded for their company.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.750
And they were looking
for space, and I

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.000
was looking for renters.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:27.210
We agreed on an amount,
and they moved in.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:29.840
And at first, I didn't really
think that much about it,

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.190
other than they were renters.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.420
But then people would read about
it, and then they would

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:36.560
ask me questions.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.950
And I would say, oh,
yeah, I know them.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.257
They're actually renting
in my garage.

00:19:40.257 --> 00:19:41.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.170
SUSAN WOJCICKI: So I started
using the products.

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:47.910
And you have to remember,
there were a lot of big

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:51.890
competitors out there that were
much, much bigger than

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:54.140
this little company of three
people at the time.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.070
So I start using the product.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.990
And it was pretty good.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:04.280
And I had this realization at
one moment, because the site

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.250
actually went down.

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:08.430
The servers were still
running at Stanford.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:12.480
And it was at that moment that
I couldn't reach Google.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.420
And that's when I really
realized how important it had

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.450
become to me and my life.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:21.170
And I realized the potential
for the world.

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:24.170
And that's when I decided I
really wanted to join Google

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.620
and be part of that future.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.510
So that's my story on terms
of why I joined Google.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:33.070
So I joined, and I was
there for one day.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:39.690
And Sergey comes up to me and
says, I have a mission for us.

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.780
It's to organize the world's
information to make it

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:45.170
universally accessible
and useful.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.420
What do you think?

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:52.790
I was employee 16.

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:55.480
There are less than
20 of us here.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.130
And you guys all just graduated
from college.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:01.420
So that's like a pretty
ambitious goal right there.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:05.120
But that brings me to my first
point, which is that do

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.070
something important, think big,
and have a big goal of

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:10.830
how you can change the world.

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.620
And I was really pleased to see
that Larry talked about

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:17.850
that this morning in his
keynote, where he said that

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:20.320
there's so many things that
haven't been done yet.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.420
It's important to focus on the
great things that haven't

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:23.760
happened yet.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.870
And that's really a focus
that we have in

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.250
our development process.

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:30.920
And a lot of times, doing
big ambitious things

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.360
sounds really hard.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:36.010
In fact, they sound crazy, and
they sound impossible.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:38.510
But when you break them down
into parts, a lot of times you

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:40.660
can realize they're
actually doable.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.990
And doing really hard, crazy
things also has the advantage

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.410
that it's a lot less
competitive, because there are

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:50.330
fewer people who want to do
crazy things, like you.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:51.740
So let me give a few stories.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.690
So let me start with
Street View.

00:21:54.690 --> 00:22:00.420
So we have the beautiful imagery
that comes from the

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.550
Bright Angel Trail in the Grand
Canyon that we have been

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:04.150
working on.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.140
In fact, here in the lobby,
you can actually see the

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.710
camera that created it, and you
can actually try on the

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:12.756
backpack and walk around
and see how we did it.

00:22:12.756 --> 00:22:17.080
But when I first heard about
Street View, it was just the

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:21.400
idea, which is let's create a
way to take pictures of all

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.430
the streets in the whole world.

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:24.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:25.190
SUSAN WOJCICKI: Right?

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:27.410
I'm like, OK.

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:30.130
And then you think about
it, and these ideas

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.430
sound crazy at first.

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:34.710
But then you start thinking,
well, how would you do that?

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:37.890
And you start thinking, well,
you would have cars, and they

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:38.820
would have cameras.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.510
You could have people, and
they could have cameras.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:43.060
And then you start talking,
what kind of cameras?

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.080
And then you find people
who actually

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.690
really want to do that.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:48.420
And then you're on your way
to making it happen.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:53.470
So we just launched our 50th
country with Street View and 5

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.360
million miles of Street
View imagery.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.120
So from a very simple idea, we
have something that enables

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.290
people to see imagery
from all over the

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:02.199
world, which is amazing.

00:23:02.199 --> 00:23:09.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:12.210
SUSAN WOJCICKI: So going on to
the next big idea, which we

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:14.940
are still working on, which
are driverless cars.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.620
Now, if you think about
driverless cars and you hear

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.440
about this idea, it also sounds
like this giant idea.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.540
Is it really going
to get done?

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.560
Are we actually going to
be able to do this?

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.330
And if so, when?

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:30.690
And so there are many, many
benefits, like it's probably

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.820
the most dangerous thing we all
do, but yet we have to do

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.260
it, which is drive.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.840
And you think about
the benefits of

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.560
saving lives and emissions.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.260
And it really could make a
difference in the world.

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:47.130
So my goal is to have the
people at Google do this

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:48.910
before my kids start driving.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:51.580
So I have a personal OKR here.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:53.910
But it's just an example of a
really big idea that doesn't

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:56.910
sound possible that you
can make have happen.

00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:00.490
So let me move on to the second
big principle that we

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:01.480
think about.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:05.340
Now, when I'm working with
teams, and they are telling me

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:08.690
they're going to create some new
product or they have some

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:13.050
idea and they want to staff it
and they want to build it, I

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:16.180
ask them, what is
your insight?

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.560
Tell me something why you're
doing something new, why

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.610
you've observed something in
the world that's different.

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:24.720
And what's your insight that's
going to make this product be

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.960
a big success?

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.560
And I found that if they can
answer that, the product is

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.760
usually a success.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.490
And if they can't, then it's
often time to go back to the

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:34.810
drawing board.

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:38.410
And I think about the insights
as, because there's so much

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:40.630
technology and the world that
we live in is changing so

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:43.750
much, if we go around and we
look really, really carefully

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:47.230
at how the world's changing,
and we see new technology,

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:50.740
sometimes we can see glimpses
of how the world will change

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.240
in the future.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.980
And if we can see that glimpse,
then we can build

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.190
around it, and we
can plan for it.

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:00.700
And we can build those next
generation solutions.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.810
We can build that future.

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:05.810
So I'm going to give a few
examples, actually, of

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:09.710
insights that have been really
important to me and my product

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.610
development and that
have guided me.

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.940
And again, a lot of times these
are just one sentence.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:17.630
But they're powerful, because
it's a nugget that you can use

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:19.460
to build your products.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:22.850
So I was working on
Google Video.

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:25.570
And as you can see, we have
the YouTube logo here.

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:30.280
And when I was working on Google
Video, we were working

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.650
with studios who had
great content.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:36.560
And we were working to
bring this online.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.100
But at the same time, after we
had just gotten it online and

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.970
users were starting to be able
to see it, we had this other

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:45.830
video that became very,
very popular.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:50.240
In fact, the numbers were
significantly larger than what

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.670
we were seeing from
this studio in the

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:54.190
studio deal we had done.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:56.220
And it made me realize
the power of

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:58.350
user-generated content.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.820
So do you guys want
to see that video?

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:01.740
Yes?

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.520
Let me show you a few, just
like 15 seconds of it.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.790
But it was this video that
really gave me that insight

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:09.856
and that inspiration.

00:26:09.856 --> 00:26:11.832
[YOUTUBE CLIP]

00:26:11.832 --> 00:26:17.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.240
SUSAN WOJCICKI: What I love
about that video is that the

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.100
roommate is doing his homework
in the background the entire

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.980
time and doesn't notice.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.035
But this was an insight.

00:26:24.035 --> 00:26:26.270
I realized, wow, this
user-generated content, it can

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.050
be really, really powerful.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:30.300
And today, we all know that,
because that's what the world

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.610
has become-- user-generated
content.

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:34.460
It has its place it's
very valuable.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.110
There's also all kinds of other
content that's produced

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:38.790
professionally that's really,
really important to the

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:40.350
ecosystem, too.

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:44.880
But it was that video that
really gave me the confidence

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.840
in thinking that we should
acquire YouTube.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.035
And I was a big advocate
of it.

00:26:49.035 --> 00:26:51.270
And Google spent
$1.65 billion.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:54.880
So sometimes you have one little
insight, and from that

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.180
little insight, you make
a really big decision.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:01.510
So I want to talk about another
insight that's near

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:04.340
and dear to my heart,
which is ads.

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.090
I'm responsible for Google's
ads business.

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:13.130
Now , we created an ad system
when Google had not very many

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:14.580
people at the company--

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.560
I would say probably like 30
people at the company.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:21.060
And we didn't really have enough
people even to build a

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:25.000
search engine, let alone to
try to build and ad system

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.540
where nobody knew anything
about advertising--

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:28.110
nothing.

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:30.230
None of us had ever
worked in it.

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:31.920
But we had an insight.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.550
And that insight is something
that I still use today when I

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:36.830
think about the ad products
that we build.

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:37.980
And the insight is very basic.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.610
But it's ads are information.

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:45.870
Now, if you think about ads
being information and you

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:48.920
think about them just being
commercial information, then

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.450
the ads need to be relevant, and
the ads need to be useful.

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:53.480
The ads need to be shown to the
right person at the right

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.360
time, just like we think about
that for our search results.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.780
And so that meant we had to
build our own ad system.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.420
That meant that if you typed in
flowers, you had to see ads

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:02.870
about flowers.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:05.430
That if you typed in the name
of any book, you had to see

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:08.380
all the ads had to be
about the book.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.290
Not just for a bookstore, but
for that actual book.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:13.950
And so that's a principle that
we use that caused us to build

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:16.060
an ad system.

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.260
And if I think about
things today,

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:18.420
sometimes I'll get questions.

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:22.210
Like when we first went into
display, people would ask me,

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:23.650
how do you feel about
image ads?

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:25.440
How do you feel about
video ads?

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:29.430
Do you think an image ad
could not be a good ad?

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:30.350
You think about that.

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:31.660
Well, an image is information.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.510
Are images useful to you?

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:33.960
Yes.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.500
Then an image ad can be useful,
provided its served at

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.150
the right ad at the right
time to the right user.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.580
All of it, at the end of the
day, is about serving the

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.210
right ad and making it useful.

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:48.330
So that's an insight that
we've used across our ad

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:50.790
business from beginning
till present.

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:54.070
And just going forward, moving
really quickly to the present,

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:55.675
if you look at today,
and you say, what do

00:28:55.675 --> 00:28:56.410
you see about today?

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:58.670
What are things that
you're focused on?

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.060
I would say we have
to be thinking a

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.300
lot more about location.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.670
We have all these phones.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:04.620
The phones know where we are.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.500
How do we make all the
services that we have

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.090
super-relevant to us?

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:11.960
So you think about, all of you
having traveled, probably come

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.950
from all different places and
staying in hotels and looking

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:17.800
for places to eat.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:22.010
How many of you have actually
gotten some kind of offer

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.490
related to where you are
right now that would

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:27.220
be useful to you?

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:31.090
I'm looking, but I
see a few people.

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:33.210
They're the brave souls who--

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:34.860
or the people who have
special technology or

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:36.100
have special insights.

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.570
But it's something that doesn't
really happen yet.

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:40.290
But there's no reason it
shouldn't and couldn't.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:42.610
We should all be getting useful
information based on

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.290
where we are right now.

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:46.190
And the reason we haven't is
just because the systems

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:48.300
haven't been built out yet.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.170
And so it's just an example of
an insight and the way we

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:51.840
should think about things
in the future.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.350
So just to sum up, those
are my two insights.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:55.780
That's how we think
about building.

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.650
We think about doing things
that are really important,

00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:59.510
things that haven't been done
yet, things that will be used

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:01.010
by billions of people.

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:05.210
And to think about insights and
what the future will look

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:08.100
like, get an insight into that
future, and then build for

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:08.565
that future.

00:30:08.565 --> 00:30:11.770
And by building for it, that
will become the future.

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:14.240
So I'm very excited about the
future of technology and how

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.910
it's changing our world.

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.940
I think there are so many
opportunities for us and for

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:19.590
all of you.

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:21.860
And I'm looking forward
to that future.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:24.900
And now I'd like to invite
Anna Patterson

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.360
to come up on stage.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.330
Anna Patterson has worked on
some of the biggest, most

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:33.830
ambitious projects I've
seen at Google.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:37.390
And she's going to tell you
a little bit about them.

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:40.650
Anna is vice president of
engineering and artificial

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:41.620
intelligence.

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.730
What an amazing role
and opportunity.

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:47.390
So let's please welcome
Anna onto the stage.

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:48.875
Thank you.

00:30:48.875 --> 00:30:57.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:02.470
ANNA PATTERSON: So I'm here to
tell a little bit of hacker

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:07.700
stories from the trench and I
think with a main theme of

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.920
perseverance.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:13.730
I saw that the ENIAC
programmers, how they got a

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:16.980
circuit diagram in
order to program.

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:22.030
My first programming job out
of school was for the F15E.

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:27.720
And we would test our software
the best you can on something

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.490
that wasn't flying.

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:33.930
And then we'd invariably
need to put in patches.

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:38.240
And just like the ENIAC, you had
to toggle in the program.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:41.630
So it was very scary, since
people's lives were

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:43.920
depending on it.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.690
But also, I was thinking
about how

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:47.200
source control has evolved.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.188
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:50.188 --> 00:31:52.425
ANNA PATTERSON: Of course, my
first programs in high score

00:31:52.425 --> 00:31:53.990
were on punch cards.

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:57.140
But at home, I was really
fortunate that my dad brought

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.350
home a Commodore pet computer.

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:01.970
And he encouraged us to
experiment and write

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:03.380
a program on it.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:08.490
And I wrote a really, really
horrible, terrible video game.

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:13.460
And it only had 8K of memory, so
I stored the program state

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.200
in the corners.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.400
So they were flashing weirdly.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:21.920
ANNA PATTERSON: And I guess
it was a standard trick.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.010
I found out much later.

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:26.690
But I was from the suburbs of
Saint Louis, so I wasn't

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:30.820
really part of a burgeoning
hacker community.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.800
I eventually got my PhD in
computer science at the

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.250
University of Illinois,
Champaign.

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:38.980
And then I became a research
faculty member for John

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.530
McCarthy, the founder of AI.

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:46.220
And I see several people here
who know me really well.

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:50.590
And so you'll appreciate when I
say that John McCarthy made

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:54.210
me do something, how hard
that must have been.

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:57.530
So he made me look into this
area called phenomenal data

00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:01.650
mining, where you're given
facts and relations, and

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:03.610
you're given a big data set.

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:06.440
Big was very small
in those days.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:10.500
And then when you learn new
correlations, you can explain

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.760
these new correlations in terms
of underlying phenomena.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.100
So that's where it
got its name.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.820
And that technique
is still in use.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:22.970
But everybody was leaving the
department to start companies.

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:25.950
So we were pretty much like
the last ones out when the

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:27.540
lights were turning off.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:32.960
And I co-founded in 1998
a web mining company.

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.690
Because the web was so big at
5 million pages, we thought,

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:39.390
how are people going to be able
to get around this thing?

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:44.690
And so we had an idea to make an
automatic taxonomy and kind

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:46.930
of lead people to what questions
were answerable on

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:48.910
the web and what ones weren't.

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:51.300
Because in those days, trust
me, there weren't really

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:52.470
recipes on the web.

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:57.150
But the taxonomy around
Linux was deep.

00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:01.510
So we got angel-funded to
do this just in time

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:04.350
for the dot com crash.

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:08.110
And so I tried to figure out
what my other passion was, and

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:12.440
I said mobile is just
about to take off.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:17.800
So I moved into the mobile area
in 1999, just in time for

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:18.710
the Telco crash.

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:19.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:24.425
ANNA PATTERSON: So after killing
two industries, I had

00:34:24.425 --> 00:34:27.560
a one-year-old, and I was
four months pregnant.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.380
And of course, I was unemployed,
and I was actually

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:31.530
living in [? Pogne's ?]

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:34.070
guest room, who is
in the front row.

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:38.480
And so the doctor said, you
need to be on bed rest.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.980
And I said, have you ever
heard of programming?

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.469
And he hadn't.

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:44.730
And I said it's a lot
like bed rest.

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:47.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:49.690
ANNA PATTERSON: So
I volunteered at

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:51.050
the internet archive.

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:54.179
And they have snapshots
of the web over time.

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:57.730
So as such, especially
in 2001, it was much

00:34:57.730 --> 00:34:58.490
bigger than the web.

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:00.760
It had 30 billion web pages.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.900
And the live web at the time
maybe had five billion.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:07.500
So I did a history-based search
engine that launched

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.570
at, like, 12 billion pages.

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:13.690
And you could look at how
terms change over time.

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:17.270
So you could dial back to 1997
and searched for a term like

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:20.930
Clinton, and you'd see all these
co-occuring terms in a

00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:22.600
graph and how they changed
over time.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.510
And it was very presidential.

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:29.430
Dialing it up to 1999, it wasn't
quite as presidential.

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:33.520
And then moving forward to
today, everything is about

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:36.390
Hillary Clinton if you search
for Clinton, when you look at

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:38.510
the popularity of the
things on the web.

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:40.750
So it was a really interesting
project.

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:43.465
And I was doing it
as a volunteer.

00:35:43.465 --> 00:35:46.450
And four days after it launched,
various companies

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:47.960
wanted to talk about
acquiring it.

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:53.150
So I go from volunteer
stay-at-home mom to the world

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.920
of corp dev.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.410
So that was really fun.

00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:00.040
So that's how I wound
up at Google.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:04.010
And at Google, I really wanted
to unlock some global and

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:05.370
local information.

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:10.040
One of our examples was about
these small towns in Germany

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.910
with their local Octoberfests
and how that information was

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:15.360
really important to them.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.960
And we weren't quite
big enough to get

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.550
everything to everyone.

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:24.030
And so at Google, we
evolve our systems.

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:26.950
So just when one system
launches, we

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:27.830
would start a new one.

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:31.100
So when one such system just
launched, I came up with the

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.480
idea for TeraGoogle.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:37.710
And speaking of thinking big,
probably 95% of people said,

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:39.510
why would we ever need
a search system

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:41.710
for a trillion pages?

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:45.550
And of course, the founders
were like, is that all?

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:47.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:49.200
ANNA PATTERSON: So at the
time, it was very

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:49.970
cost-efficient.

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:52.160
When it launched, it was about
50 times cheaper than our

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.910
mainline index.

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:57.840
And at the same time, some of my
web ranking team went off,

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.210
and they shipped one of our
early deep learning projects,

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:02.960
which was around
ads broadening.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:07.560
Like once you bid on one
keyword, what other keywords

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.600
might be interesting?

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.090
So after having my fourth child,
I did what everybody

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:14.190
does when they have four
kids and they're

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:15.780
on maternity leave.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:17.740
I decided to start a company.

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.840
ANNA PATTERSON: So I started
a company, Cuil.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:26.850
And we really want to bring
a really high res, rich

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:29.950
experience to people with high
bandwidth and a really low

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:34.810
bandwidth experience to people
who had feature phones.

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:38.870
And so what we did around the
low bandwidth experience is we

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:42.820
summarized things so that a fact
that appeared on tons of

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:47.940
web pages was on top in
paragraph format with a bunch

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:52.080
of references, down to much
rarer facts that had much

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.080
fewer references.

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.676
So after Cuil, I returned to
Google, where I became one of

00:37:56.676 --> 00:37:59.720
the first 100 engineers at
Android, because this time, I

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.420
was pretty sure the
mobile revolution

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:04.310
was going to happen.

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:06.710
But it wasn't a sure thing.

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:11.400
At that time, Android had
sold 40 million phones.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.480
And of course, today it was
announced that Android now has

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:17.090
900 million.

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:20.110
I was part of the team that
helped launch Google Play on

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:21.530
Play tablets.

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:26.560
And very recently, like two
weeks ago, we shipped a native

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:30.180
search architecture onto the
phone to index all the local

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:33.030
data, so that when you're
offline, you can

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:34.010
have access to it.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:35.570
And some data never
leaves your phone.

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:39.770
So a lot of people say, wait,
Google is so good at search.

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:41.440
Why didn't you just compile
the thing and

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.840
put it on the phone?

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.710
Well, the phone is kind
of like my early

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:46.250
Commodore pet computer--

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:50.350
not quite as bad, but compared
to a data center, it is.

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:53.910
And each of the programs can
only have 20 meg resident in

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:59.300
memory, and the executable is
500 meg as hard constraints.

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:03.560
So trust me when I say that
Google's search system, it's

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:07.890
executable, it's bigger
than 500 meg.

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:10.850
So when we look at this system,
because the success of

00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:14.940
Android as a compute cluster,
it's actually over 500

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:19.490
exahertz of computing power,
which is way more powerful

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:21.720
than the human brain.

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:26.740
So last autumn, I moved over
to our new AI area, where

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:28.940
recently, Ray [INAUDIBLE]
joined us.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:32.520
And he says that the AIs that
humans create are going to

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:36.230
leave the earth at light speed
and populate the universe.

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:39.920
So we're not just working on the
most important project on

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:44.000
planet Earth, but
in the universe.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.790
So I do want to encourage the
tech makers out there, women

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:51.490
and men, to really reach for the
stars and use technology

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:53.710
to help shape the world.

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:57.430
Technology is a very powerful
platform in order to help

00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:59.100
people and enable change.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:39:59.900
Thank you.

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:08.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:11.020
ANNA PATTERSON: Now, I want to
introduce Johanna Wright.

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:14.940
She's the lead product manager
of Search for many years,

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.560
launching such innovations as
Universal Search, Instant, and

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.430
the Knowledge Graph.

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:23.680
And now she's leading up Search
at Android, including

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:27.024
Google Now Voice Search
and Speech.

00:40:27.024 --> 00:40:35.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:39.900
JOHANNA WRIGHT: Let's step
back to January, 2003.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:41.960
At this point in time,
I'm living in my

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.860
father-in-law's house.

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:47.940
He's put a nice curtain up for
my section of the living room

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:51.580
where my husband and I share
an air mattress.

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:54.450
The sun streams in, 6:00 AM,
we wake up every morning

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:57.410
because of the unbearable
Orange County heat.

00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:01.950
The air mattress has popped,
and I'm unemployed.

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:06.110
Just six months earlier, I was a
young tech exec in New York,

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:09.560
first, during the dot com
boom and then bust.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.950
But my company that I worked at
had finally shut its doors.

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:15.930
And my husband and I decided
to get on our bicycles and

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:21.160
ride across the country
to lovely sunny LA.

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.700
Riding across the country
with your new

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:25.030
husband is a lot of fun.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:29.150
Showing up in LA, a new city,
with no job, not so much fun.

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.020
Then the rejection letters from
business schools started

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.930
pouring in.

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:40.430
And it's January, and there's
only one business school I

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:41.290
haven't heard back from.

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:43.870
But I'm not feeling too
optimistic, because they're

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:46.200
supposed to interview all of
their candidates, and they're

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.860
going to mail out their verdict
two days later.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.400
And they still haven't
interviewed me.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.310
But then I got an email from
UCLA, It said we want to

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:55.950
interview you.

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:58.390
And since my confidence
had been shot, my

00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:59.745
response was, you do?

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.980
I was fortunate enough
to get to go to UCLA

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:06.470
for business school.

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:09.570
And then I got a
job at Google.

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:12.310
And today, I'm going to talk
about my career starting now

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:14.600
to Google and what it was like
to be a product manager at

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.460
Google and give some bits
of advice about product

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:19.100
management.

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:22.280
But my first piece of career
advice is that your career is

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:23.820
not going to be linear.

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:25.190
Expect to be disrupted.

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:27.130
This is a disruptive industry.

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:31.150
And you, too, may someday
be unemployed on your

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:33.540
father-n-law's couch.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:36.310
What's really going to matter is
the energy and the tenacity

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:38.680
with which you pick yourself
up and take

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:39.930
on your next adventure.

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:44.130
So let's jump into Google.

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:46.830
I was hired to be a product
manager working in Search.

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:49.020
My boss gave me two
options of jobs.

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:51.430
One was something called
Universal Search.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:54.480
Universal Search was the project
where we took all the

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.690
content from our different
backends--

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:57.740
Maps, Videos, Images--

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:00.520
and we put them in the main
search results pane.

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.480
The other option she gave me
was to do something called

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.950
Premium Content Search.

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:07.820
This is where we searched all
the content behind pay walls

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:10.480
and put it in the
search results.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.200
Both of these things seemed
pretty interesting.

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.790
And I was so new to Google I
didn't have any context or

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:18.010
judgment to make a decision.

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:20.510
Fortunately for me, I'd gone to
the same business school as

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:23.020
Susan Wojcicki, my
fellow panelist.

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:25.990
And so I asked her
for some advice.

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:28.780
Susan looked at me like
I had two heads.

00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:29.220
What?

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:31.140
Of course you should do
Universal Search.

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:32.390
That's our business, Johanna.

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:37.610
So this leads to another
piece of career wisdom.

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:39.770
What does a good opportunity
look like?

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:42.160
A good opportunity looks like
something that's strategic.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.490
If you're doing something
that's in line with a

00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:47.170
company's mission and has not
been done before, then it's

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:48.480
very likely to be a
good opportunity.

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:53.080
So let me jump into
Universal Search.

00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:57.260
This was 2005 at Google.

00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:58.660
Google was growing like crazy.

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:01.360
It was very chaotic.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:06.090
And for me, it was hard to
know how projects got

00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:08.110
assigned, what you
were working on.

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:10.660
And I got paired up with an
infrastructure team while I

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:12.730
was working on Universal
Search.

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:15.380
This was a great team, but a
team that was very focused on

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:17.280
building infrastructure,
and they didn't want

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.780
to build any features.

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:21.920
And I was a product manager, and
I was being judged on the

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:22.910
features that I launched.

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:24.660
And so it was pretty stressful,
because I wasn't

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.520
delivering anything.

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:30.280
And so what I ended up doing was
creating a set of mocks, a

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.630
series of mocks of
what Universal

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:33.310
Search could look like.

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:35.380
And then I created a little
PowerPoint deck, and I walked

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:39.070
around Google, and I introduced
myself to anyone

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:40.900
who looked like they might want
to be a features tech

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:44.040
lead to see if they wanted
to join my project.

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.130
And I was fortunate enough to
meet a person named David

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:50.040
Bailey, who wanted to join on
and lead the features side of

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.400
the effort.

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:55.900
And then the project really
started to get legs.

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.580
So here's the beginning
of my product

00:44:57.580 --> 00:44:59.540
management specific advice.

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:01.350
And that is to paint a vision.

00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:03.890
Once you paint a vision and you
share your vision, people

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:04.590
will follow.

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:08.480
It'll be a lot easier to follow
once you have a vision.

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.840
OK, so David and I started.

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.080
There was a big mountain
in front of us.

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:14.200
We didn't really know
what to do.

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.230
This project had failed a
number of times before.

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:18.250
We didn't really know
why it had failed.

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:22.935
And I had this idea that we
should do a user study.

00:45:22.935 --> 00:45:24.360
I was trying to figure out what
to do, so I said, let's

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:25.900
just do a user study.

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:27.340
So we pulled together
a prototype

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:28.910
to do our user study.

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:32.080
And once we had this prototype,
the people around

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.800
us at Google started to be
able to imagine that this

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:40.050
product might come to life and
that something might happen.

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:42.690
And so this brings me to my
second piece of product

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:45.330
management advice, which is that
if you don't really know

00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:48.080
what to do, you should
just do something.

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.720
Do something to move
the ball forward.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:56.620
I was very fortunate, though,
that a user study was what we

00:45:56.620 --> 00:46:00.930
decided to do, because
people loved it.

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:01.850
And it was so awesome.

00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:04.760
We learned that the project
and the product had legs.

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:07.490
So I remember sitting in the
labs, and it was in the spring

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:10.870
of 2006, for our user study.

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:14.590
And one of the searches we ask
people to do was Barry Bonds.

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:16.510
This was a long time ago.

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:17.390
This was the Dark Ages.

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:19.210
YouTube was just starting out.

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:21.840
But there was a home video that
someone had uploaded of

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:25.390
Barry Bonds tying Babe Ruth's
home run record.

00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:28.670
And the participant
in our study, she

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:30.110
clicked on the video.

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:33.835
She watched the ball sail
out into the field.

00:46:33.835 --> 00:46:35.920
And there was this big
smile on her face.

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:39.000
It wasn't unnatural at all that
she saw this video in the

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.700
search results.

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:43.390
So we knew the project
had legs.

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:47.050
And it was just a
great moment.

00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:51.250
So my final and most important
piece of product management

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:53.490
advice is to listen
to your users.

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:57.300
And even more importantly, use
your products yourself.

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:00.340
Just this weekend, when I was
using Android Search, I

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:04.000
noticed that speech recognition
is slow, like

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.670
maybe one in seven times.

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:06.460
I don't know why.

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:09.760
But I'm really glad that we're
investing in speed.

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.700
And then I also had some magical
experiences with

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:12.430
Google Now.

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:15.770
So I was invited to go to a
birthday party in Burlingame,

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:18.080
and Google Now reminded
me about the party.

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:20.220
And it even told me that
Burlingame was 30 minutes from

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:21.600
my house, which I didn't know.

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.360
And it was super helpful.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.440
The more you use your products,
the easier it is to

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:29.460
make decisions and to have an
intuitive feel for what you

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:30.710
should be doing.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.540
So I'll summarize my product
management advice.

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.234
One, paint a vision.

00:47:37.234 --> 00:47:40.690
Two, when you don't know what
to do it, just make mini

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:41.420
milestones.

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:43.570
Roll that ball forward.

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:45.115
And three, use your products.

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:50.300
Since this is a Women's
Techmakers event, I thought

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.690
I'd close with my very
own lean-in story.

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:58.130
So back when all this Universal
Search stuff was

00:47:58.130 --> 00:48:01.050
going on, I ended up
getting pregnant.

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:03.880
And when I was eight months
pregnant, my boss, Marissa

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:08.190
Mayer, suggested that I lead a
team of senior engineers to

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:11.240
come up with the Search strategy
for the next year.

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:16.700
Now, the Search strategy, the
normal process was to set this

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.280
meeting in mid-November.

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:22.180
But my baby was supposed to be
born at the end of October.

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:23.540
And so they were like,
hey, no problem.

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:26.350
We'll just move the date up,
which didn't give me very much

00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:29.260
time to prepare.

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.850
And my baby was something that
you call transverse.

00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:33.640
So he's lying on his side.

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.310
And I had to have a C-section.

00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:37.130
So they moved the date up.

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:39.580
I moved my C-section to the very
last possible date, and

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:41.150
we met in the middle.

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:45.430
And on Wednesday, I gave the
strategy presentation.

00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:46.740
On Thursday, I had my baby.

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:49.897
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:49.897 --> 00:48:52.110
JOHANNA WRIGHT: Now, this might
be horrifying to some of

00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:54.030
you, but to me, it
was invigorating.

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:56.460
And it set me up to have a
leadership role in Search when

00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:59.408
I returned from my leave.

00:48:59.408 --> 00:49:02.770
And the point I want you to
takeaway is not that you need

00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:05.090
to sacrifice your family
for your career.

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:07.700
I feel fortunate enough that
I haven't had to do that.

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:10.260
You see, there was no question
in my mind that given that

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:13.470
opportunity, I would want to
give that presentation.

00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:18.170
And it was really huge that
my manager believed in me.

00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:20.520
So the takeaway that I'd like
us to take is that as

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:24.130
managers, we shouldn't assume
people's abilities or desires.

00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:25.690
We should ask.

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:28.275
As managers, it's our job to
enable greatness in our teams.

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:41.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:43.720
JOHANNA WRIGHT: So now
I'm so excited to

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:46.100
introduce Diane Greene.

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:48.500
Diane Greene is the
latest member of

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.360
Google's board of directors.

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:54.820
She's also a board member
for Intuit and MIT.

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:57.550
Diane is probably
most well-known

00:49:57.550 --> 00:49:59.490
for founding VMware.

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:04.430
VMware went on to define the
visualization industry.

00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:09.360
Diane was the CEO of VMware
from 1998 to 2008.

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:13.640
She took the company to $2
billion in revenue, and she

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.930
took the company public.

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:19.030
When I heard that I got to be
on the same panel as Diane

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:24.010
Greene, I was flabbergasted
and so excited.

00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:28.120
Despite how intimidating her
resume sounds, Diane Greene is

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.470
actually quite approachable.

00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:31.910
I heard her speak last year at
a Google event, and I went up

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:33.200
and introduced myself
afterwards.

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.070
And she was very friendly
and nice.

00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:37.860
So if you get the opportunity
afterwards, I would encourage

00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:40.200
you to shake her hand.

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:44.290
Diane is also a national
champion sailor.

00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:46.094
With that, Diane.

00:50:46.094 --> 00:50:51.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:54.330
DIANE GREENE: Thank you
for that introduction.

00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:56.240
She went further than
I suggested she go.

00:50:59.350 --> 00:51:04.800
So how did I manage to
do these things?

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:08.430
What I thought I would do is
take you on a whirlwind tour

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:10.980
of my life and try and highlight
where I thought I

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:13.160
learned valuable things.

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:18.270
And I grew up sailing,
racing sailboats.

00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:22.190
And when you race a
boat, first, you

00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:23.920
have to build a team.

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:27.100
And you have to get your team
all aligned on a single goal,

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:28.980
which is to win the race.

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:31.680
And then you need your strategy
to win the race.

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:34.670
You have to understand what the
wind is doing, understand

00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:39.200
what the currents are doing,
and pay attention to your

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.370
competitors.

00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:43.250
And if your competitors surprise
you or you get a wind

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:48.290
shift, you have to immediately
react and handle that and

00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:50.390
continue winning the race.

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:57.030
And the last thing is the
engineering around sailing.

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:58.380
You have to prepare your boat.

00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:01.690
It has to be ready to go fast,
and you have to tune it while

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:04.680
on the race course to
keep going fast.

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:08.410
And I think that's what
led me to train.

00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:11.020
I trained as a mechanical
engineer and

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:13.200
then a Naval architect.

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:16.140
I came out to the Bay Area
to San Francisco

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:18.040
for my first job.

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:23.930
And the first thing I was given
to do was analyze some

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:27.550
mooring for an offshore oil
platform that was used for

00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:28.990
firefighting.

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:34.190
And there was a big Fortran
program that looked like it

00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:36.210
was the way to model this.

00:52:36.210 --> 00:52:38.235
And so that's when I learned
how to program.

00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:47.940
It was just this incredibly
powerful tool, software.

00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:49.300
You could do anything with it.

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:51.880
I got pretty excited about it.

00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:56.150
Was not very excited about
sitting inside behind a desk.

00:52:56.150 --> 00:53:00.200
I really came to the Bay Area
for the wind surfing.

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:06.880
And so I quit that job, and I
moved to Hawaii, where I think

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:09.750
I had perhaps one of my favorite
periods of my life.

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:14.950
I lived sort of in a commune
where we were exploring

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:15.630
windsurfing.

00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:19.530
It was sort of an early

00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:21.330
microcosm of the tech industry.

00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:24.830
We were just inventing
all kinds of things--

00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:27.360
new sails, high aspect
sails, new shapes

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:29.160
of boards, new materials.

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:33.650
And all we did was build and
test this equipment every day.

00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:34.700
It was really tremendous.

00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:38.010
And from there, I went and ran
engineering for Windsurfing

00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:39.600
International.

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:44.360
That was the company that had
the patent on the windsurfer,

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:50.120
which also taught me how abused
patents can be, because

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:54.330
they tried to control a very
rapidly expanding industry

00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:55.920
with their patents.

00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.080
I left that, and all
this time, I

00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.280
continued to study software.

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:03.230
I went back up to the Bay Area
and enrolled in a graduate

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:07.070
program in computer science
at UC Berkeley.

00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:11.350
Berkeley was a pretty happening
place at that point.

00:54:11.350 --> 00:54:15.210
The grad students had a lab
full of brand new Sun

00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:21.370
workstations that were based on
this Unix, a relatively new

00:54:21.370 --> 00:54:22.830
open operating system.

00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:25.370
Richard Stallman, who wrote
the GPL license,

00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:28.190
was hanging out there.

00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:31.190
I got to see the first graphical
user interface.

00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:34.780
And it was just very exciting.

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:37.230
And I knew it's what I
wanted to keep doing.

00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:40.390
I did still yearn
for adventure.

00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:42.580
I've always really
loved adventure.

00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:47.310
So I took a brief interlude and
went to use my computer

00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:51.960
skills to be the computer expert
on a marine archaeology

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:56.670
expedition in Sipan, where we
excavated a Spanish galleon

00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:58.870
and found gold.

00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:04.410
And then I came back to the Bay
Area, and I went to work

00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:08.220
at a succession of companies
in the tech industry.

00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:13.830
The first one was Sybase, where
I really got hit over

00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:17.970
the head with the value of
having engineers across

00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:19.930
companies work together.

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:22.720
I made friends with an
engineer at Sun.

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.790
It turned out he was a
windsurfer, and we spent a few

00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:28.470
months windsurfing and
writing software.

00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:31.060
And we were able to get sort
of an order of magnitude

00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:35.130
performance increase in the
Sybase system running on Sun.

00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:40.530
And I really used that
when I built VMware.

00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:46.660
All three companies were quite
an education in how important

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:51.180
it is to embrace change and
always go forward and invest

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:52.690
in the future.

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:56.950
Sybase didn't want to rework
their system to support

00:55:56.950 --> 00:56:01.930
symmetric multiprocessing, and
that's sort of why Oracle

00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:03.220
eclipsed them.

00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:06.350
I went to work at Tandem that
had the world's best database

00:56:06.350 --> 00:56:11.050
management system, but it ran
on proprietary hardware and

00:56:11.050 --> 00:56:12.790
proprietary operating system.

00:56:12.790 --> 00:56:17.440
And it was too hard to see the
business model for moving to

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.230
commodity open systems.

00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:22.840
And they sort of sailed into
oblivion, getting bought by

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:26.420
Compaq and then by HP.

00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:30.180
And then I went to work for
SGI, which was a pretty

00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:34.080
aggressive tech company at that
point in time, and worked

00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:36.160
on interactive television,
which was a

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.810
really exciting project.

00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:46.790
But again, as the internet was
happening, and it was starting

00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:50.230
at SGI, but instead, the founder
of SGI, Jim Clark,

00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:52.370
left and founded Netscape.

00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:54.650
And a number of us left
and started companies.

00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:57.810
And that's when I finally
just decided

00:56:57.810 --> 00:56:59.500
to stick with startups.

00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:05.150
And so I did two successive
smaller startups.

00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:07.080
They both had great visions.

00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:10.000
I would say they maybe
executed too early--

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.330
nice financial outcomes.

00:57:11.330 --> 00:57:15.750
The first one was streaming
video over the internet-- low

00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:17.980
bandwidth, because there
wasn't much bandwidth.

00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:24.450
And the second was internet ad
serving, interestingly enough.

00:57:24.450 --> 00:57:32.590
At that point, I took a little
time off and decided to found

00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:37.130
VMware, which was based on some
work my husband was doing

00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:39.970
at Stanford around
virtualization.

00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:44.950
And there's a few things I can
relate to what we did at

00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:46.770
VMware to what I had
already learned.

00:57:46.770 --> 00:57:52.240
For instance, Sun Microsystems
introduced these workstations.

00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:54.520
People loved these workstations
and then brought

00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:56.340
their servers into
the companies.

00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:59.100
And at VMware, we used
the same strategy.

00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:01.930
We had a workstation software.

00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:03.950
People loved our workstation
software.

00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:06.800
And then when we came out with
the server product, were

00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:08.410
pretty quick to adopt it.

00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:13.350
Our engineers worked with
the hardware vendors.

00:58:13.350 --> 00:58:15.040
They worked with the
chip vendors.

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:17.290
They worked with the
storage vendors.

00:58:17.290 --> 00:58:19.610
And then we worked with
all of those vendors

00:58:19.610 --> 00:58:20.680
to take it to market.

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:23.080
And I'm just a huge believer in

00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:24.920
collaboration in the industry.

00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:28.510
And it was really effective for
VMware, but it was always

00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:31.560
hard to convince other companies
to trust us and

00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:33.030
partner with us.

00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:37.530
But I think we always won
jointly together.

00:58:37.530 --> 00:58:41.620
And then the last thing was
just how to adapt, how to

00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:43.190
embrace change.

00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:47.530
My job changed considerably
from zero to the sort of

00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:50.740
6,000, 7,000 people the company
was when I left.

00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:56.120
And it's just recognizing, OK,
this isn't working, and

00:58:56.120 --> 00:59:00.580
constantly sectioning out parts
of my job that I just

00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:03.360
didn't have time for
anymore and hiring

00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:07.890
someone to do those things.

00:59:07.890 --> 00:59:13.450
VMware was just a totally fun
adventure, building it with

00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:17.860
all those people and seeing
the impact that it had.

00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:24.870
And what I would say is, it's
not so important how.

00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:27.410
There's just sort of
an infinite number

00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:29.280
of ways to do things.

00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:32.850
But when you see something that
you're very interested

00:59:32.850 --> 00:59:38.310
in, that you think it can have
some real impact, the thing

00:59:38.310 --> 00:59:43.440
that's important is to codify
that vision, see that vision,

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:47.300
enjoy the adventure of
building that vision.

00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:50.640
And if you do enjoy it, it makes
it fairly easy to be

00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:51.890
fearless about it.

00:59:56.010 --> 00:59:58.530
So now we're going to shift,
and we're going to hear an

00:59:58.530 --> 01:00:05.150
amazing talk by a hardware
lead at Google.

01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:10.310
Jean Wang has a PhD In
electrical engineering.

01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:15.110
In Photonics, she worked in the
optical communications and

01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:17.920
then came to Google.

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:21.125
She's the hardware lead
on Google Glass.

01:00:21.125 --> 01:00:24.660
As a board member, I
have Google Glass.

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:25.310
I love it.

01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:28.650
It's so much more natural
than a phone.

01:00:28.650 --> 01:00:32.372
And now you get to hear about
how she did this.

01:00:32.372 --> 01:00:34.732
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:34.732 --> 01:00:35.982
JOHANNA WRIGHT: Thank you.

01:00:38.508 --> 01:00:39.758
JEAN WANG: Hi, everybody
Smile.

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:46.610
So I'm very happy to be
here with you today.

01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:49.220
I'd like to share with
you my Glass journey.

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:53.260
It's a three-part story that
spans across multiple domains.

01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:55.390
And while it is yet unfinished,
I hope you share

01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:58.500
my enthusiasm for what
is yet to come.

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:02.590
Before diving in, I'd actually
like to float this number

01:01:02.590 --> 01:01:04.780
briefly and plant it
in your minds.

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:07.250
It has significance to
me and the story.

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:09.290
And in the meantime,
please [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:10.660
the number base that
I'm using.

01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:17.380
So Glass, like many ideas,
started as a blank canvas.

01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:19.510
As part of the initial team,
we came into the project

01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:20.980
largely inexperienced
in the field of

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:22.640
head-mounted displays.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.740
Instead, we had the ability to
divide and conquer through our

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:27.480
ability to learn and adapt.

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:30.480
While some of us focused on
optics, like myself, others

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:34.600
worked on cameras, sensor
systems, electronics.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.620
And so we also came in with the
fundamental belief that

01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:39.340
technology had ripened to the
point where we can make a

01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:44.060
significant impact and create
something of significant use.

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:49.190
And that has led us into the
discovery phase and to find

01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:52.390
out just what it was that could
be done to basically

01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:56.590
minimize the barrier to
information access and to make

01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:58.470
us connect with each
other in terms of

01:01:58.470 --> 01:02:01.470
accessing our social sphere.

01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:04.050
As part of the discovery
process, we looked at existing

01:02:04.050 --> 01:02:06.430
products in the mobile space
and wanted to really

01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:09.510
understand where it was that we
can make an impact in terms

01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:11.020
of form factor.

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:13.120
For example, whether it was
bulky and had to fit into our

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.430
pocket or carry around
a bag for it.

01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:17.120
Ease of access-- whether we
had to pull it out of our

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:20.130
pocket or a bag to actually
engage with it.

01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:23.110
And also, ease of use-- whether
we were blocked when

01:02:23.110 --> 01:02:25.870
we were using the device, or
whether we could look straight

01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:29.220
ahead and talk with people
and not be distracted.

01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:32.310
So to push on these pain points,
we did a number of

01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:33.860
technical experiments.

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:37.350
Here's a helmet-mounted display
that did not allow us

01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:39.900
to be hands-free
or wires-free.

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:42.360
And in the bottom, you can see
here is an early optical

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.490
experiment to help us understand
the technical

01:02:44.490 --> 01:02:48.850
complexities in terms of how
optics sizes actually impact

01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:51.800
the performance and
the image quality.

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.880
So with these considerations
in mind, we dived into

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:57.370
selecting components
that we can use and

01:02:57.370 --> 01:02:58.620
make a viable solution.

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:03.920
So in the vast array of options,
we looked at what it

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:07.140
was we could just reuse
and customize.

01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:10.250
Or was there something that we
had to invent for ourselves?

01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:12.210
So we played around with a bunch
of pico projectors and

01:03:12.210 --> 01:03:13.220
projectors.

01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:16.480
We looked at optic components
such as lenses and prisms, as

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.880
well as interface devices--

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:20.240
touchpads, microphones,
speakers.

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.640
And underpinning the whole
system was electrical

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:25.460
components and board design.

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:30.020
So in this huge selection of
choices and huge array of

01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:32.570
options, how do we
down select?

01:03:32.570 --> 01:03:35.770
And so we filtered using
two key criteria.

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:39.250
One was power consumption, and
the second was weight.

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:44.020
So these two are basically
factors in enabling us to

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:48.070
first, wear a system all day,
and second, actually allow us

01:03:48.070 --> 01:03:51.120
to want to wear a
system all day.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.525
So we headed into the second
phase of prototyping.

01:03:56.740 --> 01:04:01.640
Here are six example generations
of glass

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:03.040
prototypes.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.430
Starting at the very top left,
we took the lowest hanging

01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:08.790
fruit of simply putting mobile
phones to the side of the

01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:12.740
head, and a pico projector
shining directly into the eye

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:14.680
to ride the image.

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:17.320
And so this was a bit bulky,
as you can imagine.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.990
It came in at 167 grams.

01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:23.530
And we wisely decided that we
could lighten the load by

01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:25.240
taking the mechanicals
off the phone.

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.100
And that's our second proto
shown right up there in the

01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:28.550
middle of top.

01:04:28.550 --> 01:04:31.680
And so as you can see, over
time, we shifted from using

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:35.440
off-the-shelf components, such
as safety shields and frames,

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.840
into 3D painting
our own frame.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.390
And that's shown here
in the third.

01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:42.290
And you can also see that we
migrated into making our own

01:04:42.290 --> 01:04:45.395
optical design architecture,
which is something we carry

01:04:45.395 --> 01:04:47.110
thorough today.

01:04:47.110 --> 01:04:50.660
And as you gradually evolve to
the very end, you see that

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:52.890
more and more, we use customized
components.

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:56.150
And we look at making our own
plastics and metals to get to

01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:58.640
where we are today, which is
essentially the essence of

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.640
what Glass needs to be.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:03.670
This provides the core and
provides a very minimalistic

01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:06.170
system that allows us to run
around and be happy when we're

01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:08.390
playing with the system.

01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:11.550
And in addition to prototyping
with our hardware, Glass

01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:16.170
derives its use from an
easy-to-follow UI.

01:05:16.170 --> 01:05:19.980
And this is, by definition,
actually easy to make.

01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:22.070
Along the way, we experimented
with a number of different

01:05:22.070 --> 01:05:26.200
interaction concepts, for
example, head gestures.

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:28.930
That recent "SNL" skit was not
too far from our previous

01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:31.160
truth, if you've seen it.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.890
Also, we experimented with
porting the keyword

01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:35.660
functionality to the touchpad.

01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:38.090
But we found that it was a bit
too complex, even when running

01:05:38.090 --> 01:05:39.910
the predictive word mode.

01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:43.230
We also tuned the number of
lines of text, the font, the

01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:47.700
size to basically optimize
for readability.

01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:51.240
So through all of these
things, we found that

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:55.580
minimalizing and stripping down
to the very core allowed

01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:59.270
for the best use case
and experience.

01:05:59.270 --> 01:06:03.970
We also found that minor head
tilts and voice commands

01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:07.810
allowed us for hand-free
experience, which is very

01:06:07.810 --> 01:06:10.500
important when we're
busy dancing or

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.320
riding that roller coaster.

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:16.150
On the flip side, having the
touchpad and the camera button

01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:19.150
allowed us for more quiet
modes of interaction.

01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:24.310
So with the hardware and
software solutions converging

01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:27.070
into a viable state, the team
actually turned to the

01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:30.020
question of production.

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:33.710
It is possible to manually tweak
and baby one device to

01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:36.660
get it to be close to ideal
in terms of cosmetics and

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:38.340
functionality.

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:40.690
However, we like to share
Glass more broadly.

01:06:40.690 --> 01:06:43.080
And so that, to us,
quickly turns into

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.160
the question of scale.

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:48.730
How do we build not 1,000,
100,000, but upward towards a

01:06:48.730 --> 01:06:50.920
Google of devices?

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.520
Layering in automation
is key to this.

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:57.470
And that means that not only
do we have to build Glass

01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:59.820
itself, but we have
to build the

01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:02.170
infrastructure that builds Glass--

01:07:02.170 --> 01:07:04.260
the floor space, the
equipment, the

01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:07.490
whole kit and caboodle.

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:10.470
And to add a bit more
complexity, we'd like to honor

01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:13.480
individuality and human
preferences.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:17.410
And that, to us, has meant
color options.

01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:20.500
And that leads to color
complexity.

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:23.160
How do we make sure that on
the device itself, part to

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.930
part, the colors match?

01:07:24.930 --> 01:07:27.060
And how do we make sure
that, between

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:29.100
devices, the colors match?

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:31.260
So production requires the
solutions to all these

01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:34.990
questions and beyond.

01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:39.480
Through these three phases of
discovery, prototyping, and

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:43.900
production, I have found that
Glass is both an innovation

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:46.090
and a reinvention.

01:07:46.090 --> 01:07:50.640
By integrating highly compact
and new components, we've been

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.740
able to extend far beyond
[INAUDIBLE]

01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:56.540
displays, beyond the last
several decades of

01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:58.830
individualized movie players,
game consoles,

01:07:58.830 --> 01:08:00.210
and aircraft systems.

01:08:00.210 --> 01:08:03.990
On the other hand, I think that
Glass is a way in which

01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:08.650
we can examine and develop new
fields that we can push beyond

01:08:08.650 --> 01:08:11.620
and learn to be better connected
to each other, as

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:14.850
well as share a perspective
and have access to

01:08:14.850 --> 01:08:15.850
information.

01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:19.170
And all of this will allow us to
better emphasize as people

01:08:19.170 --> 01:08:21.600
and synthesize.

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:24.985
So coming back to that number
at the very beginning, it's

01:08:24.985 --> 01:08:29.750
been exactly, as of today, 1,111
days since I joined.

01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:31.560
And this is a picture I
would not be able to

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.470
take without Glass.

01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:36.760
I am paragliding over Coronet
Peak in New Zealand.

01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:39.250
And just by looking at it, I can
recall what it was like to

01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:40.890
soar with the birds
and to take in the

01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:42.140
beauty of the landscape.

01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:46.229
I've often been asked what the
"aha" moments have been the

01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:47.750
project thus far.

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:50.729
And while I have a few,
I'm more excited about

01:08:50.729 --> 01:08:52.520
what is yet to come.

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:54.020
There is a first here.

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:57.859
For example, barcode, QR code
scans, where we can get

01:08:57.859 --> 01:09:01.510
[? just time ?] reviews of
movies, books that [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:04.580
were just about to take, but
we're not quite sure yet.

01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:07.080
Then there's also never getting
lost and not bumping

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:10.100
into things while you're
looking at directions.

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:12.500
And then there's a whole
other level.

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:15.140
Recently one of my colleagues
exchanged his wedding vows

01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:16.779
while wearing the device.

01:09:16.779 --> 01:09:21.330
And I get goosebumps when I
imagine him reliving that when

01:09:21.330 --> 01:09:24.880
he's old and gray and seeing
the reflection of a future

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:27.560
from his wife's eyes.

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:30.439
And then there's also a
physics instructor who

01:09:30.439 --> 01:09:33.210
recently toured Cern
with the device.

01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:36.470
And he did a Hangout back to
his classroom in Michigan.

01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:39.260
And he was riding his bike down
the tunnel of a Large

01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:41.270
Hadron Collider, showing his
classroom just how cool it was

01:09:41.270 --> 01:09:45.050
while taking live questions
on the spot.

01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:48.029
Then there's also another
example where Glass can mean

01:09:48.029 --> 01:09:50.750
life or death.

01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:53.040
It can help you translate to a
medical doctor in a foreign

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.935
country that you're allergic
to penicillin.

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:03.680
So through this process, I think
that there's just so

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:07.410
much potential in what
is yet to come.

01:10:07.410 --> 01:10:11.140
That in pushing towards a new
perspective on information

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:15.250
sharing and perspective sharing,
we've come upon a new

01:10:15.250 --> 01:10:19.860
environment in what Glass
can engender.

01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:23.950
And when I have time to pause
and think about how far we've

01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:28.630
come, I feel privileged to be
part of such a dynamic team.

01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:30.640
Together we're striving forth
to bring forward this new

01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:32.230
perspective.

01:10:32.230 --> 01:10:34.840
And I count you, as developers,
as part of this

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:36.800
growing group.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.860
There's just so much potential
and positive impact in keeping

01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:42.400
in the moment, where information
is just at your

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:45.880
fingertips, and knowledge is
a twinkle in your eye.

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:49.680
And with that, I look forward
to your "aha" moments.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:52.434
And we are back to discovery.

01:10:52.434 --> 01:11:03.150
[APPLAUSE]

01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:04.710
JEAN WANG: Thanks, everyone.

01:11:04.710 --> 01:11:06.760
I'd like to hand it back to
Megan, one of my colleagues at

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:10.170
Google X, where she is
spearheading an idea for solve

01:11:10.170 --> 01:11:11.420
for X to get us to
more moonshots.

01:11:14.702 --> 01:11:16.530
[APPLAUSE]

01:11:16.530 --> 01:11:18.050
MEGAN SMITH: Thank you.

01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:19.250
Thank you, Jean.

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:21.270
And first off, thank
you to all of our

01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:22.550
amazing lightning speakers.

01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:23.800
You guys were incredible.

01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:32.120
And also to Stephanie and Phoebe
and Mimi and Sinead and

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.770
Tara and Judith, who helped us
put all this together with the

01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:36.430
amazing I/O team.

01:11:36.430 --> 01:11:40.540
Just quickly, Larry talked
about thinking big.

01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:42.510
We've been talking about
the idea of moonshots--

01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:44.130
going 10x instead of 1x.

01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:47.600
And so my colleague Astro and I
have launched this site and

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:51.040
this goal to have the meme of
moonshot thinking be something

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:51.920
that more of us do.

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:54.260
So solve for X is this
idea, there's a big

01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:55.450
problem in the world.

01:11:55.450 --> 01:11:58.500
There's some kind of crazy
technology that is there.

01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:00.440
It feels like science fiction,
or there's a reuse of

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:02.840
something old that we just
might be able to use as a

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:06.140
radical solution to solve big
problems in the world, be they

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:09.960
self-driving cars or poverty
or water or just

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:12.220
more fun for everybody.

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:16.080
And the main thing about this
is that it's on the web.

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.510
It's open.

01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:19.600
And so there's lots of proposals
already up, and

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:23.570
we've partnered with the X
PRIZE and TED and Arizona

01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:28.140
State University, Singularity,
this great set of movies from

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:29.970
GE Focus Forward
about moonshots

01:12:29.970 --> 01:12:31.240
that people are taking.

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.660
And so we're just trying to get
the conversation going and

01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:36.270
really celebrate people who
are starting or who are in

01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:37.670
process of moonshot.

01:12:37.670 --> 01:12:39.920
Because we always celebrate
the people who made it.

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:41.410
But we really want
to get more about

01:12:41.410 --> 01:12:42.570
collaborating and teamwork.

01:12:42.570 --> 01:12:45.250
Bill Clinton calls the 21st
century the century of

01:12:45.250 --> 01:12:46.030
creative collaboration.

01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:48.610
And really, the web and all
the things we already know

01:12:48.610 --> 01:12:50.440
about, we already feel that.

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.270
So that's what solve
for X is about.

01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:56.490
And along those lines, there's
an idea that we

01:12:56.490 --> 01:12:57.580
have as part of--

01:12:57.580 --> 01:13:00.360
my clicker's not working--

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.730
about your X Like X is a
problem in the world or

01:13:02.730 --> 01:13:04.320
something you're passionate
about.

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.300
So I was really lucky, as a
student, to get to take

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:09.680
acoustics at MIT from Professor

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:13.280
Bose, as in Bose Speakers.

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:15.330
He was an extraordinary
professor.

01:13:15.330 --> 01:13:18.740
And at one point during our
classes, he paused, and he

01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:20.700
went into a lecture
about life.

01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.660
And one of the key things that
he said is, you guys are

01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:23.330
really talented.

01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:24.240
You're doing great things.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:25.920
You're going for it.

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.840
The key thing now for you is
figure out what are you

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.860
passionate about?

01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:30.270
In some ways, what's your X?

01:13:30.270 --> 01:13:31.170
What do you care about?

01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:32.530
What do you want to work on?

01:13:32.530 --> 01:13:34.610
Because if you find that,
you're going to be

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:37.660
unstoppable, and you will do
extraordinary things to help

01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:39.140
people and make things
great in the world.

01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:41.930
And I think that the women who
we've heard from have found

01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:44.160
their X. And I hope that
everybody will be

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:44.890
thinking in that way.

01:13:44.890 --> 01:13:48.800
I welcome everybody to
stay afterwards.

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.750
I think Susan has to
catch a plane, but

01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:51.530
everybody else is here.

01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:54.130
There's a bunch of great
websites up, like the

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:55.520
makers.com site.

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.240
And in fact, today, somebody
just told me that Susan's

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:01.040
story is up on the
home page of AOL.

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.720
So she's one of the Makers,
and she's there.

01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:06.600
And again, we've launched
Makers at Google.

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:08.140
And we hope that other
companies and other

01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:10.800
organizations will start telling
the stories, which

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.440
leads me back to visibility.

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:13.650
And let's make people visible.

01:14:13.650 --> 01:14:14.480
Help us do it.

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:16.220
And thank you so much
for being here.

01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:17.470
[APPLAUSE]
