00:00:00.962 --> 00:00:03.367
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:09.970
-Thanks so much, Judy.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:10.470
Wow.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.830
Somebody really did some
proper sleuthing there.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.760
There were some bits of
bio that I hadn't even

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.550
thought about for a long time.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.470
And thank you so much
to you all for coming.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.480
I'm having a really
wonderful year so far,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.440
wandering lonely as a cloud
in my Radcliffe office.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.930
I thought I would try
to do something slightly

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.950
different from what I usually do
this afternoon and read poems,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.650
but try to talk a little bit
more around them than normal.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.350
And I guess this is because,
for once, the audience might

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.330
actually have more lawyers or
physicists in it than poets.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.450
And I assure you, this
never, ever happens.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.770
So I guess I hoped
that this wouldn't

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.100
seem an exercise in saying, oh,
these poems are so difficult.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.550
Look what clever things
I've put into them.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.170
It's more me trying to
show the way that I think

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.210
and the sort of
serendipitous connections

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.020
and leaps and
suturings of thought

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.230
that go into a poem for me.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.360
Given that it's
working, at the end,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.920
towards this current
project of mine,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.590
an erasure poem about and for
Hong Kong called "Two Systems."

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.790
There's a sort of
teleological strand

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.070
running through this talk.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.930
So the poems I'm
going to read today

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.330
might seem a little
bit single-minded,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.310
because they're all,
effectively-- to my mind--

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.460
variations on a theme.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.320
So I do have poems about
buses and theoretical physics

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.936
and love and walking
home in the rain.

00:01:47.936 --> 00:01:50.060
But I'm not going to be
reading any of those today.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.660
And this first
poem, I think, could

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.980
act as a sort of prologue.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.050
Because it's the
same but different

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.070
to the others, in as much
as all the other poems

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.780
I'm going to read
explore the Chinese side

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.699
of my heritage via--
more-or-less directly-- my mum.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.800
Whereas, this poem is one
that's firmly placed in England,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.370
my dad's country.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.700
If you drive northeast
from Cambridge, UK--

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.170
where I used to live--
for a couple of hours,

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.240
you'll eventually
reach a place called

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.670
Binham Priory in Norfolk.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.050
And there's a rood
screen there, which

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.080
is an object that has
fascinated me for a long time.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.060
I think, partly,
because it feels to me

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.330
like history in motion.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.020
It's an emblem of
history in some sense.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.830
So the rood screen,
it's a painting

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.760
of saints, which has been
whitewashed and, then,

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.270
over-painted in black-letter
script with text

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.360
from Cranmer's Bible.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.240
And this was quite common in the
early reformation in England.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.800
And often, the
text painted on top

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.860
was of prohibitions
against idolatry.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.850
So this object is
a sort of emblem

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.360
of transition from a
medieval culture of image

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.160
worship to this sort of
self-proclaimed Protestant

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.930
culture of the Word.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.350
But the punctum that made this
into the germ of a poem for me

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.146
was the fact that
the fingers that

00:03:19.146 --> 00:03:20.520
have rubbed away
at the whitewash

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.110
have done it selectively.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.440
So the faces are the
only areas that have

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.380
been systematically uncovered.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.950
And as the historian
Eamon Duffy revealed,

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.720
people thought of
this of white-washing,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.730
even at the time, as
a reversible process.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.470
That Catholic sympathizers
might whitewash

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.900
church art instead of more
permanent sorts of destruction.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.990
So I'm going to read
you this poem called

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.690
"Acts and Monuments,"
which has this epigraph,

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.920
as obedient children, that you
give not yourselves over unto

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.640
your old lusts.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.940
At the priories fall,
its people came too late,

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.130
amidst clamour and cries.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.970
The glistering saints, torn
from their Sunday height--

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.580
each gilded screen
and tabernacle,

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:19.570
each tilted face quite slubbered
over, washed with white.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.020
As homily blurred into
homily, Binham's flock

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.230
continued to gaze.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.470
A whole generation,
disobedient children,

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.890
thumbed at the
lime's forgetfulness,

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.360
hoping to coax
from stubborn chalk

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.730
that serpent's peep-holed
green, a flash of wheatsheaf

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.690
hair almost as bright
as it ever was.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.160
What I want to talk about
today goes to the heart,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.640
I think, of what poetry is.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.930
Heather McHugh puts it very
beautifully when she says,

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.760
all poetry is fragment.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.460
It's shaped by its
breakages at every turn.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.330
And I suppose, this is the
most recognizable thing

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.820
let's you distinguish
verse from prose,

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.640
that jagged, broken,
right margin.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.090
Though I am going to actually
read a couple of prose poems

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.700
today, which I suppose
trouble that division.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.470
But for me, at least, poetry
is an art, fundamentally shaped

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.510
by the white frame
of the page, that's

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.370
tuned into the unsung
as much as the singing,

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.960
to wordlessness
as much as words.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.150
And so, as that poem "Acts
and Monuments" suggested,

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.650
I'm going to be
talking, especially,

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.120
to this idea of vacancy
somehow made visible,

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.680
how poems might frame an
absence and, in the process,

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.915
make it paradoxically
more present.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.800
And this is a painting that does
just this, frame an absence.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.920
It's attributed to a 10th
century Chinese painter Li

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.800
Cheng.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.715
But it's actually,
probably, a copy of it

00:06:00.715 --> 00:06:02.540
a couple of centuries later.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.310
And my thinking
about this picture

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.580
has been really indebted to
the wonderful Chicago-based

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.140
art-historian Wu
Hung, who's done

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.200
lots of thinking about
ruins and monumentality;

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.720
memory, absence, and
presence in Chinese art.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.320
And for him, this picture
is a quintessential example

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.470
of something called [CHINESE],
so lamenting the past.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.402
It's sometimes
translated as nostalgia.

00:06:28.402 --> 00:06:30.360
But actually, I think
it's not quite nostalgia.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.230
And it's not quite ubi sunt.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.510
It's a bit different to the
idea of confronting ruins

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.680
in Western culture.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.480
But it's this moment
when past and present

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.400
are standing face-to-face.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.460
But as Wu Hung points out, the
funny thing about this picture

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.030
is that this stele--
so stele, of course,

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.137
are these monuments which
have names or events

00:06:50.137 --> 00:06:53.880
or deeds inscribed on them
that need to be remembered.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.300
It's blank.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.280
So unlike in poems
of the period, which

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.526
very commonly depict ruins--
so you have your poet

00:07:02.526 --> 00:07:03.900
standing on the
hill looking down

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.610
at the ruins of the old
capital and thinking, oh gosh.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.050
Lament, lament past.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.450
What you have here is this
odd displacement, whereby

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.170
the stele is intact, right
down to the tortoise base.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.580
In fact, this impression
of wizenedness and ages

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.250
is displaced onto these
contorted trees, if anything.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.210
The stele's intact.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.250
But it's blank.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.350
As if the surface, the
inscription, the writing,

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.565
has been worn away by time.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.040
And with that in
mind, I want to read

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.495
this poem called "Yangtze."

00:07:37.495 --> 00:07:40.430
Although I was born and spent
my early childhood in Hong Kong.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.700
I didn't actually ever
visit mainland China

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.550
until I was in my early 20s.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.860
And this was back in 2004.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.920
And one of the first things
I did, as good tourists do,

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.450
is go on a cruise
down the Yangtze.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.915
But at that time, work for
the Three Gorges Dam project

00:07:57.915 --> 00:07:59.280
had already begun.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.470
So the water level had
already risen by 1/3.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.565
So it was up to here in 2004.

00:08:04.565 --> 00:08:06.370
Whereas, now, it's
sort of up to here.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.995
So your vista of
valley and gorge

00:08:08.995 --> 00:08:15.110
is quite different to how
it was a decade ago now.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.000
But what was most
extraordinary at that time

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.130
was traveling down
this landscape,

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:23.480
which felt like it should be in
a classical Chinese painting.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.950
You would periodically encounter
these towns and villages

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.505
that had been not just
emptied and evacuated

00:08:29.505 --> 00:08:33.409
but positively stripped down
to the bare cause of buildings,

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.060
ready to go under the water.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:38.700
Yangtze.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.230
The moon glimmers in
the brown channel.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.540
Strands of mist wrap
the mountainsides,

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.950
crowded with firs.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:56.710
Declining cliffs sink beneath
fast water, by remote paths,

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.410
twisting pines.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:05.180
Far downstream, two sides of a
half-built bridge fail to meet.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.810
Our crude boat, chugging,
points to Chongqing.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:15.550
As someone I now forget once
said, journeying is hard.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.790
My face greets the
evening breeze.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:23.460
I listen, the dream of a place.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.310
A cormorant dives
by trembling light.

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.630
From the white eyelet of a
star, the sound of ripples.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.410
A fishermen skirting shore
in his high-prowed skiff,

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:42.310
crossing bamboo oars, comes up
with a jolt. Nets catch, not

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:46.540
fish, but the wizened finger
of a submerged branch.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:51.020
For below, a sunken
valley persists.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.750
Slick, bare trunks,
furred in wafting fronds,

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.950
have water for
sky, ghost forest.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:04.910
Roots rot deep in the hill
where buried rock is still dry.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:11.340
Windows film, doors drift open
in the empty concrete shells

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.440
of houses.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:17.780
Towns that once held hundreds of
thousands slowly filling with--

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.190
What?

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:22.940
What is it they fill with?

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.820
Someone I now forget once
said, journeying is hard.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.505
The moon glimmers in
the brown channel.

00:10:35.002 --> 00:10:38.860
Wu Hung says one more
interesting thing

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.840
about this picture,
which is that it

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.390
has a relationship with the
convention for representing

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.630
Chinese ancestral tablets
in art of this period,

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:53.960
that they too are
depicted as blank tablets.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.040
And the idea was that
you should project,

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:01.280
into that space, the image
of your own ancestors.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.420
This is something
that is especially

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.820
interesting and tinged
with sadness for me.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.080
Because my mum was an orphan.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.640
So I have never known any
Chinese family except for her.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.660
So when I look into the blank
of my mental ancestral tablet,

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.460
it is literally blank.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:25.490
And this is something that feeds
into the title poem of my book,

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:26.380
"Loop of Jade."

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.820
You're not meant to be able
to read this, by the way.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.580
This is just to show you what
it looks like on the page.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.490
The poem takes its title
from the jade bracelet--

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:44.870
this one-- that my
grandmother gave me as a baby.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.065
And the poem is a way to think
about lines of inheritance,

00:11:48.065 --> 00:11:51.040
search for roots, but also
things that one might not

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.470
want to pass on.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.020
But the most important things
in the poem are left unsaid.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.920
So for example, my grandmother
wasn't my grandmother by blood.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.240
And indeed, I never knew her.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.610
But she was, rather, the
women who, after my mom

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:07.590
was born and
abandoned, slightly,

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.390
tenuously took her
in, adopted her.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:14.180
This was in Guangdong
Province in 1948, '49.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.680
So the Communists
came to power just

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.150
as my mom was a few months old.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.030
And then, this woman took
her just across the water

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:23.415
to the safe haven
of Hong Kong Island.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:31.380
So this is to illustrate
that the poem takes place

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:35.220
in this counterpoint
of two shapes.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.650
And I've only actually
performed this poem once before.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.110
And I think that experience
showed me that I'm not really

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:41.030
quite up to it.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:45.080
Because it demands two voices,
which I can't quite do.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.660
So the prose sections
are putatively me.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:55.870
And then, the little
sections tell the story

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.595
of the butterfly
lovers, which is

00:12:58.595 --> 00:13:01.100
a folktale that all Chinese
children would know.

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.570
Which goes something
like, girl disguises

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.130
herself so she can go to school.

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.210
Falls in love with fellow pupil.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:11.880
But when she's married off to an
older man, he dies from grief.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.550
And then, she hauls
herself into his grave.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:15.380
Everything's awful.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.429
But then, God takes pity.

00:13:16.429 --> 00:13:18.095
And they're turned
into the butterflies.

00:13:18.095 --> 00:13:20.080
And they're reunited.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.640
And it's only towards
the end of the poem

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.260
that you discover that these
fragments of this story

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.310
are being told in
my mother's voice.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:34.215
So I thought I would just read
a couple of the prose sections.

00:13:34.215 --> 00:13:37.590
And by the way, I should say
that this alternation of prose

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.685
and verse is something
that was inspired

00:13:39.685 --> 00:13:43.470
for me by a Japanese form
called haibun, which is actually

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.900
how many of the original
haikus were presented.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.580
You would have these
journalistic prose, every day

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.410
sections and, then,
this heightening

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:52.270
into little haiku sections.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.940
So I thought I'd read a
couple of the prose sections.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.420
And then, there's a change
of key on the last two pages

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.920
of the poem.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.810
So the penultimate
section, this one--

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.970
which is about trying
to score visually,

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:07.520
hesitation, difficulty.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.960
Not so much a
physical stuttering

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.520
as a sort of
psychological hesitation.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.870
This is in my mum's voice.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.580
And then, this last section
is back to me again.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.710
And you can follow along in
the handout, if you want to.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.100
But actually, I
wouldn't recommend it.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:38.480
When the television has stayed
on too long, the channels ended

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.390
and all the downstairs
lights switched off

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:45.050
but one, sometimes,
rarely, my mother

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:48.540
will begin to talk
without prelude or warning

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.936
about her growing up.

00:14:50.936 --> 00:14:54.970
Then, her words feel pulled from
a dark and unreflective well,

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.640
willed, and not willed.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.090
It isn't that this
tacit contract is not

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:03.180
tinged by our same
daily fumblings,

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.560
but when the men
are asleep, I think

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:10.105
she believes it's someone
else's turn to listen.

00:15:10.105 --> 00:15:13.860
Once she spoke of her
horror as a very small child

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.970
at the communal kitchen in
their low-rise tenement.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:18.690
Half-outdoors in
that muggy climate,

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:22.530
it ran across the whole
row, a corridor or terrace.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:25.700
This space-- aside from
housing a blackened, static wok

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.976
the size of a Western baby's
bath-- was also a latrine.

00:15:29.976 --> 00:15:33.600
Of squatting barefoot over
the cracked tile trench

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.480
and trying not to breathe.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.740
How, despite
themselves, her eyes

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.860
would follow to the nearby
drain, as it sprouted-- here,

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.920
she giggles, shivers--
the glistening bodies

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.750
of cockroaches, like
obscene sucked sweets.

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.940
I see them, the color
of rust or shit,

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.800
hitching up from the
crusted grill on agile legs.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.005
Things scuttling from some
dank, subterranean chamber

00:15:59.005 --> 00:15:59.740
of the head.

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:08.500
Her longest and most
empty pause, I've learned,

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:14.940
comes before the word
"mother," as in, my-- mother,

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.590
she could speak Shanghainese.

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:21.320
This, one of her trademark
non-sequiters-- at the table,

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.380
the family would laugh-- arrived
while scraping off dinner

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.930
plates several months after
a trip of mine to Shanghai.

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.430
It's as though she's
been conducting

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.790
the conversation in
her head for some time

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:35.470
and decides, disconcertingly,
to include you.

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.260
Or one Christmas, tucking
the cooled mince pies

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:43.910
into kitchen paper-- I sometimes
think she wasn't very reliable,

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.930
my mother.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:51.580
What she told me, I don't
know how much I can believe.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:55.080
In her mouth, that
noun worried at me.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.690
For I would never
naturally use it

00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:01.300
myself-- mother-- except
at an immigration office,

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.319
perhaps, to total strangers
or inside the boundaries

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:06.119
of a poem.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.440
She places it in the
room's still air,

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.530
with a kind of resolve
and, yet, a sense

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:15.430
it's not quite right,
and mis-translation.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:19.720
Like watching her wade
one dredged step at a time

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.470
out into a wide gray
straight, myself a

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:26.810
waving spot, unseen,
on the furthest shore.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:35.750
There was a man in
a nearby district.

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:40.140
When I was young and my
mother short of money,

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:43.510
there was a while--
a lot of times

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:48.360
actually-- when I was sent
to live with other people.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.070
That man was one
of those people.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:56.170
Looking back, it was better
than the school on Macau.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:58.560
I learned more at his house.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:03.970
There were other children
, other girls there too.

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:08.170
At night, he would teach
us the old stories,

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.680
all singing together.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:15.060
People, they used
to talk about him.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:19.220
These weren't just nursery
rhymes, though I had never

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.270
heard those before either.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:25.860
I mean, the classical
legends and tales.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:30.320
He had a bad reputation.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.820
The legends, like
Shakespeare, had

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.520
a lot of girls who
dress up as boys,

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:40.200
so they will be allowed
to go to school or to war.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:45.380
My mother heard about it,
had me sent back to her.

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:50.560
When I was old enough, I had
to go to the school instead.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.950
There was one-- "The
Butterfly Lovers"--

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:57.910
it was a poem and also a song.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:00.430
I used to be able
to sing it all.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.590
He was kind to me.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.950
I didn't think I ever
taught you that one.

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:18.390
It thuds into my chest, this
pendant ring of milky jade.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:21.830
I wear it strung on an
old watch chain, meant

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:24.550
for a baby's bracelet.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:27.300
Into it's smooth
circlet, I can just

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:31.780
fit a quincunx of
five fingertips.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.360
Cool on my palm, it
rests, the sinople eye

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.934
on a butterfly's wing.

00:19:37.934 --> 00:19:41.750
When I was born, she took
it across to Wong Tai Sin--

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:44.910
my mother's mother--
to have it blessed.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:48.400
I saw that place-- it's
joss-stick incensed mist,

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.410
the fortune-casting herd, their
fluttering, tree-tied pleas--

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:55.780
only later, as a tourist.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:20:01.070
As for the jade, I never
wore or even saw it then.

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.810
The logic runs
like this-- if baby

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:07.910
falls, the loop of
stone-- a sacrifice-- will

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:11.070
shatter in her place.

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:14.010
Painfully knelt
on the altar step,

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:17.770
did the old woman shake out
a sheath of red-tipped sticks

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:22.200
and pick one to entreat my fate?

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.710
And if I break it
now, will I be saved?

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.260
At exactly the same time as I
was working on that poem, "Loop

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.650
of Jade," I also started
work on a sequence

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:43.080
of poems-- very
different poems, not

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.820
really autobiographical
in impetus,

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:49.210
though I guess they do touch
on my life in certain oblique

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:55.570
ways-- based on Borges'
famous Chinese encyclopedia.

00:20:55.570 --> 00:21:00.410
I'm sure many of you know this,
possibly, encountered it--

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:04.690
as I did-- in the preface to
Foucault's Order of Things,

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:09.460
where Foucault talks about this
laughter that shattered all

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.780
the landmarks of our thought.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.940
I'll just read it.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.900
"These ambiguities,
redundancies, and deficiencies

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.000
recall those attributed
by Dr. Franz Kuhn

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.030
to a certain
Chinese encyclopedia

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:24.870
entitled, The Celestial Emporium
of Benevolent Knowledge.

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:26.510
On those remote
pages, it is written

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:30.040
that animals are divided into,
A, belonging to the emperor;

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.500
B, embalmed; C, tame;
D, sucking pigs;

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.330
E, sirens; F, fabulous;
G, stray dogs;

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.450
H, included in the
present classification;

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:41.210
I, frenzied; J,
innumerable; K, drawn

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:44.430
with a very fine camelhair
brush; L, others; M,

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:46.270
having just broken
the water pitcher;

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:49.146
N, that from a long way
off look like flies."

00:21:49.146 --> 00:21:50.532
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.850
So this Chinese encyclopedia
is cited-- which is to say,

00:21:55.850 --> 00:22:00.290
invented-- by Borges
in one of his essays.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:03.872
And I guess I always thought,
being half Chinese, half

00:22:03.872 --> 00:22:05.330
English, that this
piece of writing

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.780
was somehow describing me.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:10.850
And I think Foucault is
right when he recognizes

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.880
that this is not so much
about the "exotic" charm

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.250
of another system of thought.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:17.155
It's about the
limitations of our own.

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:23.130
So what I did was
I wrote 14 poems,

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:25.055
one for each of the 14 animals.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.890
Like this one,
"d, sucking pigs."

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.200
So these poems use
Borges' animals

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:38.530
as a way of thinking about
cultural and racial hybridity,

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.500
I suppose-- my own.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.430
Also, some of the
later poems get

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.690
into my own "mixed" marriage.

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:50.300
When my husband--
who's Jewish-- and I

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.980
were planning our
wedding, we thought

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.460
it would be nice to somehow
convey aspects of our heritage.

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:59.120
So we splashed a
glass-- mazel tov!

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.040
But then, I was
trying to read around

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:07.800
to find out what Chinese aspects
we could put into our ceremony.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.740
And I came across
this custom whereby

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.910
the groom's family, upon
being reassured, shall we say,

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:17.830
of the bride's chastity,
are supposed to give

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:19.670
her family a roast piglet.

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:21.482
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:26.686
In England, I sometimes
have to gloss shikse.

00:23:26.686 --> 00:23:31.656
And I know that they
should strictly be blonde.

00:23:31.656 --> 00:23:36.450
But here we are in the land
the Seinfeld and Philip Roy.

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:40.070
And this poem is actually
a Shakespearean sonnets,

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:41.780
albeit with fuzzy rhymes.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.900
That is a technical term.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:51.703
But in the couplet at the end,
the second line is a footnote.

00:23:51.703 --> 00:23:52.203
Right.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.290
Sucking pigs.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:01.380
Between choosing
canapes and favors,

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.910
I read how the groom's
family, by Chinese tradition,

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:09.200
should gift to her kinsmen
a piglet, milk-fed, just

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.780
a moon at the teat,
crisped to perfection.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:17.120
When quite satisfied,
the bride's still intact.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.030
I imagine your mother
cranking the spit.

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:23.920
Crackling's coy,
brittle russet, then,

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:30.190
succulent fat-- that atavistic
aroma makes me salivate-- you,

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:32.520
physically sick.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:37.280
So as pet-names go,
Shikse's not a bad fit.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.590
I did play your
Circean temptress.

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:42.710
Wikipedia says it comes
down from Leviticus,

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:46.760
how your God labeled
creatures unclean to ingest

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:50.901
but, then, disgust seems
to blur into reverence.

00:24:50.901 --> 00:24:51.400
Cf.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:54.112
Xu Bing, "A Case Study
of Transference."

00:24:54.112 --> 00:24:55.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:00.622
So I guess I liked the
idea that-- in these sort

00:25:00.622 --> 00:25:03.920
of cod, scholarly,
hyper-referential, encyclopedia

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.950
poems-- you might think that
a case study of transference

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:11.470
is some reference to a piece
of psychoanalytic literature.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.190
But I also liked
the idea that people

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:16.610
who know the work of the
Chongqing born Chinese artist

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:22.530
Xu Bing might connect it
to this piece of 1994.

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:25.330
Those are, actually,
two live pigs

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.650
in a pen in an
art gallery space,

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:30.530
which are doing their thing.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:33.100
And the male-- as you
can possibly make out--

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.970
is inscribed with Latin
text, whilst the female

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:38.290
is inscribed with Chinese text.

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:40.810
But what you probably can't
see from the zoomed out view

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:44.110
is that it's actually nonsense
written on both of them.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:47.190
So you can see that this is
no language, this Latin script

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.880
at the top.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.990
And the Chinese characters
are these nons made-up ones

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:52.700
that Xu Bing had
actually come up

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.390
with for a project of a
couple of years earlier called

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:59.080
[CHINESE], which translates
as "A Book from the Sky,"

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.500
which is a Chinese idiom
meaning nonsensical or illegible

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:10.030
language from codes or down to
a doctor's illegible scrawl.

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:13.010
So nonsense is
actually something

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:16.650
that I like to think about and
play with a lot in my work.

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:18.720
Though that's not going
to come up so much today,

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.105
right until the very
end of my reading.

00:26:22.105 --> 00:26:24.220
And I sometimes wonder
if this has anything

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.450
to do with growing up hearing
my mum-- and everyone in Hong

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:30.710
Kong-- speaking Cantonese, a
language I couldn't understand.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:33.980
And I wonder if that
experience somehow made

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:37.770
me a poet, or at least more
susceptible to language

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:42.140
as sound and cadence
separated from sense.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:46.920
Now, I'd like to read three more
poems from the Borges sequence,

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.820
a little trio or
subgroup, all of which

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:55.270
relate to censorship
in one way or another.

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:59.564
So I didn't speak Cantonese
when I was growing up.

00:26:59.564 --> 00:27:02.780
I only learned
Mandarin as an adult.

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:06.000
And as I went through this
process of painstakingly--

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.650
and with great difficult--
learning this tremendously hard

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:11.880
language, one of the things that
struck me most was all the ways

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.400
that Chinese can pun
that English just can't.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.890
So the characters,
the written system,

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:19.830
allow for this in one way.

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:21.860
When a character
differs from another

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:25.400
by just one dot or stroke,
they'll look similar

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.420
but have entirely
different meanings.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.340
And this is a sort of
punning that became

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:33.110
very important to the
protesters in the visual culture

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:37.120
of the recent Umbrella Movement
in Hong Kong, for example.

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.670
But even more common
is puns based on sound,

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:43.470
because Chinese is so
full of homophones.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:48.700
So things will sound almost
exactly the same, or exactly

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.410
the same, bar the
differences in tone.

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:54.840
And I thought it was fascinating
that this is something that

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.700
has become a way for
Chinese dissidents

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:02.920
to either get round
or protest censorship,

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:07.240
the so-called "Great
Firewall" of China.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.510
And so I think Borges would
have approved of the fact

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:14.970
that the now rather notorious
grass-mud horse of the top

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:18.520
left-- for some reason
they look like alpacas--

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:22.490
first arose early
in 2009, as part

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:27.730
of a hoax on the online
interactive encyclopedia

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:30.560
of Baidu-- the sort
of Chinese equivalent

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.340
of Wikipedia-- where
people entered these 10

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:39.610
mythical creatures into the
encyclopedia, all of which

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:42.000
had these names that
sound like obscenities

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.040
of one sort or another.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:48.420
So the grass-mud horse became
a widespread, hugely popular,

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:52.840
internet meme in
China in 2009 and on,

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.890
and gave rise to
this whole menagerie

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:58.250
of subversive animals,
including its mortal enemy,

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:02.150
the river-crab, whose
name sounds almost exactly

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:06.440
like "harmony," which, you
know, harmonious society.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.460
It's become a euphemism
in contemporary Chinese

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.510
whereby, when you say
you harmonize something,

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:14.370
you mean you censor it.

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:20.340
So two other memes turn
up in this next poem--

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:23.370
the Elephant of Truth,
which apparently

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:27.090
has been on the endangered
species list since 1949;

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:31.469
and also the sensitive
fragile-porcelain meme.

00:29:31.469 --> 00:29:33.010
I didn't I need to
say anything else,

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:37.190
except maybe that
Cangjie, the court

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:39.890
historian of the Yellow
Emperor, makes a cameo here,

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:42.200
as the legendary inventor
of Chinese characters.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:53.940
Having just broken
the water pitcher.

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:58.370
This poem has an epigraph from
a collection of koans called,

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:01.720
"The Gateless Gate,"
which goes, Baizhang

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.620
picked up a water
picture, set it on a rock,

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.990
and posed this question.

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:10.700
If you cannot call it a water
pitcher, what do you call it?

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:17.250
This fact I can't
forget, my 30th year

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:22.930
had hastened by before I learned
to see how plum blossom lies

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:27.210
one side-long stroke
of gum-suspended soot

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:31.090
away from regret.

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:35.030
It's said, the man who
invented writing-- charged

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:37.410
with this burden
by the emperor--

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:42.390
sought inspiration in the
surface moods of water.

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:44.285
That he was by the
river when he spied,

00:30:44.285 --> 00:30:49.330
in the finely cracking
mud, a footprint-- its brim

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:52.430
still is a bronzed
mirror, stamped there

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:58.330
by some invisible creature--
and understood his task.

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:00.380
The moment he sketched
the first character,

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.110
the sky rained millet.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:04.750
And the ghosts wailed all
night, for they could not

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:05.630
change their shapes.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:13.970
5,000 years later, in some
remote coal-mining district,

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:18.270
sits an anonymous blogger,
his face lit by more than just

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:20.390
the ancient monitor.

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:23.580
He ponders how strange
it is, how useful

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:27.030
that "I beg you for the
truth" is pronounced the same

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:30.660
as "I beg you,
Elephant of Truth."

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:36.010
Or that sensitive words-- as
in "filters," "crackdowns"--

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:41.050
sounds exactly like
"breakable porcelain."

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:45.440
Done typing, he clicks Submit.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.290
Recall the old monk's
koan, the correct reply

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:53.130
to Master Baizhang's
question-- his pupil

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:55.330
kicked over the
pitcher and left.

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:04.490
This next poem
revisits a figure who's

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:10.670
been really important
to me in my own work.

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:12.580
He's quite a troublesome
figure in lots

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.900
of ways, Ezra Pound, one of
the founders of modernism

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:16.400
in English.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:21.020
I think Eliot was
right when he said

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.860
that Pound was the inventor of
Chinese poetry for our time.

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:27.400
And that's still true now.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.670
Eliot based that
judgment on "Cathay."

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:33.810
Maybe some of you will
know it, published

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:37.810
in 1915, Pound's
free translations

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:41.580
from the classical
Chinese poet Li Bai,

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:46.610
which-- whenever you read
Chinese or Chinese-sounding

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:52.400
poetry these days-- is still
drawing on "Cathay," basically.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.152
But this page here
is actually from

00:32:55.152 --> 00:33:00.990
his epic, unfinished, huge,
sprawling work of synthesizing

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.840
historical and poetic
imagination-- deeply flawed,

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.530
but also, I think,
rather brilliant--

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:08.230
called the cantos,
which he worked on

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:09.917
for much of his adult life.

00:33:09.917 --> 00:33:12.250
And as you can see, one of
the most immediately striking

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:14.541
things about the cantos is
that they have these Chinese

00:33:14.541 --> 00:33:18.120
characters in the margins, in
Pounds rather dodgy Chinese

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:22.070
script. ; Which, of course, is
something I recall deliberately

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:25.670
in my own work and book.

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:28.340
The reason Pound is such
a troubling character--

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.180
there are many.

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:33.510
But one of them is his
pro-fascist and violently

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:37.080
anti-Semitic wartime speeches
for Radio Rome, which

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.940
were what landed him--
after his arrest in 1945--

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:45.080
in a death-cell at the US Army
Disciplinary Training Center

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.430
just outside of Pisa.

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:50.580
And the mental
instability fostered

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:55.060
by these hellish conditions
he met in the cage

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.180
were actually what
eventually saved Pound

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.800
from the scaffold
for treason, in favor

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.797
of a American mental hospital,
St. Elizabeth's, where he spent

00:34:02.797 --> 00:34:04.005
most of the rest of his life.

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:11.380
The last cantos
that he wrote often

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:12.989
are called the "Pisan Cantos."

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:18.360
And it's not straightforward,
ethically, to be moved by them.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:21.230
But I find myself moved
by them, especially

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:24.420
passages like this
famous on in Canto 74,

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:27.800
when an African-American
soldier, Mr. Edwards,

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:31.800
brings Pound a packing
crate to his medical tent

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.250
to use as a writing table.

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:36.030
The "Pisan Cantos,"
elsewhere, are

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:39.940
horribly racist about
Pound's African-American gods

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:40.929
and fellow soldiers.

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:46.380
But this moment does have
it's tug on the heart strings.

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:49.210
So where the last
poem and the next one

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:52.469
are to do with circumventing
censorship, this one,

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:55.429
I sort of conceived as
being about where we might

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:57.535
draw the lines of free speech.

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:04.640
Oh, by the way, Kung
Fu-tzu or Kongzi

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:08.490
is the Chinese
name of Confucius.

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:09.350
Stray dogs.

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:17.260
Thou art a beaten
dog beneath the hail.

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:22.450
To think again of Pound,
bared to the sky at Pisa.

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:26.885
The traitor's cage they built
for him specially, 6 by 6 feet

00:35:26.885 --> 00:35:29.850
of air-strip mesh and dust.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:34.270
Wire diamonds shadowed
starkly under foot.

00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:39.400
Day 25, DTC doctors transfer
him to a medical tent--

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.420
a swollen magpie
in the fitful sun--

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:46.040
fearing the first
signs of a breakdown.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.575
Three weeks in
this here sun going

00:35:47.575 --> 00:35:50.760
to change a man,
thinks Mr. Edwards, he

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.110
with the face of
the Baluba mask,

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:55.510
as he flips over
a packing crate--

00:35:55.510 --> 00:36:01.470
hang regulations-- to fashion
the traitor a writing table.

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:04.730
Squat at his
crate-cum-desk, Pound

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:09.300
spreads flat the worn-out covers
of his dog-eared Confucius.

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.960
He'd slipped it in his
slacks' side-pocket that day

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:16.810
at the house, a rifle
butt pounding the door.

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:18.950
As he flicks through
the "Analects,"

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:21.840
his hand starts to tremble.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.980
He pushes it hard into
his temple, takes up

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.690
the donated pencil stub.

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:30.700
Pull down thy vanity,
near illegible.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.660
Scrawling on squares of
shiny latrine roll, now

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.950
lodged in a library's vaults.

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:40.980
Later, he gets hold of a
GI pad, ruled lines turned

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:44.180
90 degrees, like bars.

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:46.660
No longer blithely
ranting on Rothschilds

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:48.920
as in his radio days--
whether they are

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:52.030
born Jews or taken to Jewry.

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:56.305
Circe's sty, glorious cant.

00:36:56.305 --> 00:36:59.580
Our captive flutters again
to the much-thumbed page

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:03.520
where, having lost his disciples
at the city's east gate,

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:07.110
Kung takes with equanimity
the stranger's slur.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:08.820
Look at this man here.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:12.440
He has a face like a lost dog.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:16.290
Yes, smiles Kung Fu-tzu, yes.

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:17.240
That's quite correct.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.720
That poem is, of course, just a
sequence of terrible dog puns,

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.280
including that Ezra
got sent to the pound.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.008
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:34.920
The third in the trio-- by
way of indirect preamble.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:39.260
This is a photograph I took
in a public park in Chengdu

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.280
a couple of years ago.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.905
And those of you who
have been to China

00:37:41.905 --> 00:37:45.730
have maybe seen this phenomenon
of writing calligraphy--

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:49.440
in this case, a poem
by Li Bai-- in water,

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:53.870
using a giant brush on the
paving stones in parks.

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:58.610
So I spoke just now about
Xu Bing's [CHINESE], Books

00:37:58.610 --> 00:37:59.700
from the Sky.

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:02.280
This is [CHINESE],
so ground-calligraphy

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.250
or books from the ground.

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:07.390
I sort of like that connection.

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:09.030
It's a practice
that-- from what I

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:12.190
can tell-- seemed to arise
in public parks in Beijing

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:16.090
in the 1990s, but then
spread around the country.

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:18.110
And this is the
old man in question

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:19.870
with his admiring
audience of-- I

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:23.450
think they were
physio-therapy students.

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:25.850
But anyway, this practice
of ground-calligraphy,

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:30.900
I think it chimes with a
certain strand of evanescence

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:34.260
or disappearance in Chinese
art of recent decades.

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:38.300
So Song Dong, a
Beijing-born artist,

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:41.550
who began at an early age as a
painter but-- after the events

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:45.790
in Tienanmen of 1989-- was
traumatized and stopped work

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:49.950
for years, before returning
as a conceptual artist.

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:55.600
In 1995, maybe having seen these
old man in the Beijing parks,

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.950
Song began to keep a daily
journal, which he wrote out

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:04.850
in water on a large flat stone,
so that his record of his days

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:09.440
vanished faster than
the days themselves.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:14.660
The following year, in '96, on
a freezing New Year's Night,

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:17.010
Song performed a piece
called "Breathing."

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:19.200
He lay down in Tienanmen
Square, his face

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.190
to the ground, his lips
almost touching the pavement.

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:25.920
And for the next 40
minutes, his clouded breath

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.990
played over the concrete
flags, the vapor freezing

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:33.120
into a thin sheet of ice,
which lasted for a few hours

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.980
and, then, was gone by morning.

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:37.254
So this photograph
and a couple of others

00:39:37.254 --> 00:39:38.920
are the only record
of this performance.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:46.790
I'm working my way
round to Hong Kong.

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:49.750
This, by the way, isn't how
this poem appears in my book.

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:52.150
I just got excited by
the gradient-fill button

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:53.458
on PowerPoint.

00:39:53.458 --> 00:39:55.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:56.510 --> 00:40:00.280
In Chinese, the Tienanmen
incident of '89 isn't known

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:05.570
by its place name, but by
the date, June 4, [CHINESE]--

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:08.590
references to which are
censored on the mainland.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:12.650
For a time, the
invented date, May 35,

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:17.020
allowed Chinese web users
to circumvent the ban.

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:20.230
Hong Kong is the
only place in China

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:23.730
where the anniversary can
be publicly commemorated.

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:26.490
And mass candlelit vigils
take place every year.

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:32.000
And actually, they grow in
force and numbers every year.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.460
I won't say too much, because
it's all in the poem really.

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:38.972
But this is my recollection
of a solidarity protest,

00:40:38.972 --> 00:40:41.170
a sort of fundraising
event that took place

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:45.340
in Hong Kong in support of
the students in Tienanmen

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:48.700
at the end of May 1989.

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:51.630
Even I think I
remember that this

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:53.940
was a euphoric moment
in Hong Kong, when

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:56.750
hundreds of thousands of
people flooded into the streets

00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:59.360
in support of the Chinese
democracy movement

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:05.760
and thought that China would
be reborn in Hong Kong's image.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.290
We still don't know how many
people died in the square.

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:16.300
Innumerable.

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.800
Poem on the eve of May 35.

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:24.440
In the early summer of
1989, when I was five,

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.840
my parents took me
on an unusual outing.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.940
It wasn't that the Jockey
Club's Happy Valley track--

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:35.650
at that time, still epitheted
"Royal"-- was unfamiliar to me.

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:38.000
Every week, I went there for
an hour's swimming lesson

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.740
in the too-hot pool.

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:42.920
My reward, an orange ice-lolly
from the freezer cabinet

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.660
behind the clubhouse bar.

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:48.340
But I knew things were
different that morning.

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:53.070
For one, I had never trod
on the actual grass before.

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:55.060
On race days, that
was the preserve

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:59.180
of the slow-processing row
of black-trousered laborers,

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.990
their cone hats and
canes, who would follow on

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:04.330
after the rumbling
of the horses.

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:06.310
Their job-- with the
practiced touches

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:09.930
of the blind-- to feel out
the slightest hoof-flung sod

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:14.000
and tamp it back into
the reperfected turf.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.180
I spent the day hoisted
on my father's shoulders,

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:22.390
staring out across the
jellied mass of human heads.

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:25.020
On the big screen,
the dots of light

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:28.700
weren't tickering the customary
shifting dance of odds,

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.850
but the exact words
that would rise

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:33.760
from the rippling mouth
in the stands' atoll,

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:37.930
as the crest of
skyscrapers stood watch.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:39.770
On the news that
evening, I tried

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:42.160
to pick out my waving
self among the banners'

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:47.330
swell, the toy-box people
chanting and abuzz.

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:51.340
A few days later, there were
different pictures on the news.

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:54.140
A man, with two
white shopping bags,

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:57.560
edging crabwise on a faceless
boulevard in another city

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:01.000
where, 23 years later, I would
struggle for over half an hour

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.700
to hail a cab.

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:06.870
On rainy race days,
the turf workers--

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:10.120
still bamboo-brimmed--
would wear transparent macs,

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:13.150
dotted with drizzle, and the
determination of a search

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:14.920
party.

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:18.572
Where they press the clumps
back down, you would never know.

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:27.480
And now, finally,
onto my new project,

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:32.190
"Two Systems," which I'm
working on here in Radcliffe.

00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:34.940
Though, I actually
began work on this poem

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:38.770
even before the Umbrella
Movement gained momentum.

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:44.510
I started writing it in the
summer of 2014, last year.

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:47.850
It's an erasure poem that
takes as its source text

00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:50.380
the basic rule of
Hong Kong, which

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:54.370
is often called the former
colony's mini-Constitution.

00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:56.740
And it's a document
that was negotiated

00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:01.450
by Beijing and London through
my childhood in '80s Hong Kong.

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:03.820
So I sort of grew
up in the shadow

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:07.890
of the countdown towards
handover, which was

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:11.910
agreed in '84, when I was one.

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:15.610
The title itself is an erasure.

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:18.280
It refers to one country,
two systems-- of course,

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.640
the principle that
Hong Kong's way of life

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.090
should stay unchanged
for 50 years

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:30.100
after the handover date
on 1st of July, 1997.

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.160
One country, two
systems supposedly

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.910
guarantees a high-degree
of autonomy from China.

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:39.060
But what this
means is constantly

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:43.680
being negotiated and
feared over right now.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:48.380
So I guess, the idea that Hong
Kong should remain a civil law

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:50.980
jurisdiction within a civil
law state, a capitalist pocket

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:53.940
in a socialist
framework, and so on.

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:56.510
But what intrigued me
about the basic law

00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:59.940
is that it's a
self-deconstructing-- you might

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.680
even say,
self-destructing-- text,

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:09.070
which enshrines within itself
the date of it's undoing, 2047.

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:12.210
On the basis that I think
that you are all probably

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:14.710
more familiar with the Umbrella
Movement in Hong Kong than

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:16.620
you are with the history
of the erasure poem.

00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:17.360
I could be wrong.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.000
I thought I'd give
you a posit history

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.750
to show that this is far from
something that I've invented.

00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:27.260
So I guess it was popular with
Western avant garde writers

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:28.750
since the '60s.

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:32.090
And so, this is a famous example
called Ronald Johnson's RADI

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:37.970
OS of 1977, which erased most
of Milton's Paradise Lost,

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:42.130
to give rise to these new,
surprisingly affecting work.

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:46.860
It's often praised for being
Pound-like in its imagism,

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:49.200
out of the earlier
poem's rubble.

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:52.570
Johnson described his process
as being like etching,

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:54.690
cutting away at each page.

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:57.530
And indeed, erasure poetry
does have visual qualities

00:45:57.530 --> 00:46:01.590
that I think place it somewhere
between art and literature.

00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:03.630
And it's rise
probably has something

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:05.130
to do with contemporary
developments

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:05.970
in the visual arts.

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:09.360
So like Rauschenberg's Erased
de Kooning Drawing, which

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.490
does what it says on the tin.

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:15.430
So I've been trying to think
about this visual dimension

00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:18.740
since I've been at Radcliffe,
the texture, the materiality,

00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:20.710
or otherwise of erasure.

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:24.670
And I think Travis McDonald's
"The Omission Repo,"

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:27.190
is particularly interesting
in this respect.

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:31.240
McDonald's source text is
the 9/11 Commission Report,

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:36.330
which gives his work an
obvious political valence.

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:40.300
But he also has these three
different strategies for part

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.120
effacing the background text.

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.040
So by the way, I
think this is the best

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.827
page in the whole poem.

00:46:45.827 --> 00:46:47.910
We have tried to remember
that sight can sometimes

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:49.110
see what happened in shadow.

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:51.290
It's good, isn't it?

00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:58.030
So like here, a sort
of fade or a blur

00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:03.190
or a strike-through-- which
reminds me of the fact

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:06.650
that George W. Bush's
favorite writing instrument

00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:08.765
was reportedly a Sharpie marker.

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.770
Oh, and this is Tom Phillips'
"A Humament," and which

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:19.021
is based on W.H. Mallock's
late Victorian novel, A Human

00:47:19.021 --> 00:47:19.520
Document.

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:22.300
Which sort of takes the visual
dimension to another level

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:26.920
that I'm not sure I can
personally arise to.

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:31.010
I'm just going to read
you this first page

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:34.871
of "Two Systems," though I've
given you three in the handout.

00:47:34.871 --> 00:47:36.370
And so, as I said,
I started working

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:39.780
on this piece in the
early summer of 2014,

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.530
when Beijing released
a white-paper that

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:44.820
caused widespread
consternation in Hong Kong

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:49.240
and was one of the spurs towards
the Occupy Central Umbrella

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.122
Movement.

00:47:51.122 --> 00:47:53.330
One of the things they were
particularly afraid about

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:55.220
was the idea that
Hong Kong judges might

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:59.100
have to show fealty to Beijing.

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:02.210
So I found it satisfying,
in a childlike way,

00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:05.410
to set about these pages from
the basic law with Photoshop's

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:09.690
eraser tool, so releasing
their anarchic, subversive,

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:12.010
gloriously vulgar undersongs.

00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:13.990
But you find in amongst
the nonsense touches

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:18.250
of sense starting to
emerge, including illusions

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:21.335
to the current unrest
about Hong Kong's path

00:48:21.335 --> 00:48:23.750
to universal suffrage.

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:27.000
So I'll read it from
this first page.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.900
The court of Kong is rat
hall, diction over acts

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:33.360
such fence and reign affairs.

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:37.170
Our region shall obtain
a cat on quest, the cat

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:39.840
of Cat Hall, before all.

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:44.468
EG joy, power to
the people, he-he.

00:48:44.468 --> 00:48:45.704
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:46.204 --> 00:48:47.710
I've never read that before.

00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:48.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:52.040
Zen shall entitle the
age to dance, number

00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:55.990
the citizens among the elect,
work the high organ of men

00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:57.570
over and over.

00:48:57.570 --> 00:48:59.855
Mini rat, mini dance.

00:48:59.855 --> 00:49:01.772
There is a need for art.

00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:03.188
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:07.700
I won't read the second page,
though it's in the handout.

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:10.230
But what I found
was interesting,

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:12.760
these characters
start to emerge,

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.850
as I do more and more
of this, I guess in line

00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:19.120
with the repetitions
in the legal text.

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.370
So there's this sort of
hapless character called

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:25.810
Reg on this page-- Reg must
obtain the approval of people--

00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:29.670
who, in my mind, was a sort of
allusion to the colonial past.

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:31.910
Reg, for me, is like
an irreverent nod

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:35.470
to the Regina versus X
formula of English law.

00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:39.410
So he's this cut-down
version of Regina.

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:42.060
And then, by this
final page-- which

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:46.030
is the one seeking to define
a Hong Kong resident-- hardly

00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:51.660
anything is left, except
that haunting date of 2047.

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:53.530
So I'm sure we can
talk more about this.

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:56.730
But I think it's probably
time to open up for questions.

00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:59.780
[APPLAUSE AND MUSIC]
