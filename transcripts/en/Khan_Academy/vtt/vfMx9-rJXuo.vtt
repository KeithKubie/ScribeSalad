00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.940
If we have 2 groups and
in each group I have 4,

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.880
so that's one group
of 4, and then

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.310
here is my second
group of 4, we already

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:20.230
know that we could
write this as 2 times 4,

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.960
which is the same
thing as 4 plus 4.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.890
Notice I have two 4's here.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.540
I have 4 plus another 4.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.600
Well, if I have 4 plus 4,
or if I have 2 groups of 4,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.306
either way, I'm going to
have a total of 8 things.

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:41.680
And you see that
right over here.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.380
We have 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8 things.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.050
What I want you to do
is pause the video now

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.720
and try to group these
same 8 things, but to group

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.010
it in other ways so
that we can represent 8

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.920
as the product of whole numbers.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.020
Here I've represented 8
as the product of 2 and 4.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.660
2 times 4 is 8.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.660
See if you can represent
8 as the product

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.180
of other whole numbers,
or as whole numbers

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.120
in different ways, grouping
it in different ways.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.040
So I assume you've
paused the video.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.250
So let's try it out ourselves.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.730
So one thing we
could do, we could

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.700
view this instead
of as 2 groups of 4,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.030
we can view 8 as 4 groups of 2.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.420
So that's 1 group of 2, 2
groups of 2, 3 groups of 2,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.890
4 groups of 2.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:42.150
So we could write that
4 times 2 is equal to 8.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.490
And we could view this as
the same thing as, literally,

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.490
4 2's.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.520
We have one 1, 2, 3, 4 2's.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.850
Each of these have 2 in them.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.110
So we're going to
say 1, 2, 3, 4 2's.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.760
2 plus 2, plus 2,
plus 2 is equal to 8.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.130
These are both equivalent.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.560
4 times 2, literally
4 groups of 2.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.460
That's the same thing as taking
4 2's and adding them together.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.670
Notice, we have 2
2's right over here.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.340
We added them together, 1, 2.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.320
Here, we have 4 2's
and we're adding

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.720
them together, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.620
We take our 4 2's and
we add them together.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.450
How else could we represent 8?

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.240
Well, we literally could
view it as 8 groups of 1.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.750
So let's do that.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.920
So 8 groups of 1
would look like this.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:40.880
That's 1 group of 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.660
So we could write this
down as 8 times 1.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.205
8 times 1 is, once
again, equal to 8.

00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:53.580
And if we wanted to write this
down as repeated addition,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.350
well, this is literally 8 1's.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.760
So 1 plus 1, plus 1,
plus 1, plus 1, plus 1.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.260
Let's see.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.320
That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.630
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.490
1 plus 1, plus 1, plus 1,
plus 1, plus 1, plus 1,

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.180
plus 1 is equal to 8.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.980
Now, you might be
a little stumped.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.470
Well, what's another
way of getting to 8?

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.170
Well, you could literally
view it as 1 group of 8.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.560
So let me view it that way.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.530
So this is just 1 entire
group of 8, the whole thing.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.030
The whole thing is a group of 8.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.110
So let me scroll over to
the right a little bit.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.240
We could write this
down as 1 times 8.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.770
And 1 times 8 is equal to 8.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.580
And how would we view that?

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.660
Well, we only have one 8 now.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.830
We don't have to add that
one 8 to anything else.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.440
So if we wanted to do it the
way we've done the last few,

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.560
we could literally write it
down as we just have one 8.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.950
Well, one 8 is clearly
going to just be equal to 8.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.740
So now let me ask
you another question.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.880
So far we've been focused
on each of these groups,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.480
but what if we actually
view this as 4 groups of 8.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.320
Then how many things are
we actually going to have?

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.360
So let me make this very clear.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:37.940
So we have 1 group of eight 8,
2 groups of 8, 3 groups of 8,

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.000
and 4 groups of 8.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.230
So we would view this
as 4 times 8, or which

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:56.880
is going to be the same thing
as 8 plus 8, plus 8, plus 8.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.110
4 8's.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.694
What is this going
to be equal to?

00:04:59.694 --> 00:05:01.360
A And I encourage you
to pause the video

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.535
and figure it out right now.

00:05:03.535 --> 00:05:05.160
Well, there's a couple
of ways that you

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.567
could have thought about this.

00:05:06.567 --> 00:05:08.400
You could have literally
just counted these.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.570
Or you could say, well, let's
see, you can skip count by 8.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.840
8, 16, 24, 32.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.250
Or you could have said, 8
plus 8 is 16, plus 8 is 24,

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.860
plus 8 is 32.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.270
Or you could have literally
just counted the triangles here.
