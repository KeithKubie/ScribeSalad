WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE
A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS THING.

00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:57.343
YOU'RE A COCAINE DEALER,

00:02:57.376 --> 00:02:59.378
BUT YOU'VE DONE A LOT
OF GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY.

00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:00.446
- OH, I KNOW, MAN.

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:02.248
ON THANKSGIVING,

LIKE NINO BROWN, BABY.

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:06.385
- BUT, SERIOUSLY,
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

00:03:06.418 --> 00:03:08.654
HOW ABOUT YOU TESTIFY
BEFORE A SENATE COMMITTEE

AND SPEND

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:11.658
TWO MONTHS AT CLUB FED?

00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:15.127
- WHEN I GET OUT,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.298
CAN I STILL TRAFFIC ROCKS

- ANYWAY,
HE POINTS THE GUN AT US,

00:03:36.548 --> 00:03:38.351
AND HE TELLS HIS DOG
TO SIC US.

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:41.053
IT WAS AT THAT POINT
THAT I FIRED UPON THE CANINE

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:44.390
AND WE WERE ABLE
TO SUBDUE MR. JEFFRIES.

00:03:44.423 --> 00:03:46.659
UPON FURTHER SEARCH
OF THE MANSION,

00:03:46.692 --> 00:03:49.195
WE WERE ABLE
TO LOCATE THIS:

00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:51.330
PURE COLOMBIAN HEROIN.

00:03:51.363 --> 00:03:52.598

00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:54.066

I DON'T KNOW
WHO'S HEROIN THAT IS,

00:03:56.568 --> 00:03:58.904
BUT IT CERTAINLY
ISN'T MINE.

00:03:58.937 --> 00:04:02.074
- THEN HIS WIFE THREW
HER TITTIES IN MY HAND.

00:04:02.107 --> 00:04:03.075
IT WAS WEIRD, YOUR HONOR.

00:04:03.108 --> 00:04:04.377
- YOU GRABBED
HER TITTIES!

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.445
I SAW YOU!

00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:10.316
- BEFORE I SENTENCE YOU,

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.151
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY?

00:04:12.184 --> 00:04:14.820
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL--

00:04:14.853 --> 00:04:16.188

TEN MINUTES

00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:43.416

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.918
PLENTY OF TIME TO LIFT WEIGHTS

00:04:45.951 --> 00:04:48.021
AND CONVERT TO ISLAM.

00:04:49.955 --> 00:04:53.092
