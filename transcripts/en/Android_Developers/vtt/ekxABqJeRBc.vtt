00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.475
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.220
ROK ZORKO: I'm Rok Zorko.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.330
I am the VP of products.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.910
When we started, it
was just eight of us.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.870
Everything was sketched
on a whiteboard

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.480
and then built very quickly.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.240
In the first six months, I think
we built seven or eight apps.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.041
And the last one, Talking
Tom, was then a global hit.

00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:29.820
IZA LOGIN: Currently,
we have more than 2.5

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.940
billion downloads, more than
250 million monthly users

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.300
only on Talking Tom
and Friends franchise,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.570
and we are all thrilled
to continue this way.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.790
ROK ZORKO: We've seen Android
become our majority platform.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.170
When we launched My Talking
Tom in November 2013,

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.010
the initial numbers were 50/50.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.060
So 50% of users and downloads
came from Android and 50

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.180
from other platforms.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.560
Now, the split is 70/30.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.170
So 70% Android, 30%
other platforms,

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.230
but we use the same
cross promotion.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.230
We use the same
marketing, so this just

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.660
means that Android has grown.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.870
So Outfit7's launch
strategy on the latest games

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.600
has always been all
platforms at the same time,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.120
and the main reason for that is
the effect that you can achieve

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.730
is the biggest,
and we don't really

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.739
want any of our
users to be unhappy.

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:22.780
MARKO STAMCAR: We launched
My Talking Angela back

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.600
in December.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.960
We first did stage
rollout in Google Play,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.130
and then after
everything was ready,

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.870
we went 100% on all platforms.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.840
And in about a week, I think
we got 10 million downloads.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.130
So that was a huge success and
recognition for all our teams,

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.150
from product to marketing.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.140
ROK ZORKO: When we were
just doing paid apps,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.060
and now we're doing freemium
apps within our purchases

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.290
from 2013 and 2014, the revenue
growth was more than 1,000%.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.860
So I think we chose the right
strategy going freemium.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.510
When we built our first app,
the only app provider in there

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.830
was AdMob It's still one of our
most important ad providers.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.710
We didn't actually expected that
we would be earning as much.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.090
Our most successful
apps at the moment all

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.290
have a lot of mini
games in it, and we

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.970
decided that the best way to
get engagement on a new level

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.550
was to put in Google Play
services leaderboards,

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.550
and that really helps
competition in a healthy way.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.200
I think the main reason why
our downloads keep growing ever

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.880
faster is because we were always
effective at cross promotion.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.220
We always say internally
that 50% of our business

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.600
is building great
apps and games,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.279
and the other 50% is making
sure that people notice them.

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:40.320
MARKO STAMCAR: When we
became successful in apps,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.420
we wanted Outfit7 to become
more than just an app company.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.870
We wanted to become an
entertainment company.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.320
So we started building
up our YouTube Channel,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.880
and now we have
millions of subscribers

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.990
and 1.4 billion viewers.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.400
And we just recently have been
accepted into the YouTube Kids

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.460
app.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.370
IZA LOGIN: Google play a
big role because in certain

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.170
territories, without
Google, we cannot imagine

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.690
our distribution, and it's
really nice to see users

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.850
worldwide playing with
our apps and having fun.
