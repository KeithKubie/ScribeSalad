00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.296
June 13, 2014

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.696
started as a routine Friday

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.000
in Redemption Hospital in Monrovia,
the capital of Liberia.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.480
Redemption is the largest
free public health hospital in the city.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.560
We are called upon to serve
hundreds of thousands of people.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.280
In the best of times
it puts strain on our resources.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.896
Monthly supplies run out within weeks,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.480
and patients without beds
would be seated in chairs.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.776
That summer, we had a nurse
who had been sick for a while.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.120
Sick enough to be admitted
in our hospital.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.136
But our treatment
didn't seem to be helping her;

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.736
her symptoms were getting worse:

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.680
diarrhea, severe abdominal pain,
fever and weakness.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.576
On that particular Friday,
she developed severe respiratory distress,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.360
and her eyes were menacingly red.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.696
One of my fellow doctors,
a general surgeon,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.456
became suspicious of her condition.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.440
He said her symptoms
were suggestive of Ebola.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.216
We kept a close watch on her,
we tried to help her.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.896
We were treating her for malaria,
typhoid and gastroenteritis.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.720
We didn't know it,
but by then it was too late.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.056
The next morning I walked in
to check on my patient.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.240
I could tell by the look in her eyes
that she was filled with fear.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.400
I gave her reassurance,
but shortly after ...

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.040
she died of Ebola.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.176
For me, her death was very personal.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.800
But this was just the beginning.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.800
A virtual biological bomb had exploded.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.960
But the word spread faster than the virus,
and panic spread across the hospital.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.560
All the patients ran away.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.920
Then, all the nurses and doctors ran away.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.256
This was the beginning
of our medical tsunami --

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.096
the devastating Ebola virus

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.800
that left an indelible scar
in our country's history.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.400
I was not trained for this.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.696
I had just graduated
from medical school two years before.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.656
At this time,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.776
my total knowledge about Ebola
came from a one-page article

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.440
I had read in medical school.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.336
I perceived the disease as so dangerous,

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.256
this one page in essence had convinced me
to run out of the hospital, too,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.200
the moment I heard of a case of Ebola.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.696
But when it finally happened,
I stayed on and decided to help.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.200
And so did several other
brave health care professionals.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.376
But we would pay a heavy price.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.336
Many persons and health professionals
had become high-risk contacts.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.920
This actually meant 21 days counting
to potentially disease or death.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.296
Our health systems were fragile,

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.640
our health workers
lacked skills and training.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.936
So in the weeks and months that followed,

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.336
health workers were disproportionately
affected by the Ebola virus disease.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.216
More than 400 nurses, doctors and other
health professionals became infected.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.656
Unfortunately, my friend,
the general surgeon

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.760
who correctly identified
the symptoms in that first case

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.240
became one of the casualties.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.736
On July 27, the president of Liberia

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.880
imposed quarantine
on the worst-affected areas.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.256
She closed all the schools
and universities

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.296
and shut down many public events.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.056
Four days later,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.936
the United States Peace Corps

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.976
pulled out of Liberia,
out of Sierra Leone and Guinea

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.200
due to Ebola.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.016
In August, six weeks after the nurse died,

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.096
hundreds of people were dying
of the disease each week.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.720
People were dying in the streets.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.176
Over the months that followed,

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.976
West Africa would lose thousands of people
to Ebola virus disease.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.216
In August, I joined a team
to set up the Ebola treatment unit

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.776
at JFK hospital in Monrovia.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.840
I was charged with running the second
Ebola treatment unit in the city.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.080
Our unit provided hope for thousands
of patients, families and communities.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.536
I not only provided care,
I came face to face with Ebola.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.656
Living every day as a high-risk
Ebola virus disease contact

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.296
during the worst of the outbreak

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.055
was one of my worst experiences.

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:33.896
I started counting 21 days every day.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.456
I lived every moment anticipating
the onset of symptoms of the disease.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.416
I measured my body
temperature several times.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.576
I showered with chlorinated water,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.056
more concentrated
than actually recommended.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.936
I chlorinated my phones,
my pants, my hands, my car.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.760
My clothes became bleached.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.776
Those days you were alone,

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.936
people were so afraid of touching anybody.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.136
Everyone was counted
as a potential contact.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.696
Touching would make them sick.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.920
I was stigmatized.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.616
But if that was what it was for me,
who was symptom-free,

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.536
imagine what it was for someone
who actually had symptoms,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.480
someone who had Ebola.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.896
We learned that to treat
Ebola successfully,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.840
we had to suspend
some of the normal rules of society.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.176
Our president declared
a state of emergency in August

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.840
and suspended certain rights.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.240
And the national police even supported
our work during the Ebola response.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.336
In February 2015,
gang members came in for isolation

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.240
in our Ebola isolation unit.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.896
They were also know
as the VIP Boys of Monrovia,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.296
terrifying small-time drug addicts

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.176
whose presence could instill
a tremendous amount of fear,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.880
although they could not
legally carry guns.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.856
They underwent quarantine for 21 days
in our unit and were not arrested.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.760
We told the police,

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.800
"If you arrest them here,

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.800
they will stop coming,
they won't get treated.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.520
And the Ebola virus
will continue to spread."

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.376
The police agreed, and we were able
to treat the VIP Boys,

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.960
and they did not have to worry
about being arrested while in the unit.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.576
Over the course of the outbreak,
West Africa had almost 29,000 cases.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.776
More than 11,000 people died.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.280
And that included 12 of my fine colleagues
at John F. Kennedy hospital in Monrovia.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:52.176
In June 2016, exactly 23 months
after my first Ebola patient died,

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.880
Liberia declared its Ebola outbreak ended.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.216
We thought that once the outbreak ended,

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.136
so did the problems.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.280
We hoped that life
would go back to normal.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.656
Today, there are more
than 17,000 survivors in West Africa.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.376
People who actually had
Ebola virus disease,

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.136
lived through it and survived.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.000
We counted survival rate as a success:

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.296
the end of suffering for the patient
and fulfilling joy for families.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.696
Every discharge from the unit
was a moment of jubilation.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.440
At least so we thought.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.176
The best description
of the moment of discharge

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.096
and a rare glimpse into the moment
that defines our life post-Ebola

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.896
was vividly expressed
in the words of my best friend

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.640
and fellow doctor, Philip Ireland,
in an interview with "The Times."

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.056
He said at the time of his release,

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.576
"There were a lot of people there
from JFK hospital:

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.640
my family, my elder brother,
my wife was there.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.216
A lot of other doctors were there, too,
and members of the media were there.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.496
And I felt like Nelson Mandela,
it felt like the 'Long Walk to Freedom,'

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.736
and I walked and raised
my hands to the heaven,

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.400
thanking God for saving my life."

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.840
And Philip said,
"Then I saw something else.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.976
There were a lot of crying people,
people happy to see me.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.160
But when I got close to anybody,
they backed away."

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.736
For many Ebola survivors,
society still seems to be backing away,

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.176
even as they struggle
to lead a normal life.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.680
For these survivors, life can be compared
to another health emergency.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.096
They may suffer debilitating
joint and body pain.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.496
The suffering gradually decays
over time for most.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.376
However, many continue
to bear intermittent pain.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.160
Some survivors are blind,
others have neurological disabilities.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.336
Some survivors experience stigmatization
every day, in many ways.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.216
A lot of children are orphans.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.240
Some survivors experience
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.160
And some survivors
lack opportunity for education.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.160
Even families can be split apart
by fear of Ebola, too.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.536
There's no definitive cure
for transmitting Ebola virus through sex.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.680
However, there are successful
interventions for prevention.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.336
We have worked hard on semen testing,

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.640
behavioral counseling,
safe sex promotion and research.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.816
For the past year, there have been
no cases of sexual transmission.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.176
But some male survivors
have lost their spouses

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.736
out of fear they will be
infected with Ebola.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.840
That's how families are torn apart.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.416
Another tremendous challenge
for Ebola survivors

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.280
is obtaining adequate health care.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:43.456
In theory, Liberia's public
health services are free of charge.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:47.896
In practice, our health system
lacks the funding and capacity

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.840
to expand care
to all at the point of need.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.296
Many survivors have waited
many months to undergo surgery

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.120
to heal their blinding cataracts.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.856
Few had to relive
the traumatic experience,

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.416
when their blood was retested for Ebola
at the point of admission.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.656
Some survivors experienced
delayed or deferred admission

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.280
due to limited bed capacity.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.120
No bed available for one more patient.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.216
This is neither national policy
nor officially condoned,

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.840
but many people are still afraid
of the sporadic resurgence of Ebola virus.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.400
The results can be tragic.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.776
I have seen Beatrice, an Ebola
survivor, several times now.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.280
She's 26 years old.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.760
Many of her family members
became infected, she luckily survived.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.736
But since that day in 2014
she was discharged

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.096
to cheering health workers,

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.936
her life has never been the same.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.240
She became blind as the result of Ebola.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.416
In 2014, the baby of a dear friend of mine
was only two months old,

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.776
when both parents and child were admitted
in an Ebola treatment unit in Monrovia.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.360
Luckily, they survived.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.056
My friend's baby
is almost three years old now,

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.296
but cannot stand,
cannot walk, cannot speak.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.800
He has failure to thrive.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.960
There are many more hidden experiences
and many stories are yet untold.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.920
The survivors of Ebola
deserve our attention and support.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.736
The only way we can defeat this pandemic

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.600
is when we ensure
that we win this final battle.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.336
Our best opportunity is to ensure

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:33.136
that every survivor receives
adequate care at the point of need

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.640
without any form of stigma
and at no cost to them personally.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.320
How can a society consider itself healed

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.216
when a person's entire identity

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.256
is defined by the fact
that they recovered from Ebola?

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.256
Should a previous disease
that a person no longer has

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.896
become the sum total of their identity,

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.976
the identifier in their passport

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.080
that deters you from traveling
to seek medical care abroad?

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.336
Simply the ID that denies you health care.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.616
Or prevents you from having
a relationship with your spouse.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.096
Or denies you of family,
of friend or home.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.856
Or prevents you from
carrying on your normal job,

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.720
so you can put food on the table
or have a roof over your family's head.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.696
What is the meaning of the right to life

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.440
when our life is clouded by stigma
and barriers that fuel that stigma?

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:27.256
Until we have much better answers
to those questions in West Africa,

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.840
our work is not over yet.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.800
Liberians are a resilient people.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.680
And we know how to rise to a challenge,
even a devastating one.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.936
My best memories of the outbreak

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.656
center on those many people
who survived the disease,

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:51.016
but I cannot forget the hard-working
nurses, doctors, volunteers and staff

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.616
who risked their own safety
in service of humanity.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.920
And some even losing
their lives in the process.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.336
During the worst of the contagion,

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:06.336
one thing kept us making those perilous
daily journeys into the Ebola wards.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.000
We had a passion to save lives.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.616
Was I afraid during the Ebola outbreak?

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.920
Of course I was.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.256
But for me, the opportunity
to protect our global health security

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.360
and keep communities safe at home
and abroad was an honor.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.880
So as the dangers became greater,
our humanity became stronger.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.720
We faced our fears.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.696
The global health community
working together defeated Ebola,

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.920
and that ...

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.096
that is how I know

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.856
that we can defeat its aftermath

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.720
in our hearts, in our minds
and in our communities.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.816
Thank you.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:59.480
(Applause)
