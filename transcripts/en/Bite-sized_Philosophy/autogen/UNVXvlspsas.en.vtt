so<00:06:49.869><c> that's</c><00:06:50.409><c> just</c><00:06:50.769><c> it</c><00:06:51.459><c> isn't</c><00:06:51.669><c> that</c>

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:51.969 align:start position:0%
so that's just it isn't that
 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:53.969 align:start position:0%
so that's just it isn't that
biologically<00:06:52.839><c> there</c><00:06:53.049><c> are</c><00:06:53.169><c> two</c><00:06:53.409><c> sexes</c>

think you kind of already talked about
 

00:07:34.299 --> 00:07:38.279 align:start position:0%
think you kind of already talked about
this<00:07:35.129><c> when</c><00:07:36.129><c> you</c><00:07:36.249><c> said</c><00:07:36.489><c> the</c><00:07:37.179><c> American</c><00:07:38.019><c> post</c>

this when you said the American post
modernist<00:07:38.709><c> got</c><00:07:39.009><c> this</c><00:07:39.219><c> right</c><00:07:39.489><c> and</c><00:07:39.819><c> that</c><00:07:40.389><c> I'm</c>

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:40.899 align:start position:0%
modernist got this right and that I'm
 

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:43.049 align:start position:0%
modernist got this right and that I'm
going<00:07:41.679><c> to</c><00:07:41.739><c> summarize</c><00:07:41.979><c> very</c><00:07:42.309><c> quickly</c><00:07:42.459><c> because</c>

going to summarize very quickly because
 

00:07:43.059 --> 00:07:46.519 align:start position:0%
going to summarize very quickly because
you<00:07:43.569><c> have</c><00:07:43.779><c> already</c><00:07:44.229><c> answered</c><00:07:44.619><c> but</c><00:07:45.129><c> like</c><00:07:45.339><c> um</c>

00:07:46.519 --> 00:07:46.529 align:start position:0%
you have already answered but like um
 

00:07:46.529 --> 00:07:50.459 align:start position:0%
you have already answered but like um
you<00:07:47.529><c> say</c><00:07:47.949><c> that</c><00:07:48.249><c> you</c><00:07:49.209><c> see</c><00:07:49.449><c> scientific</c><00:07:50.110><c> realism</c>

00:07:50.459 --> 00:07:50.469 align:start position:0%
you say that you see scientific realism
 

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
you say that you see scientific realism
is<00:07:50.829><c> nested</c><00:07:51.219><c> in</c><00:07:51.369><c> Darwinian</c><00:07:52.179><c> competition</c><00:07:52.809><c> and</c>

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:53.050 align:start position:0%
is nested in Darwinian competition and
 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.179 align:start position:0%
is nested in Darwinian competition and
so<00:07:53.919><c> it's</c><00:07:54.369><c> reasonably</c><00:07:55.360><c> objective</c><00:07:55.779><c> that</c><00:07:56.649><c> the</c>

00:07:57.179 --> 00:07:57.189 align:start position:0%
so it's reasonably objective that the
 

00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:59.999 align:start position:0%
so it's reasonably objective that the
little<00:07:57.789><c> no</c><00:07:58.239><c> that's</c><00:07:58.479><c> not</c><00:07:58.629><c> quite</c><00:07:58.839><c> right</c><00:07:59.110><c> okay</c><00:07:59.739><c> no</c>

00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:00.009 align:start position:0%
little no that's not quite right okay no
 

00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
little no that's not quite right okay no
I<00:08:00.279><c> I</c><00:08:00.369><c> would</c><00:08:00.879><c> say</c><00:08:00.909><c> that</c><00:08:01.329><c> it</c><00:08:01.899><c> hasn't</c><00:08:02.139><c> obvious</c><00:08:02.919><c> to</c>

00:08:03.119 --> 00:08:03.129 align:start position:0%
I I would say that it hasn't obvious to
 

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:06.829 align:start position:0%
I I would say that it hasn't obvious to

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:48.420 align:start position:0%

is so I am suggesting that if we are to

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
