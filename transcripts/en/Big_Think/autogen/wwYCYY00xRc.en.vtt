00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:06.260
How might you be able to differentiate between
the executives who ultimately decided to commit

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.640
fraud and those who didn't?

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:16.970
You look at all these incentives and over
a 20 year period there's thousands of executives

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.160
who have strong incentives from their career
perspective, from the value of their stock

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.159
options to inflate the numbers, and only a
tiny fraction, you know, less than one percent,

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:31.659
that we know of, ever wind up doing this.

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:35.680
So maybe there's something unique that we
can find about these people.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.789
We started brainstorming and thinking about
just anything about someone's lifestyle, beliefs,

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:47.719
personal behaviors that might be relevant
in this area.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:54.140
And we had a list of all sorts of things like
if they had extramarital affairs or we thought

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.329
about trophy wives or just anything.

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.780
And some of the things were more just sort
of joking around.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.760
But then we had a list of things that we thought
would make good sense.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.190
One of them was if an executive had previously
broken the law.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:16.010
Another one would be the relative materialism
or frugality of an executive; how they spend

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.990
their money.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.240
And it turns out that we're able to get pretty
good data on these two things for a large

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.650
number of senior executives.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.310
So instead of just having an idea, it's actually
something that we can test.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:38.590
So in this paper we found that executives
who had previously broken the law were maybe

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.150
two and a half to three times more likely
to commit accounting fraud in the analysis

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.020
we did.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.960
What was perhaps a little more surprising
was that if we looked at executives whose

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.350
only legal violation was a minor speeding
ticket or some other traffic violation, we

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.420
still find significant results.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.880
Now, they're definitely weaker but they're
still meaningful and significant in the tests

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.100
that we run.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.280
We go one step further.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.310
When the SCC investigates a firm they usually
name the people that the evidence suggests

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.370
specifically perpetrated the fraud.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.830
And when just looking at who the SCC actually
singled out, we found those with these prior

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.490
legal violations were six to seven times more
likely to be the one the SCC indicates had

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.020
actually committed the act.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:42.670
The second characteristic we looked at, depending
on what area of say psychology or sociology

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.830
you're looking at, you can think about it
as either frugality or materialism, they're

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.140
roughly two sides to the same coin.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.819
I mean if you live a really frugal lifestyle,
you're not really materialistic, and if you're

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.320
really materialistic you're not frugal.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:06.011
So we were able to get pretty good data on
cars, boats and real estate that an executive

00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:07.011
owns.

00:03:07.011 --> 00:03:15.180
Ideally we'd have paintings or huge diamonds
or something of that sort but you really can't

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.640
accurately collect data like that for a large
group of people.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:26.850
So we came up with just a binary measure whether
we treated an executive as frugal or materialistic

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.709
or unfrugal depending on the value of any
vehicles they owned, the length of any boats

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.420
they may have owned and then sort of an excess
value of their real estate.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.480
We realized there's a cost to living.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.069
People need to pay to live.

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.069
And depending on where an executive works
that cost can vary dramatically.

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:54.430
So we wound up basically subtracting the average
cost of living for wherever they happen to

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.011
be and we said if an executive's home was
more than double what the average is, we'd

00:03:59.011 --> 00:04:02.670
consider that relatively unfrugal.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.110
We'd found some interesting research that
suggested frugal CEOs placed more emphasis

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.720
on controls and on monitoring.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:19.219
And we thought strong monitoring and good
controls probably reduces the likelihood that

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:20.829
fraud takes place.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.439
So we didn't find a really strong theory to
suggest that these materialistic CEOs would

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:31.449
commit fraud themselves, but we thought it
was reasonable that if they weren't placing

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.180
emphasis on controls that somebody in the
firm might do it.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.600
And that's really what we found.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:45.490
We didn't find that these materialistic CEOs
were accused specifically by the SCC of committing

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.719
fraud, but we found fraud was much more likely
to happen at their firms.

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:55.360
And then just as a follow up we thought well,
if this really is related to corporate governance

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.650
broadly or firm controls and monitoring, then
these CEOs should also be more likely to have

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.460
to restate financial statements just because
of an error.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.520
So we collected data on restatements that
were not intentional and basically performed

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.770
the same analysis and we found they were more
likely to have errors take place at their

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:15.840
firms.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.241
So we think this has to do with a culture
that they set in the firm and the relative

00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:24.490
lack of emphasis on monitoring and controls.
