00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.700
- [Instructor] The server
suggests that all guests

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.740
would try the homemade
chocolate fudge cake.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.320
Now, when I read this and
I had the word would here,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.330
when I see the server
suggested all guests would try

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.120
the homemade chocolate fudge cake,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.702
I'm expecting, well, under
what conditions would they try?

00:00:18.702 --> 00:00:20.571
So I'm expecting to see
something, would try

00:00:20.571 --> 00:00:22.810
the homemade chocolate fudge cake

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.330
if such and such happened.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.800
But that's not what they're telling us.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.870
What we're really saying
is that the server suggests

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.590
that guests try the homemade
chocolate fudge cake.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.750
So I definitely don't wanna
keep it the way it is.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.940
If we said tried, then that
would be the past tense.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.120
The server suggests that all guests tried

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.360
the homemade chocolate fudge cake.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.010
Now, that would imply that
the server's suggesting

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.880
that in the past, all the guests had tried

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.070
the homemade chocolate fudge cake.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.250
But that's not the intent of the sentence.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.300
The server's suggesting that people try

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.660
the homemade chocolate fudge cake.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.690
So I'm gonna get rid of that one.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.430
And I keep saying it, and we
see the best choice three.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.290
The server suggests that all guests try

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.440
the homemade chocolate fudge cake.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.450
This is exactly what we want.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.420
The server is making a suggestion.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.420
It's not a conditional, it's
not something in the past.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.310
And then we can rule out
this last one, will try.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.400
This is kinda the server,
if we replaced will try,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.010
this would be the server
predicting something

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.410
about the future, which isn't
the intent of the sentence.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.880
The server suggests
that all guests will try

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.550
the homemade chocolate fudge cake.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.740
So I think this one is off too.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.893
So definitely like that choice.
