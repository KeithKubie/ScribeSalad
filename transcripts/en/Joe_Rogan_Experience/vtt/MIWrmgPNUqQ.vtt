WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.800
Try it in there. Yeah. This one is from a Goggins.

2
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.170
David Goggins gave me this one. That's his coin. Yeah. He's got his own coins.

3
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:14.140
So was kind of Dan Crenshaw coin, bro. I do. This is kind of a big coin.

4
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.320
It's a fat one. It's not one you can really carry in your pocket now,

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.650
so it stays on the desk. He's really trying to outdo everybody else's.

6
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.240
That's coined David Goggins

7
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.190
the uncommon amongst uncommon men. Even with your fucking coins,

8
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.620
Jesus let go. It's not going to be that big. I'm still working on it.

9
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.680
Are you going to get a coin for real? We are. Yeah.

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.320
We're way behind the power curve on this. We need one. It's all about, you know,

11
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.900
you gotta get the right symbology in there. You got the right amount of Texas,

12
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.600
the right amount of seal, the right amount of Congress.

13
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.520
You get a pack that in into the right symbology. So test different ingredients.

14
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.000
Try it over and over again. Yeah, till you get the bacon, right, basically.

15
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.270
Yeah. Well thanks for being here man. I appreciate it. I'm glad to be here.

16
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.210
This is pretty cool. You a Rose to prominence through a joke.

17
00:00:58.211 --> 00:01:03.190
Isn't that strange? [inaudible] form of a joke. Yeah. Saturday night live. Yeah.

18
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.130
That was a weird moment. And I was like, Whoa. It was,

19
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.720
you handled it really well though. Well thank you. Um, when that happened,

20
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.890
it was a Saturday night, obviously Saturday night live. And uh,

21
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.990
we heard about it the next morning. I got a lot of texts and everybody's like,

22
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.050
Oh, Hey man, you made it. It's been a bunch of seals too.

23
00:01:23.051 --> 00:01:27.190
So the seal community is not prone to, you know,

24
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.710
this righteous indignation kind of reaction there. They're more likely there.

25
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.850
They were more likely in private to just double down and make fun of me more.

26
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.200
Right. Which I love about them. Um, but here's what they would say,

27
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.770
only were allowed to make fun of you and not, not this guy. Um,

28
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.180
so that's how we found out about it. We watched it and we were,

29
00:01:46.181 --> 00:01:49.600
we were right in the middle of the campaign.

30
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.290
The election was about two days away. So you're,

31
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.530
you're struggling just to do all your last minute things to get the vote out.

32
00:01:56.531 --> 00:01:58.150
And so this was, it was,

33
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.380
it did not Dawn upon me how big of a deal this was going to be at the time.

34
00:02:02.381 --> 00:02:05.860
It felt more like an annoyance. It felt more like, okay, I've got to,

35
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.910
I've got to come up with a statement. I'm seeing people really upset about this,

36
00:02:09.911 --> 00:02:13.660
but I'm not going to lie to them and tell them that I'm emotionally upset.

37
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.190
Like I'm emotionally triggered by this.

38
00:02:15.191 --> 00:02:18.370
That would be a false reaction on my part. Um,

39
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.330
so we crafted, I think the, the right statement,

40
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.910
which was listed like it's offensive.

41
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.580
It doesn't mean I'm offended and you don't have to be,

42
00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:31.960
if you don't have to choose to be offended here. And as just a general rule,

43
00:02:31.961 --> 00:02:35.200
we should try hard not to offend people and try or not to be offended. Okay.

44
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.160
There, that's it. And I'm going to demand some apology, uh, and, and,

45
00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:41.650
and kind of stand on my high horse and play this,

46
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.670
played this aggrieved victim role, which is,

47
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.500
which is the expected role to play these days. We don't want to do that. Well,

48
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.320
good for you. Good for you for not doing so refreshing. Yeah.

49
00:02:53.321 --> 00:02:57.020
But the joke was kind of funny. I mean, I have to admit and said, he's like,

50
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.220
you look like a bad guy on a porno film. That not the offensive part.

51
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.410
<v 1>What was the offensive part? Yeah,</v>

52
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.350
that part was funny that it drew a lot of questions.

53
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:06.880
He called me a Hitman in a porno.

54
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.090
And so the obvious question is what kind of porno is this? I mean, that, right.

55
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.230
That's the [inaudible] that's the,

56
00:03:13.231 --> 00:03:16.660
that's the next thing that goes through your head has a hit man. Right, right.

57
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:19.060
And like what's the role of that? I mean there's just,

58
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.670
your mind goes to all sorts of directions that that part wasn't defensive part

59
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.650
was he lost his eye in the war or whatever. That's what set people off.

60
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.490
That's what set people, yeah. Yeah. And you know,

61
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:34.660
after having gone on the show and seeing how they do things and how carefully

62
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:37.980
scripted it actually is, it's, it's, it's,

63
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.200
it's unclear to me and it always will be and nobody will ever come out with the

64
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:45.490
actual truth on this, on, on how that mistake got made. I think.

65
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.520
I think probably, uh, Pete, Dave,

66
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:50.840
if I'm just giving him total benefit of the doubt and,

67
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.770
and also have after having met him and, and just, you know,

68
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.040
having a general rule that we should try to give some people some space and

69
00:03:57.041 --> 00:04:01.870
assume that they're not the evil people that we might assume they are. Um,

70
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.580
he probably just kind of looked at the line and didn't feel like finishing it

71
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.730
and just set out whatever and it just in, in that,

72
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.180
but that caught in that and that created this, you know,

73
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.800
what would actually was a pretty offensive comment. Um, but uh, you know,

74
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:19.990
did he mean it? Well, we'll never really know.

75
00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:23.860
Now I'll back up and say the whole premise of that joke was ill intentioned.

76
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.550
I mean they said as much, right? They, they said, look at these gross people.

77
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.580
We don't like them and just to appear somewhat fair.

78
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.150
We'll make fun of one Democrat. I mean they did. They did say that. So they,

79
00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:34.850
you know, they're there.

80
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.160
This was the thrust of the entire skit was obviously not willing tension,

81
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:42.840
but I'm not sure he meant to be as deeply insulting as it. Yeah.

82
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.340
You got to say the same thing. You're an American hero,

83
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.580
but you look like a Hitman and a porno film. Yeah, it have been funny. Yeah,

84
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.980
and it would've been okay. Yeah, it's the whatever. It's that part,

85
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.680
but he's no Joe Rogan. He was just trying to be funny man. That's all it was.

86
00:04:56.681 --> 00:05:00.220
You know, people look so deeply into why comics do things,

87
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.970
but the majority of the reason why they say offensive shit is because they think

88
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:06.670
it's gonna work. That's why they find a thing.

89
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.290
It's not like they Harbor some deep resentment or anger towards any protected

90
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.150
class or anything like that.

91
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.190
This is like what people who are non comics look into it guarantee 100% like

92
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:20.800
this is going to work. That's all it is. This is going to get a laugh.

93
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.540
That's all it is. 100%.

94
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.330
And then there's other things you talk about that are important to you that

95
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.450
you're trying to figure out how to make funny. But for the most part,

96
00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:31.120
especially on something like Saturday night live where they're all kind of

97
00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:35.540
competing to be funny together. I mean that's a very weird show. It is.

98
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.300
And it was cool being behind the scenes and watching how it all takes place. Um,

99
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.900
you know, they, they come up with these wacky ideas. They, they test them out,

100
00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:47.950
the writers go try it out. They, they see how it goes. They change some things.

101
00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:49.090
They'll do it in front of an audience.

102
00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:52.650
They'll see how the audience reacts and they'll go with that. Um, it's,

103
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.100
it was fun. It was fun to be a part of, it was fun to actually get,

104
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.980
have my input on. What was great

105
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.120
<v 2>about it though is that you came back after that and he apologized to you and</v>

106
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:05.420
you accepted graciously. But it also got, I mean,

107
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:09.290
it was great for you because it got people to know who you are and then I

108
00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:11.140
started paying attention to you after that.

109
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.230
I started watching some interviews and it some speeches and different things and

110
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.860
I've found you to be a very reasonable right wing guy,

111
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:22.670
which I think we need way more of in this world. You know, it's like,

112
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.240
and this polarization of left versus right. It's just seems,

113
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:31.450
it's so toxic right now that when you can find people that are reasonable and

114
00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:36.521
intelligent and think along logical lines that you could easily follow and go,

115
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:38.750
Oh, okay, maybe I agree or disagree with this guy,

116
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.190
but I see where he's coming from.

117
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.830
Yet what you're getting at is a problem in politics is as politicians and

118
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:46.880
political leaders, I think, fuck,

119
00:06:46.881 --> 00:06:51.380
I forgot to explain why we believe what we believe. And that's pretty important.

120
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.843
Um, you know, we'll,

121
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.020
I think too often talking points are relied upon and it's not that those talking

122
00:06:57.021 --> 00:06:58.730
points are false necessarily,

123
00:06:58.731 --> 00:07:03.560
but they're not persuasive because you haven't gone a couple layers deep.

124
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.490
Again, I think you talk about this a lot. Why are podcasts so popular?

125
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.800
They're popular because people want to hear a little bit more information.

126
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.800
They want to get a deeper understanding of why you think, what you think.

127
00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:16.640
People are ready to hear that they're ready for some nuance. Um,

128
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.350
that being said, being in politics, you wouldn't think,

129
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.460
you wouldn't think that we're getting any closer to nuanced conversations and

130
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.870
political conversations on podcasts or opening up a whole new door where you

131
00:07:29.871 --> 00:07:34.400
understand people like Tulsi Gabbert or Andrew Yang or Bernie Sanders,

132
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.560
or the people that have had a, I've had on this podcast,

133
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.040
one of the things that I've talked to people about this and I didn't know that

134
00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:41.420
Bernie was like a normal person.

135
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:46.250
You hear him talk and you know it's always in these very quick sound bites on

136
00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:50.090
television. Now he's always yelling about wealth or race or something. He goes,

137
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.340
it looks like a mad man. Yeah,

138
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.410
but then you sit down and talk to him for in a long form conversation,

139
00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:57.410
you let him expand on his thoughts. You go, Oh, he's a reasonable guy.

140
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.280
He just has this, these are his principles. His,

141
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:04.310
those are his ideas and he's not a cartoon. Yeah. I mean, on a personal level,

142
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.670
most people in Congress are not exactly who you think they are.

143
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.250
They are just people. They make jokes and we, of course, we,

144
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:15.830
we make small talk in the elevator, you know, these, these things happen. Um,

145
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.440
Bernie in particular I've used in the Senate side.

146
00:08:18.441 --> 00:08:21.130
I don't really interact with him at all. Uh, Tulsa Gabbert I do.

147
00:08:21.131 --> 00:08:24.170
You mentioned her. Um, you know, we, we, we do, we,

148
00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:27.050
we do have good conversations, uh, that, that does happen.

149
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.430
We disagree vigorously on, on lots of things. What do you guys disagree on? Uh,

150
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:36.350
Tulsa in particular? Sure. Uh, well, most things I would say, uh,

151
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.800
one thing she's quite outspoken about is, um,

152
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:44.780
is our involvement overseas. Uh, she's, she would generally say she's,

153
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.910
she's much more of an isolationist than I am.

154
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.450
What I remind people when we're talking about that particular subject, why,

155
00:08:50.451 --> 00:08:53.810
why do we keep troops in Syria? Why do we keep troops in Iraq?

156
00:08:53.811 --> 00:08:56.310
Why do we keep troops in Afghanistan? Isn't the war over?

157
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.430
<v 0>Um, why don't we bring the boys back home? And the,</v>

158
00:09:00.431 --> 00:09:02.580
the answer is this is not a conventional war.

159
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.600
This is not something where you sign a peace treaty with a uniformed, uh, army.

160
00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:10.470
It is, it is a different, it's a different situation.

161
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:12.720
We send guys like me over there so that they don't come here.

162
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.650
We send guys like me over there so that we keep pressure on them and prevent

163
00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:19.710
them for him in the operational space and timing to commit another nine 11.

164
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.100
You have to understand that these people over there wake up every single day

165
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.960
trying to plan another nine 11 is, it is, it is what they do. And uh,

166
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:32.020
we've already seen an increase in ISIS activity just from the drawdown that we

167
00:09:32.021 --> 00:09:34.530
already did have in Syria. So, you know, that's a,

168
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.390
that's a fair disagreement again, but she's a really cool person and I want to,

169
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.500
I brought up Tulsi just specifically because we do talk and, and I, and I,

170
00:09:42.501 --> 00:09:45.840
and I, and I just like her as a person. We just disagree on things.

171
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.270
But there's a respect there to play devil's advocate.

172
00:09:48.271 --> 00:09:52.500
Some would say that the reason why they want to plat plot and other nine 11 is

173
00:09:52.501 --> 00:09:55.470
because we're over there. Yeah, I disagree with that. So let's,

174
00:09:55.471 --> 00:09:58.050
let's look at the [inaudible] in London. Um, example.

175
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.410
What exactly did we do to this guy? You know, we helped him, right? Yeah,

176
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:06.540
exactly. So in the nice Soviets with the Mujahideen exactly in the, he,

177
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:09.930
he was a majority and fighter. We helped them fight the Soviets.

178
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.500
We protected Saudi Arabia from invasion from Saddam Hussein.

179
00:10:13.501 --> 00:10:16.800
That's his Homeland. And yet he hated us. And when we left,

180
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.450
we'd never occupied Saudi Arabia.

181
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:22.860
We left when they asked us to leave after we defended them and prevented another

182
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.140
invasion from Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.

183
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.170
What is it we did to make this guy so mad?

184
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:31.110
And the answer is we didn't do anything. Objective. Lee speaking,

185
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.580
he hates us because of our Western ideology. He hates us because he hates us.

186
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.270
And, and it's hard for us to understand because it's not logical,

187
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.630
but it is the truth. And um, it's,

188
00:10:42.631 --> 00:10:47.530
it's so [inaudible] and it's the prime example of why we this, this,

189
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:52.200
this is a longterm fight. And it's, um, it's not likely to go away anytime soon.

190
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.620
And at the last thing I would say the world is a very small place. We can,

191
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:59.760
when we pretend that we had to ignore things going on in the middle East,

192
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.710
we can pretend that they won't come here.

193
00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:04.750
But the reality is that's a 12 hour flight and,

194
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.220
and the speed of information travels even faster. You know,

195
00:11:08.221 --> 00:11:11.370
when we were seeing a lot of attacks in the U S and in Europe when ISIS was at

196
00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:14.640
its peak as its at its peak strength,

197
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.260
that was because they were able to radicalize online notice that they've stopped

198
00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:22.320
having that power and it's because we actually took the fight to them.

199
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.260
We'll there,

200
00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:29.260
there's certainly are some conflicts between their ideology and Western

201
00:11:29.911 --> 00:11:32.460
ideology, but why on Western values,

202
00:11:32.461 --> 00:11:36.060
but why is it that they're dedicating their entire life to try and take down

203
00:11:36.061 --> 00:11:40.050
America? Well, they, I mean there's, this is always the question.

204
00:11:40.051 --> 00:11:42.140
It is a question that it's, it's, you know,

205
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:44.730
you would almost have to ask them exactly why. Right.

206
00:11:44.731 --> 00:11:49.130
But I mean at its core we are infidels at at its core there is, they are there,

207
00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.350
they are taking an extreme view of Islamic fundamentalism and believing that we

208
00:11:53.351 --> 00:11:54.160
are infidels that must

209
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.160
<v 1>be destroyed. I mean that's at its core, uh, there,</v>

210
00:11:57.161 --> 00:12:00.520
there it's a less political reasons and a little bit more emotional reasoning.

211
00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:02.110
There has to be some,

212
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.380
some part of it because of our policies and some part of it because of our

213
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:06.660
actions. And I don't know,

214
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.370
I'm not so sure that we should always assume that it's our fault.

215
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.230
And I think that's a common, that's a common theme, uh,

216
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.520
in politics these days where anything bad happening must be America's fault.

217
00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:20.380
It must be decisions we made. I mean, maybe,

218
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.650
but let's objectively make the case if that, if that's, if that's true.

219
00:12:23.651 --> 00:12:26.620
I think there's an automatic assumption and I, it's not self evident to me,

220
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.271
but if we're in,

221
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:31.630
what are we in a hundred and how many countries do we have basis and what's the

222
00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:35.380
number? Do you know? That's a lot. It might, it's definitely over a hundred.

223
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:36.070
Yeah.

224
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:40.630
And if you were one of the people that is in one of those countries and you had

225
00:12:40.631 --> 00:12:43.990
to deal with that and you saw like the drone attacks in Yemen that have killed

226
00:12:43.991 --> 00:12:48.991
people and wedding parties and the kind of shit that we hope never happens again

227
00:12:49.691 --> 00:12:51.040
but has happened in the past,

228
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:55.420
you can kind of understand why there would be a hatred against the number one

229
00:12:55.421 --> 00:12:58.660
superpower in the world. Will opinions in these countries are not,

230
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:03.850
are not homogenous, right? They're there, they're vastly diverse.

231
00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:04.400
There's a,

232
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.910
there's millions of people in Yemen probably begging for us to come there.

233
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.900
Same with Iraq. Iraqis did not want us leaving. They knew this would go badly.

234
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:15.420
But again, not all Iraqi's. Right. So the ones who understood, right?

235
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.850
I mean it just depends on who you talk to a, so again, it's, it's,

236
00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:23.851
it's everything is more complex than a simple than a simple black and white

237
00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:25.840
scenario where America's bad or good. It's just,

238
00:13:25.841 --> 00:13:27.130
it's always more complex than that.

239
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.680
So you feel like if we did pull out of all these countries,

240
00:13:29.681 --> 00:13:31.210
particularly pull out of the middle East,

241
00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:34.000
Afghanistan and all the basis that we have over there,

242
00:13:34.001 --> 00:13:37.990
that it would be a very similar to like what's going on in Iraq,

243
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.540
what happened in Libya? There's a power vacuum.

244
00:13:40.541 --> 00:13:45.130
The vacuum gets filled by bad guys. It'll a hundred percent happen that way. Um,

245
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.260
you know, and it's, I, there's not a doubt in my mind,

246
00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:49.630
there's no doubt in any experts minds who's looking at this.

247
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.350
I would also say when we're, we have a base somewhere that is, that is at the,

248
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:57.730
that is, that is at the discretion of, of that, uh, local government.

249
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.230
There's, there's no cases here except in the case of Syria, uh, where, you know,

250
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.820
their local government, Bashar Al Assad doesn't want us there.

251
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:10.660
That's the only case I, that I can think of and that,

252
00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.400
that we don't have an agreement,

253
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.180
a status of forces agreement with the government there. So I don't,

254
00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.180
I don't think it's quite right to paint it as some kind of imperialistic

255
00:14:19.181 --> 00:14:21.760
occupation. That's just, that's just not how we, how we do things.

256
00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:25.150
And you're right over there. Yeah.

257
00:14:25.151 --> 00:14:28.630
I'm just making sure this side sound is all good for you before anything

258
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.540
actually did happen. Now, um,

259
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.990
do you think this is a,

260
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.590
a political ploy that this is a popular thing to say because so many people that

261
00:14:38.591 --> 00:14:42.340
have, uh, you know, a cursory understanding of foreign policy,

262
00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:45.880
they look at our military bases overseas and they say, Hey,

263
00:14:45.881 --> 00:14:47.950
let's bring those people back. Let's end these Wars.

264
00:14:47.951 --> 00:14:52.520
Let's stop spending this money. But you're not the only one that's told me this.

265
00:14:52.521 --> 00:14:54.980
And particularly not the only one that's told me this that's has a military

266
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:55.814
background.

267
00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:00.170
I'm saying it's virtually impossible to prevent any of this stuff without having

268
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.490
basis over there. That's 100% right. Yeah. I mean you, you need,

269
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.280
you need that relationship with the host nation of course,

270
00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:09.170
that you want to partner with. And that's generally what we do,

271
00:15:09.171 --> 00:15:10.850
especially in the special operations community.

272
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.810
When we're in a hundred plus countries, we're there to partner with them.

273
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.550
We're not there doing our own thing.

274
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:20.120
We're there partnering and training and equipping and enhancing their

275
00:15:20.121 --> 00:15:22.790
capabilities so that that's part of what we're doing.

276
00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:26.410
And the other part is just knowledge. We want to know what's happening.

277
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.850
We don't know what's happening. Why do, why do we have embassies everywhere?

278
00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:32.540
Part of that is just relationships and knowledge and understanding of what's

279
00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:37.150
going on because we can't look at it from afar and actually get it. It's just,

280
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:41.940
it doesn't work that way. So, and, and, and again, I, and I'm not,

281
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.650
I think it is reactionary to just assume that we have bad intentions all the

282
00:15:45.651 --> 00:15:50.000
time and that everything is American's fault. I hear that constantly. Um,

283
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.820
mostly coming from the left, but, but,

284
00:15:51.821 --> 00:15:55.820
but that isolation is sentiment certainly comes from the right as well. And, uh,

285
00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.650
and it's a reaction.

286
00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.800
It's a reaction to the Iraq war and some of the mistakes we made there to

287
00:16:00.801 --> 00:16:02.210
reaction to Vietnam. It's never,

288
00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:06.830
that's never left the American psyche in many ways. But these,

289
00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:11.890
these matters are complex and they deserve complex reasoning and analysis and a

290
00:16:12.201 --> 00:16:13.720
little nuanced understanding. And I,

291
00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.010
they just think that's how we should look at it. We don't, we don't say that.

292
00:16:16.011 --> 00:16:18.890
We're always right. That's, that's not what I'm saying, right.

293
00:16:18.891 --> 00:16:23.510
It's no one gets really educated on it. It's not like there's a cursory,

294
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:28.400
you know, examination of this that's given to the American person.

295
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.600
Like when they sign up to register to vote, it's like you, you don't say, okay,

296
00:16:32.601 --> 00:16:33.590
before you vote,

297
00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.850
let's explain to you what's going on and this is why there's bases here and this

298
00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:39.110
is why we do this. And yeah.

299
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.040
I mean not even as a real simple explanation or these things,

300
00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.130
it's just have to go searching for it.

301
00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:49.910
Or you have to rely on political pundits usually have a bias one way or the

302
00:16:49.911 --> 00:16:53.360
other. It's sending an MSNBC or it's Fox news and it's, you know,

303
00:16:53.361 --> 00:16:56.270
you don't know where the reality is.

304
00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.240
You can apply and you can apply that to not just our foreign policy.

305
00:16:59.241 --> 00:17:01.970
It's every issue. Yes. You know, why are things the way they are?

306
00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:03.920
That's a really good question to ask. Yeah.

307
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.560
When we're trying to find the solutions for the things we don't like.

308
00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.950
The first question we should ask is why are things the way they are?

309
00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.390
And that question really gets manipulated, uh,

310
00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:18.890
again on any issue. And, um, it, it is unfortunate. It, how do we fix that?

311
00:17:18.891 --> 00:17:19.820
I don't know. My,

312
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.870
my message w when like high school kids are asking me how do they get involved

313
00:17:23.871 --> 00:17:27.770
in politics? And what I tell them is it's okay not to know things first of all.

314
00:17:27.771 --> 00:17:31.160
And it's okay not to choose a side just yet, right? Because there's,

315
00:17:31.161 --> 00:17:34.820
there's nothing wrong with your ignorance on the why behind this issue.

316
00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.710
There's nothing wrong with that. You're young,

317
00:17:36.711 --> 00:17:38.120
you don't have the experiences yet. It's fine.

318
00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.840
But there is something wrong with having a very strong opinion on that when you

319
00:17:41.841 --> 00:17:44.480
don't actually understand it. And yes, that's,

320
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:48.260
that's what creates the animosity. That's what creates the divisiveness.

321
00:17:48.261 --> 00:17:50.880
Because once you're emotionally attached to an opinion, it's,

322
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.980
it's not easy to remove yourself from that. Uh,

323
00:17:55.220 --> 00:18:00.120
that takes a massive amount of, of, I think, humility. Um,

324
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.300
and which is, it was an attribute we all aspire to but maybe don't have.

325
00:18:03.301 --> 00:18:04.670
Exactly. Uh,

326
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.910
and it's hard and so it's okay not to know and to ask questions and to just

327
00:18:08.911 --> 00:18:12.420
wonder and to think may, maybe what I'm hearing isn't exactly the whole truth.

328
00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:16.680
Maybe I'll look into it before I start posting on social media about how awful

329
00:18:16.681 --> 00:18:20.040
that situation is or whatever. People love to know, you know,

330
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.250
even if they don't, they love,

331
00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.290
they love to be the person that has the information. And

332
00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:25.190
<v 3>one of the things that social media has done,</v>

333
00:18:25.191 --> 00:18:29.540
this is allowed this sort of text-based debate format where people can shut

334
00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:33.410
people down wrong and say this, the problem with that is this and this,

335
00:18:33.411 --> 00:18:37.430
and everybody wants to be correct about things because they're married to these

336
00:18:37.431 --> 00:18:40.410
ideas. If these ideas succeed, they succeed. If they,

337
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.390
they get a zinger off on someone and some sort of online political debate,

338
00:18:44.391 --> 00:18:48.510
they walk around with like a fucking, like a peacock strut and they won.

339
00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:50.540
They got one in. And for many people,

340
00:18:50.541 --> 00:18:53.450
this is like the only form of competition that they participate in,

341
00:18:53.451 --> 00:18:55.490
which I think is a real problem in our culture.

342
00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:00.470
Human beings desire competition. It, especially men,

343
00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.460
it is a giant. And when they shy away from it, they usually become secretly,

344
00:19:04.461 --> 00:19:06.770
quietly angry. And they, they,

345
00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:11.720
they Harbor Harbor resentment and bitterness and they never understand the

346
00:19:11.721 --> 00:19:14.000
feeling of losing and getting better.

347
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:19.150
The feeling of failing and improving the feeling of not knowing something and

348
00:19:20.091 --> 00:19:22.430
then learning something like these, these things are critical.

349
00:19:22.431 --> 00:19:24.500
And to pretend that you know something when you don't,

350
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:26.780
it's a terrible way to go about your life.

351
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.500
<v 1>Yeah, I mean that's a very good point. And the competitive aspects of things,</v>

352
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:33.210
uh, you obviously compete a lot.

353
00:19:33.211 --> 00:19:36.750
I've competed a lot in my life and I can't imagine a world where that didn't

354
00:19:36.751 --> 00:19:37.584
happen.

355
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:41.970
And I can't imagine a world where I didn't have to suffer as a kid through some

356
00:19:41.971 --> 00:19:45.600
losses and my soccer game. And then when my parents didn't say, well,

357
00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:50.010
you deserve to win. They said, well, you lost. So, so that's what happens.

358
00:19:50.011 --> 00:19:54.810
And guess what? Welcome to life. We still love you, but you fucking lost.

359
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:57.330
That's life. That's real. Should have trained harder.

360
00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:00.870
It's the idea that they're doing that with these little kids. Man.

361
00:20:00.871 --> 00:20:03.900
When my daughter was three, she had a soccer game where there was no winners,

362
00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.270
no losers. Like, ah, the other team, fucking one.

363
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:10.040
I watched until the ball went in the goal. Everybody was cheering. Like,

364
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:13.950
what are we doing? We don't know what I keep in score. Yes. This is bananas.

365
00:20:13.951 --> 00:20:18.020
You're gonna, you know, it's soft times than this.

366
00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:21.900
This is what we're living in. So off times create soft people. Yeah,

367
00:20:21.901 --> 00:20:25.680
that's right. Um, and we talked about this before. Yeah. Before the show.

368
00:20:25.681 --> 00:20:29.100
I'm writing a whole book on this actually. Uh, and, uh,

369
00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:33.010
it's about outrage culture. It's about becoming too soft and, and, but I,

370
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:37.020
but I try to make it a, you know, a, a productive conversation.

371
00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:42.080
Each chapter will be lessons derived from my own experiences and derived from

372
00:20:42.991 --> 00:20:47.850
psychology, uh, derived from ancient truths. Actually a, the, you know,

373
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.520
nothing

374
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:52.540
<v 0>I will say in this book is going to be new. But that's kind of the point.</v>

375
00:20:52.541 --> 00:20:53.650
And that's how you know it's good.

376
00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:56.490
<v 3>Yeah. We need to hear those things over and over again. You know,</v>

377
00:20:56.491 --> 00:20:57.540
sometimes you forget them.

378
00:20:57.541 --> 00:20:59.820
Sometimes they just need to be cemented in your psyche.

379
00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:03.760
And competition doesn't mean being mean. It doesn't mean people there.

380
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:08.770
They're associating it and equating it with either violence or aggression or a

381
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:12.930
toxic masculinity.

382
00:21:12.931 --> 00:21:16.620
There's all these words it kept throwing around for people feeling bad because

383
00:21:16.621 --> 00:21:17.454
they lost.

384
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.660
But that feeling of feeling bad because you lost and thing is extremely valuable

385
00:21:21.661 --> 00:21:22.494
in your life.

386
00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.440
And I don't want to say it hardens you because it doesn't hard you emotionally,

387
00:21:25.441 --> 00:21:28.590
you still are the same amount of emotional availability,

388
00:21:28.591 --> 00:21:32.370
but you get if you're accustomed to it, and I always tell people,

389
00:21:32.371 --> 00:21:34.590
young men get involved in martial arts,

390
00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:38.220
especially jujitsu because you can do it and you're not going to get brain

391
00:21:38.221 --> 00:21:40.090
damage. You get strangled a bunch,

392
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.170
you get your ass kicked all the time and it teaches you humiliating.

393
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:47.010
It teaches you humility and then you learn after that that you can get better.

394
00:21:47.011 --> 00:21:50.920
And then eventually you become the hammer instead of being the nail. And that's,

395
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:54.240
that's something you can actually apply to your real life.

396
00:21:54.241 --> 00:21:59.241
You can understand that these lessons of failure and humility and humiliation

397
00:21:59.701 --> 00:22:03.870
and just getting pummeled, like all that stuff pays off. Ultimately,

398
00:22:03.871 --> 00:22:07.830
if you just keep showing up, and that's analogous to life in life.

399
00:22:07.831 --> 00:22:10.590
If you can just keep showing up and keep working hard,

400
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.280
you're going to have setbacks. You can,

401
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:15.840
but don't let them define you and you can move forward. But if you don't,

402
00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.500
if you just liked the world's toxic and we need to Nerf everything and you know,

403
00:22:19.501 --> 00:22:21.180
everyone needs a safe space while we're,

404
00:22:21.181 --> 00:22:26.181
we're just gonna make a whole Island full of pussies and we're in danger of

405
00:22:26.311 --> 00:22:27.144
doing that.

406
00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:27.711
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

407
00:22:27.711 --> 00:22:30.620
we're definitely in danger of doing it if it hasn't already happened in many

408
00:22:30.621 --> 00:22:33.170
ways. And like what you're saying is intuitively true,

409
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.520
that hardship creates a stronger mind, right lesson. But it's,

410
00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:40.790
it's not just intuitively true. This is, this is in data. This is in,

411
00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:45.740
this isn't science as well. Um, and in a lot of psychological research,

412
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:48.770
you know, this is, uh, and, and we know it to be true.

413
00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:50.320
What if the reason I like, actually I love the,

414
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:53.900
the subject of psychology because it kind of tells us things that we already

415
00:22:53.901 --> 00:22:57.500
Intuit to be true. And, uh, and it just makes sense. And,

416
00:22:57.501 --> 00:22:59.630
and this is certainly one of those and there's a lot of studies that show that

417
00:22:59.631 --> 00:23:03.470
people who have suffered deep trauma, um, uh,

418
00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.920
ended up better for it as long as they're telling themselves the right stories.

419
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:08.900
And so this, I go into this a lot, my book too,

420
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:12.200
you have to tell yourself the right story about that trauma. Uh,

421
00:23:12.201 --> 00:23:14.750
you have to tell yourself that you are resilient and that you,

422
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:17.480
and that you are empowered to overcome it.

423
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:19.970
That's a very important narrative that you have to tell yourself.

424
00:23:19.971 --> 00:23:22.340
If you tell yourself it just happened to you and it's not fair and everybody's

425
00:23:22.341 --> 00:23:23.310
out to get you right.

426
00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.760
I wouldn't wish that psychological state on my worst enemies, I agree.

427
00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:30.500
Well maybe my worst enemy, but, but that's the point, right?

428
00:23:30.501 --> 00:23:34.010
Like you would never wish that upon somebody you like. Uh, and that's,

429
00:23:34.011 --> 00:23:35.750
and that's, that's, that's an important truth.

430
00:23:35.751 --> 00:23:36.710
I think we have to tell ourselves,

431
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:38.130
<v 3>when you were in the military,</v>

432
00:23:38.131 --> 00:23:41.820
is this something that they taught you or is it something that you learned?

433
00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:46.340
<v 0>True example? Uh, yeah, I think through experience.</v>

434
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:47.630
So you know, the,

435
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:53.000
the reason buds so buds is basic underwater demolition slash seal training.

436
00:23:53.001 --> 00:23:56.630
It is, it is our six month trial by fire, um,

437
00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.690
selection process that we go to become a sales. The very first thing you do.

438
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:02.980
And uh, it's where you see all the infamous footage,

439
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:06.080
GI Jane and hell week and all that stuff. That's all.

440
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:10.970
It's all first phase in buds. And so I like how you brought up channel chain.

441
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.090
Yeah. Well, yeah, it is that, that yeah,

442
00:24:14.091 --> 00:24:16.130
it's probably the wrong example in hindsight.

443
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
All the Navy [inaudible] cause I can't think of any other movies that show buds.

444
00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.920
Um, now that you bring it up, I actually lone survivor,

445
00:24:24.921 --> 00:24:28.760
the very first interview I think has some buttons anyway, find it on YouTube.

446
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.300
Uh, you know, most people know what I'm talking about, but uh,

447
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:33.890
his GI Jane is not a realistic movie.

448
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:38.120
It's one of the least realistic movies and every single aspect about the seal

449
00:24:38.121 --> 00:24:41.870
teams. But the point is, is, is that there is a,

450
00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.040
there's not just a hardening of the mind that occurs from hell week.

451
00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:46.510
It's like a, it's a, it's an,

452
00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.730
it's an increase in confidence in a pretty excessive way. Like,

453
00:24:49.731 --> 00:24:54.410
if I can push my limits this far, imagine what else I can do. And, uh, in that,

454
00:24:54.411 --> 00:24:56.600
and then you, and you continue to push those limits. I mean,

455
00:24:56.601 --> 00:25:01.010
just even after hell week you do it, uh, when you're kind of what we would,

456
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:04.850
what I would describe as controlled drowning. And, uh, in second phase where we,

457
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.630
where we learned to be super calm under water, under the worst conditions,

458
00:25:08.631 --> 00:25:11.750
meaning you can't breathe and you're about to pass out, uh,

459
00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:14.990
and you're still going to go through procedures in a very specific way.

460
00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:18.330
You have to learn that, that, that calming and then you,

461
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.780
and you've pushed another limit and you've pushed another limit.

462
00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:24.410
So bet that by the time we do get to combat, uh,

463
00:25:24.411 --> 00:25:29.060
we have already suffered so badly in training that the combat doesn't feel all

464
00:25:29.061 --> 00:25:30.770
that bad and,

465
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.630
and we're ready to get your eye blown out of your head like I did. Uh,

466
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:40.010
you're ready for that. You understand it and it's, it's not surprising.

467
00:25:40.011 --> 00:25:44.350
You don't react as, you know, in an emotional way when it does happen, uh,

468
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:46.210
because you've allowed yourself to be hard.

469
00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:48.380
And then you've told yourself the right story about that.

470
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:52.490
What is the traumatic experience of it and how we can be really is,

471
00:25:52.491 --> 00:25:54.680
I broke my leg the first time through. I had to do it again.

472
00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.930
So was a just a stress fracture that turned into a fracture and it just snapped

473
00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.190
at us while we were running with the boats on our head.

474
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:04.040
So we run with these two or 300 pound boats in our heads.

475
00:26:04.041 --> 00:26:08.330
They're basically kind of boats you use and um, river rafting and,

476
00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.070
but we run everywhere with them. Um,

477
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:14.660
some estimates maybe up to 200 miles and just how weak alone. So, uh,

478
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:17.840
it's, it's one of the reasons the older, older guys, you know,

479
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:21.740
maybe 25 and older have a lot of heart, a hard time getting a hold of those 25.

480
00:26:21.741 --> 00:26:25.970
That's hilarious. Yeah. Because your, your body just breaks, you know,

481
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:29.780
early twenties are probably the prime time your muscles are developed about that

482
00:26:29.781 --> 00:26:32.610
time. Uh, your bone structure can still handle the,

483
00:26:32.611 --> 00:26:36.320
the just immense amount of punishment that it's taking. And uh, you know,

484
00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:37.780
except for mine we call it, we know,

485
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:39.230
and then we'd make fun of each other and say, Oh,

486
00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:44.010
nice weak jeans you have there. That's why you broke. So your broke in.

487
00:26:44.011 --> 00:26:47.060
How much time did you need before you went back to do it again? Uh, six months.

488
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:51.900
So I was enrolled three classes, which, uh, which bone? A left tibia. Oh, okay.

489
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:56.820
Yeah. That's a big one. Yeah. Yeah, it hurt. Um, you know, it's,

490
00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.760
that's a dangerous one to break too, that not a lot of blood flow there. Yeah.

491
00:26:59.761 --> 00:27:02.550
It's amazing that you got back in there six months later. A lot of times,

492
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:05.220
I know guy broke his leg and, uh, he was,

493
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:09.810
he was fucked up for a good solid a couple of years. Yeah. And, um,

494
00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.400
and it was a risk because we weren't sure. I, I the,

495
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:15.600
the frankly the command was getting impatient. They're like,

496
00:27:15.601 --> 00:27:19.740
we're not going to let you heal anymore. Six months is it? So go for it. Um,

497
00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:24.510
and uh, you know, it's, you know, it's not like a compound fracture either.

498
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:29.100
This is a crack in the bone. So maybe in any case it worked out just fine.

499
00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:32.760
But, uh, it's a risky thing because I knew it broke. Right. I mean,

500
00:27:32.761 --> 00:27:35.670
I felt that I rounded a corner and my adrenaline kinda took me through the rest

501
00:27:35.671 --> 00:27:39.950
of that run. Then we sit down for lunch and I couldn't get back up from,

502
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.720
from that seat. Like it was, it was the adrenaline worn off.

503
00:27:42.721 --> 00:27:45.750
There was something bad, badly wrong there. And, uh,

504
00:27:45.751 --> 00:27:48.510
there's always this question that the instructors will ask, are you hurt?

505
00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.640
Are you injured? Because there's a difference.

506
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.870
And if you're just hurt because everybody hears hurt. If you're just hurt,

507
00:27:54.871 --> 00:27:57.240
then you're just quitting. Right. If you're injured, okay,

508
00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:59.280
we might give you another chance. Isn't that interesting?

509
00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:01.320
That's for the average person.

510
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:05.950
That's such an alien thought alien question. Are you hurt or are you yeah,

511
00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.920
it is. But there's a difference in there is a difference. Yeah. Now, um,

512
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:16.160
do they have any courses where they explained to you how your mind works and how

513
00:28:16.981 --> 00:28:21.420
to overcome questions and doubts that creep in your head or they just,

514
00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:24.630
they're teaching you through fire. Right.

515
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.170
And we wouldn't want those courses, frankly. Um,

516
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.240
so when you see all those like online people,

517
00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:34.560
what you gotta do is you gotta face your fears and understand who you are and it

518
00:28:34.561 --> 00:28:38.180
say it's going to be okay. [inaudible] does that, does that drive you crazy? No,

519
00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:41.040
it didn't drive me crazy. I don't mind that somebody's trying to do that.

520
00:28:41.041 --> 00:28:45.540
I say that we wouldn't do it because, uh, the point is,

521
00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:48.000
the point is that you're already that person.

522
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:51.870
You're a seal before you got there. Okay. We're just,

523
00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:55.860
we're just making you prove it because you are already that guy. Okay.

524
00:28:55.861 --> 00:28:58.680
Because you never had a choice and a is another chapter in my book,

525
00:28:58.681 --> 00:29:02.040
I call it no plan B. You go through this with no plan B.

526
00:29:02.041 --> 00:29:05.760
If you ever thought for a second that maybe I can make it through buds,

527
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:07.650
like maybe I'll make it through hell week. I hope I do.

528
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.160
You're not gonna make it right. There's a choice there. You're, you're, you're,

529
00:29:11.161 --> 00:29:13.110
you're telling yourself that you actually have a choice.

530
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.020
I think that's with everything. Yeah, it is with everything. Cause I get it.

531
00:29:16.021 --> 00:29:20.670
This is plan. It's an extreme example, but it's certainly applies to everything.

532
00:29:20.671 --> 00:29:23.370
If you replied to my run for Congress,

533
00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:28.450
like if I didn't plan anything after the primary on March six they just did it.

534
00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:31.440
Now you could argue that that was probably not a great idea.

535
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:34.920
Maybe you should've had some kind of backup plan what worked, but, but,

536
00:29:34.921 --> 00:29:37.860
but mentally it was more of a mental state than it was like a don't have a

537
00:29:37.861 --> 00:29:40.350
backup plan. I'm not saying don't have contingencies in your life.

538
00:29:40.351 --> 00:29:42.040
I'm just saying an only,

539
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.470
<v 2>you know when you've actually decided to quit. Right.</v>

540
00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:45.580
Cause it's one thing to be like,

541
00:29:45.581 --> 00:29:49.240
I have tried to be an artist for so long and I'm just not good at it.

542
00:29:49.241 --> 00:29:49.931
And then you quit. Well,

543
00:29:49.931 --> 00:29:53.860
is it really quitting or is it just facing reality that you're just not good at

544
00:29:53.861 --> 00:29:55.840
being an artist? You know that. So it's, it's different.

545
00:29:55.841 --> 00:29:59.050
You have to distinguish between those two things. But you know, you know,

546
00:29:59.051 --> 00:30:02.140
if you quit because you actually quit, you gave up on yourself and that's,

547
00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.970
and um, and, and nobody, nobody can really judge that for you. And I, I just,

548
00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:08.830
I think that's an important lesson and that's how you make it through buds.

549
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:10.820
Cause you never had a choice. Yeah.

550
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:15.020
I don't think there's a way you can get through what I've heard described and

551
00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:19.150
while having a plan B, like I hope I get through this, but if I don't, I've got,

552
00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.250
you know, I'm gonna open this pizza place with my cousin and yeah,

553
00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:24.220
I always talk about it like bandwidth.

554
00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.860
And I would say to people like if you want to really do something,

555
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.060
you only have like, let's call it,

556
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.050
let's like pretend you have a like a certain amount of juice,

557
00:30:32.051 --> 00:30:35.620
like your juice is 100 and when it's fully on, do you have a hundred?

558
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:40.780
Well if you take 30 of it and you put it towards this and another 20 and you put

559
00:30:40.781 --> 00:30:41.321
it towards that,

560
00:30:41.321 --> 00:30:44.980
well guess what you think you're all in but you really only 50% in because

561
00:30:44.981 --> 00:30:48.700
you've got all this, 50% of your juice is on all these different things.

562
00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:52.630
You gotta be 100% involved in what you're trying to do at your best.

563
00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.480
If you're not like for fighting. That's a big one.

564
00:30:55.481 --> 00:30:59.770
When I tell guys there's a lot of guys that I know that are kind of one foot in,

565
00:30:59.771 --> 00:31:01.870
one foot out and I'm like get out, get out.

566
00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:03.400
Cause there's a fucking animal out there.

567
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.760
Cause some Mike Tyson when he was 20 years old and he's going to rearrange your

568
00:31:06.761 --> 00:31:08.530
liver. Don't do it.

569
00:31:08.531 --> 00:31:12.190
Get out now because there's people that are all in and when you're half in,

570
00:31:12.191 --> 00:31:15.610
those people that are all in you become their highlight reel. That's a good,

571
00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:20.410
that's probably good advice. So that's, that's the best advice you see it,

572
00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.410
you see guys that are just starting to think, well maybe one more fine,

573
00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:27.640
like fuck, stop. Just stop now. Yeah, don't do it. That's how you get hurt.

574
00:31:27.641 --> 00:31:29.770
Yeah. It's um, it's a,

575
00:31:29.771 --> 00:31:33.160
it's an interesting thing because of this world where there are so many people

576
00:31:33.161 --> 00:31:35.710
that are teaching lessons that are teaching, you know what you got.

577
00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.490
But then there's real ones like Jocko, you know,

578
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.290
like when a guy like Jocko says something,

579
00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:45.970
everybody listens because he's done it. Like this is real shit. And you know,

580
00:31:45.971 --> 00:31:49.390
you see his watch every morning on his Instagram, four 30 in the morning.

581
00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:53.390
So annoying. He's up. It's very annoying when you wake up. I'm not,

582
00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.110
we're not all morning people, Jocko, he's not either,

583
00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.620
he's not a morning person either. You'd like to sleep in,

584
00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.320
but he gets up and he fucking gets after it.

585
00:32:02.321 --> 00:32:06.190
And that guy is fuel for fucking millions of people in this country because it

586
00:32:06.191 --> 00:32:09.790
was great. His books and his videos and all the time, that video. Good.

587
00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:12.340
You've seen that video? I don't think I've seen a lot of them.

588
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:13.850
I'm not sure which one you're talking about.

589
00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.200
I think about that when I run cause uh,

590
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:20.530
like it's talking about things going wrong. Good. Oh chance to get better.

591
00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.940
You know, everything fell apart. Welcoming the group, welcoming the failure.

592
00:32:24.941 --> 00:32:29.941
And like that's just when I was on his podcast a while back and I hadn't gotten

593
00:32:30.371 --> 00:32:33.490
to his book yet and I was like, Jocko, I'm so sorry. Haven't read your book yet.

594
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.240
He's like, it's fine. It's just, it's, it's one less than you have to know.

595
00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:38.350
Everything is your fault.

596
00:32:38.351 --> 00:32:40.700
It's extreme ownership is like everything we learned in the teams. I'm like,

597
00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.000
okay, yeah, I know that. Cause you taught it to me as you were, you know,

598
00:32:44.001 --> 00:32:47.120
he was, he was the head of trade at when I went through and, um,

599
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:52.400
and he just crushed us like everything, the shore, every, every,

600
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:56.270
uh, every training up was, uh,

601
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:59.720
this is people on this life that are both on the crush things. Yeah.

602
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:03.410
That guy's boy, he's put here to crush things. He, uh, rolled my friend John,

603
00:33:03.411 --> 00:33:08.060
my friend John Dudley, who's a, a professional archery coach and a bow Hunter,

604
00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.590
and he wanted to learn jujitsu.

605
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:13.670
So we started taking some classes and then he rolled with Jocko and Chaco

606
00:33:13.671 --> 00:33:14.990
literally broke his neck.

607
00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:19.140
He broke a bone in his neck and he didn't even mean to broken him.

608
00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:23.420
Broke the other guy's neck. Just to be clear, John's a bone in John's neck.

609
00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:26.810
It's got something in the back of his throat that still tickles him to this day.

610
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:30.020
Or it's, none of this surprises me that Jocko broke somebody's neck.

611
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:35.210
Don't fucking roll with that gorilla. What are you crazy? The guy's five 10.

612
00:33:35.211 --> 00:33:37.790
He weighs 240 pounds. Don't fucking roll with him.

613
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:42.370
He's terrifying pills for jujitsu. Built to snap things off. Yeah.

614
00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:45.830
That's what he's built for. It's exactly right. But people like that,

615
00:33:45.831 --> 00:33:46.760
that you know,

616
00:33:46.761 --> 00:33:51.761
have real lessons because of real success and real failure in life and a real

617
00:33:53.391 --> 00:33:57.140
understanding of what it takes to motivate people, what it takes to be a leader.

618
00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.390
I think those guys are extremely valuable,

619
00:33:59.391 --> 00:34:04.100
but they get watered down by so many people that are out there giving lessons

620
00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:08.840
and like making a career out of being a motivational speaker when you just want

621
00:34:08.841 --> 00:34:11.290
to grab them, go, what the fuck have you done? Right?

622
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:16.070
What have you done other than motivate people and with words that you've just,

623
00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:16.390
you,

624
00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:20.300
you like collecting words out in the field and jumbling them together and you're

625
00:34:20.301 --> 00:34:23.870
like a a word harvester and you're putting them together but they're not really

626
00:34:23.871 --> 00:34:27.350
coming from a real place. Yeah. And then the question is, are they even,

627
00:34:27.410 --> 00:34:30.890
are they successful? And that maybe they are, but you're right.

628
00:34:30.891 --> 00:34:32.300
If you're not backing it up with,

629
00:34:32.301 --> 00:34:37.301
I think real experience and a real story to do to frame the argument that you're

630
00:34:38.301 --> 00:34:38.991
trying to make.

631
00:34:38.991 --> 00:34:41.300
And maybe the arguments the same as the other guy that you're talking about.

632
00:34:41.301 --> 00:34:42.500
It doesn't really have the experience,

633
00:34:42.501 --> 00:34:45.320
but if it's going to be powerful and meaningful to somebody,

634
00:34:45.321 --> 00:34:48.020
I think it does have to come from a place of experience. Well,

635
00:34:48.021 --> 00:34:52.970
it's one of the reasons why I, I really like politicians that have served.

636
00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:56.780
I think it's so critical when you're talking about sending people overseas to

637
00:34:56.781 --> 00:35:00.050
have an honest understanding of what that really means and to have been there.

638
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:01.910
So one of the reasons why I really like Tulsi,

639
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:05.180
and it's one of the reasons why I really like you, I think that is,

640
00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:09.620
it is a giant factor. I mean, I don't want it to be mandatory, but God damn,

641
00:35:09.621 --> 00:35:09.831
when,

642
00:35:09.831 --> 00:35:12.590
when people start talking about going to war and they have no understanding

643
00:35:12.591 --> 00:35:16.370
personally about what that means, it bothers me. Yeah.

644
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:19.770
And it's going to war or not going to war or not going to war. Right.

645
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:21.770
Both opinions. Because again,

646
00:35:21.771 --> 00:35:23.720
with me and tells you really disagree on fundamental,

647
00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:26.930
I think on a deeper level is whether our troops out there are victims or not.

648
00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:29.280
And I, I do, I,

649
00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:33.110
I think there's a common misunderstanding that our troops don't want to be

650
00:35:33.111 --> 00:35:38.010
there, that our troops are being victimized by our bad political decisions. And

651
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:42.240
<v 0>that's to me as one of those people who voluntarily goes out there,</v>

652
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:46.470
which is by the way, everybody cause everybody volunteers to, to do it. Um,

653
00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:50.190
you know, that's, that's a deeply problematic opinion cause it's just not true.

654
00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.850
Uh, you know, the, the truth is, is that we want to be there.

655
00:35:53.851 --> 00:35:58.710
We want to be serving debated her on this and had her clarify her positions. Uh,

656
00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:02.580
no, no. We've, I mean we can, we talk a lot, but uh,

657
00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:07.290
it'd be interesting to have you guys sit down and talk about it. Yeah. Again,

658
00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:10.360
I like Tulsa. So yeah, that'd be one of these days.

659
00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:14.980
<v 3>That's also nice too, that you guys have these differing political philosophies,</v>

660
00:36:14.981 --> 00:36:18.700
but yet you can be friendly with each other because in today's day and age,

661
00:36:18.701 --> 00:36:19.990
I mean, I don't know what the fuck happened.

662
00:36:19.991 --> 00:36:22.090
Somewhere around 2016 when Trump won,

663
00:36:22.091 --> 00:36:25.240
everybody went haywire and now you're either with us or against us.

664
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:28.300
You can't talk to Republicans. And if you do,

665
00:36:28.301 --> 00:36:31.510
you're a bad person and you're a part of the problem and you're probably a white

666
00:36:31.511 --> 00:36:33.160
nationalist. And like it's this,

667
00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:37.360
it's the most divided I can remember ever this country being,

668
00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:40.100
<v 0>yeah, it's insane. Um,</v>

669
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:45.050
now on Capitol Hill it's a little less like, I think behind closed doors,

670
00:36:45.051 --> 00:36:47.180
people do talk to each other quite a bit.

671
00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:50.180
And I think it'd be good if the American people understood that that's actually

672
00:36:50.181 --> 00:36:54.940
what happens. Um, so they, we, we do debate vigorously in public and,

673
00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.710
and some of us don't talk to each other. Just to be clear, it's not, it's not,

674
00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:00.170
not every show, not everybody. Yeah. It wasn't that well,

675
00:37:00.171 --> 00:37:04.340
we kind of do right on Capitol Hill. I mean, between, we kind of do, I mean,

676
00:37:04.341 --> 00:37:08.060
I put so much of what I do everyday out on, on social media. Yes.

677
00:37:08.061 --> 00:37:11.480
And others as other members of Congress do sometimes new thing. Right? Yeah.

678
00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.730
And it's, it's a great way for people to get to know you.

679
00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:16.460
I think there's a lot of value in that. Uh, you know,

680
00:37:16.461 --> 00:37:20.480
the old political way of thinking is don't say too much because they'll,

681
00:37:20.481 --> 00:37:24.500
you'll get crucified for it and stick to your talking points because there's

682
00:37:24.501 --> 00:37:27.260
just, there was for a long time, there's still,

683
00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:31.190
there's still this argument to be made that there's no reward for being open and

684
00:37:31.191 --> 00:37:34.610
honest about things for having that nuanced conversation. And uh,

685
00:37:34.611 --> 00:37:38.480
that is still true by the way. I've certainly discovered it on my own,

686
00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:43.400
but just that the backlash, I think the backlash that you'll get from,

687
00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:45.860
from certain groups of people is, is,

688
00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:50.000
is quick and Swift and unforgiving. And this is, and this is why,

689
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:53.690
this is why now again, is it worth it for me? Yes.

690
00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:57.320
I think it is because I'd still rather have that open conversation.

691
00:37:57.530 --> 00:38:00.440
I'd rather sit with you for hours and actually get through this stuff.

692
00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:04.870
<v 3>I think that that backlash is just the vocal minority.</v>

693
00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:09.160
And I think there's a tremendous amount of people that are happy that you've

694
00:38:09.161 --> 00:38:12.610
done that and support you for doing that. They're just not vocal about it.

695
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.430
They think you're probably right. I know for sure.

696
00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.510
Cause when I talked to my buddies that, uh, you know, when I said, Hey,

697
00:38:19.511 --> 00:38:22.060
I'm having that Dan Crenshaw and like, Oh, I fucking like that guy, man.

698
00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:24.310
I'm like, do you ever post on his Twitter? No.

699
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:26.620
Do you ever post on his Instagram? No. Yup. They,

700
00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:28.780
there's a lot of people like that. They just,

701
00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:34.120
most people are not going to comment on a YouTube video. Most the vast majority,

702
00:38:34.121 --> 00:38:36.100
most people are gonna watch it go. Oh, that was good.

703
00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:39.640
<v 2>All I can say, I've never commented on a single YouTube video. There you go.</v>

704
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:43.570
I mean, I have disparaged people who comment on YouTube videos in the past,

705
00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:46.330
but look, I don't have a cubicle job. People get fucking bored.

706
00:38:46.331 --> 00:38:48.880
I'd probably be commenting too, but the,

707
00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:54.070
the idea that just the people that are angry at you are the only ones that are

708
00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:58.570
paying attention. It's all backlash. I think you just not see,

709
00:38:58.571 --> 00:39:02.950
you're not reaping the positive aspect as a perspective perspective is hugely

710
00:39:02.951 --> 00:39:06.520
important and you're absolutely right. Um,

711
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:11.320
but, you know, trying to, going back to the political culture,

712
00:39:11.321 --> 00:39:14.960
trying to move it into this a little bit more of an open and honest nuance

713
00:39:14.961 --> 00:39:19.090
discussion, uh, I think is important and we just,

714
00:39:19.091 --> 00:39:22.300
I want to be part of that solution. And it's why come on a show like this?

715
00:39:22.301 --> 00:39:24.580
It's why so I other politicians come on shows like this,

716
00:39:24.581 --> 00:39:27.340
it is moving in that direction. And I think it's, I think it's a cool thing.

717
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:31.810
I think so too. And I think people need to understand that there's, you know,

718
00:39:31.811 --> 00:39:34.900
what are the motivations behind these decisions? Like what, what's the,

719
00:39:34.901 --> 00:39:36.790
what's the thought process behind these decisions?

720
00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.420
You just don't never get that on one of those panel shows where there's two

721
00:39:40.421 --> 00:39:41.620
people barking over each other,

722
00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:44.440
then you've got five minutes to talk less than that. You know?

723
00:39:44.441 --> 00:39:48.880
And that's why on every major bill I'll put out a video and I have to be

724
00:39:48.881 --> 00:39:51.340
conscious of how deep I can go into the policy. Cause again,

725
00:39:51.341 --> 00:39:54.430
people will just stop listening at a certain point. So there's, there is a,

726
00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:58.750
the appetite for long form discussion isn't all that big. But two,

727
00:39:58.751 --> 00:40:01.330
three minutes, five minutes. Is this on YouTube or what do you,

728
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:02.201
I put them on YouTube.

729
00:40:02.201 --> 00:40:05.230
I put them on and I put them on all my social media accounts. So,

730
00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:08.580
and on every big bill on every big bill that we're voting on, um,

731
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:12.280
and I just tried to explain why am I for this, why am I against this?

732
00:40:12.281 --> 00:40:14.110
Here's the reasons, here's what the other side says.

733
00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:16.360
Here's what I say about that. Okay.

734
00:40:16.361 --> 00:40:19.510
And so just let me explain to you why I do what I do.

735
00:40:19.511 --> 00:40:22.780
And it turned out people really like that. No, people love that.

736
00:40:22.781 --> 00:40:25.480
And they didn't exist before. I mean,

737
00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:30.490
we are the first generation that's experiencing politicians having their own

738
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:32.770
channels to express themselves.

739
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.910
You used to have to go to NBC or CBS or what have you to in order to,

740
00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:37.893
and you had to,

741
00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:41.800
you had to be prominent enough to have a conversation with someone.

742
00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.730
Like they're only going to talk to a select number of people and the only reason

743
00:40:45.731 --> 00:40:47.790
why they're going to talk to those people because they think those people would

744
00:40:47.791 --> 00:40:51.670
be viable in terms of the amount of numbers of people that would tune in so they

745
00:40:51.671 --> 00:40:54.610
could get a good advertising money for it. And that's really the market.

746
00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:58.360
That's what it was all about. We're in this new world now, you know,

747
00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:02.050
and I think it's for the better for everybody. It is. It is. I mean,

748
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:05.050
they're like everything. It's got its pros and cons. Um, what are the cons?

749
00:41:05.051 --> 00:41:05.990
We'll just, uh,

750
00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:10.910
social media in general I think allows a lot of the,

751
00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:15.330
that that vocal minority who's mostly angry and it, and it elevates that to,

752
00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:19.870
to a high extent. Um, and it makes us a little angrier at each other, I think.

753
00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:21.850
And that's, that's just a downside.

754
00:41:21.851 --> 00:41:24.070
Now th does that mean I want to get rid of social media? No.

755
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:29.470
What is your take on what we're seeing now with social media in terms of like

756
00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:33.980
algorithms that sort of accentuate that, that, that hate

757
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.260
<v 3>where they find the things that piss you off,</v>

758
00:41:36.261 --> 00:41:40.040
whether you like to post about immigration or abortion and whatever it is and

759
00:41:40.041 --> 00:41:41.330
that's what you're gonna find in your feet,

760
00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:45.210
<v 0>puts that in front of you. Yeah. Um, you know, I think, uh,</v>

761
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:49.130
my concerns with the social media companies are more of the censorship issues

762
00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.180
that we're going to get that next. Yeah. Nothing.

763
00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:54.230
That's generally what we talk about. Um, I don't,

764
00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:56.780
I haven't thought a whole lot about the algorithms and how that works.

765
00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:59.000
I kind of wished they would do it differently. Uh,

766
00:41:59.001 --> 00:42:02.270
but they don't and I can't force them to do, do it differently,

767
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:07.100
but maybe they should recognize that it is accentuating that anger quite a bit.

768
00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:11.930
And you'd have to ask yourself at a certain point, well, Y, Y, Y,

769
00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:16.410
Y encourage that. It's not, it's not helpful. So yeah,

770
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:19.890
<v 3>no, it isn't helpful. And it seems like it's only for profit.</v>

771
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:23.250
The reason why they do it is because the more people click on things,

772
00:42:23.251 --> 00:42:26.430
the more advertising revenue they're gonna generate. Right? The best way.

773
00:42:26.431 --> 00:42:28.350
I mean, it's not a malicious idea,

774
00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:31.400
it's just the algorithms have figured out what's the best way to keep people in

775
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:35.540
<v 0>engaged. And that's through outrage. It's not through through cuteness. Yeah.</v>

776
00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:40.220
It is memes and it's, it's, it's frustrating. You know,

777
00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:44.280
you know what tweet is going to get 50,000 plus likes. Yeah.

778
00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:48.320
It's gotta be hard hitting. It's gotta be punchy. It's not going to be like, uh,

779
00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.330
your, your, your nuanced,

780
00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:53.900
thoughtful take on issue X is,

781
00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:58.190
is not going to get a ton of traction. And so there's an incentive there.

782
00:42:58.191 --> 00:43:01.430
And again, so we can, and it's not totally the social media company's fault.

783
00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.750
Like we always have to look to ourselves as a culture and I think, and,

784
00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:08.720
and be a little introspective and, and just ask ourselves like,

785
00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.090
why am I rapping? Do I want to beat this way?

786
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:16.090
Do I want to be that person that reacts so angrily that did that, that,

787
00:43:16.091 --> 00:43:19.580
that post comments to somebody that I would never have the guts to say to their

788
00:43:19.581 --> 00:43:22.640
face, you know, do you really want to be that person?

789
00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:26.480
We do have to ask ourselves as a culture about that. And, and it's this,

790
00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:27.550
you know, it's,

791
00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:30.530
it's a lot what I wrote about after the Saturday night live thing like let's,

792
00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:34.370
we, we have to get to this point and it's a pretty low standard where we're

793
00:43:34.371 --> 00:43:38.270
attacking ideas and not people and not the intent and character of people.

794
00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:42.740
And a, it's a low standard frankly as far as political discourse. But it's a,

795
00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.960
it's a good place to start. It is a good a

796
00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:49.970
<v 3>place to start and there is a problem with the gatekeepers of social media and</v>

797
00:43:51.931 --> 00:43:56.931
that these companies are all left with their policies and they might be right in

798
00:43:57.691 --> 00:43:58.950
terms of their business practices.

799
00:43:58.951 --> 00:44:02.700
And David Pacman came on here and argued that and actually makes a lot of sense

800
00:44:02.701 --> 00:44:05.340
that in terms of like how they still, uh,

801
00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:09.120
shuffle money overseas and avoid taxes and they do this,

802
00:44:09.121 --> 00:44:11.670
a lot of right-wing business practices.

803
00:44:11.671 --> 00:44:16.290
But my thought on that is it's probably just compartmentalization and you're

804
00:44:16.291 --> 00:44:19.710
dealing with business people that have taken over some multibillion dollar

805
00:44:19.711 --> 00:44:22.620
corporation and that this is the business aspect of it.

806
00:44:22.621 --> 00:44:24.660
And then you've got your social engineering aspect of it.

807
00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:29.670
And the social engineering aspect of it is, it's very problematic for me. Um,

808
00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.010
there was an article that was written recently and one of

809
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:32.843
<v 2>the guys,</v>

810
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000
he was saying something about me in that no silencing white nationalists and

811
00:44:38.431 --> 00:44:43.110
keeping them off your platform is not censorship, which is the way,

812
00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:48.150
the dumbest way to sort of boil down my position on censorship and ignore the

813
00:44:53.311 --> 00:44:57.960
real problems of other people deciding what someone can or can't say and what is

814
00:44:57.961 --> 00:45:01.890
or is not offensive. I'm one of the best examples is a woman name. Uh,

815
00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.050
I think Morgan Murph, Megan Murphy,

816
00:45:04.051 --> 00:45:08.700
Megan Murphy is her name that she's a what's called a trans exclusion exclusive

817
00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:11.370
Solutionary, what's the word? Why?

818
00:45:11.371 --> 00:45:16.050
Why am I an exclusionary trans, exclusionary, radical feminist of turf?

819
00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:18.840
And she was in a debate with,

820
00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:22.030
I don't blame you for not being able to remember that trans exclusionary but

821
00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:23.040
exclusionary, that weird word.

822
00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:28.370
She was in a debate with people about whether or not trans women should be able

823
00:45:29.041 --> 00:45:31.620
to invade feminist women's spaces.

824
00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:34.050
So a person who is biologically male,

825
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:39.320
who becomes a female later in life should be able to make decisions in feminist

826
00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:45.150
debates and in getting into their sports. So she says, yes,

827
00:45:45.151 --> 00:45:48.690
the sports is the big one for me, particularly fighting. She says,

828
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:52.860
but a man is never a woman. This is what she says. Okay.

829
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.580
So Twitter asked her to take it down. So she takes a screenshot of that.

830
00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:00.060
She takes it down, takes a screenshot of it and repost it like fuck you.

831
00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:03.690
Like I'm going to put it back up again. This way they banned her for life,

832
00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:08.880
for life. You know who's on Twitter with no problems? OJ Simpson.

833
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:11.400
OJ Simpson murdered two people.

834
00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:16.680
He fucking went to jail for armed kidnapping and he's on TV. He's on every day.

835
00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.740
Go to the world. Hamas among other things too.

836
00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:25.770
This is Megan Murphy. She says a man is not a woman. She's fucking correct.

837
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:29.130
Biologically. She's biologically correct. I mean if we wanted to,

838
00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:30.413
aside socially,

839
00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:34.560
culturally that we were going to accept this person as a woman is a completely

840
00:46:34.561 --> 00:46:38.610
different discussion, but she's right. She's biologically correct.

841
00:46:38.611 --> 00:46:40.560
Scientists would say, well here we go.

842
00:46:40.561 --> 00:46:43.540
We've got some chromosomes here and we've got X and Y and this is a penis as a

843
00:46:43.541 --> 00:46:45.840
vagina. This is a man, this is a woman and you know,

844
00:46:45.841 --> 00:46:47.820
maybe this person identifies with being a woman,

845
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.920
but she's saying you're not a woman and you're banning her for life. It's,

846
00:46:52.921 --> 00:46:57.870
this is crazy. This is this woke culture in its most boil down form.

847
00:46:57.871 --> 00:47:01.320
It has nothing to do with white nationalism. It has nothing to do with race.

848
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:06.480
It has to do with a person that feels like their own particular protected group.

849
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:08.270
Being a feminist, being a woman, and,

850
00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:13.320
and trying to like carve out rules where women are protected and she's saying,

851
00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:18.390
I don't like the fact that these trans women are entering into this space and

852
00:47:18.391 --> 00:47:21.180
dominating it and certain aspects. Right. And it's,

853
00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:24.850
it's an example of this intersectional coalition that they've created kind of

854
00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:28.830
coming, coming to terms with itself. And you know, the,

855
00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:30.160
a lot of the feminist groups

856
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:33.610
<v 1>aligned with us against the equality act because the equality act would have put</v>

857
00:47:33.611 --> 00:47:37.630
in into real practice this in into concrete terms,

858
00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:40.720
a biological men getting into women's sports. Yes.

859
00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:43.450
And so a lot among other things by the way, that that,

860
00:47:43.451 --> 00:47:46.390
and a lot of feminist groups were finally coming out and saying, no,

861
00:47:46.391 --> 00:47:50.770
this is not correct. Like we were a feminist group, so let's protect women,

862
00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:55.330
which I fully agree with and, but, you know, on a deeper level,

863
00:47:55.331 --> 00:47:58.690
it's interesting to watch that intersectional coalition just implode.

864
00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:02.080
And it stems from this desire on their part to, to,

865
00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:06.420
to divide everybody up into three categories of oppressed, uh,

866
00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:10.380
the oppressors and then the champions of the oppressed, right.

867
00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:12.250
And the woke culture is the champions. Of course,

868
00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:14.290
that's how they label themselves. They were,

869
00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:17.200
they labeled their intersectional coalition as the oppressed,

870
00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:18.520
and then they lumped,

871
00:48:18.521 --> 00:48:21.010
and then they have this whole other kind of intersectional coalition of

872
00:48:21.011 --> 00:48:24.700
oppressors. And they connected all with the worst of the worst,

873
00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:27.610
which is white supremacist, Nazis, Nazis. And so you're all in,

874
00:48:27.611 --> 00:48:30.700
they say you're all connected with that somehow. Even,

875
00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:32.030
even if you're just making a, uh,

876
00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:37.180
a pretty bland statement about a biological men and women somehow that connects

877
00:48:37.361 --> 00:48:41.740
to this. And this is how you see them reason their way through it. And, uh,

878
00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:46.800
and what th what that does is it undercuts real basic arguments because you're

879
00:48:46.871 --> 00:48:50.170
attacking the intent of that argument because you're connecting it with the

880
00:48:50.171 --> 00:48:53.500
worst of the worst, right? Not we kill Nazis. That's what our country does.

881
00:48:53.501 --> 00:48:56.880
We did it. And so if you're connecting all of these things you disagree with,

882
00:48:56.881 --> 00:48:59.860
with that, well, you don't even have to make an argument anymore. Yes.

883
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:05.190
And the idea that you're going to somehow or another convince people that

884
00:49:06.161 --> 00:49:10.010
everyone is a Nazi. Just because you say so. That's not gonna work. Yeah.

885
00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.070
W what's going to work as people are going to just,

886
00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.600
they're gonna go to the other side.

887
00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:17.720
You're making more Republicans with this crazy talk. You're you, you. Well,

888
00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.770
I hope so. Well that's really what's going on.

889
00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.630
Me and my friend Chris Pratt wore a tee shirt that said, don't tread on me.

890
00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:25.600
Remember that, Oh fuck man. It's a,

891
00:49:25.601 --> 00:49:30.601
it's a goddamn ancient flag representing our separation from England and are

892
00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:36.000
want to be able to start our own country. I mean, that's what it was. Yeah,

893
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:40.180
exactly. And it gets to a deeper culture. War one.

894
00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.850
There's many fronts on the cultural Wars. This is a big one.

895
00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.460
Is America based on bad things or good things?

896
00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:49.880
Are we good intrinsically good or are we bad? This is,

897
00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:54.840
this is a huge fissure in the cultural war right now. And you know it when,

898
00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:58.190
when we, and I and I have a lot of fear that, that,

899
00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:02.170
that these things are boiling up and that we're destroying the things,

900
00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:05.560
the few things that hold us together, you know, as a country,

901
00:50:05.561 --> 00:50:09.580
like what makes us Americans, it's not ethnicity, it's not religion,

902
00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:13.540
it's not even really geographic area because our geographic area has changed

903
00:50:13.541 --> 00:50:15.940
over time. It is, it is ideals,

904
00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:19.000
it is ideals and those ideals are symbolized by certain things.

905
00:50:19.001 --> 00:50:21.940
And it's the USS constant, the us constitution, the declaration of independence,

906
00:50:21.941 --> 00:50:24.880
the pledge of allegiance to the flag, the national Anthem,

907
00:50:24.881 --> 00:50:28.160
like these things matter. And I, they're very important

908
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.770
<v 0>for a culture and, and B,</v>

909
00:50:30.771 --> 00:50:33.320
and this actually all ties back into this sort of oppressor,

910
00:50:33.321 --> 00:50:36.500
oppressed kind of ideology. Because if you tell people that they're oppressed,

911
00:50:36.501 --> 00:50:39.200
well then they have to look for an oppressor. And that starts small.

912
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:42.230
It starts with your parent or your boss or somebody you don't like. Okay,

913
00:50:42.231 --> 00:50:44.720
it's their fault. That's why I have something bad happen to me.

914
00:50:44.721 --> 00:50:47.900
It's somebody else's fault. And then it grows into groups. Okay,

915
00:50:47.901 --> 00:50:50.870
now you get into identity politics. And pitting identities against each other,

916
00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.530
then you're starting to blame institutions. Okay. And this is kind of the,

917
00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:57.620
this is, this is when we talk about Bernie Sanders, this is,

918
00:50:57.621 --> 00:51:00.580
he's doing this often. He's blaming institutions for our,

919
00:51:00.581 --> 00:51:04.210
for our issues constantly that has met him.

920
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:08.480
That is morphed into blaming the entire country. The entire country as a,

921
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:12.660
as an American ideal is to blame. I,

922
00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:15.470
I just think that's really both. I think it's historically inaccurate.

923
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:19.100
I think it's an accurate objectively, but I just think it's dangerous.

924
00:51:19.101 --> 00:51:22.340
I don't think it can go anywhere good unless you just want total revolution,

925
00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:27.290
which I think some people do. Um, it just, it tears us apart.

926
00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:30.620
Right? And we're getting divided along. We're, we're, we're, we're,

927
00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:33.440
we're allowing the pop culture to get involved in this too.

928
00:51:33.441 --> 00:51:36.440
So we can't share pop culture anymore. Uh, because you know,

929
00:51:36.441 --> 00:51:40.700
musicians are getting involved in politics and comedians and late night shows

930
00:51:40.701 --> 00:51:41.241
and it's like, okay,

931
00:51:41.241 --> 00:51:43.460
well now half the country can't even watch it because those people are just

932
00:51:43.461 --> 00:51:44.570
telling them the most stupid they are.

933
00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:48.800
We're losing these basic symbols that bring us together.

934
00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:51.800
And then we're lots of losing the pop culture that kind of brings us together.

935
00:51:51.801 --> 00:51:54.800
That should be something we can just share and then not talk politics.

936
00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:59.450
But that's been removed as well. And I just, the culture war is a,

937
00:51:59.910 --> 00:52:01.400
it's, it's not going a good direction.

938
00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:06.800
I'm hoping that this is an adolescent stage in the development of this strange

939
00:52:06.801 --> 00:52:09.770
country. That's an experiment in self government. That's what I'm thinking.

940
00:52:09.771 --> 00:52:12.310
And I think this is experiment self-government,

941
00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:15.710
which is a completely new thing in human history that's redefined the way the

942
00:52:15.711 --> 00:52:19.040
rest of the world governs itself. I mean this, that's what America really is.

943
00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:21.890
Is it perfect? Fuck no, but humans aren't perfect.

944
00:52:21.891 --> 00:52:23.930
There's not a God damn human anywhere. That's perfect.

945
00:52:23.931 --> 00:52:27.590
There's not a single culture anywhere that doesn't have something that's

946
00:52:27.591 --> 00:52:31.400
inherently wrong with it. It's the best system for imperfect human beings.

947
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:35.360
Right. And it's, it's a system based on the, the fact, the,

948
00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:40.220
the unavoidable fact that we are imperfect. Okay. And that,

949
00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.540
and that you cannot,

950
00:52:41.541 --> 00:52:45.680
you cannot constrain mankind's nature to the extent that progressives would like

951
00:52:45.681 --> 00:52:46.060
to. There's,

952
00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:50.510
there's a belief of from an assumption just marks this ideology and kind of

953
00:52:50.511 --> 00:52:53.660
French revolution thought that you can perfect human nature,

954
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:56.390
that you can get people to be perfect eventually.

955
00:52:56.391 --> 00:52:59.310
If you just give the state enough control and, and, and,

956
00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:03.620
and stop certain thoughts that are bad, keep those down, keep the elevate.

957
00:53:03.621 --> 00:53:08.420
These other ones you can eventually get us to where we think we should be. Uh,

958
00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:09.500
I think that's utopian.

959
00:53:09.501 --> 00:53:13.820
I don't see how that's ever possible and I think our U S constitutional system

960
00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.830
understands that. You know, it, it's not, there's not,

961
00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:19.730
the founders got together and just made a bunch of stuff up, right? They were,

962
00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:21.910
they were, they were very well versed in history. They,

963
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:26.550
they studied it relentlessly and they took ideas from Jerusalem and Athens and

964
00:53:26.551 --> 00:53:27.390
Rome and London.

965
00:53:27.391 --> 00:53:30.150
They took all these best ideas and these best practices and they said,

966
00:53:30.151 --> 00:53:31.980
this is probably how we should govern.

967
00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:34.920
We're first going to say why government exists. Okay.

968
00:53:34.921 --> 00:53:36.750
We're going to say that in the declaration of independence,

969
00:53:36.751 --> 00:53:41.280
when John Thomas Jefferson wrote that the declaration of independence was wasn't

970
00:53:41.281 --> 00:53:42.510
just declaring its independence,

971
00:53:42.511 --> 00:53:47.070
it was also declaring why government exists and it exists to protect unalienable

972
00:53:47.071 --> 00:53:49.490
rights, life, Liberty, and pursuit of happiness.

973
00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.350
And he gets these ideas from guys like John Locke who said life,

974
00:53:52.351 --> 00:53:53.820
Liberty and property are,

975
00:53:53.821 --> 00:53:57.060
those are an alien noble rights and you protect rights.

976
00:53:57.061 --> 00:53:58.680
You can't give them to people,

977
00:53:58.890 --> 00:54:01.950
but you can protect them because they're already inherent in you their natural

978
00:54:01.951 --> 00:54:04.890
rights. Okay. And then the constitution told us how to govern.

979
00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:08.010
This is like how do we live together? Well, there should be checks and balances.

980
00:54:08.011 --> 00:54:11.490
You should have an emphasis on local state control because the cause of the

981
00:54:11.491 --> 00:54:14.400
problems are closest to the people and they should be closest to the

982
00:54:14.401 --> 00:54:16.140
representatives down at that level.

983
00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:21.000
I'm 51% of the population shouldn't be able to tell the other 49% what to do.

984
00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:21.781
You know,

985
00:54:21.781 --> 00:54:24.900
we should have an electoral college so that the biggest population centers can't

986
00:54:24.901 --> 00:54:26.850
tell everybody else what to do.

987
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:30.870
There's important structures like embedded into the constitution that have,

988
00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:33.270
that have allowed us to actually last. I think as long as we have,

989
00:54:33.271 --> 00:54:35.160
we have the oldest political debates, the oldest document,

990
00:54:35.161 --> 00:54:37.210
the world is the oldest constitution in the West.

991
00:54:37.310 --> 00:54:38.820
We're the youngest one of the youngest countries,

992
00:54:38.821 --> 00:54:41.970
but we're the only ones that had such a long standing constitution.

993
00:54:41.971 --> 00:54:44.730
I think that's important to realize too. It's very bizarre.

994
00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:49.330
<v 2>They had the insight to realize that shit could go so sideways that they put all</v>

995
00:54:49.331 --> 00:54:53.530
these checks and balances together that actually can reasonably well in a

996
00:54:53.531 --> 00:54:57.250
reasonably well way work today. I mean,

997
00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.770
there's a lot of people that disagree with a lot of the aspects of it.

998
00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.900
One person, one vote, they would like that.

999
00:55:01.901 --> 00:55:04.870
They don't think that representative democracy is an important now because we

1000
00:55:04.871 --> 00:55:08.200
have this ability to communicate that we didn't have in the 18 hundreds.

1001
00:55:08.201 --> 00:55:08.351
You know,

1002
00:55:08.351 --> 00:55:12.070
you gotta send a fucking pony with a letter on it in order to get your word

1003
00:55:12.071 --> 00:55:12.760
across.

1004
00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:17.340
Now you can actually tweet and you could vote online if we so deem it and we've

1005
00:55:17.341 --> 00:55:21.490
made it legal. Um, but the electoral college,

1006
00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:22.960
do you feel like that, that,

1007
00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:25.480
and especially with like things like super delegates,

1008
00:55:25.810 --> 00:55:29.620
do you think that that's still the way to do things and he's still an effective

1009
00:55:29.621 --> 00:55:31.930
way to, yeah. Why is it because the,

1010
00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:36.360
the alternative is the 51% versus the 49%. And that,

1011
00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:39.880
that what that really boils down to is New York and, and, and,

1012
00:55:40.090 --> 00:55:43.650
and that Los Angeles telling everybody who the president should be, but the,

1013
00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:46.660
the vast majority people don't live in New York and Los Angeles.

1014
00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:49.990
And that's exactly the problem. 20,000,007, what is it,

1015
00:55:49.991 --> 00:55:51.310
9 million or something in New York.

1016
00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:55.480
<v 0>Um, does a, but, and that's the issue, right? Cause he, you really are, you're,</v>

1017
00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:59.020
you're, you're, and when people congregate in population centers,

1018
00:55:59.021 --> 00:56:02.740
they also tend to start to think alike. And I just think,

1019
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:04.630
and on a more fundamental level,

1020
00:56:06.110 --> 00:56:08.170
look at the difference between Democrats and Republicans.

1021
00:56:08.171 --> 00:56:09.640
People always wonder what that difference is.

1022
00:56:09.641 --> 00:56:11.260
And there's a lot of differences of course,

1023
00:56:11.261 --> 00:56:15.400
but a really kind of simple heuristic to think about it is the word Democrat and

1024
00:56:15.401 --> 00:56:19.330
Republican. Okay. One believes in a pure democracy. One believes in a Republic.

1025
00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:22.210
I was saying, Democrats believe in total pure democracy, but,

1026
00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.130
but when you're saying the electoral college,

1027
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:27.820
<v 1>you are saying pure democracy are saying 51% of the population and can tell the</v>

1028
00:56:27.821 --> 00:56:31.310
other 49% what to do. The electoral college is a,

1029
00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:33.070
is a check and balance against that.

1030
00:56:33.071 --> 00:56:37.210
That gives those States in the middle a some kind of voice that they wouldn't

1031
00:56:37.211 --> 00:56:39.940
have otherwise had. It makes them, why is everybody in Iowa right now?

1032
00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:43.360
Do you think they'd be an Iowa if, uh, if we didn't have electoral college,

1033
00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:46.770
could deer hunting there? Yeah, that's a good reason to go. But they're like,

1034
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:48.790
but, but, but the reality is, is they would only,

1035
00:56:48.791 --> 00:56:51.130
they would only be campaigning in the big population centers.

1036
00:56:51.131 --> 00:56:53.290
They wouldn't bother going to the rural areas. Uh,

1037
00:56:53.291 --> 00:56:54.940
because you're gonna get the most bang for your buck.

1038
00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:58.180
Going to just the population area, painting,

1039
00:56:58.181 --> 00:57:00.220
physically campaigning and physically and also,

1040
00:57:00.221 --> 00:57:03.520
but also who you're accountable to is, that's the most important thing.

1041
00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:04.720
Who are you accountable to?

1042
00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:08.020
You're not going to care if you're accountable to the rural areas.

1043
00:57:08.021 --> 00:57:10.390
Like you should be into the middle of the country like you should be.

1044
00:57:10.391 --> 00:57:12.970
Because if you only care about 51% of the vote,

1045
00:57:12.971 --> 00:57:16.420
you're just going to go to those main population centers and you're only gonna

1046
00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:18.160
talk to them and you're only gonna care what they think.

1047
00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:21.580
And I don't think that's good. That's not a good, that's not good for democracy,

1048
00:57:21.581 --> 00:57:25.720
especially when we have such a wide diversity of preferences and, and, uh,

1049
00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:27.820
just styles of living across the country.

1050
00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:31.450
It's still that important to be physically in a place to campaign,

1051
00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:34.690
to like to physically go to Chicago, to campaign, physically go to Iowa. Yeah.

1052
00:57:34.691 --> 00:57:36.520
People, I think people want to see you. You know,

1053
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:39.340
there's a good argument to be made that Hillary Clinton lost because she just

1054
00:57:39.341 --> 00:57:42.590
didn't go to Wisconsin these last days. So I think people,

1055
00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:46.240
people want to get to know you. People want to see you. Well,

1056
00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:48.050
get the good argument of Hillary too, is that she,

1057
00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:51.760
people didn't believe she had enough energy to go and campaign.

1058
00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:57.010
And I don't know. I never met her. Uh, I, I can't,

1059
00:57:57.011 --> 00:58:00.160
I can't tell you what the inside look at that campaign was. It's,

1060
00:58:00.161 --> 00:58:03.490
I just know it didn't work. Yeah. Whatever happened. Um,

1061
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:08.670
when you think about what are the problems that we're facing today in terms of,

1062
00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:10.900
uh, of,

1063
00:58:10.901 --> 00:58:15.901
of voting and registering to vote in primaries and electing someone from,

1064
00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:16.690
you know,

1065
00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:21.690
your party to get to go against other parties and that this whole process is

1066
00:58:22.931 --> 00:58:27.130
convoluted, gigantic, involved process. Could that be simplified?

1067
00:58:27.131 --> 00:58:29.920
Do you think that in, in any way,

1068
00:58:30.250 --> 00:58:35.250
doing something online and having your ability to register to vote when you get

1069
00:58:35.951 --> 00:58:39.520
driver's license? Sure. You don't automatically registers you to vote. Is there,

1070
00:58:39.521 --> 00:58:43.720
are there ways to get more people involved? Well, you know,

1071
00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:46.210
there's two different philosophies here is,

1072
00:58:46.211 --> 00:58:48.240
are you just trying to get everybody to, to,

1073
00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:50.800
to quickly spend five minutes of the day and then vote? Well,

1074
00:58:50.801 --> 00:58:52.990
that's what you're doing for the most part in anyone. Don't you think?

1075
00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:54.240
A lot of people, uh, know,

1076
00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:57.010
if you have to actually take the time to register and go to the polls,

1077
00:58:57.011 --> 00:58:59.410
you're going to do at least a little bit more research on what's going on.

1078
00:58:59.411 --> 00:59:03.660
I think you haven't talked to my friends. Yeah. Let's see it everybody,

1079
00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:06.600
because I'd say it everybody, but you're [inaudible] but I think you'll,

1080
00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:10.060
you'll exponentially increase that number when you, when you, the the other,

1081
00:59:10.061 --> 00:59:12.820
the other problem is, is simple election security.

1082
00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:15.520
And if we're worried about the Russians hacking on our elections,

1083
00:59:15.521 --> 00:59:19.900
then I fail to see how putting everything online is also a good idea. Uh,

1084
00:59:19.901 --> 00:59:24.590
so that's, yeah, we can't, we can't be worried about both things there. Um, and,

1085
00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:26.600
and we are worried about Russians hacking our elections.

1086
00:59:26.601 --> 00:59:30.350
They've obviously tried [inaudible] tried hacking the results. I mean,

1087
00:59:30.370 --> 00:59:34.130
they've clearly tried to influence the way people, they did try each other.

1088
00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:36.740
They tried everything. Tried to do. Yeah, they did try to hack the results.

1089
00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:37.790
They're unsuccessful.

1090
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:40.190
One of the reasons they're unsuccessful is because a lot of our election

1091
00:59:40.191 --> 00:59:44.600
machines are air gapped and they're all so different. Every County you go to.

1092
00:59:44.601 --> 00:59:48.120
I mean, so it is a mess because, because you know, we allow counties,

1093
00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:49.820
States and counties to be in charge of that.

1094
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:53.360
But that also makes it highly resilient because it's so compartmentalized.

1095
00:59:53.361 --> 00:59:55.760
I mean, so from an intelligence operations perspective,

1096
00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:57.710
you want things to be compartmentalized in.

1097
00:59:57.711 --> 00:59:59.940
Our election system actually meets that and we're,

1098
01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:04.130
and we're working a lot with the DHS is working a lot with local authorities to

1099
01:00:04.131 --> 01:00:07.370
even improve upon that a lot. So they were going in the right direction.

1100
01:00:07.371 --> 01:00:11.570
You can't hack dangling CHADS. Remember those things?

1101
01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:15.490
What were those? What was it called? Those, those things that hung?

1102
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:18.290
Just a hanging Chad hanging. Just hanging. It wasn't dangling.

1103
01:00:18.291 --> 01:00:20.960
It could have been both. That's totally different. It was like,

1104
01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:23.870
like they weren't exactly sure within a vote counted.

1105
01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:28.370
They had to like examine them. Yeah. That seems like a silly way to, I mean,

1106
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:32.090
if we could do banking online, why can't we vote online?

1107
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:36.350
Isn't there a way to make something where it's hacked proof? Is that possible?

1108
01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.980
I might be. It might be again. Um,

1109
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:43.670
but now you're getting into a problem with, with identity. You know, again,

1110
01:00:43.671 --> 01:00:46.310
there's a lot of people believe you shouldn't have voting of any voter IDs.

1111
01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:49.550
I think that's crazy. I think we use ideas all the time.

1112
01:00:49.551 --> 01:00:52.640
I think you should have an ID to register so we know it's you. Right? Of course.

1113
01:00:52.641 --> 01:00:54.830
And then you should have an Asian just show your ID when you vote.

1114
01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:56.150
But what I'm saying is like what did,

1115
01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:59.960
wouldn't it be a better thing if more people voted or do you think that it's

1116
01:00:59.961 --> 01:01:03.410
better if only the people motivated to vote and participate?

1117
01:01:03.411 --> 01:01:06.200
Vote the way we do in it now where you have to register within a certain amount

1118
01:01:06.201 --> 01:01:08.390
of time and you have to show up at an actual polling place. Yeah.

1119
01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.440
Do you think that's better?

1120
01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.000
It's not self evident to me that by nature of more people voting,

1121
01:01:14.001 --> 01:01:16.910
things will get better. I'd like them to go vote.

1122
01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:20.360
I like them to put in the work and the civic and the do their civic duty and to

1123
01:01:20.361 --> 01:01:22.610
get educated and go vote. I would like them to do that.

1124
01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:25.630
But that's a separate discussion from just from,

1125
01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.340
from a moving safeguards on our elections just to get,

1126
01:01:28.341 --> 01:01:32.450
make it easier for them to do what is already quite easy. I mean, and this,

1127
01:01:32.451 --> 01:01:35.960
this is weird argument against this, like it's so hard to vote.

1128
01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:39.620
We're so suppressed. There's just no evidence of that and it's just a hard,

1129
01:01:39.621 --> 01:01:43.100
but it's not as easy as it could be if you could just register online. Yeah,

1130
01:01:43.101 --> 01:01:45.440
I mean I can make a million things easier, but then again,

1131
01:01:45.441 --> 01:01:46.790
they were moved safeguards that, that,

1132
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:51.280
that that creates safe elections and elections that we can have faith in it.

1133
01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.110
That's a very important thing if [inaudible],

1134
01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.750
and I think you see this when you have this discussion with people,

1135
01:01:56.751 --> 01:02:00.830
they're already on edge about whether their vote really counts because you know,

1136
01:02:00.831 --> 01:02:02.270
some people think illegals are voting and again,

1137
01:02:02.271 --> 01:02:05.420
there's not a huge amount of evidence for that either. It does happen,

1138
01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:08.280
but it's not as an illegals vote. I mean,

1139
01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:12.590
in place of register and in places where there's no voter ID, you can,

1140
01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:15.710
you can make it a lot easier. Where's the NovaSure voter ID?

1141
01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.570
I don't believe there is in California. Is that,

1142
01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:21.710
am I right on that California check on that? But, um,

1143
01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:24.210
it's definitely not the law of the land everywhere in Texas. It is.

1144
01:02:24.211 --> 01:02:28.200
So Texas is a good example, I think of like very, it's very easy to vote.

1145
01:02:28.201 --> 01:02:31.200
I just can't imagine that people don't think it's easy to vote in Texas.

1146
01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.830
If you're senior citizen or disabled, you can mail in your ballot 30 days prior.

1147
01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:36.570
We have two weeks of early voting.

1148
01:02:36.571 --> 01:02:39.280
You can go to any election place in the County and,

1149
01:02:39.310 --> 01:02:43.680
and vote from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM for two weeks straight. Yeah,

1150
01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:47.440
yeah, yeah. I mean, and you just show your ID and you vote. I mean, this is, I,

1151
01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:50.460
we feel in Texas, like it's safeguard and we're not,

1152
01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:53.550
we're not overly worried that our vote doesn't count because it's canceled out

1153
01:02:53.551 --> 01:02:57.570
by some fake vote. And it's hard to, and it's hard to argue that,

1154
01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.650
that there's, um, suppression either because against so easy,

1155
01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.240
difficult where you can go on election day.

1156
01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:07.140
It's just a shame that we have so little faith in our ability to do things

1157
01:03:07.141 --> 01:03:12.141
electronically that we're worried and that we wouldn't want people to vote

1158
01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:14.220
online because we're worried about people hacking.

1159
01:03:14.221 --> 01:03:19.221
It lets that is a shame because I just feel like if you could walk,

1160
01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.690
like maybe if you were going to vote online,

1161
01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:26.010
you would have to watch a five minute video explaining people's positions on

1162
01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:30.660
things and explaining where they stand and why this makes sense and show that

1163
01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:34.470
and after that five minute video, then you get to vote. Yeah,

1164
01:03:34.471 --> 01:03:38.550
that's an interesting idea. Um, I'm not opposed to the videos of course,

1165
01:03:38.551 --> 01:03:42.100
forcing people to do things just generally speaking as truth is tough. Um,

1166
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:46.220
but it still goes back to how do you even know it's the right person who's

1167
01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:49.400
sitting there at the computer. That's true too. Yeah. I mean that, that's the,

1168
01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:54.090
that's the difficult part with your phone. You have face ID, you know, Apple ID,

1169
01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:57.690
you use fingerprints with other phones. Oh, sure. I mean,

1170
01:03:57.691 --> 01:03:59.070
there's interesting ideas that you could,

1171
01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:01.800
that you could look into to make this work,

1172
01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:06.420
but it's a pretty massive change and it'd be a massive federal takeover of what

1173
01:04:06.421 --> 01:04:11.310
is, what is constitutionally a state's right to, to implement that. So,

1174
01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.790
you know, it's just, and then the question is, what are we trying to fix?

1175
01:04:15.210 --> 01:04:17.820
You know, when we're going to do as a massive change on to something,

1176
01:04:18.210 --> 01:04:20.640
what kind of improvements are we expecting and why?

1177
01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:23.100
And those are just good policy questions to ask.

1178
01:04:23.101 --> 01:04:24.450
It doesn't mean we don't have those discussions.

1179
01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:27.030
There's always been an issue with voter turnout. Correct? I mean, isn't it,

1180
01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:31.320
it's a fairly insignificant number of people that actually want to voting.

1181
01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:34.590
Right? Yeah. But does that, because is that, whose fault is that?

1182
01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:37.280
That's a good question. It's people who don't go to vote. Right?

1183
01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:40.740
So do you think that those people like, fuck those people,

1184
01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.920
they're just lazy and no. No. Shouldn't have a say. Not at all.

1185
01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:48.060
It's just that I just would encourage them to go vote. Right. Like, it's right,

1186
01:04:48.061 --> 01:04:51.200
but that isn't it been fairly consistent, like the,

1187
01:04:51.201 --> 01:04:52.800
the number of people that vote,

1188
01:04:52.801 --> 01:04:56.130
the percentage of people that vote across the board. Yeah. But again, it's,

1189
01:04:56.220 --> 01:05:00.330
it's not self, it's not self evident that that's a problem that governor,

1190
01:05:00.331 --> 01:05:05.250
it's up to government now to force that into, into a fix it. You know,

1191
01:05:05.251 --> 01:05:08.850
I, I'm not sure I see that argument's not self-evident that things would all be

1192
01:05:08.851 --> 01:05:12.420
better if we forced people to vote or made it so easy that they didn't have to

1193
01:05:12.421 --> 01:05:16.020
think about it at all and just got on their app and voted. So, yeah, it's,

1194
01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:18.220
it's an interesting question. Do we want to increase voter

1195
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:21.640
<v 0>turnout and then, yeah, sure. How do we do it? Um,</v>

1196
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:26.470
I think civic education is a more appropriate answer to that as opposed to,

1197
01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:29.830
as opposed to making it as easy as buying something at the grocery store.

1198
01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:34.120
What civic education, what form? I mean, starting with our schools,

1199
01:05:34.121 --> 01:05:37.330
we just don't, we don't teach a lot of civic education anymore.

1200
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:41.260
And I think that's obvious from our political discourse sometimes. Uh, it's,

1201
01:05:41.261 --> 01:05:44.320
it's, it's not required. Like, I think it should be, you know, just,

1202
01:05:44.321 --> 01:05:46.480
I mean the basics. Like where does government happen?

1203
01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:48.160
If you're concerned about your schools,

1204
01:05:48.370 --> 01:05:51.350
who should you go to your Congressman or you should you go to your mayor or you

1205
01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:53.650
go to, right. We're going to tell people this stuff. It's like, no,

1206
01:05:53.651 --> 01:05:54.700
you should go to, you should,

1207
01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:57.820
you should get involved in your school board elections for one thing. You know,

1208
01:05:57.821 --> 01:05:59.890
it just as an example. Uh,

1209
01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:02.950
just a lot of things that I think need to be taught before we,

1210
01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.500
so I think we're trying to solve the wrong problem when we say, well,

1211
01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:07.690
voting's not easy enough and I'm not so sure that we're,

1212
01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:11.620
we're hitting at the heart of the issue when it comes to voter turnout. Hmm.

1213
01:06:12.250 --> 01:06:17.230
<v 2>When people talk about issues in this country, there's a,</v>

1214
01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:20.740
there's a giant does it giant divide with,

1215
01:06:20.830 --> 01:06:24.860
with one thing in particular, and that is mass shootings, uh,

1216
01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.410
mass shootings and gun control.

1217
01:06:26.610 --> 01:06:30.820
There's a giant divide between people that are second amendment advocates and

1218
01:06:30.821 --> 01:06:34.990
people that want to round up all the assault weapons and take away all the guns.

1219
01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:39.100
And they think that guns are the problem. When you see this

1220
01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:44.710
pretty disturbing increase in mass shootings in this country,

1221
01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:48.820
what is, what is your take on it and what do you think could be done?

1222
01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:53.710
<v 0>Well, it's awful. Um, they're terrorist attacks and I think,</v>

1223
01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:57.580
I think it's safer to call them that, uh, the, the ink weather,

1224
01:06:57.670 --> 01:07:01.340
depending on how you define a mass shooting. Um, now you defined,

1225
01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:04.750
when we look at murder statistics, we're actually at a very,

1226
01:07:04.751 --> 01:07:07.720
very low point in our history. I mean, you look at the early nineties,

1227
01:07:07.721 --> 01:07:11.560
it was vastly more murders by gun, uh,

1228
01:07:11.590 --> 01:07:14.710
than we have now as just statistically speaking. What's, what's that?

1229
01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:19.450
Because of this? They know, uh, well there was a massive war on crime,

1230
01:07:19.451 --> 01:07:22.480
I think in the 90s, uh, increase in police. You know,

1231
01:07:22.481 --> 01:07:24.280
you had some of the crime bills that went through,

1232
01:07:24.281 --> 01:07:26.560
which were obviously the source of a lot of debate right now in the Democrat

1233
01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:30.610
primary. And, uh, yeah, I just, it was just, there was a,

1234
01:07:30.611 --> 01:07:34.090
there was an approach to fix that. Okay. You know, tackling gang violence,

1235
01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:37.720
tackling all of these things. And, uh, we, we live in a much,

1236
01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:41.750
even though you wouldn't think so because of these kinds of theatrical, again,

1237
01:07:41.890 --> 01:07:44.250
they're, they're terrorist attacks. I don't know what's to call them, uh,

1238
01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:48.160
because, because the person doing it is trying to commit terror. Right. And, uh,

1239
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:51.280
you know, for different reasons of course, but, but there are,

1240
01:07:51.290 --> 01:07:53.290
they at least they attach themselves to some kind of reason.

1241
01:07:53.291 --> 01:07:58.210
But in the end there, they're angry at something and they're, they're probably,

1242
01:07:58.270 --> 01:07:59.020
you know,

1243
01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:01.840
probably have been taking some kind of psychotropic drugs over time and they've

1244
01:08:01.841 --> 01:08:04.690
gotten to this point and they'll attach themselves to whatever reason they need

1245
01:08:04.691 --> 01:08:09.670
to do this. And it's awful. Um, so, you know, how do you fix that?

1246
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:14.620
Um, we have to understand the problem. We have to diagnose it. And, um,

1247
01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:15.930
and then we got it.

1248
01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:20.660
<v 1>And I think we have to be realistic about what the solutions really are and what</v>

1249
01:08:20.661 --> 01:08:24.860
our ability to influence those outcomes really is. And that's the,

1250
01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:29.020
that's an emotional conversation for people. Uh, you know, we've,

1251
01:08:29.021 --> 01:08:31.210
we've been dealing with for the last few weeks, of course. I mean it's, it's,

1252
01:08:31.211 --> 01:08:35.300
it's front and center, um, and the debate. And so, but we got to have it.

1253
01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:39.800
What can be done? Yeah. Um, well the, the,

1254
01:08:39.801 --> 01:08:44.390
so obviously the reaction by many is to go after the tool, right?

1255
01:08:44.391 --> 01:08:48.950
To go after the guns. Um, I don't think that's the right approach.

1256
01:08:48.951 --> 01:08:50.180
It's not, it's not, again,

1257
01:08:50.181 --> 01:08:52.820
it's not clear that that would actually solve the problem. There's, there's two,

1258
01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:56.870
there's two main requirements when you're, you're looking at a,

1259
01:08:57.250 --> 01:08:58.670
an approach to gun control. It's like,

1260
01:08:59.030 --> 01:09:01.970
does it infringe on law abiding citizens rights? Number one,

1261
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.950
what's the answer to that? And two,

1262
01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:07.580
is it going to actually affect the outcome that we're trying to affect?

1263
01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:10.520
Is it going to feel good or is it going to do good? Okay.

1264
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:13.760
And I think the vast majority of proposals, um,

1265
01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:15.620
failed both of those standards.

1266
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:19.070
They definitely infringed on law abiding citizens rights and they probably

1267
01:09:19.071 --> 01:09:22.880
wouldn't even solve the problem. You know, look at examples. Assault rifles.

1268
01:09:23.770 --> 01:09:26.870
[inaudible] well, Hey, RS. Okay. They're called assault rifles. They're really,

1269
01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:30.380
the reason they're in AR is because they're called ArmaLite. That's a brand. Um,

1270
01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:34.490
assault rifle is not a, is not a real thing. It's not a real definition.

1271
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:38.270
And um, but what if you banned them? Well,

1272
01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:41.270
rifles are responsible for less than 3% of all gun deaths.

1273
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:46.330
About 2.66% of all gun deaths. Okay. Hammers and knives, I think are, are,

1274
01:09:46.570 --> 01:09:50.930
are responsible for far more deaths. Um, so true. Yes.

1275
01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:54.110
Hammers and knives are responsible for more deaths and rifles.

1276
01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:57.380
Got statistics including AR back. Yeah. Yeah.

1277
01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:00.440
Rifles account for four, 2.6,

1278
01:10:00.441 --> 01:10:05.120
6% of controlling people with hammers. It's a good weapon. I guess.

1279
01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:09.230
I feel [inaudible] somebody has a hammer. If all you have is a hammer,

1280
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:12.050
we'll put it you have, you have a gun. Yeah. You have any, well,

1281
01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:15.410
even if you don't have a gun, like I could stop my hammer. Yeah.

1282
01:10:15.411 --> 01:10:19.430
But you're a pretty good fighter. Goddamn people on air. Well that's not true.

1283
01:10:19.431 --> 01:10:21.530
I can take away your AR if you're [inaudible], you know,

1284
01:10:21.531 --> 01:10:23.750
how close do you have to pay to do that? I just got to reach it.

1285
01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:27.110
It's very easy to take away an AR. Yeah. Yeah.

1286
01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:32.710
How easy. I just, I just need to get a hand on the barrel. You should,

1287
01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:36.420
can I use one or two? Every classes. Yeah, I know. I mean,

1288
01:10:36.421 --> 01:10:39.100
I've taken those classes. That's why I know it's so easy. It,

1289
01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:41.750
whoever controls the barrel of any gun controls the gun.

1290
01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:43.430
People don't quite realize that.

1291
01:10:43.431 --> 01:10:45.980
They think if they're gripping it then they control the gun. That's not true.

1292
01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:49.140
Right. Um, and we can get leads now. Yeah,

1293
01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:51.590
we're getting at the way that we can demonstrate that. Yeah. Afterwards.

1294
01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:56.600
So I have a flame thrower. Rub that. Yeah. No rifles in here.

1295
01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:59.480
Is that what that I was Ilan Muslim. Sure. What that was.

1296
01:10:59.570 --> 01:11:01.760
Are you going to take a picture with that later? Okay. Can I,

1297
01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:04.460
can I actually use it though? Yeah, we can turn it on.

1298
01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:07.390
As long as you don't cook the ceiling. Okay. But I can cook anything else. Yeah,

1299
01:11:07.391 --> 01:11:10.150
you'd be the only one who's ever turned it on here. Other than anyone.

1300
01:11:10.650 --> 01:11:13.130
It doesn't have to be in the room, but yeah, it does though.

1301
01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:16.140
Picture feeling in the room. Um,

1302
01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:19.980
so have you thought about this? I mean if you,

1303
01:11:19.981 --> 01:11:23.010
if you had a magic wand and they said, Hey Dan Crenshaw,

1304
01:11:23.011 --> 01:11:27.450
what can you do to solve this mass gun violence?

1305
01:11:27.451 --> 01:11:30.930
What can you do to solve these mass shootings? Yeah, I mean you have to,

1306
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:34.710
you have to target the source of them. It's just not an easy conversation.

1307
01:11:34.711 --> 01:11:38.190
Right. And so this let's also think about where these things started.

1308
01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:40.170
We're talking about the theatrical mass shootings.

1309
01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:42.330
There's a lot of statistics out there. They'll say we have hundreds of them,

1310
01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:45.240
you know, which include four or more deaths.

1311
01:11:45.241 --> 01:11:48.090
But these are usually gang violence. So gang violence is, it's a,

1312
01:11:48.150 --> 01:11:49.300
it's in a category, right?

1313
01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:53.790
Cause to believe there was 279 mass shooting so far this year. And some of them,

1314
01:11:53.791 --> 01:11:57.720
they do include gang violence. I think it's two or more.

1315
01:11:57.721 --> 01:12:01.110
Is that what it's deemed mass shootings? Yeah. It might be more.

1316
01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:05.100
Which is so fucking weird that we have a statistic. Well that doesn't count.

1317
01:12:05.101 --> 01:12:07.430
It's only [inaudible]. Yeah. Hey, I mean,

1318
01:12:07.450 --> 01:12:09.510
you gotta draw the line somewhere and you gotta, you gotta be able to, Anil,

1319
01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:12.570
if you're going to analyze it, you have to have to look into that. But the,

1320
01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:14.020
these theatrically, I think the,

1321
01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:17.920
the dramatize shootings at these that these guys are doing it,

1322
01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:21.600
it all started with Columbine and it's become this sort of copycat crime that

1323
01:12:21.601 --> 01:12:24.810
has occurred over time. And it like, we didn't have this before that.

1324
01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:28.770
And I think that's interesting. And I think it's something to take note of. Um,

1325
01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:34.290
and it, and it's not clear what you do about that. Um, you, you have to,

1326
01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:39.090
you don't have to look for signs, uh, people before they do it. And, uh,

1327
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:41.420
so one bill that I'm on, which is, there's this,

1328
01:12:41.610 --> 01:12:43.590
I've taken a lot of fire for it because if the people are just,

1329
01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:46.920
I think misunderstand what it actually is, is the taps act,

1330
01:12:46.921 --> 01:12:50.160
which is the threat assessment, uh, prevention and safety act.

1331
01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:55.290
All this does is give local law enforcement the ability to apply for grants to

1332
01:12:55.291 --> 01:12:56.610
get training and,

1333
01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:01.640
and behavioral threat assessment training and data analytical tools to identify

1334
01:13:02.251 --> 01:13:05.730
these threats beforehand. And people that are opposed to it,

1335
01:13:05.731 --> 01:13:10.080
they look at it like red flag laws, right? They combine those two quite a bit.

1336
01:13:10.081 --> 01:13:12.320
And that's just, it's just not, it's not true. I mean, the,

1337
01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:16.620
the taps act doesn't actually have anything to do with guns and red flag laws,

1338
01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:18.570
depending on how they're implemented,

1339
01:13:18.571 --> 01:13:23.571
could take someone who looks like they're a Radic or who has a pension for

1340
01:13:23.791 --> 01:13:27.930
violence and they will say, you do not have access to guns. Right. In theory,

1341
01:13:27.931 --> 01:13:30.930
that would, that would be how they work and, um, they, they would fill a gap.

1342
01:13:30.931 --> 01:13:32.580
I think it depends on the state.

1343
01:13:32.581 --> 01:13:35.970
Some States have all the ability they need to see threatening behavior and then

1344
01:13:35.971 --> 01:13:40.200
arrest that person. Uh, but it depends on criminal law within that state.

1345
01:13:40.230 --> 01:13:43.590
So I theoretically red flag I would, would fill, fill that gap.

1346
01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:47.880
The concern with red flag laws obviously is, is there really due process?

1347
01:13:47.881 --> 01:13:49.260
A lot of people hear that and they're like, okay,

1348
01:13:49.261 --> 01:13:51.960
that means my neighbor can tell on me and they're going to cut my guns the next

1349
01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:54.720
morning. Well, yeah, I mean if that's how the law was written, then yeah,

1350
01:13:54.721 --> 01:13:58.470
you better be against that. Cause that's a terrible law. Um, and, and,

1351
01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:01.530
and to be fair to a lot of the people who don't like red flag laws,

1352
01:14:01.531 --> 01:14:04.470
they see how these are written in a lot of States and in California has one.

1353
01:14:05.010 --> 01:14:07.710
And, uh, and they see how those are written and they say,

1354
01:14:07.711 --> 01:14:11.980
this doesn't protect due process. How can we possibly before this, um,

1355
01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:16.360
<v 2>thou, on the other hand, there hasn't been any cases where there's,</v>

1356
01:14:16.361 --> 01:14:20.500
there's been some obvious abuse of that law either. So, um, you know,

1357
01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.000
I've encouraged the conversation.

1358
01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:25.120
I think the conversation has to happen at the state level because every state

1359
01:14:25.121 --> 01:14:28.600
has different criminal law and that's where criminal law happens. It's a,

1360
01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:30.190
it does not happen at the federal level.

1361
01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:35.650
The only other controversial, uh, approach that I've heard is,

1362
01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:40.990
uh, putting armed police or soldiers at schools,

1363
01:14:41.530 --> 01:14:42.910
which is like that,

1364
01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:48.330
that seems incredibly disturbing to me to have people look,

1365
01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:50.050
I'm not opposed to it,

1366
01:14:50.230 --> 01:14:55.230
but it's disturbing to me that you would have to have someone standing by ready

1367
01:14:55.931 --> 01:15:00.820
for violence. Well, we have guards everywhere. Why not our schools? Um, we just,

1368
01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:05.230
cause we've never had them before and it's sort of signaling that we've reached

1369
01:15:05.231 --> 01:15:09.340
this point of impasse where we have to do something about it and we're not doing

1370
01:15:09.341 --> 01:15:11.080
anything to prevent these things from happening.

1371
01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:14.470
What we're doing is protecting the people that are going to be there when these

1372
01:15:14.471 --> 01:15:15.640
things happen. Yeah.

1373
01:15:15.710 --> 01:15:19.210
I think inner city schools have long had police presence there. So it's not,

1374
01:15:19.211 --> 01:15:21.730
it's not, I don't think it's totally new. Um, the idea,

1375
01:15:21.731 --> 01:15:24.460
and I think we could rapidly get used to it. Uh,

1376
01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:26.460
there's a good argument to be made that gun free zones are,

1377
01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:29.280
are the first thing that are attacked too. So, I mean, you know,

1378
01:15:29.410 --> 01:15:32.320
it's a counter intuitive response to this, but it's, it's true.

1379
01:15:32.321 --> 01:15:34.540
If I'm going to commit a terrible act,

1380
01:15:34.541 --> 01:15:36.490
I would of course you're going to go to the place where you know,

1381
01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:41.020
nobody's caring. You're not going to a gun show. Right? Uh, let's,

1382
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:44.470
you were just, just want to really, Leah, you're really looking for a fight. Um,

1383
01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:48.280
but that's, that's, there's some truth to that and it's, it's just hard.

1384
01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:51.190
It's so hard for people to have this conversation cause it's so emotion.

1385
01:15:51.490 --> 01:15:54.780
And there's a cultural Fisher here too. There's,

1386
01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:58.600
there's some people don't understand some people who like guns, right?

1387
01:15:58.780 --> 01:16:00.780
And there's a cultural divide there. Yeah.

1388
01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.620
And I just don't like people who like guns. That's,

1389
01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:05.830
we have to admit that's true. Well,

1390
01:16:05.831 --> 01:16:10.720
they'd have this idea of guns that guns bring violence and violent people want

1391
01:16:10.721 --> 01:16:13.990
guns. And that that's just not true.

1392
01:16:13.991 --> 01:16:16.930
And one of the things that people like to gloss over is how many people have

1393
01:16:16.931 --> 01:16:21.370
defended their life and defended the lives of their loved ones with guns in this

1394
01:16:21.371 --> 01:16:23.860
country every year. It happens all the time.

1395
01:16:23.890 --> 01:16:28.300
I've got a whole list of stats and examples that I actually read I could read to

1396
01:16:28.301 --> 01:16:29.350
you right now. Unfortunately,

1397
01:16:29.351 --> 01:16:32.290
one of the things that gets brought up during gun violence statistics and talk

1398
01:16:32.291 --> 01:16:35.590
about how many people die from firearms every year in this country.

1399
01:16:35.890 --> 01:16:40.420
They're also talking about people who defending their lives and defending the

1400
01:16:40.421 --> 01:16:41.350
lives of their loved ones.

1401
01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:45.670
People get their houses broken into all the time by armed criminals and they

1402
01:16:45.671 --> 01:16:49.870
shoot those people and they lay live to see another day and that person dies.

1403
01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:53.580
And that is the whole reason why people don't want to get rid of guns. Right.

1404
01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:55.660
And don't want to bring something up along those lines.

1405
01:16:55.661 --> 01:16:59.740
So it's far more likely in countries like great Britain that you'll get your

1406
01:16:59.741 --> 01:17:04.540
house broken into while you are there far more likely than in the United States.

1407
01:17:04.890 --> 01:17:07.810
Like by, by, by a good order of magnitude actually. So that,

1408
01:17:07.811 --> 01:17:10.130
that the why is that right? Because they know

1409
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:12.980
<v 1>that there is no gun in that house and you do that in Texas,</v>

1410
01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:16.400
there's a good chance there's a gun in that house. 100% yeah.

1411
01:17:16.401 --> 01:17:19.450
Even the liberals like [inaudible] if you don't have a gun, right?

1412
01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:22.880
Like the fight takes his mind. Yeah. I don't want out a gun. So,

1413
01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:25.460
so that's important. An interesting point. The other,

1414
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:28.250
the other good statistical analysis to do is, okay, well,

1415
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:32.570
when there's high amounts of concealed carry, what does that do to crime rates?

1416
01:17:32.571 --> 01:17:35.490
And the co-relation is there's less crime. Okay. Now,

1417
01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:38.000
now it's not fair to say that's a causation. That would be,

1418
01:17:38.290 --> 01:17:41.930
it would be intellectually dishonest, but it's an important co-relation to know.

1419
01:17:41.931 --> 01:17:44.300
It's also important to note, okay, per capita,

1420
01:17:44.301 --> 01:17:48.380
places like Switzerland and Israel have far, far more gun ownership than we do.

1421
01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:52.490
People don't realize that. Is that true? Oh yeah. I wouldn't switch.

1422
01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:54.530
I wouldn't come in here and lie to you then. I know,

1423
01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:58.750
but it was done as a ritual because of the, now,

1424
01:17:59.810 --> 01:18:01.790
now somebody would count are again, that's another, those are,

1425
01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:04.220
those are government weapons issue to people yet fine.

1426
01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:08.180
But they still are with the people, like the people have the guns. Okay.

1427
01:18:08.181 --> 01:18:08.720
And their dah, dah, dah.

1428
01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:10.710
At a rate higher than the United States thought they were.

1429
01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:13.510
And there's like over there. Yeah, but they are,

1430
01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:17.570
that's how they stay neutral so that they have almost no crime.

1431
01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:20.240
Almost no cry Israel to almost no crime. Um,

1432
01:18:20.241 --> 01:18:23.510
except for the obvious issues that Israel has in general with the Palestinian

1433
01:18:23.511 --> 01:18:25.940
Israeli conflict. But as it does a criminal act,

1434
01:18:25.941 --> 01:18:28.790
like they have very little crimes like this is interesting.

1435
01:18:28.791 --> 01:18:33.050
So you combine that with what we know about concealed carry data here in the

1436
01:18:33.051 --> 01:18:35.990
United States. You know, how do you solve this problem?

1437
01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:40.760
The other thing to think about is, um, the vast majority,

1438
01:18:40.761 --> 01:18:45.320
over 50% of all gun crime, it happens in like 2% of all counties.

1439
01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:48.410
So it's highly concentrated. You can, you can.

1440
01:18:48.650 --> 01:18:50.580
So as we look to solve this problem, like we,

1441
01:18:50.581 --> 01:18:52.880
we do have to really peel back some layers here.

1442
01:18:52.881 --> 01:18:56.930
Like who is committing the crime? Where is it happening? Why is it happening?

1443
01:18:57.860 --> 01:18:59.840
Um, you know, we can attack the tools, but it's just,

1444
01:18:59.841 --> 01:19:03.150
it's so far from self evident that that would work. Again, going back to a ours,

1445
01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:05.960
they're responsible for less than 3% of gun deaths. And also,

1446
01:19:06.170 --> 01:19:10.280
let's say you banned him. Are you actually stopping 3% of gun deaths? No.

1447
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:12.200
Cause why don't they just use another gun?

1448
01:19:12.710 --> 01:19:14.360
Why don't they use a different weapon? One of these,

1449
01:19:14.361 --> 01:19:18.260
a truck like they can use if they want to kill, they can kill the, the,

1450
01:19:18.261 --> 01:19:21.080
the horror that we're seeing is that they like to kill this way.

1451
01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:25.250
And maybe that's like, why is that? And again, I go back to Columbine,

1452
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:27.260
it all started with that. And that's interesting.

1453
01:19:27.261 --> 01:19:30.680
We should look at that and like what is driving people to like that? Well,

1454
01:19:30.681 --> 01:19:35.030
I think there are a lot of people, I mean if you look at mass shootings,

1455
01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:37.850
a lot of these people, when you read their description,

1456
01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:41.240
they're very disenfranchised, a very angry.

1457
01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:45.830
And when you're disenfranchised and very angry, there's like an archetype,

1458
01:19:45.831 --> 01:19:46.101
right?

1459
01:19:46.101 --> 01:19:50.000
There's an image that you have in your mind of shooting all these people that

1460
01:19:50.001 --> 01:19:53.780
wronged you. I mean, this is a, it goes back to our victimhood conversation.

1461
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.880
Sure. Yeah. Blame somebody else. Well,

1462
01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:59.690
and then the real conversation is how many of these people are on psychotropic

1463
01:19:59.691 --> 01:20:01.190
drugs and what are those,

1464
01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:04.780
what are those drugs and what are the effects those drugs have on people? Well,

1465
01:20:04.781 --> 01:20:08.070
when you look at the numbers, it's fucking stunning. Whether

1466
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:11.790
<v 2>it's antianxiety medications or SSRI or eyes or amphetamines,</v>

1467
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:16.870
or whether it's whatever they're on that alters the chemical frequency or the

1468
01:20:18.721 --> 01:20:19.021
camera,

1469
01:20:19.021 --> 01:20:23.340
the the biological structure of your brain in terms of like what chemicals are

1470
01:20:23.341 --> 01:20:24.980
in there, serotonin, dopamine,

1471
01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:30.540
these speeds that so many kids are on Adderall and various types of speed.

1472
01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:35.340
That stuff radically changes the way you look at the world. Yeah.

1473
01:20:35.790 --> 01:20:40.790
How many of those drugs contribute or are a factor in these mass killings?

1474
01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:46.500
I don't know if correlation equals causation,

1475
01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:51.330
but I do know the correlation is phenomenally high. Yeah. I mean,

1476
01:20:51.331 --> 01:20:54.380
I think it's on the viral, this homes, things like that. Sure. Let's,

1477
01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:58.830
let's start analyzing it. Bullying in cells, which is a new word,

1478
01:20:59.370 --> 01:21:03.090
involuntary. Celibates. Do you know about that? Huh? He didn't know about that.

1479
01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:07.440
I taught you about Intel's, you just did thing. Yeah.

1480
01:21:07.441 --> 01:21:11.760
There's whole groups online on message boards that they can't believe they can't

1481
01:21:11.761 --> 01:21:15.350
get laid and then they just go voluntary, involuntary signs.

1482
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:17.380
They're just guys who can't get laid. Yeah, that's,

1483
01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:20.850
that's just a fancy word for that. You know? Let's not call them losers.

1484
01:21:20.851 --> 01:21:22.360
That's what makes them crazy. If there's a game,

1485
01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:25.260
there's winners and losers and that, uh,

1486
01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:29.520
high school football quarterback is banging all the cheerleaders,

1487
01:21:29.521 --> 01:21:33.270
that guy's a winner. It sucks. That's true.

1488
01:21:34.110 --> 01:21:37.190
But you know, unfair. Yeah, it is unfair. You know, I'm,

1489
01:21:37.191 --> 01:21:39.990
I'm hoping genetic engineering fixes all that future,

1490
01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:44.730
but this is what you're dealing with a lot of times as these,

1491
01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:47.790
these guys have got a really shitty roll the dice and that there's no other way

1492
01:21:47.791 --> 01:21:51.900
to describe it. They, they'd got handed a terrible hand of cards, right.

1493
01:21:51.930 --> 01:21:56.930
And some of 'em are pilled up and angry and abused and they have access to guns.

1494
01:21:57.601 --> 01:22:01.860
And then next thing you know, there's a mass shooting. Right? And then again,

1495
01:22:01.861 --> 01:22:03.270
going back to the victim of a conversation, they,

1496
01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:04.950
maybe they did wear a Delta bad hand,

1497
01:22:04.951 --> 01:22:07.620
but they have to tell themselves the wrong story about why that is and who's to

1498
01:22:07.621 --> 01:22:09.360
blame. And uh, it's,

1499
01:22:09.361 --> 01:22:12.750
it's that narrative just seeps within them and it creates this, I mean,

1500
01:22:12.990 --> 01:22:15.870
the driveway, right? I is when Bernie Sanders was on here,

1501
01:22:15.871 --> 01:22:17.430
there was one thing I thought I agreed with him on,

1502
01:22:17.431 --> 01:22:20.490
which is we have to look at the effects of these drugs and like really what they

1503
01:22:20.491 --> 01:22:23.130
are. I don't see anything wrong with that. I think that's true.

1504
01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:25.590
It's amazing how much blow back you get from that.

1505
01:22:25.591 --> 01:22:28.650
And it's by people that want to look at the guns. They just want to say no, no,

1506
01:22:28.651 --> 01:22:31.860
no. Why are you talking about psychotropic drugs? It's the guns. No,

1507
01:22:31.861 --> 01:22:33.450
I'm talking about the guns too. I mean,

1508
01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:36.600
I don't necessarily think that really angry,

1509
01:22:36.601 --> 01:22:39.360
volatile people that have criminal records should have guns.

1510
01:22:39.361 --> 01:22:43.020
I think they shouldn't. Right. So the guns are already out loud. Yes we do.

1511
01:22:43.290 --> 01:22:46.260
And we probably should, you know,

1512
01:22:46.350 --> 01:22:49.440
have some understanding of who you are before we give you a gun.

1513
01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:53.160
The real question is what is that understanding and how do we go about doing

1514
01:22:53.161 --> 01:22:57.040
that and how do we keep people from making these incredibly rigid rules? I mean,

1515
01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:58.530
particularly regionally, right?

1516
01:22:58.531 --> 01:23:03.120
If you have a States that decide to have incredibly rigid rules that Procruit

1517
01:23:03.150 --> 01:23:05.350
most people from having guns. Yeah.

1518
01:23:05.790 --> 01:23:10.510
That can be possible if they just devise their own tests and you're honest about

1519
01:23:10.511 --> 01:23:12.520
your perspectives on things. And that's

1520
01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:16.330
<v 0>the fear. And it's an honest fear to have a, because, yeah. What is the limit?</v>

1521
01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:18.370
You know, if you're on psychotropic drugs sheets,

1522
01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:22.150
you be barred from having weapons. Of course not, uh, you know,

1523
01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:23.573
[inaudible] and how do you,

1524
01:23:24.190 --> 01:23:27.610
how do you manage that and know the way we do it now again,

1525
01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:30.160
you have to have committed a crime of some sorts. And there's,

1526
01:23:30.161 --> 01:23:34.290
there's other things too. A, if you abuse medication, if you abuse, uh,

1527
01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:39.190
yeah, medication, then I think you're also thinking according to federal law,

1528
01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:42.400
like you're, you're, you're barred from, from, from owning that, you know,

1529
01:23:42.401 --> 01:23:45.850
that's in the system. Uh, I think dishonorable discharge from the military,

1530
01:23:45.851 --> 01:23:46.720
things like that. So there's,

1531
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:50.160
there's already a lot of standards that actually precludes you from,

1532
01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:54.310
from buying a weapon. And, uh, there's a, there's a,

1533
01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:58.510
there would be a very vigorous debate on how you add more standards to that

1534
01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:01.540
<v 2>dishonorable discharge keeps you from buying a weapon. That's what I've read.</v>

1535
01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:04.360
We can fact check that. But that's interesting. I didn't know that one.

1536
01:24:04.361 --> 01:24:05.560
I thought you had to have a felony.

1537
01:24:07.230 --> 01:24:10.170
<v 4>Hmm. Maybe, um, maybe it makes sense,</v>

1538
01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.290
<v 2>but it's, there's no answers. And this is the,</v>

1539
01:24:13.291 --> 01:24:17.040
the thing that domestic abuse too I came up with from, is there something Jamie?

1540
01:24:17.550 --> 01:24:18.383
Yeah,

1541
01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:25.060
it's honorable discharge and N F a. What's an NFA firearm?

1542
01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:29.530
NFA refers to the national firearms act.

1543
01:24:29.730 --> 01:24:34.090
So that's what ban like automatic weapons based on a general court martial

1544
01:24:34.091 --> 01:24:34.631
conviction.

1545
01:24:34.631 --> 01:24:38.650
A person who was convicted of a crime that is punishable by imprisonment for

1546
01:24:39.010 --> 01:24:40.150
more than one year,

1547
01:24:40.151 --> 01:24:44.460
including dishonorable discharge is prohibited from threats from, yes. Okay.

1548
01:24:44.890 --> 01:24:46.030
That's what it is. So it is true.

1549
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:50.570
<v 0>So if you're imprisoned, not just to dispute, is that it would be, it would.</v>

1550
01:24:50.850 --> 01:24:54.280
There's a lot of people dishonorably discharged the public, not, not,

1551
01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:56.020
not violently. You know, they're not violent.

1552
01:24:56.420 --> 01:25:00.050
<v 2>What's disturbing talking to you? Talking to Bernie, talking to Tulsi,</v>

1553
01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:03.300
talking to everybody and nobody has a solution. I mean,

1554
01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:06.120
we'll all the brightest minds that are thinking about this all the time.

1555
01:25:06.630 --> 01:25:08.820
No one has one thing that makes sense.

1556
01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:12.160
<v 0>This gets to a very deep question about what are key,</v>

1557
01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:14.450
and I think I've briefly touched on this before,

1558
01:25:14.451 --> 01:25:17.930
like why does government exist and what are we capable of solving and what needs

1559
01:25:17.931 --> 01:25:19.970
to be solved by ourselves. You know,

1560
01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:24.350
they're there in what is just inherent to human nature and it's evil and we hate

1561
01:25:24.351 --> 01:25:28.790
it and we don't want it to be there, but it is. And w and is it,

1562
01:25:28.810 --> 01:25:31.910
is it appropriate for us to scream to our politicians and say, save us?

1563
01:25:32.450 --> 01:25:36.560
And sometimes it is, sometimes we can solve and we should try. But we have to,

1564
01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:40.790
we have to do it with some kind of constrained vision as Thomas soul would put

1565
01:25:40.791 --> 01:25:45.140
it about what is possible and then let's be reasonable about what is possible.

1566
01:25:45.570 --> 01:25:48.110
And, and, and, and hit those two categories. I said,

1567
01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:52.520
are we infringing on the rights of everyone, uh, for the sake of doing this?

1568
01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:55.830
And second, is it going to actually solve the problem?

1569
01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:57.680
And those are very important questions.

1570
01:25:57.690 --> 01:26:01.580
And if we don't frame the debate within those, I think we're, we're, we're,

1571
01:26:01.850 --> 01:26:04.010
we're not doing, we're not justice to the, to

1572
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:06.230
<v 1>the problem itself. True. But again,</v>

1573
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:11.270
no one seems to have any logical course,

1574
01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:15.230
any logical, clear path. Like, this is how we are going to reduce gun violence.

1575
01:26:15.530 --> 01:26:17.750
This is how we're going to stop mass shootings. I mean,

1576
01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:22.810
other than arming all these public places, I was in Rome recently, and, uh,

1577
01:26:22.850 --> 01:26:25.940
when you go there, it's fucking stunning. This military vehicles,

1578
01:26:25.941 --> 01:26:29.300
guys with dawns just strapped, ready to rock,

1579
01:26:29.330 --> 01:26:33.020
just standing by all over the place. And I was like, I used to be that way.

1580
01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:38.240
It didn't. And I was like, wow, this is a very, uh, it's,

1581
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:41.720
you know, you were trying to enjoy yourself when you're on vacation.

1582
01:26:41.721 --> 01:26:44.250
You're checking all, all these ancient buildings and then you're like, Oh,

1583
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:48.500
look at fucking guns, military tank. I'll get that, you know? Yeah.

1584
01:26:48.530 --> 01:26:52.460
And it's w I wish it wasn't that way. Yeah. You know,

1585
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:57.740
and uh, it, but again, like w, you know, you're right. We don't, we don't,

1586
01:26:57.770 --> 01:27:00.050
we haven't come up with perfect solutions.

1587
01:27:00.051 --> 01:27:03.020
We have some ideas that I think would mitigate these threats and we mean we've

1588
01:27:03.021 --> 01:27:06.740
discussed those at length. Um, but none of them seem tangible.

1589
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:08.240
Everything seems like just talk,

1590
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:12.230
well the taps act that I talked about I think is perfectly tangible. Again,

1591
01:27:12.231 --> 01:27:15.290
it's not a, they won't solve everything, but it mitigates something.

1592
01:27:15.570 --> 01:27:19.820
I think armed security at schools I think certainly mitigates things as far as

1593
01:27:19.821 --> 01:27:22.510
school safety goes. So no, I don't, I don't, I don't,

1594
01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:25.150
I don't think it's just talking. I think those are tangible things and I,

1595
01:27:25.210 --> 01:27:28.370
I think they're perfectly reasonable. Um, you know,

1596
01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:32.900
when people just are so reluctant to think that we need armed guards at school

1597
01:27:32.901 --> 01:27:37.310
and I understand it and I'm thinking about it myself more so really what it's

1598
01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:40.400
going to take. Cause armed guards at school, I went to high school in Bogota,

1599
01:27:40.401 --> 01:27:44.630
Columbia, so we had armed like a lot of armed guards at our school.

1600
01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:48.760
It's not foreign tomato oil.

1601
01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:52.950
No oil oil petroleum engineer. Yeah. So we moved to,

1602
01:27:52.951 --> 01:27:57.260
my life growing up was between Houston and overseas, back and forth.

1603
01:27:57.310 --> 01:28:02.000
That'd be very bizarre. Yeah, it was fun. I mean, I don't regret a minute of it.

1604
01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:05.260
That can be hard at times. I'm moving around a lot. Vanish.

1605
01:28:05.930 --> 01:28:08.660
They used to be better. It's not bad. I'll do an interview in Spanish,

1606
01:28:08.661 --> 01:28:12.020
so it's not really, it's not bad by any means, but it's not great.

1607
01:28:12.710 --> 01:28:16.460
So you can go into a taco and hang out. I totally hang, I speak,

1608
01:28:16.461 --> 01:28:19.220
I speak really well. Conversational Spanish, my Spanish,

1609
01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:23.210
it's harder when I'm talking complex policy issues because I didn't learn that

1610
01:28:23.211 --> 01:28:28.130
kind of Spanish. Right, right, right. So, but yeah, I had pretty good. Um,

1611
01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:31.910
one of the things that you said that you disagreed with Bernie on was lobbyists.

1612
01:28:32.150 --> 01:28:33.940
Oh yeah. Yeah. Well, w well,

1613
01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:37.400
I disagree with his notion that everything is attributable to some kind of

1614
01:28:37.401 --> 01:28:39.110
corporate greed and therefore lobbyists.

1615
01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:42.050
It's just not the source of our problems. It's,

1616
01:28:42.051 --> 01:28:44.390
it contributes to it in some ways. For sure. I mean, these are not,

1617
01:28:44.690 --> 01:28:47.390
these are selfish actors. They, they, they have a role, right?

1618
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:50.570
They're advocating for a specific thing. Um,

1619
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:55.860
but I think politicians like to point to them is like the, the, the book Nate,

1620
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:56.940
the Nia, the boogie man.

1621
01:28:57.050 --> 01:29:01.920
Let's just blame them for everything that I have not,

1622
01:29:01.921 --> 01:29:04.020
that is not been my experience. That what hasn't,

1623
01:29:04.110 --> 01:29:07.380
it has not been my experience that these lobbyists of any kind of excessive

1624
01:29:07.381 --> 01:29:12.120
control over politicians. I just don't see that. Okay. They, you know, they,

1625
01:29:12.121 --> 01:29:17.030
the corporate PAC can give you $5,000. That's it. I mean this isn't, this isn't,

1626
01:29:17.031 --> 01:29:20.490
not in no way, shape or form can they buy anybody off? Um,

1627
01:29:20.491 --> 01:29:22.920
it's also very transparent form of doing things.

1628
01:29:23.090 --> 01:29:25.890
Is this other talking point that it's all dark money. That's just not true.

1629
01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:28.650
The corporate pack is a group of people who work for a corporation.

1630
01:29:28.651 --> 01:29:31.560
They pulled their money together. They can't use company profits. Just be clear.

1631
01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:34.950
This is personal money and they have limits on what they can donate to that own

1632
01:29:34.951 --> 01:29:35.700
pack.

1633
01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:38.340
And then they use that to advocate for whatever's important to that business.

1634
01:29:38.341 --> 01:29:40.880
And I tell people, where do you work? I'll ask you where,

1635
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:44.040
what industry are you in? It'll give me whatever industry, and I'll say,

1636
01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:47.850
you definitely have a pack lobbying for you on Capitol Hill. All right.

1637
01:29:47.851 --> 01:29:50.190
And they'll, and they'll just point out bills. They'll say, listen,

1638
01:29:50.191 --> 01:29:52.350
this is problematic in this one. This would hurt our workers,

1639
01:29:52.351 --> 01:29:56.470
this would do this and put us out of business. Like don't do that. It's it. Um,

1640
01:29:56.550 --> 01:30:00.060
you know, and so the other, they're selfish actors don't get me wrong,

1641
01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:02.460
like they're, this is where they're advocating for their thing,

1642
01:30:02.910 --> 01:30:07.460
but that's also our democracy. Individuals can donate more now.

1643
01:30:07.530 --> 01:30:12.450
And so an individual cap is $2,800 to up to a campaign and then a couple like

1644
01:30:12.451 --> 01:30:16.800
you and your wife, we can double that. Okay. So the same as a pack.

1645
01:30:16.830 --> 01:30:20.260
It's basically the same. It's only $5,000 ish. Yup.

1646
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:22.500
That's the maximum that is the maximum.

1647
01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:27.560
But there's also influence that comes with that on top of financial,

1648
01:30:28.650 --> 01:30:33.650
there's also influence in terms of just cronyism and people reciprocating

1649
01:30:34.770 --> 01:30:37.890
getting along with each other and working, you know,

1650
01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:42.210
establishing longterm relationships where they agree on things and they make

1651
01:30:42.211 --> 01:30:45.870
deals and they make deals that might not necessarily be in the best interest of

1652
01:30:45.871 --> 01:30:50.220
people like deals in terms of like what businesses get subsidies,

1653
01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:53.430
what businesses don't get subsidies, what things get negotiated,

1654
01:30:53.431 --> 01:30:55.440
what don't what like here's a perfect example.

1655
01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:58.350
Exactly the way I think we should have a less powerful government that can't be

1656
01:30:58.470 --> 01:31:00.090
bought off like that. You know,

1657
01:31:00.270 --> 01:31:03.720
you won't get married if you want government cause cronyism certainly happens.

1658
01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:06.870
Right? And they'll say listen, like does, you know, in, in, in who can,

1659
01:31:06.930 --> 01:31:10.110
who can lobby as the bigger, the bigger companies. So there's,

1660
01:31:10.290 --> 01:31:13.290
there's some agreement here, but it's,

1661
01:31:13.291 --> 01:31:16.020
I think there's this somewhat misunderstanding of what's really happening.

1662
01:31:16.021 --> 01:31:19.190
So yeah, a big business can,

1663
01:31:19.191 --> 01:31:22.870
can lobby and then the last for more regulation, so, and,

1664
01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:25.470
and then who does that really hurt? It hurts their smaller competitors.

1665
01:31:25.471 --> 01:31:29.130
So the answer is actually the who's at fault here.

1666
01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:33.260
It's the fact that government's trying to excessively regulate so much and it,

1667
01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:37.440
and it creates, it creates a situation where there's no longer competition.

1668
01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:41.880
Okay. And then that's a, that's a real problem now. Um, you know,

1669
01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:44.220
that excessive influence though, again, it's,

1670
01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:48.690
it's not something I've seen because there's a lot of competition for influence.

1671
01:31:48.691 --> 01:31:52.350
Anybody can come to your office and they all, they all disagree, right?

1672
01:31:52.351 --> 01:31:54.750
There's all these different interests that they actually compete with one

1673
01:31:54.751 --> 01:31:58.170
another and then they represent different interests. So it's not,

1674
01:31:58.710 --> 01:32:00.070
it's not self evident to me

1675
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:04.830
<v 0>that that influences is, it's certainly not bought. And, uh, and, and I,</v>

1676
01:32:04.831 --> 01:32:07.510
I don't, I don't necessarily believe it's excessive either.

1677
01:32:07.511 --> 01:32:09.190
It's just not what I've seen. Maybe they don't,

1678
01:32:09.250 --> 01:32:10.760
maybe they just don't come to me. Well,

1679
01:32:12.330 --> 01:32:16.320
<v 3>when I think it was Northwestern university did a study recently where they</v>

1680
01:32:16.321 --> 01:32:16.650
were,

1681
01:32:16.650 --> 01:32:21.650
they showed the public support for policies and public support for,

1682
01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:27.830
for for bills and how low the public support is in comparison to things that get

1683
01:32:28.921 --> 01:32:33.921
passed and how when the public wa it was things that the public absolutely

1684
01:32:35.461 --> 01:32:36.240
wanted,

1685
01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:39.930
like across the board had something in the range of a 30% chance of getting

1686
01:32:39.931 --> 01:32:40.764
passed through.

1687
01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:45.690
Whereas there's many things that the public absolutely did not want across.

1688
01:32:45.691 --> 01:32:50.040
The board also had a 30% chance of getting through and they were talking about

1689
01:32:50.041 --> 01:32:54.450
the various influences that lead to these policies getting passed.

1690
01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:58.440
Now the argument is that your rep, your, you're electing representatives,

1691
01:32:58.441 --> 01:33:02.850
those representatives don't do you justice and pass bills and,

1692
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:07.260
and enact policies that would help your community and help you.

1693
01:33:07.530 --> 01:33:08.850
Then you let them out of office,

1694
01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:14.240
but the damage gets done while they're there and the idea is that these people

1695
01:33:14.491 --> 01:33:16.590
would then go on from there.

1696
01:33:16.591 --> 01:33:20.640
Once they've established that influence and once they've helped these people get

1697
01:33:20.641 --> 01:33:22.650
jobs in the corporate sector,

1698
01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:27.680
get jobs that represent what they've done for those corporations while they were

1699
01:33:29.471 --> 01:33:31.590
a representative supposedly of the people.

1700
01:33:31.970 --> 01:33:33.350
<v 0>Yeah, I think that's a,</v>

1701
01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:37.270
you're gonna have to really dig into like what issue they're talking about.

1702
01:33:37.290 --> 01:33:40.130
What issues not supported by the public. I mean, I, that's, I,

1703
01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:42.800
you'd have to unpack those statistics I think to really understand what's

1704
01:33:42.801 --> 01:33:46.360
happening there. The, but I also,

1705
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:49.790
I think that's too cynical of a way to look at politicians. I just don't,

1706
01:33:49.791 --> 01:33:52.850
I don't feel that way about my colleagues on the left or the right. Well,

1707
01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:56.550
how long have you been a Congressman? Seven months. So I just, and my, my,

1708
01:33:56.600 --> 01:34:00.200
like nine months in, they start coming to you may, maybe no, we meet with them.

1709
01:34:00.201 --> 01:34:02.450
It's just like, they just, they don't have this influence, you know,

1710
01:34:02.451 --> 01:34:06.230
they're not, I mean, listen, they, they present one, they, one,

1711
01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:10.970
they generally meet with the lobbyist that they already agree with you. Um,

1712
01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:15.200
and they're generally bringing up very minute things that are,

1713
01:34:15.230 --> 01:34:18.870
that you just wouldn't ever know about if they didn't bring that to you. Well,

1714
01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:21.770
there's some bills that get passed like that. Don't like, here's one,

1715
01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:22.601
<v 3>right? Medicaid,</v>

1716
01:34:22.601 --> 01:34:27.460
Medicaid spends billions of dollars on drugs for the elderly and people that

1717
01:34:27.461 --> 01:34:30.280
can't afford them billions of dollars. But by law,

1718
01:34:30.310 --> 01:34:33.430
the government's not allowed to negotiate the price of those drugs.

1719
01:34:34.110 --> 01:34:38.490
<v 0>Okay. So the price negotiations, how did that happen? Well,</v>

1720
01:34:39.450 --> 01:34:44.220
it, how did it happen? It's, well, it never, it was never a thing to begin with.

1721
01:34:44.221 --> 01:34:45.270
So the,

1722
01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:48.660
there's an argument to made that the government should be able to negotiate

1723
01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:51.970
prices. Right? The question is what is the price and the,

1724
01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:55.440
and the other thing you have to point out is there's already a strong force

1725
01:34:55.441 --> 01:34:57.980
against the pharmaceutical industry, which is the insurance

1726
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:01.520
<v 1>companies because they have an interest in making sure that price is as low as</v>

1727
01:35:01.521 --> 01:35:02.061
possible.

1728
01:35:02.061 --> 01:35:05.480
They're fighting all the time against the pharmaceutical companies and the

1729
01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:08.240
healthcare industry. All of these groups are often pitted against each other.

1730
01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:11.960
And then as politicians, we kind of look at all of them and we say, all right,

1731
01:35:11.961 --> 01:35:14.930
what are your arguments? What are your arguments? Um,

1732
01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:16.790
w is what you're saying really makes sense.

1733
01:35:16.791 --> 01:35:19.400
And then we have to make those decisions based on the overall good,

1734
01:35:19.401 --> 01:35:22.340
but you're going to piss everybody off when you do that. Like that's,

1735
01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:23.990
especially with healthcare cause all of these,

1736
01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:25.580
a lot of these groups are pitted against each other.

1737
01:35:25.581 --> 01:35:29.190
So you've got insurance already pitted against pharmacy. Um,

1738
01:35:29.770 --> 01:35:31.400
and then it becomes a pretty good question.

1739
01:35:31.401 --> 01:35:33.770
Like what is government's role there? Cause I've, I've,

1740
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:37.280
when I first looked at this problem, I said, yeah, yeah, just negotiate.

1741
01:35:37.550 --> 01:35:41.770
Well that makes sense. Um, I learned a lot more. I learned a lot more and,

1742
01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:45.410
and it's not because I met with any lobbyists. It has nothing to do with that.

1743
01:35:45.411 --> 01:35:48.380
It's because I meet with healthcare professionals and experts who know this

1744
01:35:48.381 --> 01:35:50.990
issue really well and economists who,

1745
01:35:51.190 --> 01:35:54.440
and it's very far from self evident that this would work and it's far from self

1746
01:35:54.441 --> 01:35:58.760
evident that would be beneficial, uh, at all and actually make a difference.

1747
01:35:58.761 --> 01:35:59.241
You know, when we,

1748
01:35:59.241 --> 01:36:01.910
when we look at the differences in healthcare spending between us and other

1749
01:36:01.911 --> 01:36:05.390
countries, uh, the drug prices actually have very little to do with them.

1750
01:36:06.010 --> 01:36:08.090
They're able to negotiate those, but they also get,

1751
01:36:08.150 --> 01:36:10.580
they also get last choice for medicine. Okay.

1752
01:36:10.581 --> 01:36:12.060
When you look at great Britain and Canada,

1753
01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:15.680
that they're not getting the premiere new drugs like we have in the United

1754
01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:16.580
States. Um,

1755
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:20.210
we get screwed as Americans because the patent laws are not enforced in these

1756
01:36:20.211 --> 01:36:24.550
other countries. So our pharmacy, our pharmaceutical companies, um,

1757
01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:28.550
they immediately get ripped off in other countries and that, that's a problem.

1758
01:36:28.551 --> 01:36:29.380
You know, how do we fit that?

1759
01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:31.940
So that should be something we think get ripped off in that they've done the

1760
01:36:31.941 --> 01:36:35.570
research to create these drugs and these other companies in the other countries

1761
01:36:35.950 --> 01:36:37.670
to just copy these, draw and make generics.

1762
01:36:37.810 --> 01:36:41.540
Yet because they have socialized medicine and their obligation is to provide

1763
01:36:41.541 --> 01:36:44.420
medicine to the people. So their obligations to,

1764
01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:46.820
they don't care about these copyrights,

1765
01:36:46.821 --> 01:36:48.680
they just care about getting medicine to the people. Now,

1766
01:36:48.681 --> 01:36:53.450
some people would argue that that is in favor of the population in favor of the

1767
01:36:53.451 --> 01:36:56.330
people that need healthcare. I would argue it's not sustainable though.

1768
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:57.171
It might make it feel good,

1769
01:36:57.171 --> 01:36:59.450
but it's not going to do good in the long run because it's still a profit.

1770
01:36:59.750 --> 01:37:01.780
Even if they're there, they're having,

1771
01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:03.750
they're profiting because they're charging America. Well,

1772
01:37:04.110 --> 01:37:06.750
America is basically paying for this. Right, okay. Which is, which is why it's,

1773
01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:09.830
which is why it's important for like trade agreements to say, Hey,

1774
01:37:09.831 --> 01:37:13.350
you guys have to enforce the same patent laws that we have otherwise, this,

1775
01:37:13.410 --> 01:37:17.390
this is not sustainable situation because eventually you don't make a profit.

1776
01:37:17.450 --> 01:37:20.090
Right. Right. And that's, and that's not fair for Americans.

1777
01:37:20.091 --> 01:37:23.420
So the new NAFTA deal was negotiated this way. The U S MCA,

1778
01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:27.260
like addressing some of these concerns, for instance. Uh, and that's,

1779
01:37:27.261 --> 01:37:29.330
that's the right thing to do. Like you ha you have to,

1780
01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:33.350
you have to align a set incentives when you're talking about any policy and we

1781
01:37:33.351 --> 01:37:36.980
have to dig a few layers. It's never as simple as Bernie Sanders says it is.

1782
01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:39.770
It never is. He always makes it out to be so simple. That's greed.

1783
01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:41.720
Everything is attributable to greed.

1784
01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:44.590
Everything is attributable to the 1% they own you. They, they,

1785
01:37:44.591 --> 01:37:47.420
they own the lobbyists, they own all this. Listen,

1786
01:37:47.450 --> 01:37:50.750
there's elements of truth in all of that, but what my point is,

1787
01:37:50.751 --> 01:37:52.350
it's just not the overarching thing.

1788
01:37:52.850 --> 01:37:56.970
There's so much more complexities to that and we have to have those

1789
01:37:57.060 --> 01:38:00.070
conversations and like we're just, we're, we're, we're,

1790
01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:03.510
instead what we see is just very extreme talking points. First of all,

1791
01:38:03.511 --> 01:38:08.511
very extreme interpretations of the actual problem and therefore leading to very

1792
01:38:08.971 --> 01:38:10.910
extreme solutions to that problem, right?

1793
01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:13.350
If you say the world's ending in 12 years, then why not have a green new deal?

1794
01:38:13.890 --> 01:38:14.723
Right? Like it's a,

1795
01:38:14.730 --> 01:38:18.930
you're operating off of a premise that is highly extreme and, uh, and it just,

1796
01:38:18.931 --> 01:38:22.740
it's not, it's not healthy political discourse. It's meant to an animate people.

1797
01:38:22.741 --> 01:38:25.510
It's meant to get people upset and to have a villain. Again,

1798
01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:29.100
it always comes back to the villain and the oppressor and oppressed.

1799
01:38:29.250 --> 01:38:31.050
It always comes back to this. Everything.

1800
01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:33.450
Everything's somebody like Bernie Sanders says,

1801
01:38:33.451 --> 01:38:37.410
can be traced to this specific ideology where one person is to blame or one

1802
01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:38.460
institution is to blame.

1803
01:38:38.461 --> 01:38:41.760
And I think that's extremely unhealthy way to look at things.

1804
01:38:41.761 --> 01:38:43.020
And also intellectually dishonest.

1805
01:38:43.110 --> 01:38:45.630
I don't know the parameters of a green new deal,

1806
01:38:45.631 --> 01:38:48.780
the new green deal or whatever the fuck it is, but you hear it all the time.

1807
01:38:48.990 --> 01:38:53.520
What, what is the idea behind this? Uh, at its core,

1808
01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:58.750
a, a complete shift to wind and solar, uh, at its core. So, uh,

1809
01:38:59.550 --> 01:39:01.350
an idea that if you do that, you will,

1810
01:39:01.351 --> 01:39:04.170
you will have zero emissions in the next 10 years.

1811
01:39:04.830 --> 01:39:06.090
But it's an obsession with wind and solar,

1812
01:39:06.091 --> 01:39:08.310
which I think is interesting in band's nuclear.

1813
01:39:08.450 --> 01:39:11.220
We remember when the talking points came out from the green new deal didn't like

1814
01:39:11.221 --> 01:39:12.870
nuclear. So that's how, you know,

1815
01:39:12.871 --> 01:39:16.110
it's not an actual environmental plan or at least, uh,

1816
01:39:16.111 --> 01:39:18.630
associated with carbon emissions and climate change.

1817
01:39:18.630 --> 01:39:20.910
Because why would you ban the,

1818
01:39:20.930 --> 01:39:24.420
the one reliable piece of energy that we have that has zero emissions,

1819
01:39:24.421 --> 01:39:26.670
which is nuclear. So, you know, it's not about that.

1820
01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:30.210
It also includes free healthcare for everybody. It includes free college.

1821
01:39:30.211 --> 01:39:30.960
So it's like,

1822
01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:34.110
it's like every socialist plan wrapped into one and then they call it an

1823
01:39:34.111 --> 01:39:38.670
environmental plan and ban fossil fuels and things like that.

1824
01:39:38.671 --> 01:39:42.880
So that's a fundamentally what it is. It's a wishlist of, of things like that.

1825
01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:47.430
Well, nuclear has this inherent fear of things going wrong. Chernobyl. Yeah.

1826
01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:49.620
You know, there is shame and that kind of stuff.

1827
01:39:49.621 --> 01:39:53.280
We also put nuclear reactors on like submarines and put a bunch of people on

1828
01:39:53.281 --> 01:39:56.040
them and you go down to depths and put torpedoes and stuff on them.

1829
01:39:56.041 --> 01:40:00.750
So I mean it's sure whelming very safe amount of nuclear energy that's been used

1830
01:40:00.751 --> 01:40:04.050
in this country versus the amount of times we've had nuclear disasters.

1831
01:40:04.050 --> 01:40:09.050
And there's also the problem with these old systems that weren't like Fukushima

1832
01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:13.470
that were implemented in the 1960s and 1970s they just, they're not as good.

1833
01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:18.110
Yeah, we just, that's true. But we, we do have the technology to make them good.

1834
01:40:18.410 --> 01:40:18.920
And,

1835
01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:22.560
and I think we should look at ways to research more the miniaturized mountain

1836
01:40:22.561 --> 01:40:25.620
modular nuclear devices that are, that are being looked at in nuclear car.

1837
01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:28.560
Maybe we can get you, Oh shit. I don't have them yet.

1838
01:40:29.140 --> 01:40:31.350
You should have a nuclear card judge. You have a nuclear cars.

1839
01:40:31.351 --> 01:40:36.220
What about a nuclear one's lame thrower. Now we're getting crazy. Um,

1840
01:40:36.630 --> 01:40:40.110
so then the new green deals just wind and solar.

1841
01:40:40.170 --> 01:40:42.570
It concentrates on just windmills and solar.

1842
01:40:42.571 --> 01:40:46.140
And then the idea is to replace the grid with some sort of mean California.

1843
01:40:46.141 --> 01:40:47.760
It seems like it could be possible.

1844
01:40:47.761 --> 01:40:50.760
Like you could just put solar panels on everybody's roof in California.

1845
01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:55.450
You'd probably reduce the amount of that we need from the grid radically.

1846
01:40:56.380 --> 01:41:00.400
Yeah. It gets complicated because you don't have sun at night. And, uh,

1847
01:41:00.430 --> 01:41:03.730
and so this is the complication of wind and solar in general, is that the,

1848
01:41:03.790 --> 01:41:07.780
you need battery backup to really make this work and that technology just isn't

1849
01:41:07.781 --> 01:41:11.570
there. Um, the theoretical, it's just not there. I mean we would,

1850
01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:14.380
we mean you'd have, you'd have to off the grid with solar power. Right.

1851
01:41:14.381 --> 01:41:18.350
But you to make this, uh, to do that. But when they don't, like I said,

1852
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:21.200
when there is no sun, the plants shift to either, you know,

1853
01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:24.730
natural gas or coal or something else. Here, this is a perfect example.

1854
01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:27.820
Like here, this is a goofy place to live cause it doesn't rain.

1855
01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:31.810
We have sun every day but not at night. And so, so this is,

1856
01:41:31.811 --> 01:41:35.770
but 12 hours sun is enough will only if you have the batteries,

1857
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:38.370
only if you other the batteries to store it. And so yeah, in theory if you,

1858
01:41:38.371 --> 01:41:41.110
if you, that we did and we don't right now, like for if you actually,

1859
01:41:41.111 --> 01:41:43.810
if you want to, if you want to shift the entire energy grid to that,

1860
01:41:43.811 --> 01:41:48.340
we do not have this, the massive amounts of, there's some good data on this.

1861
01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:50.080
I don't have it off the top of my head. It's massive.

1862
01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:53.650
It is massive amount of batteries and farms to actually hold that.

1863
01:41:54.010 --> 01:41:57.520
There's an energy density problem with wind and solar is the physics problem.

1864
01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:01.240
So the science can only go so far and even the theoretical limit to how much a

1865
01:42:01.241 --> 01:42:05.170
battery can hold probably were, which were not even we haven't discovered yet,

1866
01:42:05.171 --> 01:42:08.950
but it's a theoretical like capacity of a battery, uh,

1867
01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:12.320
it would still make it very difficult to actually do this. And so it's,

1868
01:42:12.570 --> 01:42:14.650
it's just not realistic. Uh,

1869
01:42:14.651 --> 01:42:19.090
also also there's other consequences to wind and solar, like massive, you know,

1870
01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:20.920
solar term or wind turbines. Okay.

1871
01:42:20.921 --> 01:42:23.980
Those are some people don't like those things. Uh,

1872
01:42:24.010 --> 01:42:27.370
massive amounts of space needed for, for, for solar.

1873
01:42:27.371 --> 01:42:29.670
And also where are you going to get that? That the, the, the,

1874
01:42:29.671 --> 01:42:32.140
the special materials needed for solar panels. Like there's,

1875
01:42:32.590 --> 01:42:36.670
there's other consequences to this. Um, and it's, it's,

1876
01:42:36.671 --> 01:42:40.300
it's not self evident that that's the only possible way to do it. It's not,

1877
01:42:40.301 --> 01:42:41.950
it's not like we should shun it. Okay.

1878
01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:46.090
Then nobody's saying that it should we advocate for all the above approach.

1879
01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:50.290
If our goal is less carbon emissions than we need to be focusing on 100% of

1880
01:42:50.291 --> 01:42:52.870
carbon emissions, meaning the world's carbon emissions,

1881
01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:56.380
the green new deal focuses on 15% of carbon emissions. Basically says,

1882
01:42:56.381 --> 01:43:00.250
let's kneecap the United States economy will a will destroy fossil fuels,

1883
01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:02.140
will have a utopian society full of wind and solar,

1884
01:43:02.141 --> 01:43:04.600
even though the batteries don't exist to make that work. But Hey,

1885
01:43:04.601 --> 01:43:05.470
we'll make it work.

1886
01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:09.760
So then that then that's all is 15% of the problem and has almost no effect on,

1887
01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:12.970
on the actual climate. So when I say 100% of the problem,

1888
01:43:13.090 --> 01:43:14.860
what I'm saying is technological innovation,

1889
01:43:14.861 --> 01:43:16.360
whether it's nuclear or carbon capture,

1890
01:43:16.361 --> 01:43:21.280
if the goal is less carbon than let's actually focus on carbon capture.

1891
01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:24.040
So I just dropped a bill, uh, Senator Cornyn did on the,

1892
01:43:24.041 --> 01:43:29.041
on the Senate side called the leading act and it basically re repurposes grant

1893
01:43:30.161 --> 01:43:33.640
funds in the department of energy to focus on carbon capture for natural gas

1894
01:43:33.641 --> 01:43:36.940
plants. So we have natural gas plants in Texas that are zero emissions.

1895
01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:41.030
They take in natural gas, they operate the facility, they create electricity,

1896
01:43:41.090 --> 01:43:43.900
and then they recapture that carbon and they power the facility with it.

1897
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:48.580
Zero emissions. So if our goal is zero emissions, let's do what works.

1898
01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:51.890
And also by the way, that plant can keep going. Matter. What does that matter?

1899
01:43:51.891 --> 01:43:54.320
What time of day it? I didn't know that that existed. That's amazing.

1900
01:43:54.530 --> 01:43:58.040
Call net power. We talked about something on the podcast before. Just as a joke.

1901
01:43:58.041 --> 01:44:01.250
I was saying, why don't they just make a giant building but make an air filter?

1902
01:44:01.850 --> 01:44:06.070
Like a huge building the size of an air filter but a carbon capture. Yeah,

1903
01:44:06.290 --> 01:44:09.530
huge air filter. The size of a building. But apparently they're doing that.

1904
01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:13.400
Apparently China is in the process of building things like that.

1905
01:44:13.890 --> 01:44:16.760
I've heard of some things in China to think [inaudible] because they have an air

1906
01:44:16.761 --> 01:44:20.660
pollution problem that's different from carbon. Okay.

1907
01:44:20.661 --> 01:44:22.880
So like cause carbon dioxide, you're breathing it right now.

1908
01:44:22.881 --> 01:44:24.890
You're not polluting it, right, necessarily.

1909
01:44:24.891 --> 01:44:27.110
So they've got a different problem and they're just a mess. And so I,

1910
01:44:27.111 --> 01:44:30.170
that might be what they're doing. But the co on the carbon capture side,

1911
01:44:30.171 --> 01:44:31.190
it's definitely happening.

1912
01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:34.220
It's all the oil companies actually doing it because there's actually an

1913
01:44:34.221 --> 01:44:37.070
interest in the oil and gas industry to reduce carbon emissions.

1914
01:44:37.071 --> 01:44:38.340
There's a huge interest. I mean they,

1915
01:44:38.341 --> 01:44:41.780
they realize where the conversation is going and we should encourage that.

1916
01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:42.081
You know?

1917
01:44:42.081 --> 01:44:47.000
So there's pretty impressive big projects going on by a lot by a lot of these by

1918
01:44:47.001 --> 01:44:51.200
a lot of these folks. So your take is that what the green new deal is? I mean,

1919
01:44:51.201 --> 01:44:52.460
if I can encapsulate it, your, the,

1920
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:57.470
the green new deal is basically more of an emotional plea to people that are

1921
01:44:57.591 --> 01:45:02.591
worried about the future and that sea wind and solar as being free and clean

1922
01:45:03.921 --> 01:45:08.360
alternatives. It's a dogmatic approach to this. It's not based in,

1923
01:45:08.361 --> 01:45:09.620
makes people feel good. It's a,

1924
01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:11.880
it's a feel good thing and it really shouldn't make them feel good,

1925
01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:15.200
but just evolved consequences I said about, well, wind and solar, it's not,

1926
01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:18.320
these aren't necessarily clean by themselves.

1927
01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:21.080
It also involves conflict minerals, right. That you need for these,

1928
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:23.600
that's what I was getting at too. Yeah. Like w where do you,

1929
01:45:23.601 --> 01:45:26.600
where do you mind these things? It's not, it's not the United States.

1930
01:45:26.601 --> 01:45:30.020
It's not the United States where we have child labor laws. Janice Stans,

1931
01:45:30.021 --> 01:45:31.290
the Congo is a lot,

1932
01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:35.060
a lot of places that have these good intentions often lead to bad things.

1933
01:45:35.061 --> 01:45:36.470
So look at the ethanol issue.

1934
01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:39.860
When we decided that we wanted ethanol in our gasoline, well I think it was,

1935
01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:41.540
I want to say it's Indonesia and Malaysia,

1936
01:45:41.541 --> 01:45:46.310
but they cleared tons and tons of forest to, to make room,

1937
01:45:46.690 --> 01:45:50.360
um, so that they could so that they could, uh, produce the ethanol oil.

1938
01:45:50.730 --> 01:45:54.950
All right. Carbon emissions there increase rapidly because of that, you know,

1939
01:45:54.951 --> 01:45:58.280
all because of our good intentions and like these incentives in the second third

1940
01:45:58.281 --> 01:46:00.650
order effects, they matter. And we have to think about them when we're,

1941
01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:03.080
when we're talking about policy and if our goal again,

1942
01:46:03.081 --> 01:46:05.090
is if our goal is less emissions than let's,

1943
01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:07.220
let's be thoughtful about how we approach that.

1944
01:46:07.250 --> 01:46:10.490
Let's not decide on a solution and then look for reasons to back up that

1945
01:46:10.491 --> 01:46:12.350
solution. Um,

1946
01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:17.440
is there any other things that are on the horizon that makes sense in terms of

1947
01:46:18.141 --> 01:46:20.210
trying to mitigate all of the,

1948
01:46:20.211 --> 01:46:23.480
the problems that we have with carbon emissions in this country? Like is there,

1949
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:27.310
is there anything else that people were working on? Uh, I listed a lot on the,

1950
01:46:27.311 --> 01:46:30.590
the carbon capture technology I think is the most promising because it's

1951
01:46:30.591 --> 01:46:32.750
profitable. You can sell carbon. Oh there's a lot.

1952
01:46:32.751 --> 01:46:35.660
There's a big market for carbon so they can use it in cities.

1953
01:46:35.690 --> 01:46:38.750
Like can they use it other places other than plants.

1954
01:46:38.751 --> 01:46:41.750
Like you were talking about the natural gas plants, you want to focus,

1955
01:46:41.780 --> 01:46:44.810
you want to focus something like carbon capture on the places that admit the

1956
01:46:44.811 --> 01:46:49.720
most carbon. This, that's why it's generally focused on the, the,

1957
01:46:49.721 --> 01:46:50.910
the plants themselves.

1958
01:46:50.910 --> 01:46:54.690
I think so like something like net power just makes the most sense. Um,

1959
01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:58.600
yeah. So I, I think that's still the, the right way to go. The,

1960
01:46:58.601 --> 01:47:02.250
the other natural gas too. So here's another statistic.

1961
01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:04.260
The department of energy has done a study on this.

1962
01:47:04.261 --> 01:47:08.730
If D replaced coal burning plants and are the boilers coal burning boilers in

1963
01:47:08.731 --> 01:47:10.230
China, in India with natural gas,

1964
01:47:10.231 --> 01:47:13.320
meaning we have all the natural gas in the world. By the way, in Texas,

1965
01:47:13.321 --> 01:47:17.370
like we can export it for decades to come. It's far cleaner than,

1966
01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:22.050
than oil and coal. If you just replaced the China's India's boilers,

1967
01:47:22.051 --> 01:47:24.660
you'd reduce, you'd reduced emissions by 40%.

1968
01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:29.550
Like the reason the United States has reduced emissions by I think by 15% since

1969
01:47:29.551 --> 01:47:31.140
the year 2000 it's because of,

1970
01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:34.380
it's largely because of the national natural gas boon that the fracking

1971
01:47:34.381 --> 01:47:37.290
business, because it's so much cleaner than,

1972
01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:40.230
than these other technologies and it's profitable and it worked.

1973
01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:43.920
But when you say fracking, eat immediately red flag. Right.

1974
01:47:44.190 --> 01:47:47.370
I saw that movie gas land people are lighting their water on fire.

1975
01:47:48.010 --> 01:47:52.230
Like there's obviously consequences to natural gas extraction through fracking

1976
01:47:52.231 --> 01:47:56.300
as well, including earthquakes. Yeah, it's pretty rare. And on all the,

1977
01:47:56.330 --> 01:47:59.160
all of these factors have to combine for an earthquake to actually happen.

1978
01:47:59.161 --> 01:48:02.430
And then also the technology has progressed a huge amount, like I said,

1979
01:48:02.630 --> 01:48:05.910
to radically increase the amount of earthquakes in places like Oklahoma just

1980
01:48:05.911 --> 01:48:07.050
because of fracking. Yeah.

1981
01:48:07.110 --> 01:48:09.300
And they decided that fracking did have something to do with that,

1982
01:48:09.301 --> 01:48:11.370
but they've also figured out how to make sure that doesn't happen.

1983
01:48:11.610 --> 01:48:14.220
How do they make sure I don't, I don't know that I don't know the details.

1984
01:48:14.221 --> 01:48:17.520
I just know well, there's just ways to do it. Like there's, in the early days,

1985
01:48:17.521 --> 01:48:18.810
I think there were some problems that the Senate,

1986
01:48:18.811 --> 01:48:21.780
the water setting on fire that had nothing to do with fracking as it turned out

1987
01:48:21.781 --> 01:48:25.250
that that was debunked. Something else, some kind of methane emission.

1988
01:48:25.460 --> 01:48:29.220
It wasn't, wasn't related to the fracking. If I, if I recall, uh, how,

1989
01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:32.010
how that conversation ended up playing out the,

1990
01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:34.750
that seems like a big factor. I mean,

1991
01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:39.120
I feel like we should know what fucked up factor was. I mean, I, I would,

1992
01:48:39.150 --> 01:48:43.230
I wouldn't, I, I would say to people like, you know, fracking happens a lot.

1993
01:48:43.231 --> 01:48:47.400
It's, it's, the technology has moved on quite a bit. Uh,

1994
01:48:47.401 --> 01:48:48.950
it's pretty safe. And there's also,

1995
01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:52.110
there's more than the initial implementation of it where they weren't really,

1996
01:48:52.111 --> 01:48:55.200
yeah. Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't argue that it was perfect, you know,

1997
01:48:55.201 --> 01:48:57.870
and I know that it was associated with some earthquakes,

1998
01:48:57.871 --> 01:49:02.340
but there was a lot of other factors, you know, specific to that place.

1999
01:49:02.570 --> 01:49:05.070
Like there's nowhere, there's not earthquakes in Texas that I'm aware of.

2000
01:49:05.530 --> 01:49:08.490
And that's where we have in West Texas where we have fried most of this fracking

2001
01:49:08.491 --> 01:49:12.480
going on. So I mean just people should know like nuclear power,

2002
01:49:12.481 --> 01:49:13.590
like the old plants.

2003
01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:16.110
They really didn't know what they were doing and they made some big mistakes.

2004
01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:20.100
I think it's probably like any technology, but I would still want to point out,

2005
01:49:21.050 --> 01:49:25.390
uh, it's, it caused a huge decrease in emissions. You know, and if we're,

2006
01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:28.770
and again, it's over. If we're looking to decrease emissions,

2007
01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:31.480
why don't we focus on things that work and,

2008
01:49:31.490 --> 01:49:35.190
and you have to hook people on went by people, I mean the world,

2009
01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:39.300
especially developing countries that don't care about our dogmatic approach to

2010
01:49:39.301 --> 01:49:42.180
wind and solar, they never will. And uh,

2011
01:49:42.270 --> 01:49:46.200
but what can you do to help them get energy to keep their people out of poverty

2012
01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:48.100
and cause that's what they care

2013
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:51.560
<v 0>about, uh, in a way that's reliable and cheap and market based.</v>

2014
01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:53.450
Cause the only thing that's sustainable is market-based.

2015
01:49:53.530 --> 01:49:56.830
Sustainability is an important term here. And I, and I mean that,

2016
01:49:56.831 --> 01:49:59.020
not in the sense of like environmental sustainability,

2017
01:49:59.021 --> 01:50:00.340
although we are saying the same thing.

2018
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:04.750
I mean it in terms of what policy will last and what will implode.

2019
01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:08.740
It's an important question and it's one reason I'm a Republican because our

2020
01:50:08.741 --> 01:50:10.600
policies, they don't feel good.

2021
01:50:10.630 --> 01:50:13.900
They're not based on emotional reasoning but they are based on realistic

2022
01:50:13.901 --> 01:50:16.930
reasoning and sustainability of that policy and this is,

2023
01:50:16.931 --> 01:50:20.320
this is a case like that and if you don't and take into account market forces

2024
01:50:20.321 --> 01:50:22.900
and incentives and just I think basic human nature,

2025
01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:27.040
then we're not doing justice to the problem itself. Now,

2026
01:50:27.250 --> 01:50:29.410
one of the big issues that's in the news

2027
01:50:29.490 --> 01:50:32.010
<v 3>right now is the trade war with China.</v>

2028
01:50:32.190 --> 01:50:37.190
I mean this is a huge issue and it's made me dive into a lot of a really weird

2029
01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:45.560
stuff with Walway and with the Chinese government's involved in and various

2030
01:50:46.711 --> 01:50:51.711
corporations and it's a hard concept to grasp for the average American citizen

2031
01:50:53.131 --> 01:50:57.570
that the corporations in China are an extra [inaudible] connected to the

2032
01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:01.470
communist government and that this is they, they work hand in hand,

2033
01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:03.060
they do the bidding of the government,

2034
01:51:03.090 --> 01:51:06.210
they work together even though they are profitable, radically profitable.

2035
01:51:06.660 --> 01:51:11.190
They also do things specifically at the bidding of the government,

2036
01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:15.120
including inserting shit that can allow people to spy on people,

2037
01:51:15.121 --> 01:51:19.080
which is why they're banning Walway devices. And this is a,

2038
01:51:19.260 --> 01:51:22.500
and it all comes back to what you were talking about earlier to an intellectual

2039
01:51:22.501 --> 01:51:26.190
copyright with a, in terms of pharmaceutical drugs,

2040
01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:28.260
the same thing could be said about electronics.

2041
01:51:28.380 --> 01:51:31.950
I mean there's entire Apple stores in China that have nothing to do with Apple.

2042
01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:35.700
They don't even, they just make their own stuff and call it Apple stuff.

2043
01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:38.620
Thieves. Yeah. It's very strange. Right. What,

2044
01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:42.630
what do you think about this sort of like tug of war that's going on right now

2045
01:51:42.930 --> 01:51:44.940
that we're seeing play out publicly?

2046
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:46.663
<v 0>Well, I,</v>

2047
01:51:46.970 --> 01:51:49.970
I think that Chinese deserve every bit of it for all the reasons you just

2048
01:51:49.971 --> 01:51:50.570
stated.

2049
01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:54.140
Their intellectual property theft is rampant and it has been for a very long

2050
01:51:54.141 --> 01:51:54.471
time.

2051
01:51:54.471 --> 01:51:58.370
And we've been in this position where our business community doesn't want to

2052
01:51:58.371 --> 01:52:01.190
bash them too bad because they want that market to be opened up and they'll,

2053
01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:01.700
and they'll,

2054
01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:05.360
there'll be very conciliatory to whatever the Chinese want a in order to get

2055
01:52:05.361 --> 01:52:08.940
openings to that market. And, uh, you know, this is the,

2056
01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:13.190
and Trump is the first to really saying, no, this is the enough is enough. Um,

2057
01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:15.810
I've, I've, and so while I'm [inaudible],

2058
01:52:15.890 --> 01:52:16.631
<v 3>I'm sorry to interrupt you,</v>

2059
01:52:16.631 --> 01:52:18.710
but you think that's because he's the first person that actually has a

2060
01:52:18.711 --> 01:52:21.170
background in business, like real big business.

2061
01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:25.930
<v 0>That could be it, that could be at I, I don't, I don't know why exactly,</v>

2062
01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:27.780
but I know he's doing it. So yeah,

2063
01:52:28.370 --> 01:52:31.990
he's been talking about this for a very long time. This isn't new to him.

2064
01:52:32.050 --> 01:52:35.320
Talking about this in the 90s. He was, yeah. And, uh,

2065
01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:40.660
and I, I'm not overly sympathetic to trade Wars, especially with our allies.

2066
01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:44.080
And I was happy to see us getting to a deal with Canada and Mexico.

2067
01:52:44.081 --> 01:52:47.270
I don't see a point in, in strong arming them,

2068
01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:50.090
but with China I'm much more sympathetic to it. And uh,

2069
01:52:50.091 --> 01:52:52.610
and I think that that should largely be bipartisan.

2070
01:52:52.750 --> 01:52:55.690
And you don't even see Democrats slamming Trump too much for this. Uh,

2071
01:52:55.850 --> 01:52:58.370
but there are consequences. And so I,

2072
01:52:58.470 --> 01:53:00.860
I would like the president to be more forthright about, listen,

2073
01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:03.260
we are going to feel some pain too because when you implement tariffs,

2074
01:53:03.261 --> 01:53:05.600
you're affecting people's supply chains. And when you do that,

2075
01:53:05.601 --> 01:53:07.850
you're hurting American businesses too. Right?

2076
01:53:07.900 --> 01:53:09.680
There has to be a reason for that. Okay.

2077
01:53:09.681 --> 01:53:12.680
And the reason is the Chinese are bad actors and we are,

2078
01:53:12.710 --> 01:53:15.020
we are in sort of an economic cold war with them.

2079
01:53:15.410 --> 01:53:18.050
The Chinese think in 50 year terms, we think in four year terms,

2080
01:53:18.051 --> 01:53:20.930
they have a huge advantage in the sense they have union advantage that they can

2081
01:53:20.931 --> 01:53:23.810
prop up their businesses and, and, and, and, and,

2082
01:53:23.811 --> 01:53:25.930
and put forth their belt and road initiatives and,

2083
01:53:25.931 --> 01:53:30.170
and made in China 2025 I think is, might be getting that wrong.

2084
01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:32.690
But you know, they can,

2085
01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:37.340
they can manipulate public opinion to encourage those status policies.

2086
01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:40.550
And there's disadvantages to that too. It means they're much less dynamic.

2087
01:53:40.551 --> 01:53:43.010
The fact that they steal everything means they'll never be competitive.

2088
01:53:43.250 --> 01:53:46.730
They're not truly a great, you know, great nation,

2089
01:53:46.731 --> 01:53:48.890
the way they're making themselves out to be because they're thieves.

2090
01:53:49.310 --> 01:53:52.870
And I think we should point that out. But we are in this cultural war with them.

2091
01:53:52.900 --> 01:53:56.870
We are in this economic cold war with them. And that's, that's,

2092
01:53:56.871 --> 01:53:59.630
that's nothing new, but it is coming to the forefront.

2093
01:53:59.690 --> 01:54:03.170
And so we gotta be careful. I would prefer, you know,

2094
01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:04.790
we take fights to the WTO.

2095
01:54:04.820 --> 01:54:07.760
We actually have a good history of being successful in the WTO against the

2096
01:54:07.761 --> 01:54:12.220
Chinese. Uh, and we go after singular companies like Walway, uh,

2097
01:54:12.221 --> 01:54:15.710
that w that would, I would like to see that. Um, you know, again,

2098
01:54:15.711 --> 01:54:18.620
I'm sympathetic to the tariffs, but they do hurt us. They hurt us.

2099
01:54:18.621 --> 01:54:22.520
There are a lot of people in my district, Texas is a, a good, uh,

2100
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:26.060
competitive market. We do well when there's free competition.

2101
01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:29.360
And so we tend to want more free trade and more free competition cause we know

2102
01:54:29.361 --> 01:54:33.040
we can handle it. Uh, so, so when there's not that it, it,

2103
01:54:33.110 --> 01:54:36.380
it can tend to hurt because we have very complex supply chains throughout the

2104
01:54:36.381 --> 01:54:36.651
world.

2105
01:54:36.651 --> 01:54:40.040
And then we have to take note of that what seems like a game of chicken almost.

2106
01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:42.680
[inaudible] yeah, that's what it seems like back and forth.

2107
01:54:42.681 --> 01:54:46.790
It's like who's going to blink? It is like that. Yeah. That's so crazy.

2108
01:54:47.050 --> 01:54:51.980
Then international business gets done and it seems so bizarre to a dummy like me

2109
01:54:51.981 --> 01:54:54.590
sitting on the sidelines going, what are these guys doing? And there's,

2110
01:54:54.591 --> 01:54:58.070
there's no playbook that tells you exactly how you should go forth with this.

2111
01:54:58.130 --> 01:55:02.660
And they just, you know, and so, um, there's,

2112
01:55:02.661 --> 01:55:06.350
this isn't, um, and um, it makes it harder.

2113
01:55:06.670 --> 01:55:10.130
You've got to take a lot of things into account and have a good end goal in

2114
01:55:10.131 --> 01:55:13.550
mind. And I think, I think we could do a better job of having that. But, um,

2115
01:55:13.580 --> 01:55:16.880
but in the end, I think, again, as a holistically,

2116
01:55:16.881 --> 01:55:18.950
I'm more sympathetic to being hard on the Chinese.

2117
01:55:19.550 --> 01:55:23.820
I'm realizing as we're talking that I never really a continued my thoughts on

2118
01:55:23.950 --> 01:55:25.280
the censorship in the media.

2119
01:55:25.281 --> 01:55:29.420
And I wanted to know what you think could be done in terms of how,

2120
01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:30.860
how you could stop,

2121
01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:35.210
particularly conservative voices from being silenced on social media and what

2122
01:55:35.330 --> 01:55:39.320
can be done. Do you think that like government regulation should be enacted?

2123
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:43.980
Like what, what should be done to stop? Cause there's a bunch of stuff that's

2124
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:48.050
<v 1>gone on behind the scenes shadow banning and you know, you don't,</v>

2125
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:51.090
what do you think about that? So there uh,

2126
01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:55.740
Senator Holly is looking at some legislation in the Senate on this and it, it,

2127
01:55:56.230 --> 01:55:59.160
and I want to get in too much detail cause I don't wanna screw up the exact

2128
01:55:59.161 --> 01:55:59.881
details of this,

2129
01:55:59.881 --> 01:56:04.881
but it essentially gets at section two 30 which provides protections for,

2130
01:56:06.750 --> 01:56:10.350
uh, internet platforms, right? Like you can't be sued for liable.

2131
01:56:10.351 --> 01:56:15.300
Like whatever you post on Facebook is not Facebook's fault. Okay. So that's,

2132
01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:19.230
it protects them in a way [inaudible] and as it should frankly.

2133
01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:21.090
Cause how could it be Facebook's fault? Like,

2134
01:56:21.091 --> 01:56:24.540
if you have a crazy comment on your YouTube videos that your fault,

2135
01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:28.650
they were trying to enact that for a while there they released something saying

2136
01:56:28.651 --> 01:56:32.100
that we had to be in charge of the comments on our page. Remember that?

2137
01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:34.350
It's crazy. Jamie and I talked about it. I was like,

2138
01:56:34.351 --> 01:56:36.750
we're just going to shut the comments down cause otherwise we're going to go to

2139
01:56:36.751 --> 01:56:39.050
jail. Yes, it's fucking crazy.

2140
01:56:39.090 --> 01:56:42.930
People are constantly posting nutty things, right? And they're like,

2141
01:56:43.010 --> 01:56:45.270
and why is it a YouTube fall? Why is it your fault? Exactly.

2142
01:56:45.271 --> 01:56:48.210
You know you were going to be response where, where's the blame lie?

2143
01:56:48.211 --> 01:56:52.350
And so like that's, that's why off of that. So as they should. So that's,

2144
01:56:52.351 --> 01:56:54.960
that's that conversation is the conversation of what is the platform,

2145
01:56:54.961 --> 01:56:58.260
what does a publication, because you can see the New York times, right? If they,

2146
01:56:58.261 --> 01:57:00.030
if they publish something that you don't like. Okay.

2147
01:57:00.031 --> 01:57:04.230
So the problem we're seeing is that Facebook, in Twitter,

2148
01:57:04.260 --> 01:57:06.170
they're acting like both. They're getting,

2149
01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:07.680
they're trying to get the best of both worlds,

2150
01:57:07.681 --> 01:57:09.480
where they're this like open platform,

2151
01:57:09.810 --> 01:57:12.930
but then they can also decide and kind of act like a publisher and decide what

2152
01:57:12.931 --> 01:57:15.930
kind of content is allowed on that platform. And the,

2153
01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:20.490
and the problem is the standards they're using are utterly vague and IM and

2154
01:57:20.491 --> 01:57:23.670
subjective and then politically biased obviously.

2155
01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:25.890
And so like that's a real problem. And so I think,

2156
01:57:26.190 --> 01:57:29.280
I think this legislation might get at kind of removing that protection and

2157
01:57:29.281 --> 01:57:31.870
basically allowing someone to say, Hey, you're being libelous.

2158
01:57:32.730 --> 01:57:34.560
And once that incentive is there, it's like, okay,

2159
01:57:34.590 --> 01:57:39.210
there's a better incentive now to say we are a pure platform. Uh,

2160
01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:39.990
you know, we'll,

2161
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:44.310
we have to have much stronger standards in the sense of clearer standards.

2162
01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:46.980
You know, maybe it's a word that you don't allow, I don't know,

2163
01:57:46.981 --> 01:57:49.950
but at least be specific. Cause right now it's like, you know,

2164
01:57:49.951 --> 01:57:52.100
they define hate speech in the Vegas terms possible.

2165
01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:54.510
And then they moved the boundaries all the time.

2166
01:57:54.511 --> 01:57:57.300
Like now you can get banned for life or dead naming someone,

2167
01:57:57.450 --> 01:57:58.620
which means like if I,

2168
01:57:58.621 --> 01:58:01.440
if I wrote something about Bruce general is cute in these heels.

2169
01:58:01.710 --> 01:58:05.940
If I wrote that I could get deadname banned for life from Twitter.

2170
01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:09.240
Like literally if I write Bruce Jenner looks cute and these heels, Oh,

2171
01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:12.150
because he's not personally, I understand him. His son called him,

2172
01:58:12.151 --> 01:58:15.690
he hilarious and that uh, whoops, one of the, what was it?

2173
01:58:16.250 --> 01:58:20.250
The Hills and the Hills came back. Oh yeah, he's, yeah, his son is on,

2174
01:58:20.251 --> 01:58:23.820
I think it took a lot of heat for it cause he called his dad and he said my dad

2175
01:58:23.970 --> 01:58:28.230
when he became one, what the fuck is dad? What's he supposed to say?

2176
01:58:28.231 --> 01:58:32.910
That's his actual dad. I told him, I don't know, but that's where we've,

2177
01:58:32.911 --> 01:58:35.220
we've entered into this cuckoo land. You know,

2178
01:58:35.221 --> 01:58:38.460
you can get banned for life for deadnaming. But again, OJ Simpson,

2179
01:58:38.490 --> 01:58:42.160
hello Twitter world. Yeah. You know, fucking kills people and he's on there.

2180
01:58:42.490 --> 01:58:45.040
No violation in terms of, we looked at the terms of service,

2181
01:58:45.041 --> 01:58:46.390
it seems like you're fine. Mr. Simpson,

2182
01:58:46.391 --> 01:58:50.350
please rant about politics in the draft NFL draft and we want to hear your,

2183
01:58:50.660 --> 01:58:55.300
your, your pics. I don't follow him. They're gay. It's fucking awesome. Well,

2184
01:58:55.330 --> 01:58:59.110
Stan hope and I had an idea of way back when we were, uh, hosting the man show.

2185
01:58:59.111 --> 01:59:02.800
We had this idea to have OJ Simpson. This is after he got acquitted,

2186
01:59:02.890 --> 01:59:07.600
the man show we were going to Brown spots and we were going to have OJ Simpson

2187
01:59:07.690 --> 01:59:10.510
and wrap up every episode like Mickey Rooney. You know,

2188
01:59:10.511 --> 01:59:14.610
Mickey Rooney sorta gives his, wow. Why is toothpastes always come at tube?

2189
01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:17.470
You remember that making Rooney's little Mickey Rooney.

2190
01:59:17.471 --> 01:59:22.090
What the fuck's his name? Andy Rooney. Andy Rose. He was the actor,

2191
01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:26.560
but Andy Rooney would, uh, we were going to have him. OJ Simpson.

2192
01:59:26.590 --> 01:59:30.850
Just give some sort of down-home anecdote at the end of every episode.

2193
01:59:31.230 --> 01:59:34.870
Sorta tie everything up and let you know that this fucking show is bananas.

2194
01:59:35.140 --> 01:59:37.750
But then the whole murderer thing. No, the burger thing was before.

2195
01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:42.220
This was way after the murderer thing. This isn't like 2002. Okay. But then,

2196
01:59:42.820 --> 01:59:45.940
you know, they, the comedy central shot it down,

2197
01:59:45.941 --> 01:59:50.470
but now you can actually get that on Twitter. I mean that is what he's doing.

2198
01:59:50.670 --> 01:59:53.520
He's, he's intending like, you never murdered anybody. Right.

2199
01:59:53.530 --> 01:59:56.800
And he's just a hello Twitter world and he's doing this thing. Well,

2200
01:59:56.801 --> 02:00:00.550
I mean made ads. It's not clear to me that we should ban him. You know,

2201
02:00:00.551 --> 02:00:04.900
like why, why would we cause cause again, right. Let's again,

2202
02:00:04.930 --> 02:00:09.070
free speech is a very specifically protected thing and it matters to us.

2203
02:00:09.110 --> 02:00:13.570
This is the question, is it free speech when it's a company that owns,

2204
02:00:13.630 --> 02:00:15.340
they own this platform,

2205
02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:19.270
should they be allowed to create their own rules?

2206
02:00:19.450 --> 02:00:21.940
Because this is what Twitter's done. This is what Facebook's done.

2207
02:00:21.940 --> 02:00:22.960
This is what Instagram has done.

2208
02:00:22.990 --> 02:00:27.710
They've created their own rules as to what is and what is not acceptable. Yeah.

2209
02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:28.390
And that, that's,

2210
02:00:28.390 --> 02:00:32.710
that's the heart of the question because we've never dealt with this because the

2211
02:00:32.711 --> 02:00:36.340
first amendment was always created to protect you from government infringing on

2212
02:00:36.341 --> 02:00:36.880
your speech.

2213
02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:39.820
Because we always assumed that government would be the only thing powerful

2214
02:00:39.821 --> 02:00:43.120
enough to actually infringe on your free speech. Right? We never,

2215
02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:46.120
we forgot about this other world that we now live in. We didn't forget about it,

2216
02:00:46.121 --> 02:00:50.080
we just didn't know about it. Where there are other entities that have very,

2217
02:00:50.110 --> 02:00:53.860
very powerful abilities to actually infringe on your free speech.

2218
02:00:54.430 --> 02:00:58.360
And it's, but like you said, they are private entities.

2219
02:00:58.361 --> 02:01:01.570
And so is it really up to government to tell the private entity,

2220
02:01:01.780 --> 02:01:05.440
are we enforcing the spirit of the first amendment or are we enforcing the first

2221
02:01:05.441 --> 02:01:09.440
amendment according to protecting you from government? Right. And so,

2222
02:01:09.441 --> 02:01:10.660
but then that's an interesting question. Are we,

2223
02:01:10.661 --> 02:01:13.090
should we enforce the spirit of the first amendment,

2224
02:01:13.470 --> 02:01:15.990
which certainly think we're encouraging it. I mean, I,

2225
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:19.510
I've definitely very vocal about encouraging it. And I say, you don't have a,

2226
02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:24.640
I and I, when Google was in front of me in a hearing the other day, uh, I said,

2227
02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:26.770
and it was Google, all of them were there. I said,

2228
02:01:26.771 --> 02:01:29.950
you don't have a legal obligation to do what I'm telling you,

2229
02:01:29.951 --> 02:01:33.940
but I do think you have an American obligation to actually adhere to free speech

2230
02:01:33.941 --> 02:01:36.580
standards and to adhere to the same standards as the government adheres to,

2231
02:01:36.581 --> 02:01:40.820
which is your speech is not protected if it incites violence directly is a

2232
02:01:40.821 --> 02:01:42.750
pretty clear standard. Yes. Uh,

2233
02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:47.860
everything else is entirely vague and it only leads to a slippery slope and

2234
02:01:48.410 --> 02:01:48.741
frankly,

2235
02:01:48.741 --> 02:01:52.160
a very dangerous situation where we're just at each other's throats even worse

2236
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:55.010
because not only are you yelling at each other,

2237
02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:58.310
but you're telling certain people that their opinions are just utterly

2238
02:01:58.460 --> 02:02:02.000
unacceptable and can't be heard at all. If you want to create civil war,

2239
02:02:02.001 --> 02:02:04.100
that's a really quick way to do it, right?

2240
02:02:04.101 --> 02:02:07.490
When you really disenfranchise people and it's just so dangerous and we just

2241
02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:08.420
shouldn't do it.

2242
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:13.310
I fully agree and I really appreciate the way you were holding their heels to

2243
02:02:13.311 --> 02:02:14.600
the fire on that,

2244
02:02:14.601 --> 02:02:19.250
particularly in regards to the description of people being Nazis, right?

2245
02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:22.670
That was you. You were talking about Dennis Prager and Ben Shapiro,

2246
02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:24.110
who are Jewish gentlemen,

2247
02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:28.960
who were being labeled Nazis by internal memos and was Google. Uh,

2248
02:02:29.100 --> 02:02:32.360
that was Google. Yeah. Yeah. And it's so intellectually dishonest.

2249
02:02:32.690 --> 02:02:37.200
So intellectually dishonest. And not only that, no, no pushback internally. Oh,

2250
02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:42.260
also, you know, I always, I always tell people when, when, when they're,

2251
02:02:42.261 --> 02:02:43.910
when they're complaining about something Trump said and they're like,

2252
02:02:43.911 --> 02:02:46.820
look at the violence he's inciting, all right. And I say, well,

2253
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:51.050
you call us all Nazis. When you call somebody a Nazi, you,

2254
02:02:51.230 --> 02:02:55.220
you are calling somebody something that we agreed as Americans to bomb and kill

2255
02:02:55.221 --> 02:02:56.054
and destroy.

2256
02:02:56.540 --> 02:03:00.560
So you're labeling me with a label that we all agree should be destroyed.

2257
02:03:00.980 --> 02:03:04.230
Like how is that not inciting violence by your, by your, by your standards.

2258
02:03:04.830 --> 02:03:07.670
I mean it's, you take away that name,

2259
02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:12.880
you take away the word Nazi and there's far less targets for people to be upset

2260
02:03:13.761 --> 02:03:16.100
about. I mean, if you just stop using that word,

2261
02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:18.350
stop using the word Nazi and look,

2262
02:03:18.351 --> 02:03:22.280
there are clearly real white nationalists who saw that in Charlottesville and

2263
02:03:22.281 --> 02:03:27.230
those dorks showed up and Tiki torches. Yeah. Those are real white nationalists.

2264
02:03:27.231 --> 02:03:30.440
They were the real, yeah. There's a lot of people that are not Ben Shapiro's,

2265
02:03:30.441 --> 02:03:33.780
one of them. You know, you can't, and not even close, not even close.

2266
02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:35.690
Like it's not even, yeah, it's,

2267
02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:40.070
but it's this convenient label that once you decide that someone is the other

2268
02:03:40.340 --> 02:03:41.600
dehumanize them,

2269
02:03:41.601 --> 02:03:46.340
their perspective becomes intolerable and you can label them as being this,

2270
02:03:47.290 --> 02:03:51.650
this target. Right, right. And they, they do it to Trump too. I mean, Trump,

2271
02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:51.810
you know,

2272
02:03:51.810 --> 02:03:56.070
this continues to be said by basically everybody running for president, uh,

2273
02:03:56.280 --> 02:03:58.430
that Trump has a white supremacist and,

2274
02:03:58.460 --> 02:04:02.180
and white ceramist and Nazi or practically basically, I think the same thing.

2275
02:04:02.181 --> 02:04:03.170
I think we have a,

2276
02:04:03.620 --> 02:04:07.940
we have an understandably deep objection to anything white supremacist as we

2277
02:04:07.941 --> 02:04:09.140
should. It should be condemned. Totally.

2278
02:04:09.710 --> 02:04:13.190
And when you're calling the president that I think you're also therefore,

2279
02:04:13.250 --> 02:04:15.400
and they often call us supporters that too. Yeah.

2280
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:18.740
So you're calling 60 something million people who voted for him. The same thing.

2281
02:04:18.741 --> 02:04:19.041
I just,

2282
02:04:19.041 --> 02:04:24.041
I just can't imagine a worst way to engage in dialogue and a quicker way to

2283
02:04:24.531 --> 02:04:28.880
escalate things to, to just the worst possible scenario. But it's new.

2284
02:04:29.090 --> 02:04:31.460
This is not something that existed 10 years ago.

2285
02:04:31.461 --> 02:04:35.270
People didn't run around calling everyone a Nazi. Like what happened? How did,

2286
02:04:35.330 --> 02:04:37.980
how did the word Nazi get tossed around

2287
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:42.630
<v 3>like a beach ball at a concert because it's so free to use now and people on the</v>

2288
02:04:42.631 --> 02:04:44.070
left are the ones who are using it.

2289
02:04:44.071 --> 02:04:47.430
It's not people on the right or labeling left wing people Nazis,

2290
02:04:47.431 --> 02:04:52.431
but fascist and Nazi that were just gets thrown out without any real

2291
02:04:52.861 --> 02:04:56.970
comprehension or any real responsibility for the actual definition of it.

2292
02:04:57.480 --> 02:05:00.540
Yeah. And I don't know where the origin is.

2293
02:05:01.130 --> 02:05:04.510
<v 0>Um, well the origin years it is,</v>

2294
02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:06.620
and then they found the word and they liked it. They just,

2295
02:05:06.650 --> 02:05:10.550
they found something effective, I think. Um, you know, there's,

2296
02:05:10.610 --> 02:05:13.520
there's Herbert Marcuse is sort of the,

2297
02:05:13.550 --> 02:05:18.550
one of the original thinkers from the new left who said that like the new way of

2298
02:05:18.891 --> 02:05:23.750
progressivism needs to be dividing people up into that other, okay. And then,

2299
02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:27.590
and then not only that, but but labeling them and then suppressing their speech.

2300
02:05:27.890 --> 02:05:30.950
So this started in the 60s okay. This the sort of the policy,

2301
02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:34.880
this is like a left wing thinker, right? Okay. So his,

2302
02:05:34.940 --> 02:05:36.260
his ideas,

2303
02:05:37.090 --> 02:05:40.550
this was absolutely a strategy that he was right and an actual strategy of

2304
02:05:40.551 --> 02:05:45.050
suppression because the goal was to take the previously oppressed and suppress

2305
02:05:45.051 --> 02:05:48.260
the previous oppressors. This is how, this is how they talked about it.

2306
02:05:48.261 --> 02:05:51.560
So this isn't slave the slave owners, right. So this is in a sense,

2307
02:05:51.561 --> 02:05:55.400
this isn't new like this. This is the kind of radicalism we're seeing.

2308
02:05:55.401 --> 02:05:58.520
It started in the 60s it was imbued into our universities and now we're seeing

2309
02:05:58.521 --> 02:06:00.490
it manifest again and amplified.

2310
02:06:00.500 --> 02:06:04.850
I think by social media and labeling somebody a Nazi is just really an old

2311
02:06:04.851 --> 02:06:07.770
tactic. They're just using a different word. And I don't know,

2312
02:06:08.030 --> 02:06:10.460
I think if we were, I think if we looked into history,

2313
02:06:10.461 --> 02:06:13.100
there's probably other cases where they've continued to call us Nazis,

2314
02:06:13.101 --> 02:06:16.820
but it's obviously extremely prevalent now. I mean never to this extent. Right.

2315
02:06:16.850 --> 02:06:21.020
And I just, I don't know why that it, well, it's,

2316
02:06:21.021 --> 02:06:25.570
it's the rise of identity politics fundamentally. And so, and then there was,

2317
02:06:25.610 --> 02:06:28.190
and then I think there's, it's fair. It is because the left would say, well,

2318
02:06:28.191 --> 02:06:28.701
there was a,

2319
02:06:28.701 --> 02:06:31.730
there was kind of a white identity politics rise and they were given some kind

2320
02:06:31.731 --> 02:06:34.070
of voice by Donald Trump. Right? This is what they would say.

2321
02:06:34.850 --> 02:06:39.850
And I think that there's probably some truth to that and then that's terrible.

2322
02:06:40.191 --> 02:06:43.420
But I think that, I think that was a reaction, you know, uh,

2323
02:06:43.790 --> 02:06:46.940
we should always point out that like when you do surveys of what race,

2324
02:06:46.941 --> 02:06:48.590
race relations are like in America,

2325
02:06:48.591 --> 02:06:52.040
they were much better before than they are now.

2326
02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:55.580
And do we really think we've gotten more racist, you know, like what happened?

2327
02:06:55.581 --> 02:06:58.150
And this is under president Obama's presidency. And I,

2328
02:06:58.151 --> 02:06:59.210
and I think those identity,

2329
02:06:59.211 --> 02:07:04.211
that identity politics just came to the forefront in the last decade in a really

2330
02:07:04.491 --> 02:07:06.110
terrible way. And again,

2331
02:07:06.111 --> 02:07:09.260
I think identity politics is one of the worst things we could do to each other.

2332
02:07:10.220 --> 02:07:12.290
Um, when you divide people up into different groups and,

2333
02:07:12.310 --> 02:07:16.410
and talk about intersectional hierarchies of victimhood, I just think it's, I,

2334
02:07:16.710 --> 02:07:20.660
I, it's, it's just dividing because fundamentally what it is,

2335
02:07:20.661 --> 02:07:24.050
is you're dividing people up and you're saying your group is oppressed by that

2336
02:07:24.051 --> 02:07:27.700
group and if you vote for me, I'll give you power over that group. Yeah.

2337
02:07:28.070 --> 02:07:30.860
And you can trace a lot of, of, of policies to that.

2338
02:07:30.861 --> 02:07:34.220
And this all stems from Marxists ideology where it was more socioeconomic

2339
02:07:34.280 --> 02:07:35.980
division of, but

2340
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:39.100
<v 1>that is, but that has become, uh,</v>

2341
02:07:39.101 --> 02:07:41.800
an ideology of intersectionality, uh,

2342
02:07:41.860 --> 02:07:45.280
ironically put forth by a woman named Crenshaw.

2343
02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:48.580
Really? Yeah. I kept Kimberly Crenshaw.

2344
02:07:48.750 --> 02:07:51.700
I think she came at it from a much more academic standpoint. I think it's,

2345
02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:56.140
I think whatever her original theory of intersectionality was a,

2346
02:07:56.190 --> 02:07:58.900
has been transformed quite a bit. But yeah,

2347
02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:02.950
I find that interesting cause I'm still opposed to that, you know,

2348
02:08:03.110 --> 02:08:05.140
now that I'm thinking about it, I don't even think it's 10 years.

2349
02:08:05.320 --> 02:08:08.830
I think the Nazi thing is only about four or five years old to the extent we're

2350
02:08:08.831 --> 02:08:13.180
seeing it. Sure. Yeah. You know, and so strange. And people use it so freely.

2351
02:08:13.181 --> 02:08:16.810
I look at people on Twitter use it so freely and they use it in regards to my

2352
02:08:16.811 --> 02:08:21.370
guests and you know, they use it say that I've had Nazis on the show. Like,

2353
02:08:21.380 --> 02:08:24.100
what do you mean? I'm like, this is crazy. You know, you're,

2354
02:08:24.250 --> 02:08:25.710
you're calling the Jewish man in Nazi.

2355
02:08:25.730 --> 02:08:29.170
You can an Orthodox Jewish guy wears a yamaka. You calling them a Nazi, right?

2356
02:08:29.320 --> 02:08:32.530
The fucking bananas. It just doesn't make any sense.

2357
02:08:32.930 --> 02:08:36.610
And we just added the shameless about it. The shameless about these accusations.

2358
02:08:36.611 --> 02:08:38.980
I don't understand it. Here's something we're probably going to disagree about.

2359
02:08:39.200 --> 02:08:43.690
A recreational marijuana. You are apparently, no kidding.

2360
02:08:44.050 --> 02:08:46.390
I really thought we're going to do a whole show with Joe Rogan and you weren't

2361
02:08:46.391 --> 02:08:48.310
going to bring up marijuana. Like what are the chances

2362
02:08:50.050 --> 02:08:54.190
you're not in favor of recreational marijuana? No, I can, I can be convinced,

2363
02:08:54.191 --> 02:08:58.630
but I'm not there yet right now. Well, spark one up. I,

2364
02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:02.380
I don't like it. I just, I just don't like it. I liked,

2365
02:09:02.381 --> 02:09:05.180
I like scotch like that too. We got shot of that.

2366
02:09:05.650 --> 02:09:08.140
We've had scotch to this whole time. Well, you gave me this amazing,

2367
02:09:08.141 --> 02:09:11.620
you gave me this amazing coffee that's actually Hamilton's savory food, coffee.

2368
02:09:11.621 --> 02:09:14.800
It's pretty damn good. Right? Need me maybe so coherent like, yeah, I love it.

2369
02:09:14.801 --> 02:09:18.730
The clarity. Good. Well it's got a tumeric. It's, it reduces inflammation.

2370
02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:22.450
Right? It gives you a yellow list though. So I, I'm definitely,

2371
02:09:22.750 --> 02:09:26.290
I'm definitely more open to just the federal legalization of medical marijuana

2372
02:09:26.291 --> 02:09:27.910
and all the benefits that come with that.

2373
02:09:27.911 --> 02:09:30.940
I think the science backs that up pretty well. Sure. The,

2374
02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:34.270
I'm on the recreational side, I'm happy to leave that to the States. Okay.

2375
02:09:34.271 --> 02:09:35.520
And then there's the argument of, well,

2376
02:09:35.710 --> 02:09:38.470
the States are having trouble with some things, the banking laws, et cetera,

2377
02:09:38.471 --> 02:09:43.000
because the federal government doesn't, may still makes it illegal. My, my,

2378
02:09:43.060 --> 02:09:47.620
my issue with recreational marijuana still is, is it's, and again,

2379
02:09:47.621 --> 02:09:48.970
this is not a strong opinion and I have,

2380
02:09:48.971 --> 02:09:52.510
this is not a Hill I'm dying on by any means. Um,

2381
02:09:52.870 --> 02:09:54.280
but if we're going to change it,

2382
02:09:54.281 --> 02:09:57.640
I want to understand what the point is and like what the benefits are of it

2383
02:09:57.670 --> 02:10:01.120
recreationally. I understand the benefits medically very well. Uh,

2384
02:10:01.150 --> 02:10:03.310
but I don't understand the, the recreational benefits.

2385
02:10:03.311 --> 02:10:06.450
And I want to see how this data plays out in places like California and

2386
02:10:06.451 --> 02:10:07.480
Colorado. You know,

2387
02:10:07.481 --> 02:10:10.810
I want to see if there's an increased use among young people. Cause there's,

2388
02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:11.230
there's,

2389
02:10:11.230 --> 02:10:14.260
there's very good science that says if you use marijuana a lot under the age of

2390
02:10:14.261 --> 02:10:14.771
26,

2391
02:10:14.771 --> 02:10:19.260
you're going to have cognitive issues for the rest of your life along with yes.

2392
02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:21.910
Yeah. But it is legal and people compare those things.

2393
02:10:21.911 --> 02:10:25.390
But I am my counter isn't that my counter is simply this,

2394
02:10:25.391 --> 02:10:28.210
the alcohol issues out of the bag, like it just is, you know,

2395
02:10:28.211 --> 02:10:30.390
we're never going to put that back in. Um,

2396
02:10:30.700 --> 02:10:34.250
and so I think they're gonna put pot back in the bag. Well, not necessarily.

2397
02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:35.690
<v 2>My point is this,</v>

2398
02:10:35.750 --> 02:10:39.460
there's a normalization that occurs when you legalize something. You're telling,

2399
02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:43.790
okay, so let's say make the age 21 or a, I'm not, what is it in California? Um,

2400
02:10:43.820 --> 02:10:46.840
I think it's 21 is it? So let's say, I want to think it's the same as alcohol,

2401
02:10:46.940 --> 02:10:50.810
let's say make it 21 what you've done though is you've normalized it for

2402
02:10:50.811 --> 02:10:55.010
teenagers cause you said, well yeah it's 21 but it's legal so there's nothing,

2403
02:10:55.070 --> 02:10:57.230
there's no issues with it. Okay.

2404
02:10:57.440 --> 02:10:59.600
That's what your T I think that's what you're telling people.

2405
02:10:59.870 --> 02:11:03.380
And there's a lot of people who can just live their lives extremely productively

2406
02:11:03.381 --> 02:11:06.620
and smoked pot a lot. And there's a lot of people who can't. Okay.

2407
02:11:06.621 --> 02:11:10.070
And there's lot of people who don't. Those people are lazy bitches. Well yeah,

2408
02:11:10.130 --> 02:11:14.270
let me help you. You can live your life. You just listen.

2409
02:11:14.610 --> 02:11:17.360
Pot's not for everybody. And I have a lot of friends who don't smoke pot,

2410
02:11:17.361 --> 02:11:20.980
but pot is a tool. Just like a hammer. You can build a house with a hammer,

2411
02:11:21.050 --> 02:11:24.200
you could hit yourself in the Dick if you're fucking crazy like scotch.

2412
02:11:24.230 --> 02:11:26.370
You could drink scotch recreationally.

2413
02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:28.760
You can have a couple of glasses with some friends and have a great

2414
02:11:28.761 --> 02:11:32.410
conversation. And it's a social lubricant and people enjoy a nice enjoy.

2415
02:11:32.430 --> 02:11:35.400
And that's why we've got a bunch of bottles of it over there. A look. But,

2416
02:11:35.401 --> 02:11:39.650
but don't you have to drink way more scotch to get even close to the,

2417
02:11:39.710 --> 02:11:43.250
to the basically cognitive and coherence that you'd be able to just one bite of

2418
02:11:43.251 --> 02:11:47.090
a brownie. You, you would, but not me.

2419
02:11:47.210 --> 02:11:49.340
I smoked pot all the time. I could smoke pot.

2420
02:11:49.790 --> 02:11:53.120
I could've smoked pot before this podcast and the exact same podcast.

2421
02:11:53.450 --> 02:11:56.540
I could have had several hits. If I gave you several hits,

2422
02:11:56.541 --> 02:12:00.390
you'd be obliterated and you'd be so paranoid, freaking out,

2423
02:12:00.430 --> 02:12:02.480
and you'd think the government's coming to get you and you're going to close

2424
02:12:02.481 --> 02:12:05.570
down the Congress and Oh my God, I try to listen. Anyway,

2425
02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:12.500
it's, it's, um, a lot of it is based on our own ideas and perceptions.

2426
02:12:12.501 --> 02:12:16.520
And I had a lot of these misconceptions in my own head. I didn't really,

2427
02:12:17.150 --> 02:12:20.570
I smoked pot maybe six times or so,

2428
02:12:20.571 --> 02:12:22.550
seven times before I was 30 years old.

2429
02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.880
And then when I was 30 I started hanging around with a guy, smoked a lot,

2430
02:12:25.881 --> 02:12:29.000
my friend Eddie Bravo, we started smoking pot together and I realized like, Oh,

2431
02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:33.170
this is an incredible tool for creativity. Like if you use it correctly.

2432
02:12:33.410 --> 02:12:34.700
And yeah, it makes you paranoid,

2433
02:12:34.701 --> 02:12:39.701
but I think a lot of what that paranoia is is you being acutely aware of your

2434
02:12:40.581 --> 02:12:45.350
vulnerability and your actual real place in the cosmos and your real place in

2435
02:12:45.351 --> 02:12:49.220
society and the real dangers of driving cars and the real dangers of being in

2436
02:12:49.221 --> 02:12:52.880
crowds of people. Yeah, it's not, it's a weird, uncomfortable feeling,

2437
02:12:52.881 --> 02:12:56.480
but ultimately you get through that and you're going to be okay and in a culture

2438
02:12:56.481 --> 02:12:58.760
that I just don't really have a problem with what you're saying. You know,

2439
02:12:58.761 --> 02:13:02.750
like it's, I'm just, I'm not cultural, I guess on a personal level,

2440
02:13:02.751 --> 02:13:05.810
I'm just not opposed to what you're saying at all. Uh,

2441
02:13:05.900 --> 02:13:08.150
from a policy level though, I just look at things differently.

2442
02:13:08.151 --> 02:13:12.680
Like when I extracted myself from the personal situations I've had with pot,

2443
02:13:13.250 --> 02:13:16.490
and I look at it from a policy perspective, what personal situations I do.

2444
02:13:16.970 --> 02:13:20.540
I've tried it, you know, and they're annoyed. I don't like it. I didn't,

2445
02:13:20.541 --> 02:13:24.170
I really don't freak out. I don't know. No, I'm not a freak out here.

2446
02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:28.940
I'm not a freak out kind of person. But what didn't you like? Uh, and it just,

2447
02:13:29.090 --> 02:13:32.970
it's just the sensation that just in general, I just really didn't like it. Um,

2448
02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:37.410
I don't know how much did you smoke? Too much. What? Sorry?

2449
02:13:38.730 --> 02:13:42.960
I think there's something going out with my headphones with that gloss over

2450
02:13:42.961 --> 02:13:47.820
this. So, but here's the problem with keeping an illegal criminal. Sell it.

2451
02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:50.520
I mean, this the same problem we had during prohibition.

2452
02:13:50.590 --> 02:13:53.760
This is what propped up the mom, right? We all know this, and this is a,

2453
02:13:53.761 --> 02:13:56.580
this is the number one problem we have with the Mexican drug cartels.

2454
02:13:56.760 --> 02:14:00.090
And the number one problem is that there's a goddamn customer base in the United

2455
02:14:00.090 --> 02:14:03.120
States and they're making billions and billions of dollars selling illegal

2456
02:14:03.121 --> 02:14:06.660
drugs. And what's the solution to that? I don't know. I mean not, look, I don't,

2457
02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:07.501
I have kids.

2458
02:14:07.501 --> 02:14:10.900
I don't want fucking heroin to be something you could buy at seven 11 yeah.

2459
02:14:11.050 --> 02:14:13.650
I don't want you to be able to go to a store and buy meth, you know?

2460
02:14:13.650 --> 02:14:17.290
But I guess it'll hold another conversation about all drugs. All drugs. Yeah.

2461
02:14:17.350 --> 02:14:19.770
But those are the real dangerous ones. Pots, not that.

2462
02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:21.900
And when you lie to kids and tell them that pots the real,

2463
02:14:22.050 --> 02:14:24.720
real danger and you shouldn't do it, then they start going,

2464
02:14:24.721 --> 02:14:27.630
well maybe you're lying about heroin. Maybe you're lying about math.

2465
02:14:27.631 --> 02:14:29.430
Maybe just square, maybe just some loser.

2466
02:14:29.431 --> 02:14:32.130
Just wants to be stuck in a cubicle all day and you want me to be living like

2467
02:14:32.460 --> 02:14:33.660
look you. But it does reduce,

2468
02:14:33.690 --> 02:14:37.990
I mean it does reduce in productivity I think more than alcohol does when

2469
02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:40.290
[inaudible] dependent upon the person.

2470
02:14:40.350 --> 02:14:42.990
I get paranoid and I want to do more things cause I don't want to be a loser.

2471
02:14:43.170 --> 02:14:44.910
That's what happens to me when I smoked pot.

2472
02:14:45.150 --> 02:14:49.230
I think it accentuates many aspects of people that are already lazy.

2473
02:14:49.740 --> 02:14:52.980
If you are already lazy and you have a problem with discipline, which I don't,

2474
02:14:53.190 --> 02:14:55.910
if you have a problem with discipline and you smoke pot, yeah, yeah.

2475
02:14:56.060 --> 02:14:58.380
You're going to just want to veg out, line the grass and stare at the sky.

2476
02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:02.460
The clouds. I want to get going. Yeah. I smoked pot and go to the gym. I mean,

2477
02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:04.770
I do it all the time. And again, as a policy maker though,

2478
02:15:04.771 --> 02:15:08.670
I have to look at the whole situation. So I see people like you and you're like,

2479
02:15:08.671 --> 02:15:11.930
yeah, you'd be fine. Why not? Um, but I, I,

2480
02:15:11.940 --> 02:15:14.820
but I do have to take into account the entirety of the situation and asked

2481
02:15:14.821 --> 02:15:17.730
myself, well, what is the benefit of society society doing this?

2482
02:15:17.731 --> 02:15:21.810
Like what is the people nicer in enhances a sense of community.

2483
02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:25.920
It makes people more aware of their surroundings. Kinder people. I mean,

2484
02:15:25.921 --> 02:15:28.770
I don't know. I think alcohol is much more of a social lubricant.

2485
02:15:28.771 --> 02:15:30.300
Definitely makes him meaner too. But I mean,

2486
02:15:30.301 --> 02:15:32.130
as far as getting along with people and going out and,

2487
02:15:32.250 --> 02:15:35.830
and interacting with human difference, it's different. But definitely, yes.

2488
02:15:35.890 --> 02:15:40.590
Inhibits your inhibitions. It lowers your inhibitions.

2489
02:15:40.591 --> 02:15:42.900
So it allows you to talk more freely with people.

2490
02:15:43.230 --> 02:15:47.160
Definitely encourages more sex and more terrible decision making and driving

2491
02:15:47.460 --> 02:15:47.820
too.

2492
02:15:47.820 --> 02:15:51.690
But the thing about marijuana and other policy problems because like how do you

2493
02:15:51.691 --> 02:15:54.860
test for it? You know, we have a very kind of clear standards on alcoholics.

2494
02:15:55.030 --> 02:15:59.880
Just again, it's like, again, I'm not, I'm not just not dying on this Hill. Um,

2495
02:15:59.881 --> 02:16:03.000
I just, I have questions and those questions aren't answered. I understand that.

2496
02:16:03.150 --> 02:16:07.110
But it's questions oftentimes are coming from a place of propaganda.

2497
02:16:07.140 --> 02:16:10.530
Like people have this idea of what it is versus what it really is. I don't know.

2498
02:16:10.620 --> 02:16:11.240
I,

2499
02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:15.480
I have personal experience with this and know I'm 35 so like growing up around

2500
02:16:15.481 --> 02:16:19.720
this my entire life, this isn't so, it's not some,

2501
02:16:20.670 --> 02:16:23.040
again, did you do it right? But here's the thing,

2502
02:16:23.041 --> 02:16:26.010
it's the same thing with alcohol. You could have led, driven,

2503
02:16:26.011 --> 02:16:28.680
drunk and crashed your car and go, well, alcohol's bad. Look,

2504
02:16:28.681 --> 02:16:31.570
I drove car into a fucking tree and I go, well, Hey man,

2505
02:16:31.571 --> 02:16:33.850
I just had a couple beers with my friends and we had a great old time.

2506
02:16:33.851 --> 02:16:36.940
We laughed it up and nobody got hurt. The difference is again, again,

2507
02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:39.820
the way to, to measure how much too alcohol,

2508
02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:41.840
too much alcohol is well defined and all that.

2509
02:16:41.900 --> 02:16:45.220
We also have just hundreds of years of experience with like as a culture with

2510
02:16:45.221 --> 02:16:48.310
how to figure out alcohol and how to deal with this to have thousands of years

2511
02:16:48.311 --> 02:16:49.870
of experience of how to use cannabis.

2512
02:16:50.170 --> 02:16:54.430
But it was suppressed in the 1930s by William Randolph Hearst and Harry

2513
02:16:54.430 --> 02:16:56.920
Anslinger and more of an echo economic decision.

2514
02:16:56.980 --> 02:16:58.720
It was a public health decision. Yeah,

2515
02:16:58.780 --> 02:17:02.260
and I think I've heard your podcast on that. It's interesting. Yeah,

2516
02:17:02.261 --> 02:17:05.320
there's many, many documentaries and books written on it,

2517
02:17:05.321 --> 02:17:09.160
but I think that the real problem is when you make drugs illegal,

2518
02:17:09.161 --> 02:17:12.510
only Outlaws sell drugs. You prop up illegal enterprises.

2519
02:17:12.520 --> 02:17:17.470
It's a guy coming in next, next month or next week, rather John Norris, who,

2520
02:17:17.890 --> 02:17:21.460
uh, is a, a guy who, uh, works for the state.

2521
02:17:21.730 --> 02:17:25.570
He's one of those guys that has to go around and find these illegal grow ops on

2522
02:17:25.571 --> 02:17:28.220
public land and it's fucking extremely dangerous. Yeah. I mean,

2523
02:17:28.221 --> 02:17:31.780
bottom bottom line is my, my position is that's a state decision. You know,

2524
02:17:31.810 --> 02:17:33.790
it's a state decision and not federally.

2525
02:17:33.820 --> 02:17:36.760
Why wouldn't it be federally legal if alcohol's federally illegal,

2526
02:17:36.761 --> 02:17:40.230
if we'd know that no one's dying from it, no one can overturn that.

2527
02:17:40.330 --> 02:17:42.810
I just want to see what the data comes out as from Colorado.

2528
02:17:42.850 --> 02:17:44.470
It's mixed right now. Frankly,

2529
02:17:44.650 --> 02:17:48.580
I think we need a strong education program to let people know, first of all,

2530
02:17:48.581 --> 02:17:51.670
if you have a problem with reality, if you have schizophrenia in your family,

2531
02:17:51.671 --> 02:17:55.030
if your reality's already slippery, marijuana is not for you.

2532
02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:59.770
And I've personally seen people that have struggled that that do have an adverse

2533
02:17:59.771 --> 02:18:03.970
reaction to marijuana and they go off the fucking rails. It does happen. Yeah.

2534
02:18:04.090 --> 02:18:05.290
It's particularly with edibles,

2535
02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:07.930
edibles in particular to knock people for a loop.

2536
02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:12.370
But then there's other people that doesn't do that too. And I think we,

2537
02:18:12.371 --> 02:18:16.720
the the way to study that is to have actual funding and make it legal.

2538
02:18:16.721 --> 02:18:19.660
Where you could, you could look at things across the board and figure out why.

2539
02:18:20.110 --> 02:18:23.020
I think, I think as far as the battles we should fight in the federal level,

2540
02:18:23.140 --> 02:18:24.700
we've got to start with the medical side. I think this,

2541
02:18:24.710 --> 02:18:29.490
I think the science is clear and like, so you know, let's start, I mean I,

2542
02:18:29.500 --> 02:18:31.180
I just, I just the gateway, right?

2543
02:18:31.181 --> 02:18:35.890
CBD is non-psychoactive and helps so many old people with arthritis and so many

2544
02:18:35.891 --> 02:18:38.830
people with anxiety. It's fantastic. And it just is, again,

2545
02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:43.210
another reason I'm a Republican is because I believe in somewhat slower

2546
02:18:43.211 --> 02:18:45.100
policymaking to like these,

2547
02:18:45.101 --> 02:18:47.440
these conversations have to play out in society and they,

2548
02:18:47.500 --> 02:18:52.500
we don't always need to see to solve the problem right away.

2549
02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:57.100
Like there's a reason for that. Things must happen so early. So I think,

2550
02:18:57.101 --> 02:19:00.550
I think the medical conversation is, is the one we should be fighting for.

2551
02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:03.610
I think the recreational side is a few steps beyond that.

2552
02:19:03.730 --> 02:19:06.130
And then we get to that and we'll have them, we'll know more. And I,

2553
02:19:06.131 --> 02:19:09.610
and I think that's, that's, that's why generally when people ask me that,

2554
02:19:09.611 --> 02:19:12.670
I'm like, this is the medical thing is the thing to be talking about right now.

2555
02:19:12.820 --> 02:19:16.030
I appreciate that conservative perspective and the slow approach to things.

2556
02:19:16.031 --> 02:19:17.260
And I understand what you're saying.

2557
02:19:17.410 --> 02:19:22.120
What bothers me more than anything is that American citizens are not doing any

2558
02:19:22.121 --> 02:19:23.050
harm to anyone.

2559
02:19:23.290 --> 02:19:27.470
Could be criminals for something that's been used by human beings for thousands

2560
02:19:27.470 --> 02:19:29.450
years and doesn't show any real problems.

2561
02:19:29.840 --> 02:19:32.840
I don't think young people should drink, but I drank when I was young.

2562
02:19:32.930 --> 02:19:34.790
I mean I didn't drink a lot, but I did occasionally.

2563
02:19:34.820 --> 02:19:37.880
I don't think young people should smoke pot. I definitely don't encourage it.

2564
02:19:37.970 --> 02:19:41.030
No. Matter of fact, I deeply discourage it and I tell people, look,

2565
02:19:41.031 --> 02:19:41.601
there's a reason.

2566
02:19:41.601 --> 02:19:44.540
One of the reasons why I enjoy it is I didn't start smoking really until I was

2567
02:19:44.541 --> 02:19:48.410
30 and you know, I take time off all the time.

2568
02:19:48.411 --> 02:19:50.330
It's not an addictive substance to me.

2569
02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:52.820
It's psychologically addictive to some people.

2570
02:19:52.821 --> 02:19:57.050
And there might be some evidence that a very, very small percentage of people,

2571
02:19:57.051 --> 02:20:00.590
it's physically addictive but not like alcohol is or not like a lot of the

2572
02:20:00.591 --> 02:20:05.060
things that we can just by anywhere are, yeah, those are all fair arguments.

2573
02:20:05.190 --> 02:20:09.170
Again, it's a good discussion to have. I'm not, we sorta disagree on it, but,

2574
02:20:09.340 --> 02:20:13.880
but only because I just think more due diligence needs to be done. It's not as,

2575
02:20:13.990 --> 02:20:16.610
is not a something I'm vehemently opposed to. Well,

2576
02:20:16.611 --> 02:20:20.360
I think anything for young kids can be a real problem,

2577
02:20:20.390 --> 02:20:23.030
especially for young kids where their brain is still developing and they're

2578
02:20:23.031 --> 02:20:25.100
trying to find their way through life and you give them something that's

2579
02:20:25.101 --> 02:20:28.130
severely distorts reality, whatever it is. Um,

2580
02:20:28.131 --> 02:20:31.760
I wish we had that same due diligence the way they prescribed psychotropic drugs

2581
02:20:31.761 --> 02:20:35.480
to kids because we don't, you know, should talk to parents discretion.

2582
02:20:35.510 --> 02:20:39.620
So many parents are putting their kids on Ritalin and Prozac and Adderall and

2583
02:20:39.650 --> 02:20:40.140
you know,

2584
02:20:40.140 --> 02:20:44.000
and you're making kids speed freaks as opposed to relying on like cognitive

2585
02:20:44.001 --> 02:20:45.110
behavioral therapy,

2586
02:20:45.111 --> 02:20:48.590
which is proven to work much better because you're getting at the problem,

2587
02:20:48.591 --> 02:20:51.650
you're questioning, you're questioning the untruth that you're telling yourself.

2588
02:20:51.650 --> 02:20:56.330
That's it. That's effectively what CVT is. Um, you know, it's good practice.

2589
02:20:56.360 --> 02:21:01.340
Kids have exorbitant amounts of energy and you can call that hyperactive or you

2590
02:21:01.341 --> 02:21:05.060
could just say, well, that kid's got a fucking great engine. Got a lot of gas.

2591
02:21:05.290 --> 02:21:08.090
Yeah. You just figure out a way to get this kid engaged in what they like.

2592
02:21:08.091 --> 02:21:10.640
I guarantee you'd take that kid, put them in front of a video game.

2593
02:21:10.641 --> 02:21:12.430
He doesn't have any problem focusing. Yeah. What did,

2594
02:21:12.470 --> 02:21:16.030
what he has a problem with his shitty classes with boring subjects, right.

2595
02:21:16.130 --> 02:21:19.790
And teachers that are uninterested and so many people are being labeled as being

2596
02:21:20.180 --> 02:21:22.010
problems because of this

2597
02:21:22.110 --> 02:21:25.800
<v 0>blame something else besides reality. And that's, that's, that's,</v>

2598
02:21:25.830 --> 02:21:29.540
that's problematic. Um, and uh, you know,

2599
02:21:29.650 --> 02:21:31.540
you talked about looking into certain drugs. I mean,

2600
02:21:31.550 --> 02:21:34.380
you know the opioid epidemics and issue too where,

2601
02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:37.450
and that's a bipartisan issue. It's just, again, it's not exactly clear.

2602
02:21:37.490 --> 02:21:39.470
How do you solve this? How do you solve this?

2603
02:21:39.471 --> 02:21:42.950
I have a ton of experience with opioids because I've been injured so many times.

2604
02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:46.450
Did you ever have a problem getting off of them once you Oh yeah.

2605
02:21:46.460 --> 02:21:49.730
It's devastating. It's absolutely, absolutely devastating. And I didn't,

2606
02:21:49.760 --> 02:21:50.690
I never knew.

2607
02:21:50.691 --> 02:21:55.691
And this was in 2012 so I didn't know how devastating it would be cause I just

2608
02:21:55.851 --> 02:21:57.740
stopped taking them. I don't think I'm in pain anymore.

2609
02:21:57.741 --> 02:22:01.850
I should probably just not take these. And then I was in, in worse pain.

2610
02:22:01.851 --> 02:22:03.890
I had no was sick. I didn't know what was wrong with me.

2611
02:22:04.280 --> 02:22:08.660
What was that experience like? Uh, it's not, you just, you can't move.

2612
02:22:08.661 --> 02:22:11.450
You're sick. I don't know how to describe it. You're just really sick.

2613
02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:15.170
And is your body craving the pills? Yeah, but, but I didn't know that.

2614
02:22:15.290 --> 02:22:18.050
I think so. You're just feeling the sickness, just feeling the sickness.

2615
02:22:18.180 --> 02:22:21.820
That wasn't, I didn't, I didn't quite know where it was coming from. Um,

2616
02:22:21.870 --> 02:22:23.720
and then, you know, you tell your doctor and be like, Oh yeah,

2617
02:22:23.790 --> 02:22:26.010
you've got to wean off of that. We tell you that. No,

2618
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:29.970
<v 1>you didn't tell me that. Um, it's very, I was 28 when this happened,</v>

2619
02:22:29.971 --> 02:22:32.580
so I, my body can get over it.

2620
02:22:32.700 --> 02:22:36.220
You're also 28 with a strong mind who's a seal. Right.

2621
02:22:36.390 --> 02:22:39.360
But the age matters just like it matters with pot and just like,

2622
02:22:39.361 --> 02:22:42.450
it matters with addiction, your mind when,

2623
02:22:42.460 --> 02:22:44.460
when teenagers are hooked on opioids,

2624
02:22:44.850 --> 02:22:47.520
when not one dealer gets into the system,

2625
02:22:48.030 --> 02:22:51.980
like you change that person's brain forever and they're always addicted to it,

2626
02:22:52.010 --> 02:22:56.160
really bad ways and like it's different the way that I'll always remember it.

2627
02:22:56.161 --> 02:22:58.650
Like it's ingrained in my brain too, but it's different cause I was older.

2628
02:22:58.980 --> 02:23:01.500
Like if you got an injury today, would you be raise?

2629
02:23:01.740 --> 02:23:06.600
Would you be reluctant to take them? No, no. I have faith in my ability to,

2630
02:23:07.300 --> 02:23:11.310
to just stacked responsibly. Like I, yeah. You know,

2631
02:23:11.311 --> 02:23:15.940
and so that requires a lot of things. But when you win, and this is, this gets,

2632
02:23:16.350 --> 02:23:18.750
this is a little bit, gets to the war on drugs philosophy,

2633
02:23:18.751 --> 02:23:21.960
like do you just not do it because we're losing all the time.

2634
02:23:22.380 --> 02:23:26.190
And I actually disagree with that pretty strongly because [inaudible] yeah,

2635
02:23:26.191 --> 02:23:29.340
you might be feel like you're losing all the time, but you are mitigating it.

2636
02:23:29.730 --> 02:23:32.760
And supply does create demand, especially with something like opioids.

2637
02:23:32.761 --> 02:23:35.400
If that one dealer gets into that one high school and,

2638
02:23:35.500 --> 02:23:37.680
and gets those kids addicted at one party,

2639
02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:42.450
like those in those kids die 10 12 years later. And I've watched this happen,

2640
02:23:42.451 --> 02:23:46.920
I've been to the funerals and uh, it's, it's devastating. And that supply,

2641
02:23:46.921 --> 02:23:51.720
that demand was created by supply. So like again, no, there's no,

2642
02:23:51.721 --> 02:23:53.310
there's never a black and white to anything.

2643
02:23:53.311 --> 02:23:56.020
And so when we say I war on drugs as stupid or it's not stupid, like not,

2644
02:23:56.030 --> 02:23:58.560
it's complicated. It's complicated in the opioid epidemic.

2645
02:23:58.561 --> 02:24:00.510
I think a good indication of that,

2646
02:24:00.810 --> 02:24:04.920
what could be done to mitigate that other than sawing Florida off and selling it

2647
02:24:04.921 --> 02:24:08.010
to the Russians, Oh, what did Florida do? Florida is a problem.

2648
02:24:08.530 --> 02:24:10.560
You know the whole deal with the pill mills. Did you ever,

2649
02:24:10.850 --> 02:24:12.480
there's a great documentary called a,

2650
02:24:12.481 --> 02:24:17.481
the Oxy Oxycontin express and detailed how they had pain management centers in

2651
02:24:17.581 --> 02:24:22.581
Florida set up right next to the doctor next door to the pharmacy that only sold

2652
02:24:23.521 --> 02:24:24.600
opioids. Yeah.

2653
02:24:24.930 --> 02:24:27.750
And they didn't realize I was a Florida and they didn't have a database.

2654
02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:30.390
They didn't have a database. So there's no computer database. So you could,

2655
02:24:30.420 --> 02:24:32.820
if you were a doctor, I could go to you,

2656
02:24:33.090 --> 02:24:35.700
I could get my opioids and I'd go over Jamie, he's a doctor.

2657
02:24:35.701 --> 02:24:38.040
He could hook me up and then I'd go down the street and get more.

2658
02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:39.540
And then when people started selling them, yeah.

2659
02:24:39.570 --> 02:24:43.320
And there was an express from Florida went up into Kentucky and Ohio and all

2660
02:24:43.321 --> 02:24:45.900
these different students that were having giant problems and they found out the

2661
02:24:45.901 --> 02:24:49.950
pills were all coming from this one area. It was a Vanguard documentary.

2662
02:24:50.220 --> 02:24:54.300
And that stuff's been slammed down pretty hard ever since. And so,

2663
02:24:54.440 --> 02:24:56.730
and the pendulum maybe swung a little too far.

2664
02:24:56.880 --> 02:24:59.260
Cause now pain patients are having trouble getting the opioids they want.

2665
02:24:59.330 --> 02:25:01.710
They're like, Oh, here's two pills for your surgery. And you're like, really?

2666
02:25:01.770 --> 02:25:02.760
Right. Um,

2667
02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:06.630
so some people legitimately need this stuff and so we've got to find that

2668
02:25:06.631 --> 02:25:10.660
correct balance. And again, you've always got to know why there's a problem. Um,

2669
02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:13.020
is a general policy approach.

2670
02:25:13.021 --> 02:25:16.800
We should always really question why the problem exists in the first place and,

2671
02:25:16.910 --> 02:25:18.960
and, and what the characteristics of that problem are.

2672
02:25:19.500 --> 02:25:21.780
So a lot of people are dying, not necessarily, they're not like,

2673
02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:24.310
they're not overdosing on oxycotton. They're overdosing

2674
02:25:24.340 --> 02:25:28.750
<v 0>from illegal forms of it or heroin that is laced with fentanyl.</v>

2675
02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:32.170
So how do you tackle that? Well, find, I was coming from the Southern border,

2676
02:25:32.171 --> 02:25:35.980
that's where it's coming from. Um, you know, we can talk about immigration too,

2677
02:25:35.981 --> 02:25:38.110
but little, what happens a lot is, you know,

2678
02:25:38.150 --> 02:25:41.470
these massive waves of immigrants who are turning themselves into border patrol,

2679
02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:45.550
they're allowed to cross because the drug cartels say they can cross. Okay.

2680
02:25:45.551 --> 02:25:47.500
That's why they come across in organized groups.

2681
02:25:47.830 --> 02:25:49.600
And then they turned themselves into border patrol and they,

2682
02:25:49.780 --> 02:25:50.501
and they claim asylum.

2683
02:25:50.501 --> 02:25:52.450
They always bring a kid with them so that they know they can stay.

2684
02:25:53.020 --> 02:25:55.150
But what's also happening is just down the road,

2685
02:25:55.151 --> 02:25:58.210
the drug cartels are moving the fentinol another or other drugs across,

2686
02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:00.730
especially the bulky drugs, mostly like marijuana, things like that.

2687
02:26:01.150 --> 02:26:03.160
Fentanyl so small, they can just bring it through trucks,

2688
02:26:03.161 --> 02:26:05.360
through ports of entry. So the and,

2689
02:26:05.380 --> 02:26:09.370
and so we need sensors to actually detect that and we're getting those,

2690
02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:11.620
getting those put in place more. Um,

2691
02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:14.200
and we need to secure the border because this is where it's coming from and we

2692
02:26:14.201 --> 02:26:16.540
need to deal with where it's coming from South of the border, which is China.

2693
02:26:17.070 --> 02:26:19.990
And so the administration actually did that and we got the Chinese to say at

2694
02:26:19.991 --> 02:26:23.080
least that they'll do it. And you'll never know how much they're enforcing that.

2695
02:26:23.110 --> 02:26:23.710
So we'll see.

2696
02:26:23.710 --> 02:26:27.070
It's so interesting when you play people clips of Obama talking about the

2697
02:26:27.071 --> 02:26:28.570
importance of securing the border.

2698
02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:32.770
I like to play those clips and sounds just like Trump played the statistics of

2699
02:26:32.771 --> 02:26:36.700
how many people they sent back and telling people to not come over with their

2700
02:26:36.701 --> 02:26:39.460
children. They'll be separated from their children. It's a,

2701
02:26:39.461 --> 02:26:42.580
it's one of those things where people like don't like that.

2702
02:26:42.610 --> 02:26:46.780
They don't like to see that it really is deeply disturbing to them that Obama

2703
02:26:47.020 --> 02:26:51.220
campaigned on this idea of protecting our border cause we all used to agree on

2704
02:26:51.221 --> 02:26:54.940
it. You know, [inaudible] racial issue with Trump.

2705
02:26:55.870 --> 02:26:58.810
Yeah. I mean he's definitely said some things where you could trip. Yeah. Yeah,

2706
02:26:58.811 --> 02:27:01.910
for sure. Definitely not going to [inaudible] raping sides,

2707
02:27:02.220 --> 02:27:05.180
murder and not going to defend, not going to defend Trump's rhetoric on the,

2708
02:27:05.230 --> 02:27:09.850
on your show or on any show. Um, they contributed to it. Sure.

2709
02:27:09.970 --> 02:27:13.990
But again, as a pretty unemotional person, I tend to look at what is the policy.

2710
02:27:14.050 --> 02:27:14.201
Right.

2711
02:27:14.201 --> 02:27:18.130
And so I have tried my hardest to move the debate towards when it comes to

2712
02:27:18.131 --> 02:27:20.590
immigration, towards a matter of sustainability,

2713
02:27:21.190 --> 02:27:23.580
a matter of sovereignty and a matter of rule of law. Like,

2714
02:27:23.581 --> 02:27:25.120
do we have standards or doing not, you know,

2715
02:27:25.121 --> 02:27:29.770
do we believe in this idea of a managed border or do we not? And you know,

2716
02:27:30.130 --> 02:27:30.670
in the end, yeah.

2717
02:27:30.670 --> 02:27:34.060
And Trump has made the Democrats so crazy that they've moved radically to the

2718
02:27:34.061 --> 02:27:36.400
left. And it's interesting to watch.

2719
02:27:36.401 --> 02:27:38.590
People always say like both sides have gotten so extreme.

2720
02:27:39.370 --> 02:27:41.030
I always find that interesting. And I say this,

2721
02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:44.770
there's two ways to manage to measure extremism. One is our voting record.

2722
02:27:45.070 --> 02:27:47.020
Like how often do you really vote with the other side?

2723
02:27:47.021 --> 02:27:49.090
And you can measure that pretty carefully actually. And you look,

2724
02:27:49.091 --> 02:27:52.810
you've probably seen a YouTube video maybe where you watch all over time,

2725
02:27:52.811 --> 02:27:55.630
all the red dots and the blue dots and they sort of mingled together and their

2726
02:27:55.631 --> 02:27:58.300
voting records. And then they slowly over time moved to the sides.

2727
02:27:58.750 --> 02:28:00.340
So both sides are responsible for that.

2728
02:28:00.370 --> 02:28:04.370
Like a lack of lack of actual compromise, a lack of deal making where we say,

2729
02:28:04.371 --> 02:28:06.770
okay, I'll vote for your stuff. You vote for my stuff, that,

2730
02:28:06.771 --> 02:28:09.990
that doesn't happen anymore. A eight. And there's reasons for that.

2731
02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:13.150
We could get into, but there's another way to measure extremism.

2732
02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:17.110
And it's the actual policy changes. And so that we can observe that.

2733
02:28:17.111 --> 02:28:19.480
And I think, and, and in that respect,

2734
02:28:19.780 --> 02:28:21.980
I don't think the right and conservatives have

2735
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:24.560
<v 1>really changed our policies or I don't think we've gotten more extreme.</v>

2736
02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:27.510
I think the left has gotten vastly more extreme.

2737
02:28:27.670 --> 02:28:31.910
They've changed their policies radically. Uh, Medicare for all open borders.

2738
02:28:31.911 --> 02:28:34.850
I mean effectively open borders, they don't like to use the word,

2739
02:28:34.851 --> 02:28:36.410
but when you're saying decriminalize it,

2740
02:28:36.411 --> 02:28:38.990
when you're saying no infrastructure at all on the border,

2741
02:28:38.991 --> 02:28:41.400
when you're saying no more ice detention beds, you're,

2742
02:28:41.580 --> 02:28:44.080
you're effectively saying open borders cause you don't want to enforce it and

2743
02:28:44.081 --> 02:28:47.630
you don't want to stop it. So I don't, I don't know what else to call it. Um,

2744
02:28:48.260 --> 02:28:50.720
you know, and those are just some example. The green new deal. I mean,

2745
02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:53.600
socialism's a good word now. So like I think there's,

2746
02:28:53.900 --> 02:28:57.170
I think that on that loan that measure, uh,

2747
02:28:57.290 --> 02:29:00.710
only one side has really moved to an extreme as far as policy policy positions

2748
02:29:00.711 --> 02:29:04.040
go. And to your point, you look at Barack Obama and he's, he's not the only one.

2749
02:29:04.040 --> 02:29:07.080
You can look at Chuck Schumer's old comments on this stuff. I mean it's you,

2750
02:29:07.090 --> 02:29:11.180
you Trump could have written those statements for them. Yeah. And um,

2751
02:29:11.450 --> 02:29:15.480
what can change done? The real issue is not people coming over here, uh,

2752
02:29:15.650 --> 02:29:19.040
seeking work, good people that just want to do better for their life.

2753
02:29:19.050 --> 02:29:20.870
The real issue was drugs and crime.

2754
02:29:21.560 --> 02:29:25.970
What can be done to mitigate the effect of the Mexican drug cartels?

2755
02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:27.560
Cause that seems to be our biggest worry.

2756
02:29:27.770 --> 02:29:31.540
Our biggest worry is that cartels and cartel violence. [inaudible] well, no, I,

2757
02:29:31.620 --> 02:29:36.380
well our biggest worry, that is a worry but, but there's a, again,

2758
02:29:36.460 --> 02:29:39.380
to go back to a matter of sustainability and sovereignty in terms of the amount

2759
02:29:39.381 --> 02:29:43.670
of people that, yeah, I don't, I don't, I never, I actually never,

2760
02:29:43.700 --> 02:29:45.080
when I talk about the immigration issue,

2761
02:29:45.090 --> 02:29:48.320
actually never talk about the drugs and the crime because I don't want to label

2762
02:29:48.321 --> 02:29:53.090
these good people as criminals, drug dealers, you know that that's the wrong,

2763
02:29:53.120 --> 02:29:55.370
that's the wrong in most investment you are.

2764
02:29:55.790 --> 02:29:58.790
But that just because you're a good person and you want nice things doesn't mean

2765
02:29:58.791 --> 02:30:01.210
you get to move to the front of the line. I don't remember immigration policy.

2766
02:30:01.220 --> 02:30:05.090
So a important point to note for people that don't know,

2767
02:30:05.210 --> 02:30:06.620
it's kind of a shocking statistic.

2768
02:30:06.621 --> 02:30:10.940
We let in more legal immigrants in any other country. Yeah, yeah.

2769
02:30:10.970 --> 02:30:15.680
Over a million a year. Um, I think become citizens and much more than that.

2770
02:30:15.890 --> 02:30:18.770
Granted visas. So, and there's a,

2771
02:30:18.771 --> 02:30:22.430
there's a perfectly reasonable debate to have about how many work visa should we

2772
02:30:22.431 --> 02:30:24.320
have. Should we increase it or should we decrease it?

2773
02:30:24.750 --> 02:30:27.740
But now how does someone get over here and how do we know that they don't have a

2774
02:30:27.741 --> 02:30:30.350
history of violent crime? Sure. Like, and I, you know,

2775
02:30:30.351 --> 02:30:33.500
I advocate for a merit based system with the president proposed I think is

2776
02:30:33.501 --> 02:30:34.720
absolutely right. We, we,

2777
02:30:34.721 --> 02:30:37.910
we have the opportunity to choose the best people from the world to come here.

2778
02:30:38.270 --> 02:30:40.130
And if you're a refugee, we have a system for that.

2779
02:30:40.131 --> 02:30:43.340
And if you're in an actual asylum seeker, we have a system for that.

2780
02:30:43.670 --> 02:30:47.510
But what we should be a totally opposed to is this idea that just because you

2781
02:30:47.511 --> 02:30:49.310
made it to walk across the border,

2782
02:30:49.730 --> 02:30:51.470
that all of a sudden you get to cut to the front of the line.

2783
02:30:51.760 --> 02:30:54.100
And that's exactly what's happening right now. Um,

2784
02:30:54.110 --> 02:30:56.930
because of the loopholes we have, if you bring a child with you,

2785
02:30:56.931 --> 02:30:59.660
our laws are written so that we basically can't enforce it.

2786
02:31:00.080 --> 02:31:04.370
We cannot enforce these laws. Um, and this is for a couple of reasons. One,

2787
02:31:04.371 --> 02:31:06.740
the Flores settlement you hear have heard that a lot.

2788
02:31:06.741 --> 02:31:11.360
What it means is you can't attain a child past 20 days.

2789
02:31:11.630 --> 02:31:15.110
So if a family comes across or it's usually it's usually just a part of a family

2790
02:31:15.260 --> 02:31:16.580
cause what they actually do is they split up,

2791
02:31:17.180 --> 02:31:20.850
they split their own families up because they don't want to deport one of the

2792
02:31:20.851 --> 02:31:24.030
parents. Does that make sense? Okay. So the Flores settlement says you have to,

2793
02:31:24.300 --> 02:31:25.470
you can't detain children,

2794
02:31:25.471 --> 02:31:28.680
which effectively means we can never adjudicate these claims in time.

2795
02:31:29.100 --> 02:31:31.230
Whether it's an illegal crossing issue,

2796
02:31:31.260 --> 02:31:36.260
like a criminal act of 1329 U S code 1325 illegal crossing or just they're

2797
02:31:36.931 --> 02:31:39.960
claiming asylum. Either one. We can't, we can't adjudicate it in time.

2798
02:31:40.170 --> 02:31:42.780
So what ends up happening is a catch and release. They say, okay,

2799
02:31:42.781 --> 02:31:43.680
show up for court date.

2800
02:31:44.280 --> 02:31:47.430
Then what incentive do they have to show up for that court date? You know,

2801
02:31:47.431 --> 02:31:50.830
and they just don't. So, and we're talking, you know, Jesus,

2802
02:31:50.831 --> 02:31:53.700
in the earlier part of this year we had over a hundred thousand a month.

2803
02:31:54.120 --> 02:31:57.270
So it gets to a question of sustainability. Let's say all,

2804
02:31:57.271 --> 02:32:00.990
let's say all 100,000 people are perfectly good people, but it's sustainable.

2805
02:32:00.991 --> 02:32:03.990
It's a sustainability question. And it's also a fairness question.

2806
02:32:04.440 --> 02:32:06.720
Like why do they get to cut in front of the illegal immigrants?

2807
02:32:06.960 --> 02:32:11.960
Why do they get so much more priority over all of the other people who want to

2808
02:32:12.001 --> 02:32:14.580
be in our country around the world? I mean,

2809
02:32:14.581 --> 02:32:16.980
they don't have that opportunity just walk across the border. So it's just,

2810
02:32:16.981 --> 02:32:18.780
it's just completely, it's utterly unsustainable.

2811
02:32:18.781 --> 02:32:21.120
And if we value a sense of sovereignty and rule of law,

2812
02:32:21.660 --> 02:32:25.020
but I think we should and we value the idea of having a managed system,

2813
02:32:25.021 --> 02:32:27.960
then we have to put a stop to that and then have a good conversation about,

2814
02:32:28.160 --> 02:32:31.230
well, maybe we need more workers. Okay, well then let's increase worker visas.

2815
02:32:31.231 --> 02:32:32.100
If that's true. Well,

2816
02:32:32.101 --> 02:32:35.430
I think we show sympathy about on them because they're poor people that are

2817
02:32:35.431 --> 02:32:37.170
trying to do better for their life.

2818
02:32:37.200 --> 02:32:42.200
Whereas we look at people that are coming over from Canada and if we had 100,000

2819
02:32:42.241 --> 02:32:45.480
people from Canada illegally immigrating into our country every year,

2820
02:32:45.610 --> 02:32:48.240
we would go, Hey Fox, get back over where you are. Like,

2821
02:32:48.290 --> 02:32:49.680
do you guys have a great country already?

2822
02:32:49.681 --> 02:32:52.440
You don't have the problem of a lack of opportunity in Canada,

2823
02:32:52.441 --> 02:32:54.090
the way people do in Mexico.

2824
02:32:54.290 --> 02:32:59.290
There's a giant disparity between North America in terms of like a United States

2825
02:33:00.120 --> 02:33:04.590
of America and Mexico. The economic possibilities, the the sheriff,

2826
02:33:05.280 --> 02:33:07.500
the drug violence law, our laws,

2827
02:33:07.620 --> 02:33:11.310
our laws have to be written blind to those subjective terminology. Sure.

2828
02:33:11.370 --> 02:33:14.190
You know, and that's, that's really important because otherwise why have them,

2829
02:33:14.191 --> 02:33:16.110
like why, why even have a system at all? If you just,

2830
02:33:16.111 --> 02:33:18.210
if it's enforced based on feelings,

2831
02:33:18.240 --> 02:33:22.590
the best case scenario would be Mexico becomes like Canada, right?

2832
02:33:22.620 --> 02:33:24.230
Wouldn't that be the best case scenario? Mexico.

2833
02:33:24.280 --> 02:33:27.900
Mexicans are not the one ones that are actually, we're having an issue.

2834
02:33:27.901 --> 02:33:31.140
You know, it's, it's vastly central Americans. So again,

2835
02:33:31.141 --> 02:33:34.740
this stems from loopholes in our laws. OK. So, uh,

2836
02:33:35.070 --> 02:33:38.080
cause I'm Mexican too because they're actually border us, right?

2837
02:33:38.550 --> 02:33:41.790
Our laws work where we can actually just put them right back. For the most part,

2838
02:33:41.820 --> 02:33:45.570
a single adults to weaken our system works okay with that.

2839
02:33:46.050 --> 02:33:48.390
The problem is if you bring a child, and so every,

2840
02:33:48.391 --> 02:33:50.280
so everybody tends to bring a child in.

2841
02:33:50.281 --> 02:33:52.500
What this also causes is human trafficking.

2842
02:33:52.830 --> 02:33:55.200
A lot of these children don't belong to these parents. Okay.

2843
02:33:55.201 --> 02:33:58.200
So now we have to look at DNA testing to try and to try and forth this.

2844
02:33:58.201 --> 02:33:59.340
And that is what's happening now.

2845
02:33:59.341 --> 02:34:02.580
And we find that good amount of kids don't belong to these parents.

2846
02:34:02.700 --> 02:34:05.100
So they bring over a kid in order for them to stay.

2847
02:34:05.310 --> 02:34:07.350
And what will happen is they'll recycle that kid.

2848
02:34:07.380 --> 02:34:11.670
So border patrol often sees the same kid coming through with different adults in

2849
02:34:11.880 --> 02:34:14.430
and out and it's, it's terrible. And what other kinds, I mean,

2850
02:34:14.431 --> 02:34:15.720
if it's not Mexico, what are the,

2851
02:34:15.750 --> 02:34:18.310
the main countries where these people calling in Guatemala, Honduras,

2852
02:34:18.311 --> 02:34:20.770
El Salvador. And again,

2853
02:34:20.890 --> 02:34:25.890
it seems like the only way that anyone could really truly fix that is if those

2854
02:34:26.531 --> 02:34:31.240
countries could rise up to the level of Canada so they could be commensurate

2855
02:34:31.241 --> 02:34:34.360
with the United States. And this is what the left says we need to do.

2856
02:34:34.361 --> 02:34:36.100
And I don't disagree with it at all. Uh,

2857
02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:38.950
the problem with what the left is suggesting is that's the only thing we need to

2858
02:34:38.951 --> 02:34:42.720
do. And that's just not true. We also have to enforce our actual laws, but that,

2859
02:34:42.910 --> 02:34:45.170
but it's, but it is a bipartisan, I think, agreement that we,

2860
02:34:45.190 --> 02:34:48.930
we want to develop the countries closest to us. Uh,

2861
02:34:48.950 --> 02:34:51.540
I'm on a call MCO sponsoring a bill that touches does just that.

2862
02:34:51.690 --> 02:34:53.600
It's a bipartisan bill. Um,

2863
02:34:53.860 --> 02:34:57.340
and I think it encourages a more creative look at development in the central

2864
02:34:57.341 --> 02:34:58.510
America. Uh,

2865
02:34:58.511 --> 02:35:01.480
the Bush Institute is talks about this a lot and I think it's a really good

2866
02:35:01.481 --> 02:35:04.930
idea, which is basically economic empowerment through,

2867
02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:08.470
through digital infrastructure. So here in America, I mean,

2868
02:35:08.500 --> 02:35:12.130
we made a lot of money just based on the gig economy and every individual can

2869
02:35:12.131 --> 02:35:15.580
empower themselves and work towards that. And it's really cool. Uh,

2870
02:35:15.581 --> 02:35:17.050
they don't have that opportunity down there.

2871
02:35:17.140 --> 02:35:21.310
And it's a lack of digital infrastructure, whether it's broadband or whatever.

2872
02:35:21.970 --> 02:35:24.820
Um, so working towards investing in the right things as opposed to just, Hey,

2873
02:35:24.950 --> 02:35:26.560
here's some aid that, that your,

2874
02:35:26.740 --> 02:35:28.870
your corrupt politicians can line their pockets with.

2875
02:35:29.140 --> 02:35:31.240
And we can feel good about ourselves and Pat ourselves on the back and think

2876
02:35:31.241 --> 02:35:33.700
like, we're doing good for other countries, but we're really not, again,

2877
02:35:33.910 --> 02:35:37.120
feel good or do good. That's always a good question to ask. And so I think,

2878
02:35:37.121 --> 02:35:40.030
I think we're, I think we're working towards this solutions in Congress now.

2879
02:35:40.570 --> 02:35:43.270
Dan, we've got gotta get you on your flight, so I'm going to let you go.

2880
02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:47.220
So it's already three 20 here. That's sad. That's sad. But other than fun,

2881
02:35:47.300 --> 02:35:48.910
it was a great conversation. I really appreciate it.

2882
02:35:48.911 --> 02:35:52.030
And thank you very much for your time and thank you, Dan Crenshaw.

2883
02:35:52.031 --> 02:35:53.290
Ladies and gentlemen. Goodbye.

2884
