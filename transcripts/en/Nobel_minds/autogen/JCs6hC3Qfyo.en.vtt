two different food cultures and I think
 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.360
two different food cultures and I think
Edward II your you are Brazil kind of

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370
Edward II your you are Brazil kind of
 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.970
Edward II your you are Brazil kind of
epitomizes that dilemma of having to

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980
epitomizes that dilemma of having to
 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.390
epitomizes that dilemma of having to
deal with with this this process of

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400
deal with with this this process of
 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.729
deal with with this this process of
change and and you in the Health

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739
change and and you in the Health
 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.640
change and and you in the Health
Ministry have really tried to take on

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650
Ministry have really tried to take on
 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.520
Ministry have really tried to take on
board this idea that we don't just need

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530
board this idea that we don't just need
 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.479
board this idea that we don't just need
a healthy diet ABC this is what you

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489
a healthy diet ABC this is what you
 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.280
a healthy diet ABC this is what you
should be eating along the kind of us

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290
should be eating along the kind of us
 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.320
should be eating along the kind of us
dietary model but it is actually quite

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330
dietary model but it is actually quite
 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.040
dietary model but it is actually quite
radical in the way that it talks about

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050
radical in the way that it talks about
 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.720
radical in the way that it talks about
reconfiguring the way we eat do you

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730
reconfiguring the way we eat do you
 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.580
reconfiguring the way we eat do you
to say a bit about those guidelines but

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590
to say a bit about those guidelines but
 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.600
to say a bit about those guidelines but
also you know if I get a piece of paper

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610
also you know if I get a piece of paper
 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.370
also you know if I get a piece of paper
that tells me how I should be eating

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380
that tells me how I should be eating
 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.630
that tells me how I should be eating
it's not as if I'm going to run off and

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640
it's not as if I'm going to run off and
 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.600
it's not as if I'm going to run off and
do that what what else do you need to do

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610
do that what what else do you need to do
 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.120
do that what what else do you need to do
to make that vision turn into reality

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130
to make that vision turn into reality
 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.850
to make that vision turn into reality
and what are you doing yeah it's

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860
and what are you doing yeah it's
 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.040
and what are you doing yeah it's
actually a big challenge that not only

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050
actually a big challenge that not only
 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.360
actually a big challenge that not only
in Brazil but most of the world

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370
in Brazil but most of the world
 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.160
in Brazil but most of the world
specially Latin America we have

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170
specially Latin America we have
 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.070
specially Latin America we have
transition very quickly from

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080
transition very quickly from
 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.800
transition very quickly from
malnutrition to overeating obesity

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810
malnutrition to overeating obesity
 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.710
malnutrition to overeating obesity
chronic diseases and that was actually

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720
chronic diseases and that was actually
 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.450
chronic diseases and that was actually
led to what we're working in terms of

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460
led to what we're working in terms of
 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.570
led to what we're working in terms of
food guidelines which is not making

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580
food guidelines which is not making
 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.700
food guidelines which is not making
nutrition of nutrients but making

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710
nutrition of nutrients but making
 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.100
nutrition of nutrients but making
nutrition of foods and meals and that is

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110
nutrition of foods and meals and that is
 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.100
nutrition of foods and meals and that is
a huge twist because it affects how you

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110
a huge twist because it affects how you
 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.830
a huge twist because it affects how you
view the food system or food systems

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840
view the food system or food systems
 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.880
view the food system or food systems
because ultimately our food choices they

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890
because ultimately our food choices they
 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.470
because ultimately our food choices they
bring everything behind it from the

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480
bring everything behind it from the
 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.930
bring everything behind it from the
production from the distribution

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940
production from the distribution
 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.550
production from the distribution
consumption and even preparation of the

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560
consumption and even preparation of the
 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.100
consumption and even preparation of the
the food so we actually classify the

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110
the food so we actually classify the
 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.800
the food so we actually classify the
foods differently based on how much

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810
foods differently based on how much
 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.750
foods differently based on how much
their process and the soul from net

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760
their process and the soul from net
 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.210
their process and the soul from net
natural minimally processed foods to

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220
natural minimally processed foods to
 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.160
natural minimally processed foods to
ultra processed foods which we call and

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170
ultra processed foods which we call and
 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.800
ultra processed foods which we call and
that brings a whole pattern of diets

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810
that brings a whole pattern of diets
 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.350
that brings a whole pattern of diets
along with it so speaking from a

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360
along with it so speaking from a
 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.790
along with it so speaking from a
government point of view it's a really

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800
government point of view it's a really
 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.560
government point of view it's a really
huge challenge of how governments can

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570
huge challenge of how governments can
 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.080
huge challenge of how governments can
actually change the system not only in

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090
actually change the system not only in
 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.300
actually change the system not only in
terms of the health outcomes but also in

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310
terms of the health outcomes but also in
 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.280
terms of the health outcomes but also in
terms of the environment and in terms of

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290
terms of the environment and in terms of
 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.680
terms of the environment and in terms of
social aspects and that's what we're

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690
social aspects and that's what we're
 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.970
social aspects and that's what we're
actually working because from the

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980
actually working because from the
 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.410
actually working because from the
governor point of view have to work on

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420
governor point of view have to work on
 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.290
governor point of view have to work on
promoting healthy settings of course but

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300
promoting healthy settings of course but
 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.640
promoting healthy settings of course but
you also have to affect somehow

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650
you also have to affect somehow
 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.070
you also have to affect somehow
regulating the system of course and that

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080
regulating the system of course and that
 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.850
regulating the system of course and that
comes to the policies of taxation of

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860
comes to the policies of taxation of
 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.830
comes to the policies of taxation of
subsidizing healthy foods and improving

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840
subsidizing healthy foods and improving
 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.660
subsidizing healthy foods and improving
access to healthy food to have a healthy

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670
access to healthy food to have a healthy
 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.520
access to healthy food to have a healthy
environment but also to protect some

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530
environment but also to protect some
 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.020
environment but also to protect some
specific environments at schools for

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030
specific environments at schools for
 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.720
specific environments at schools for
instance and other ones but also how to

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:14.730
instance and other ones but also how to
 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.700
instance and other ones but also how to
educate populations there so they can

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710
educate populations there so they can
 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.890
educate populations there so they can
make the right choices but based on

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900
make the right choices but based on
 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.780
make the right choices but based on
foods because that's what we found out

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790
foods because that's what we found out
 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.150
foods because that's what we found out
them because of the guidelines although

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160
them because of the guidelines although
 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.850
them because of the guidelines although
it's radical but it's very close to

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860
it's radical but it's very close to
 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.290
it's radical but it's very close to
reality because it was based on the

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300
reality because it was based on the
 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.180
reality because it was based on the
actual diet of the population of Brazil

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190
actual diet of the population of Brazil
 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.950
actual diet of the population of Brazil
and it could actually be fitted to other

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960
and it could actually be fitted to other
 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.810
and it could actually be fitted to other
contexts essere if you take an account

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820
contexts essere if you take an account
 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.100
contexts essere if you take an account
what the healthiest part of the

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110
what the healthiest part of the
 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.500
what the healthiest part of the
population are consuming so you can make

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510
population are consuming so you can make
 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.300
population are consuming so you can make
that in terms of food and try to address

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310
that in terms of food and try to address
 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.870
that in terms of food and try to address
the whole environment in

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880
the whole environment in
 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.480
the whole environment in
and that mean so you can work on

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490
and that mean so you can work on
 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.350
and that mean so you can work on
production and supply and have the whole

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360
production and supply and have the whole
 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.510
production and supply and have the whole
opportunity for consumers to be informed

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520
opportunity for consumers to be informed
 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.370
opportunity for consumers to be informed
but also to know where the food comes

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380
but also to know where the food comes
 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.950
but also to know where the food comes
from how it's made and make the right

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960
from how it's made and make the right
 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.200
from how it's made and make the right
decisions based on all this environment

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210
decisions based on all this environment
 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.710
decisions based on all this environment
but so I mean there's a growing emphasis

00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720
but so I mean there's a growing emphasis
 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.350
but so I mean there's a growing emphasis
on the importance of the sort of

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360
on the importance of the sort of
 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.300
on the importance of the sort of
socio-economic structures that frame and

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.310
socio-economic structures that frame and
 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.430
socio-economic structures that frame and
influence our consumption patterns and

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440
influence our consumption patterns and
 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.250
influence our consumption patterns and
but I suppose that you could that almost

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:08.260
but I suppose that you could that almost
 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.530
but I suppose that you could that almost

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:10.540
takes the individual out of the equation
 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.290
takes the individual out of the equation
and says the individual has absolutely

and says the individual has absolutely

and says the individual has absolutely
no control and what it is they eat and I

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:15.700
no control and what it is they eat and I
 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.820
no control and what it is they eat and I
think that's probably oversimplifying

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:17.830
think that's probably oversimplifying
 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.370
think that's probably oversimplifying
the the issue and but if you are going

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:20.380
the the issue and but if you are going
 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.340
the the issue and but if you are going
to take the individual down a stage to

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:23.350
to take the individual down a stage to
 

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.930
to take the individual down a stage to
the kind of the genetic and the

the kind of the genetic and the

biological level let's do do you think
 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.750
biological level let's do do you think
there is any validity in the idea that

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:30.760
there is any validity in the idea that
 

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.630
there is any validity in the idea that
we're we're sort of programmed to want

we're we're sort of programmed to want
 

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.220
