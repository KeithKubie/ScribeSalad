NARRATOR: Al Gore may not have
invented the internet

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.000
but you can thank the United
States Military for it.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.380
That's right.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.500
You can thank the US
Government for Tinder.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.210
The US Government helped
create the internet.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.540
Here's how.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.710
1957, 10 years into the
Cold War between the United

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.580
States and the Soviet Union.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.330
The battleground was
technological superiority

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.080
and Americans had
the upper hand.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.250
That is until the
Soviets launched

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.500
the Sputnik 1 satellite.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.080
In response, the military
created the Advanced Research

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.420
Projects Agency, or ARPA, to
develop new military technology

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.420
and put America back on top.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.380
The US Military was worried
a nuclear first strike

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.750
from the Soviets might wipe
out their communication

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.580
system, leaving the
US unable to respond.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.250
So they set out to create a
protected emergency system.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.210
They established computer
research centers at leading

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.880
scientific universities.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.210
But computer scientists
needed to connect

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.710
these geographically separate
systems so that they could

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.380
share research and information.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.460
In 1966, the ARPANET program
headed by Larry Roberts

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.120
began work.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.290
On October 29, 1969,
the first message

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.750
was sent across the ARPANET
from UCLA to Stanford.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.080
UCLA student, Charley
Kline, started typing log in

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.750
and typed L - O before
the system crashed.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.290
In 1970, the Network Control
Program was released.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.920
The network expanded
from 10 smaller computer

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.710
networks, or nodes,
in December 1970

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.040
to 15 nodes four months later.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.080
By 1972, there were 19 nodes
linked together and ARPANET.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.210
But it still wasn't
used all that much.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.170
Each host computer essentially
spoke a different language.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.960
And most users only knew the
language of their own host.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.120
ARPANET needed a way
for the computers

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.500
to talk to each other.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.670
So scientists began
meeting to discuss

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.790
both technical and philosophical
aspects of the network

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.580
and formed the
Network Working Group.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.620
In late 1971, the first
user-to-user email was sent

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.750
and mailing lists spread
across the network.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.120
By 1973, email accounted for
75% of traffic on ARPANET.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.670
Meanwhile, other networks were
being built around the world,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.500
but they had no way
to talk to each other.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.830
So in 1974, Robert
Kahn and Vint Cerf

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.040
presented the Transmission
Control Protocol slash Internet

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.960
Protocol or TCP/IP,
which acts kind

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.540
of like a handshake that
introduces distant computers

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.880
to each other.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.000
And it makes today's
internet possible.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.120
But the internet of 1974 still
wasn't something just anyone

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.170
could use until Tim
Berners-Lee created

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.710
the World Wide Web in 1989.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.040
So while Al Gore may have been
the first politician to really

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.880
support and promote
awareness for the internet,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.460
its invention came long before.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.170
And it would not have been
possible without the pioneering

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.380
researchers and hackers who knew
computer networks could do more

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.960
than launch a counter-strike.
