think it's reasonable that only the

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070
think it's reasonable that only the
 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.860
think it's reasonable that only the
police and the army should be allowed to

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870
police and the army should be allowed to
 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.340

having said that well I think I'll just

having said that well I think I'll just
 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.350
having said that well I think I'll just
leave it at that I mean I feel obligated

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360
leave it at that I mean I feel obligated
 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.990
leave it at that I mean I feel obligated
in some sense to go farther especially

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000
in some sense to go farther especially
 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.550
in some sense to go farther especially
with regards to what happened in Las

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560
with regards to what happened in Las
 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.540
with regards to what happened in Las
Vegas but it seems to me that most of

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550
Vegas but it seems to me that most of
 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.130
Vegas but it seems to me that most of
what happens after these mass shootings

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140
what happens after these mass shootings
 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.230
what happens after these mass shootings
is that the event gets absolutely

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240
is that the event gets absolutely
 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.630
is that the event gets absolutely
politicized and people take their

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640
politicized and people take their
 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.060
politicized and people take their
standard positions and there's no moving

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070
standard positions and there's no moving
 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:45.330
standard positions and there's no moving
either side and that's too bad but

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340
 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.820
I think that it's unfortunate to use an

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830
I think that it's unfortunate to use an
 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.949
I think that it's unfortunate to use an
event like the Las Vegas event or the

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959
event like the Las Vegas event or the
 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.540
event like the Las Vegas event or the
Columbine shootings to make political

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550
Columbine shootings to make political
 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.910
Columbine shootings to make political
capital and I think that's usually what

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920
capital and I think that's usually what
 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.220
capital and I think that's usually what
happens and so I'm not going to do that

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230
happens and so I'm not going to do that
 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.080
happens and so I'm not going to do that
I think it's an important right I

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090
I think it's an important right I
 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.940
I think it's an important right I
believe that the individual should be

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950
believe that the individual should be
 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.770
believe that the individual should be
allowed or even encouraged to be

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780
allowed or even encouraged to be
 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.250
allowed or even encouraged to be
dangerous but controlled you know so

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260
dangerous but controlled you know so
 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.199
dangerous but controlled you know so
along with that right is a

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209
along with that right is a
 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.270
along with that right is a
responsibility and and I guess maybe

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280
responsibility and and I guess maybe
 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.460
responsibility and and I guess maybe
from the NRA there should be more

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470
from the NRA there should be more
 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.440
from the NRA there should be more
discussion of responsibility is that

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450
discussion of responsibility is that
 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.720
discussion of responsibility is that
possible that seems to me to be

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730
possible that seems to me to be
 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.959
possible that seems to me to be
reasonable so
