developer relations team in this episode
we are looking at the hierarchy viewer

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080
we are looking at the hierarchy viewer
 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.990
we are looking at the hierarchy viewer
and how you can use their tool to fix

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000
and how you can use their tool to fix
 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.970
and how you can use their tool to fix
overdraw issues in your application so

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980
overdraw issues in your application so
 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.349
overdraw issues in your application so
let's have a look at our demo

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359
let's have a look at our demo
 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.900
let's have a look at our demo
application here so this is a looks a

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910
application here so this is a looks a
 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.429
application here so this is a looks a
bit like an ass as frida we're calling

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439
bit like an ass as frida we're calling
 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.349
bit like an ass as frida we're calling
it the bacon reader application so you

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359
it the bacon reader application so you
 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.120
it the bacon reader application so you
can select articles here on the side and

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130
can select articles here on the side and
 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.070
can select articles here on the side and
you can you know you can read some text

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080
you can you know you can read some text
 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.589
you can you know you can read some text
here in this frame here this is quite

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599
here in this frame here this is quite
 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.440
here in this frame here this is quite
standard Android layout there we have a

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450
standard Android layout there we have a
 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.150
standard Android layout there we have a
fragment here for the list on the side

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160
fragment here for the list on the side
 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.220
fragment here for the list on the side
and we have one fragment here on the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230
and we have one fragment here on the
 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.580
and we have one fragment here on the
right-hand side for the full domain

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590
right-hand side for the full domain
 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.130
right-hand side for the full domain
content so let's look at hierarchy view

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140
content so let's look at hierarchy view
 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.200
content so let's look at hierarchy view
and I will show you how this application

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
and I will show you how this application
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.310
and I will show you how this application
what the application looks like in

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320
what the application looks like in
 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.130
what the application looks like in
hierarchy viewer so the the hierarchy

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140
hierarchy viewer so the the hierarchy
 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.510
hierarchy viewer so the the hierarchy
viewer application is part of the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520
viewer application is part of the
 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.700
viewer application is part of the
Android device monitor you can simply

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710
Android device monitor you can simply
 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.229
Android device monitor you can simply
open open it up by clicking on the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239
open open it up by clicking on the
 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.080
open open it up by clicking on the
hierarchy viewer button up here so once

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090
hierarchy viewer button up here so once
 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.849
hierarchy viewer button up here so once
you float it in your application you've

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859
you float it in your application you've
 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:00:59.990
you float it in your application you've
selected it we have selected your

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000
selected it we have selected your
 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.049
selected it we have selected your
activity you get this tree up here and

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059
activity you get this tree up here and
 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.910
activity you get this tree up here and
this tree basically shows you what there

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920
this tree basically shows you what there
 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.320
this tree basically shows you what there
what you have used in your application

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330
what you have used in your application
 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.810
what you have used in your application
actually looked like so in this case

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820
actually looked like so in this case
 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.280
actually looked like so in this case
here you can see we have a linear layout

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290
here you can see we have a linear layout
 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.929
here you can see we have a linear layout
and this is your app or entire

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939
and this is your app or entire
 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.060
and this is your app or entire
application lives so we can we can drill

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070
application lives so we can we can drill
 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.310
application lives so we can we can drill
down a bit further so you can see here

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320
down a bit further so you can see here
 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.899
down a bit further so you can see here
we have a list view and it is coming

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909
we have a list view and it is coming
 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.100
we have a list view and it is coming
from the fragment that we have on the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110
from the fragment that we have on the
 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.899
from the fragment that we have on the
left hand side and you can see here this

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909
left hand side and you can see here this
 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.660
left hand side and you can see here this
is this is what we have in this in this

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670
is this is what we have in this in this
 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.130
is this is what we have in this in this
list which is what what's drawn inside

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
list which is what what's drawn inside
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.039
list which is what what's drawn inside
it and we also notice that we have these

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049
it and we also notice that we have these
 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.469
it and we also notice that we have these
these these colored dots here and these

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479
these these colored dots here and these
 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.080
these these colored dots here and these
dots indicate how how quickly each of

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090
dots indicate how how quickly each of
 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.390
dots indicate how how quickly each of
these views was drawn so green means it

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400
these views was drawn so green means it
 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.850
these views was drawn so green means it
was very fast yellow means it was drawn

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860
was very fast yellow means it was drawn
 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.060
was very fast yellow means it was drawn
it was fast and 50% of the views and the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070
it was fast and 50% of the views and the
 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.560
it was fast and 50% of the views and the
red means it's one of the slowest trees

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570
red means it's one of the slowest trees
 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.600
red means it's one of the slowest trees
in your view hierarchy so this is

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
in your view hierarchy so this is
 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.069
in your view hierarchy so this is
actually quite a nice true true that

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079
actually quite a nice true true that
 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.109
actually quite a nice true true that
allows you to drill down and see what

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119
allows you to drill down and see what
 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.789
allows you to drill down and see what
your application actually looks like

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799
your application actually looks like
 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.410
your application actually looks like
when you run it and it particular when

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420
when you run it and it particular when
 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.609
when you run it and it particular when
you use some more complicated layout

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619
you use some more complicated layout
 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.350
you use some more complicated layout
this really helps you troubleshoot some

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360
this really helps you troubleshoot some
 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.800
this really helps you troubleshoot some
of the layout issues so if you want to

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810
of the layout issues so if you want to
 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.120
of the layout issues so if you want to
use the hierarchy viewer in your own

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130
use the hierarchy viewer in your own
 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.399
use the hierarchy viewer in your own
application you have to include the view

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409
application you have to include the view
 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.100
application you have to include the view
server class in your application you can

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110
server class in your application you can
 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.450
server class in your application you can
get it from this website down here

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460
get it from this website down here
 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.219
get it from this website down here
that's on the screen and I'll show you

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229
that's on the screen and I'll show you
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.260
that's on the screen and I'll show you
what that looks like so you basic just

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270
what that looks like so you basic just
 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.510
what that looks like so you basic just
drop it into your application in this

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
drop it into your application in this
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.250
drop it into your application in this
case you an Android studio and then you

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260
case you an Android studio and then you
 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.000
case you an Android studio and then you
have to add a few

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010
have to add a few
 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.160
have to add a few
inside your activity lifecycle and the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170
inside your activity lifecycle and the
 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.600
inside your activity lifecycle and the
activity you want to look at it but in

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610
activity you want to look at it but in
 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.580
activity you want to look at it but in
more detail so you have to add a call in

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590
more detail so you have to add a call in
 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.550
more detail so you have to add a call in
the oncreate method and in ondestroy

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560
the oncreate method and in ondestroy
 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.250
the oncreate method and in ondestroy
and in on resume and that allows you

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260
and in on resume and that allows you
 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.770
and in on resume and that allows you
allows the hierarchy view to connect to

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780
allows the hierarchy view to connect to
 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.449
allows the hierarchy view to connect to
your application and load in the views

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459
your application and load in the views
 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.770
your application and load in the views
justice as we've seen so let's see how

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780
justice as we've seen so let's see how
 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.990
justice as we've seen so let's see how
we can use the hierarchy viewer to debug

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000
we can use the hierarchy viewer to debug
 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.670
we can use the hierarchy viewer to debug
one very common problem that you often

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680
one very common problem that you often
 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.740
one very common problem that you often
have any application in this code over

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750
have any application in this code over
 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.479
have any application in this code over
draw and over draw means that you've

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489
draw and over draw means that you've
 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.460
draw and over draw means that you've
drawn the same pics in multiple times on

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470
drawn the same pics in multiple times on
 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.900
drawn the same pics in multiple times on
the screen and obviously that's really

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910
the screen and obviously that's really
 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.390
the screen and obviously that's really
bad before for performance especially if

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400
bad before for performance especially if
 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.860
bad before for performance especially if
you define a background multiple times

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870
you define a background multiple times
 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.090
you define a background multiple times
and it's always the same color doesn't

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100
and it's always the same color doesn't
 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.350
and it's always the same color doesn't
make much sense to draw it multiple

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360
make much sense to draw it multiple
 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.690
make much sense to draw it multiple
times on the screen so if you go to the

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700
times on the screen so if you go to the
 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.930
times on the screen so if you go to the
developer options on your device there

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940
developer options on your device there
 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.699
developer options on your device there
is an option called show GPU overdraw

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709
is an option called show GPU overdraw
 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.710
is an option called show GPU overdraw
and that that gives you a nice visual

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720
and that that gives you a nice visual
 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.360
and that that gives you a nice visual
indication of which pixels you draw

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370
indication of which pixels you draw
 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.090
indication of which pixels you draw
multiple times red and green means to

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100
multiple times red and green means to
 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.190
multiple times red and green means to
draw on it once or twice and then light

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200
draw on it once or twice and then light
 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.020
draw on it once or twice and then light
red and red means you draw get more than

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030
red and red means you draw get more than
 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.640
red and red means you draw get more than
three four five times that's obviously

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650
three four five times that's obviously
 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.680
three four five times that's obviously
really bad for your application and if

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690
really bad for your application and if
 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.110
really bad for your application and if
you look here at our app you can see

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120
you look here at our app you can see
 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.870
you look here at our app you can see
that we have the background of the each

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880
that we have the background of the each
 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.610
that we have the background of the each
of the ListView items is thrown multiple

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620
of the ListView items is thrown multiple
 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.410
of the ListView items is thrown multiple
times and then we also have a real two

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420
times and then we also have a real two
 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.140
times and then we also have a real two
rectangle behind our main body of text

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150
rectangle behind our main body of text
 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.360
rectangle behind our main body of text
and if we remember our application was

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370
and if we remember our application was
 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.740
and if we remember our application was
completely right you know we're not

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750
completely right you know we're not
 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.360
completely right you know we're not
using any background color so anything

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370
using any background color so anything
 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.770
using any background color so anything
else whatsoever there's clearly

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780
else whatsoever there's clearly
 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.970
else whatsoever there's clearly
something going on that we can optimize

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980
something going on that we can optimize
 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.729
something going on that we can optimize
here so let's have a look at the

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739
here so let's have a look at the
 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.500
here so let's have a look at the
hierarchy view and see how we can use it

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510
hierarchy view and see how we can use it
 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.780
hierarchy view and see how we can use it
to to figure out what exactly is going

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790
to to figure out what exactly is going
 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.740
to to figure out what exactly is going
on here so here's our hierarchy viewer

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750
on here so here's our hierarchy viewer
 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.660
on here so here's our hierarchy viewer
here's our linear layout that defines

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670
here's our linear layout that defines
 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.620
here's our linear layout that defines
the right-hand side of the application

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630
the right-hand side of the application
 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.130
the right-hand side of the application
the the details fragment and you can see

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140
the the details fragment and you can see
 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.720
the the details fragment and you can see
here that we have a white background

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730
here that we have a white background
 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.840
here that we have a white background
behind the behind the main body of text

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850
behind the behind the main body of text
 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.490
behind the behind the main body of text
so that's that's the problem because we

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500
so that's that's the problem because we
 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.020
so that's that's the problem because we
already have a main background defined

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030
already have a main background defined
 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.759
already have a main background defined
in the application so this is something

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769
in the application so this is something
 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.309
in the application so this is something
we should investigate a bit further if

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319
we should investigate a bit further if
 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.449
we should investigate a bit further if
you click on the article boy down here

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459
you click on the article boy down here
 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.650
you click on the article boy down here
you can clearly see there's a white

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660
you can clearly see there's a white
 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.809
you can clearly see there's a white
background behind it so that's one way

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819
background behind it so that's one way
 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.360
background behind it so that's one way
you can see what's being drawn on-screen

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370
you can see what's being drawn on-screen
 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.220
you can see what's being drawn on-screen
another really useful feature is the

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230
another really useful feature is the
 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.410
another really useful feature is the
option to export your entire view layers

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420
option to export your entire view layers
 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.120
option to export your entire view layers
as a PSD file

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130
as a PSD file
 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.190
as a PSD file
so as this option up here and if you

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200
so as this option up here and if you
 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.500
so as this option up here and if you
click that you can save all window

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510
click that you can save all window
 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.479
click that you can save all window
layers as a Photoshop file and I've

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489
layers as a Photoshop file and I've
 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.920
layers as a Photoshop file and I've
already done this here if you open up

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930
already done this here if you open up
 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.170
already done this here if you open up
Photoshop that's what it looks like and

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180
Photoshop that's what it looks like and
 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.659
Photoshop that's what it looks like and
each of the layers in your view that's

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669
each of the layers in your view that's
 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.740
each of the layers in your view that's
visible on the screen

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750
visible on the screen
 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.440
visible on the screen
it's also visible in your in your

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450
it's also visible in your in your
 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.510
it's also visible in your in your
Photoshop file so down here we have two

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520
Photoshop file so down here we have two
 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.160
Photoshop file so down here we have two
decor view and that's the main window

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170
decor view and that's the main window
 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.380
decor view and that's the main window
background so if you turn it off you can

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390
background so if you turn it off you can
 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.480
background so if you turn it off you can
see there is still a lot of light but

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490
see there is still a lot of light but
 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.400
see there is still a lot of light but
the window background already was right

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410
the window background already was right
 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.830
the window background already was right
that's a bit strange and here we have a

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840
that's a bit strange and here we have a
 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.030
that's a bit strange and here we have a
linear layout that has a white

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040
linear layout that has a white
 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.220
linear layout that has a white
background it's again a bit strange if

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230
background it's again a bit strange if
 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.200
background it's again a bit strange if
another linear layout see this is coming

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210
another linear layout see this is coming
 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.790
another linear layout see this is coming
from each of our least three items and

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800
from each of our least three items and
 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.880
from each of our least three items and
again there's a background right here so

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890
again there's a background right here so
 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.710
again there's a background right here so
this is one way that you can use

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720
this is one way that you can use
 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.000
this is one way that you can use
hierarchy viewer to to see how your

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010
hierarchy viewer to to see how your
 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.120
hierarchy viewer to to see how your
views are drawn on on the screen another

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130
views are drawn on on the screen another
 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.560
views are drawn on on the screen another
really useful future I would like to

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570
really useful future I would like to
 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.230
really useful future I would like to
show you is this year so we have our

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240
show you is this year so we have our
 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.680
show you is this year so we have our
preview here that shows you what's this

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690
preview here that shows you what's this
 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.060
preview here that shows you what's this
particular view actually draws to the

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070
particular view actually draws to the
 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.740
particular view actually draws to the
screen and if you double click on this

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750
screen and if you double click on this
 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.810
screen and if you double click on this
you get you get a bigger view but you

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820
you get you get a bigger view but you
 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.790
you get you get a bigger view but you
can also change the background color of

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800
can also change the background color of
 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.950
can also change the background color of
that view so in this case because we

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960
that view so in this case because we
 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.440
that view so in this case because we
have defined virus or background color

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450
have defined virus or background color
 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.750
have defined virus or background color
for this layout for linear layout you

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760
for this layout for linear layout you
 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.440
for this layout for linear layout you
won't see any changes but this can also

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450
won't see any changes but this can also
 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.150
won't see any changes but this can also
help you to see what's transparent was

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160
help you to see what's transparent was
 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.580
help you to see what's transparent was
not transparent in your application so

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590
not transparent in your application so
 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.020
not transparent in your application so
let's fix this you know we don't need to

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030
let's fix this you know we don't need to
 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.090
let's fix this you know we don't need to
define the background multiple times so

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100
define the background multiple times so
 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.550
define the background multiple times so
if you look at our code let's go to

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560
if you look at our code let's go to
 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.100
if you look at our code let's go to
Android studio and the first thing you

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110
Android studio and the first thing you
 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.920
Android studio and the first thing you
want to fix up is the main background so

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930
want to fix up is the main background so
 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.230
want to fix up is the main background so
we had our two panes and if we remember

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240
we had our two panes and if we remember
 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.490
we had our two panes and if we remember
the wall suddenly our layout and all we

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500
the wall suddenly our layout and all we
 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.350
the wall suddenly our layout and all we
had a background so let's let's get rid

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360
had a background so let's let's get rid
 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.380
had a background so let's let's get rid
of that one first so that's coming from

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390
of that one first so that's coming from
 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.790
of that one first so that's coming from
the activity through pain XML and up

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800
the activity through pain XML and up
 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.500
the activity through pain XML and up
here you can see straight away we are

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510
here you can see straight away we are
 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.420
here you can see straight away we are
defining a background color you don't

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430
defining a background color you don't
 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.060
defining a background color you don't
need that can you get rid of that the

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070
need that can you get rid of that the
 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.330
need that can you get rid of that the
next thing we had we had a background

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340
next thing we had we had a background
 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.330
next thing we had we had a background
color in our article detail view you

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340
color in our article detail view you
 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.469
color in our article detail view you
know have it the body of text at the

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479
know have it the body of text at the
 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:12.440
know have it the body of text at the
bottom so let's get rid of that here as

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450
bottom so let's get rid of that here as
 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.860
bottom so let's get rid of that here as
well

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870
well
 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.110
well
color white let's just remove that and

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120
color white let's just remove that and
 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.980
color white let's just remove that and
then lastly we also had a background

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990
then lastly we also had a background
 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.560
then lastly we also had a background
color for each ListView item you know

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570
color for each ListView item you know
 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.719
color for each ListView item you know
the list of in the list of bacons on the

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729
the list of in the list of bacons on the
 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:26.360
the list of in the list of bacons on the
left hand side and our background is

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370
left hand side and our background is
 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.980
left hand side and our background is
actually it's selector drawable and you

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990
actually it's selector drawable and you
