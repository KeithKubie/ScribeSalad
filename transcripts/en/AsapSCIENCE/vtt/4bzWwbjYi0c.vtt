00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.779
With devastating hurricanes refugee crisis and the real possibility of nuclear war it can sometimes feel like the end is near

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.428
But what are the biggest threats to humanity and is there anything we can do to stop them?

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.269
Experts all over the world from the global challenges foundation in Stockholm

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.479
And the Center for study of existential risk at the University of Cambridge consider this question yearly using scientific research

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.329
Some risks lay millions of years into the future

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.749
like gamma-ray bursts caused by a star explosion

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.819
Which would destroy our ozone layer or even the over expansion or collapse of the entire universe?

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.269
Closer to home we have our Sun which will eventually become a red giant as it ages and engulf the entire planet

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.349
But even that isn't for another five billion years more imminent is an asteroid large enough to create a global catastrophe

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.750
Which is estimated to occur every?

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.719
120,000 years while none are currently expected to hit earth soon existing data is

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.680
Incomplete with a worldwide effort underway to search the skies

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.939
Should it happen it could create a global cooling event like the Ice Age

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.349
But even smaller asteroids could have a significant impact on both natural and human

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.130
Ecosystems - an even closer possibility is the supervolcano the devastation in pompeii from Mount Vesuvius?

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.319
Released around four kilometres cubed of magma, but these super volcanoes can release more than

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:27.839
500 kilometers cubed the real worry from this worldwide is the ash cloud which would block up the sunlight cooling the globe and crippling

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.360
agriculture the last known eruption occurred around

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.689
25,000 years ago in New Zealand and researchers predicted they occur every 30,000 to 50,000 years

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.310
Scientists are currently monitoring Yellowstone in the US as a future potential site

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.180
but not all of our threats are natural overpopulation can outstrip Earth's capacity to produce food and other resources and

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.060
Amplify the threat of infectious pandemics due to high densities perhaps with bioengineered diseases

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:02.549
Conversely evidence is already pointing to declining fertility rates will we see the human population gradually die out from lack of births or?

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.709
Will climate change beat this concern a rise of 3 degrees Celsius would be incredibly?

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.019
significant with most of Florida and Bangladesh underwater while several coastal cities would become

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.880
On top of this longer and more damaging wildfire seasons more destructive

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.120
hurricanes heat waves food insecurity and droughts all of which can impact and amplify incidences of

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.229
violence with nations already suffering from water and climate conditions, which ultimately impacted deteriorating economic conditions

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.899
Then there's nuclear war tensions over North Korea have brought this conflict to the forefront with over

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.849
7,000 known warheads between Russia and the US and nukes within the UK France

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.420
China India Pakistan Israel and North Korea the Doomsday Clock created by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:56.459
Represents the likeliness of a man-made global catastrophe though the clock more recently included climate change and some other developments that put humanity at risk

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.040
Emphasis is placed on nuclear war since its creation in 1947 the farthest

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:09.299
We've been from midnight or doomsday is in 1991 when the clock was 17 minutes to midnight today in

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.760
2017 the clock sits at

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.510
2.5 minutes to midnight the second closest it has ever been

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.899
Even a small nuclear war could create a nuclear winter

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.830
Which would cause global cooling and damage to the ozone layer that may ultimately create droughts that lasts more than a decade

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.880
But the greatest threat of all researchers currently believe it's artificial

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.230
intelligence if growth continues to become comparable to the industrial and agricultural

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.960
revolutions experts predict autonomous machines will attain near human level intelligence by

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.860
2075 and

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.720
even if these machines don't become malevolent or evil what happens when those programmed to kill fall into the wrong hands or

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.579
when AI programmed to do something good go about it with a destructive method

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.339
Thank you all so much for watching this video if you liked it make sure that you subscribe so you can see our videos that

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.120
Come out every Thursday

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.459
and we're gonna link some other videos over there that are similar to this one about how rich people are prepping for the apocalypse and

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.599
How to survive a nuclear war this year is almost over hang in there peace guys
