00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.139
The commonly held notion that WW1 was started
out of outrage over the assassination of Archduke

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.440
Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife Sophie
at the hands of the Serbian nationalist secret

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.660
society known as the “Black Hand” isn’t
entirely correct.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.280
In fact, the Emperor Franz Josef himself expressed
relief over the assassination because it rid

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.140
him of an heir that he deeply disliked.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.460
The Emperor commented that “God will not
be mocked.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.250
A higher power had put back the order I couldn’t
maintain.”

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.390
It wasn’t just the Emperor who was relieved;
it was reported by an Austrian newspaper that

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.070
the general consensus among the various political
circles was that the assassination, though

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.110
a tragedy, was for the best.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.350
As far as the Austrian people were concerned,
it was noted “The event almost failed to

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.559
make any impression whatever.

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.870
On Sunday and Monday, the crowds in Vienna
listened to music and drank wine as if nothing

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.940
had happened.”

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.429
So why go to war over an assassination if
nobody cared?

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:03.050
Because, while nobody seemed to much care
about the assassination itself, Austria-Hungary

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.140
had been looking for an excuse to wage a “preventative
war” against Serbia as a state in order

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.700
to weaken or destroy them so as to take back
territory in the Balkans that had been taken

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.980
during the Balkan Wars.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.360
They had not taken it back up to this point
because they lacked Germany’s support; without

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.320
that support, they feared Russia too much.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.270
(Russia had a treaty with Serbia.)

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.470
With the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand
and his wife on June of 1914, Austria-Hungary

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.890
was able to secure the promise from Germany
that it would aid in a war with Serbia and

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.070
possibly Russia, if Russia chose to enter
the fray.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.329
It should be noted here that Austria-Hungary
did not really expect Russia to enter the

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.049
fight as they expected this to be a very small
war that would be over quickly before Russia

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.789
would feel obligated to respond.

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.010
Now with Germany’s support if Russia did
enter the war, Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.509
to Serbia with remarkably severe terms that
Serbia would be sure to reject, thus giving

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.439
Austria-Hungary an excuse to go launch a limited
war on Serbia to reclaim territory in the

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:57.439
Balkans.

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.570
Surprisingly, Serbia responded relatively
well to the ultimatum, but they did dispute

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.460
a few clauses, giving Austria-Hungary the
excuse they needed to go to war.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.820
At this point, the following general series
of events happened due to a variety of existing

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.379
treaties between various nations, escalating
this minor clash into the first “Great War”.

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.870
WWI MapRussia, bound by their treaty with
Serbia, decided to come to Serbia’s aid.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.480
Germany, with the recent treaty with Austria-Hungary,
declared war on Russia.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.360
France, bound by an existing treaty with Russia,
now was at war with Germany by association.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.450
Germany then invaded neutral Belgium to have
easy access to France.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.000
Britain, allied with France with an existing
treaty, declared war against Germany.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.280
This was unexpected by Germany as they thought
Britain would stay out of the war due to the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.590
fact that the treaty with France was loosely
worded and not entirely binding.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.299
However, Britain also had a 75 year old treaty
with Belgium.

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.250
So because of both of these treaties, they
decided to declare war on Germany.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.599
With Britain now warring with Germany, Canada,
India, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.140
were obligated to enter the war as well.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.400
Japan then honored an existing treaty with
Britain and declared war on Germany.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.990
Austria-Hungary declared war on Japan for
declaring war on Germany.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.950
The U.S. tried to stay out of the war but
in 1917 decided to enter due to Germany’s

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.680
submarines hindering the United States’
commercial shipping.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.939
(The U.S. was shipping a lot of supplies to
the Allies.)

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:28.989
So in the end, a minor land dispute turned
into a lengthy war that resulted in the deaths

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.400
of over 17 million people, with another 20
million or so wounded.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.860
(The tail end of the war was also around the
same time the Spanish Flu was killing 50-100

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.980
million- yes million- people and infecting
roughly 1 in 4 humans.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.150
At the same time, the mysterious encephalitis
lethargica epidemic was killing about one

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.180
million more and leaving countless others
as human paperweights.)

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.040
While the war may have started for petty reasons,
the danger to those on the home front was

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.040
very real.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.230
Edward Thomas, the inspiration for the famous
poem “The Road Not Taken”, noted of this:

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.390
a sky of dark rough horizontal masses in N.W.
with a 1/3 moon bright and almost orange low

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.480
down clear of cloud and I thought of men east-ward
seeing it at the same moment.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.989
It seems foolish to have loved England up
to now without knowing it could perhaps be

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.800
ravaged and I could and perhaps would do nothing
to prevent it…

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.790
Something, I felt, had to be done before I
could look again composedly at English landscape…

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.720
So while up to this point he had been indifferent
to the politics behind the war, he now began

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.860
to consider that it really didn’t matter
what the war was being fought over; if the

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.580
land and all that was on it was directly threatened,
it needed defending if it was to be preserved.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.970
(For more on Edward Thomas and why Frost’s
point in “The Road Not Taken” is the opposite

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.340
of what most people think, see: Robert Frost’s
Almost Universally Misinterpreted Poem “The

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.310
Road Not Taken” and the Role it Played in
the Death of His Best Friend.)

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.790
So what does all this have to do with white
feathers?

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.410
The idea of a white feather being synonymous
with cowardice stretches back to at least

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.250
the 18th century, supposedly from the sport
of cock fighting, with the belief that cockerel’s

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.410
sporting these white feathers were poor fighters.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.530
Whether that’s really how the notion started
or not, over time a white feather came to

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.200
be associated with weakness and cowardice
in parts of Britain, notably appearing in

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.110
the 1902 novel The Four Feathers and the 1907
The White Feather.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.710
ArnoldBennettColliersWeeklyThis brings us
to August of 1914 when Vice-Admiral Charles

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.050
Penrose Fitzgerald came up with an idea to
bolster recruitment rates (at this point in

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.270
the war, enlisting was voluntary) – have
women present white feathers to any man on

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.210
the streets who wasn’t wearing a uniform.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.289
To help accomplish this goal, Fitzgerald recruited
a group of 30 women to hand out the feathers

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:52.430
to any man they saw out of uniform in his
home town of Folkestone, dubbing the newly

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.970
formed group “The Order of the White Feather”.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.960
When the British Press got wind of the campaign
and reported on it, many women across the

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.470
country reacted in kind and similarly began
handing out white feathers to any man they

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.970
saw in civilian clothes.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.430
This campaign was inflamed by numerous forms
of propaganda and rampant rumors about the

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.800
“Rape of Belgium“, graphically speaking
of Germans brutally torturing Belgium women

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.110
and children and implying the same would happen
in Britain if the men of the country didn’t

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.150
go to war.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.870
As one war poster stated, “Britain is Fighting
not only for Freedom in Europe, but to defend

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.480
your mothers, wives, and sisters from the
horrors of war!”

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.190
In a propaganda poster directed at women,
it stated “To the young women of London:

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.330
Is your ‘Best Boy’ wearing Khaki?

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.220
If not don’t YOU THINK he should be?

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.750
If your young man neglects his duty to his
King and Country, the time may come when he

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.539
will NEGLECT YOU!”

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:44.690
These types of campaigns worked remarkably
well.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.090
Journalist Helen Ball even went so far as
to write in 1916, “a husband lying in a

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.470
rough grave in France is easier to bear than
a ‘shirker by your side’.”

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:59.060
On a similar note, in a July of 1915 edition
of the Times, one Ethel M. penned a personal

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.120
column noting, “Jack FG.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.990
If you are not in khaki by the 20th I shall
cut you dead.”

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.600
As the Order of the White Feather grew, it
was reported that gangs of young “Feather

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.479
Girls” would go around handing feathers
out to men on the streets.

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:16.330
William Brooks noted of this (in an interview
he gave in 1993 about why he joined up to

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:17.360
fight in WW1 all those years ago),

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.260
Once war broke out the situation at home became
awful, because people did not like to see

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:26.690
men or lads of army age walking about in civilian
clothing, or not in uniform of some sort,

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.900
especially in a military town like Woolwich.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.979
Women were the worst.

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:33.281
They would come up to you in the street and
give you a white feather, or stick it in the

00:07:33.281 --> 00:07:34.389
lapel of your coat.

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:38.160
A white feather is the sign of cowardice,
so they meant you were a coward and that you

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.099
should be in the army doing your bit for king
and country.

00:07:41.099 --> 00:07:43.660
It got so bad it wasn’t safe to go out.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.759
So in 1915 at the age of seventeen I volunteered
under the Lord Derby scheme.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:51.669
Now that was a thing where once you applied
to join you were not called up at once, but

00:07:51.669 --> 00:07:54.360
were given a blue armband with a red crown
to wear.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.139
This told people that you were waiting to
be called up, and that kept you safe, or fairly

00:07:58.139 --> 00:08:01.729
safe, because if you were seen to be wearing
it for too long the abuse in the street would

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:02.800
soon start again.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.030
James Lovegrove, who was 16 when he joined
the war effort, wrote:

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.430
On my way to work one morning a group of women
surrounded me.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:12.229
They started shouting and yelling at me, calling
me all sorts of names for not being a soldier!

00:08:12.229 --> 00:08:13.780
Do you know what they did?

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.509
They struck a white feather in my coat, meaning
I was a coward.

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:19.270
Oh, I did feel dreadful, so ashamed.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.620
I went to the recruiting office.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.240
The sergeant there couldn’t stop laughing
at me, saying things like “Looking for your

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.110
father, sonny?”, and “Come back next year
when the war’s over!”

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:31.180
Well, I must have looked so crestfallen that
he said “Let’s check your measurements

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.180
again”.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.080
You see, I was five foot six inches and only
about eight and a half stone.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.610
This time he made me out to be about six feet
tall and twelve stone, at least, that is what

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:40.610
he wrote down.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.610
All lies of course – but I was in!”

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:46.260
In another example, architect William Weller
was the recipient of both a feather and the

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.810
then somewhat common associated shaming letter.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.861
Weller, had been excused from military service
due to a combination of illness, being in

00:08:52.861 --> 00:08:57.580
his 40’s, and the fact that he was helping
design and build homes for steel workers.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.750
This didn’t stop him from receiving the
following note in the mail with an included

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.920
white feather:

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.920
Sir,

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:07.050
Your gallant and protracted defence against
the brutal attacks of the local tribunal has

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:11.930
been brought to the notice of the Supreme
Council of the Most Noble Order of the Trench

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:12.930
Dodgers.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.770
I am to inform you that the council have therefore,
as a reward for your devotion to self regardless

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:24.040
of narrow patriotism, made you a companion
of the said most Noble Order, the insignia

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.800
of which is forwarded herewith.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.870
I am.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.480
Sir Your obedient servant,

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.761
A. Chicken Heart, Clerk of the Council

Recruitment Committee

00:09:31.761 --> 00:09:32.761
Poster issued in 1915 by the British Parliamentary
Recruitment Committee

00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:35.610
In a 2008 article published in The Guardian,
Francis Beckett told the story of his grandfather

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.430
who was shamed into fighting in the war and
ultimately perished because of it:

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.770
He had three small daughters, which saved
him from conscription, and his attempt to

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.190
volunteer was turned down in 1914 because
he was short-sighted.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:50.850
But in 1916, as he walked home to south London
from his office, a woman gave him a white

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.850
feather…

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:53.100
He enlisted the next day.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.360
By that time, they cared nothing for short
sight.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:01.280
They just wanted a body to stop a shell, which
Rifleman James Cutmore duly did in February

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.230
1918, dying of his wounds on March 28.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.610
My mother was nine, and never got over it….

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.160
She blamed the politicians.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.760
She blamed the generation that sent him to
war.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.420
She was with Kipling: “If any question why
we died, / Tell them, because our fathers

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.420
lied.”

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:20.710
… But most of all, she blamed that unknown
woman who gave him a white feather, and the

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:25.530
thousands of brittle, self-righteous women
all over the country who had done the same…

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:29.280
As you can imagine, since the only criteria
for being given a white feather was “not

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.530
wearing a military uniform at that particular
moment” some of the men presented with them

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:36.670
actually were soldiers who were either on
leave or had been discharged.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:40.960
Unsurprisingly, few soldiers took kindly to
being called a coward and reactions ranged

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.440
from snide dismissal to outright aggression,
including one unfortunate incident in which

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:50.320
Private Ernest Atkins unchivalrously slapped
the woman presenting him with the feather

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.510
with his military paybook.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:55.650
Sometimes, however, the campaign was even
successful on former soldiers.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:11:00.410
Case in point- Frederick Broom was a young
man of just 15 years of age who managed to

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.800
convince recruiters he was 19 and fought on
the Western Front for a year before contracting

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.240
a severe fever and being sent home.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.650
While enjoying a stroll shortly after his
16th birthday, Broom was accosted by three

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:16.100
girls who gave him a handful of white feathers
while a gathered crowd chided him for being

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.100
a coward.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.840
He stated, “I explained to them that I had
been in the army and been discharged, and

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.380
I was still only 16.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.780
Several people had collected around the girls
and there was giggling, and I felt most uncomfortable

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.490
and … very humiliated.”

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:32.440
Broom was so shaken by the experience, he
re-enlisted the next day.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.710
Sadly, this isn’t the only example of a
far too young man being shamed into fighting

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:40.820
in WW1 and many young men barely out of puberty
are reported to have enlisted (or at least

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:41.820
attempted to) for this reason.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.570
For instance, in another shaming letter incident,
an anonymous note was written on the back

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.390
of what is thought to be a 10 year old boy’s
picture:

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:48.390
What a promising boy…

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.930
Now wear this brooch and buttons and your
frilly white dress.

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:54.970
‘Whilst your brother goes to war (his older
brother was 16 at the time and a member of

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:59.570
the Royal Field Artillery), riding gallantly,
the town all sees your ways…

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:01.300
Chicken you are!!

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.980
Arguably the most glaring mistake made by
the so-called members of the Order of the

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:09.630
White Feather was the case of Seaman George
Samson who was presented with a feather while

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:15.460
he was on his way to a party being held in
his honor for earning a Victoria Cross (Britain’s

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:16.570
highest medal for gallantry).

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:21.620
He earned the Cross by rescuing 30 sailors
during the Gallipoli campaign while acquiring

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:25.100
for himself more than a dozen bullet wounds
in his torso.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.080
A._Fenner_BrockwayOf course, then there was
the likes of famed pacifist and future MP

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:33.550
Fenner Brockway who happily noted that he’d
received enough white feathers to make a fan.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:38.840
(He was imprisoned during the war for refusing
to pay a fine for distributing a leaflet opposing

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:42.570
conscription and then later again arrested
for refusing to be conscripted.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:46.790
He noted of the latter arrest, “I was taken
to the Tower of London and locked in a large

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:49.530
dungeon where there were 20 or so prisoners.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:50.530
Six were objectors.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:53.460
I was to be taken to Chester Castle and my
wife travelled with me.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.960
The Cheshire Regiment did not have a good
reputation for its treatment of objectors.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.530
The previous week the newspaper had carried
reports of how George Beardsworth and Charles

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:06.820
Dukes [both subsequently prominent trade union
leaders] had been forcibly taken to the drilling

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:12.650
ground and kicked, punched, knocked down and
thrown over railings until they lay exhausted,

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:14.310
bruised and bleeding.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.150
I was a little apprehensive…”)

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:20.010
Hundreds of feathers were also given to civil
servants, factory workers and a whole host

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:24.210
of others who actually were aiding the war
effort in some way, shape or form.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:28.340
This became a major problem, but of course
the Order was very successful at recruiting,

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:31.190
so calls to have Order members arrested were
ignored.

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:35.060
Instead, the Home Secretary of Great Britain,
Reginald McKenna, authorised the government

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.290
to begin production of various special badges
in 1916.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:42.510
For instance, there was the “King and Country”
badge, that indicated the man wearing it was

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:47.220
aiding in the war effort in some form or other,
and then the Silver War Badge, that indicated

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:52.690
the individual wearing it had served and been
honourably discharged due to wounds or sickness.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:57.090
This did little to help the conscientious
objectors, however, such as Oxford University’s

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:00.850
Joseph Kaye, who was quoted in The Courage
of Cowards: The Untold Stories of First World

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.970
War Conscientious Objectors as stating,

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:07.610
How is it possible for a greengrocer say,
or a labourer in some small town in Germany,

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:11.200
to have any kind of grievance with a shopkeeper
or a gardener in…

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.710
St. Albans for example?

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:16.720
They are just ordinary men, working to provide
a living for their families.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.560
They both want fundamentally the same thing,
whichever country they live in, and yet they

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.210
are being forced to blow one another to pieces
with guns and bombs.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:25.990
It’s immoral, plain and simple.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:30.570
And what’s more, the working man on either
side will gain nothing from this war, whatever

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:31.570
the outcome.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:35.570
Every country involved will be bankrupt by
the end of it and who will suffer?

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.920
Not the men in power, that’s for sure….

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.060
If you look at how much Britain has spent
on this war already, it’s enough to provide

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:44.520
every family in this country with a decent
house and a piece of land.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:49.110
Why can the government find money to fund
a war, but not provide a reasonable standard

00:14:49.110 --> 00:15:04.270
of living for its citizens?
