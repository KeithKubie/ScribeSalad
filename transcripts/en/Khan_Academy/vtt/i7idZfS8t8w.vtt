00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.460
 

00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.610
In this video, I'm going to
expose you to what is maybe

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.860
one of at least the top five
most useful formulas in

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:08.550
mathematics.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.460
And if you've seen many of my
videos, you know that I'm not

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.660
a big fan of memorizing
things.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.400
But I will recommend you
memorize it with the caveat

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.776
that you also remember how to
prove it, because I don't want

00:00:20.776 --> 00:00:22.940
you to just remember
things and not know

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.870
where they came from.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.970
But with that said, let me
show you what I'm talking

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.330
about: it's the quadratic
formula.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.620
And as you might guess, it is to
solve for the roots, or the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.900
zeroes of quadratic equations.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.450
So let's speak in very general
terms and I'll

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.850
show you some examples.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.360
So let's say I have an equation
of the form ax

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.070
squared plus bx plus
c is equal to 0.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.620
You should recognize this.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.450
This is a quadratic equation
where a, b and c are-- Well, a

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.730
is the coefficient on the x
squared term or the second

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.540
degree term, b is the
coefficient on the x term and

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.270
then c, is, you could imagine,
the coefficient on the x to

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.550
the zero term, or it's
the constant term.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.550
Now, given that you have a
general quadratic equation

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.700
like this, the quadratic formula
tells us that the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.100
solutions to this equation are
x is equal to negative b plus

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:32.020
or minus the square root of
b squared minus 4ac, all

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.530
of that over 2a.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.490
And I know it seems crazy and
convoluted and hard for you to

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.160
memorize right now, but as you
get a lot more practice you'll

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.170
see that it actually is a pretty
reasonable formula to

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.300
stick in your brain someplace.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.570
And you might say, gee, this is
a wacky formula, where did

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.340
it come from?

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.660
And in the next video I'm
going to show you

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.260
where it came from.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.920
But I want you to get used to
using it first. But it really

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.670
just came from completing
the square on this

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.750
equation right there.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.880
If you complete the square here,
you're actually going to

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.250
get this solution and that
is the quadratic

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.390
formula, right there.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.949
So let's apply it to some
problems. Let's start off with

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.680
something that we could have
factored just to verify that

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.120
it's giving us the
same answer.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.660
So let's say we have x
squared plus 4x minus

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.890
21 is equal to 0.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:30.230
So in this situation-- let me
do that in a different color

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.370
--a is equal to 1, right?

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.415
The coefficient on the
x squared term is 1.

00:02:34.415 --> 00:02:37.790
 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.910
b is equal to 4, the coefficient
on the x-term.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.240
And then c is equal
to negative 21,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.470
the constant term.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.860
And let's just plug it in the
formula, so what do we get?

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.470
We get x, this tells us that
x is going to be equal to

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.200
negative b.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.346
Negative b is negative 4-- I put
the negative sign in front

00:03:02.346 --> 00:03:05.660
of that --negative b
plus or minus the

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.770
square root of b squared.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.230
b squared is 16, right?

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:20.170
4 squared is 16, minus 4 times
a, which is 1, times c, which

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.870
is negative 21.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.750
So we can put a 21 out there
and that negative sign will

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.790
cancel out just like that with
that-- Since this is the first

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.400
time we're doing it, let me
not skip too many steps.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.800
So negative 21, just so you
can see how it fit in, and

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.330
then all of that over 2a.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.760
a is 1, so all of that over 2.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.460
So what does this simplify, or
hopefully it simplifies?

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.120
So we get x is equal to negative
4 plus or minus the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.110
square root of-- Let's see we
have a negative times a

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.890
negative, that's going to
give us a positive.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.470
And we had 16 plus, let's see
this is 6, 4 times 1 is 4

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.160
times 21 is 84.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.380
16 plus 84 is 100.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.810
That's nice.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.180
That's a nice perfect square.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.380
All of that over 2, and so this
is going to be equal to

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.160
negative 4 plus or
minus 10 over 2.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.060
We could just divide both of
these terms by 2 right now.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.840
So this is equal to negative 4
divided by 2 is negative 2

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.000
plus or minus 10 divided
by 2 is 5.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.490
So that tells us that x could be
equal to negative 2 plus 5,

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.930
which is 3, or x could be equal
to negative 2 minus 5,

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.240
which is negative 7.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.420
So the quadratic formula
seems to have given us

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.500
an answer for this.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.240
You can verify just by
substituting back in that

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.840
these do work, or you could even
just try to factor this

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.610
right here.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.110
You say what two numbers when
you take their product, you

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.230
get negative 21 and when you
take their sum you get

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.200
positive 4?

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.740
So you'd get x plus 7
times x minus 3 is

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.690
equal to negative 21.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.970
Notice 7 times negative 3 is
negative 21, 7 minus 3 is

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.160
positive 4.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.850
You would get x plus-- sorry
it's not negative --21 is

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.590
equal to 0.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.890
There should be a 0 there.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:29.380
So you get x plus 7 is equal
to 0, or x minus

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.810
3 is equal to 0.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.850
X could be equal to negative
7 or x could be equal to 3.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.390
So it definitely gives us the
same answer as factoring, so

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.700
you might say, hey why bother
with this crazy mess?

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.140
And the reason we want to bother
with this crazy mess is

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.150
it'll also work for problems
that are hard to factor.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.210
And let's do a couple of
those, let's do some

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.080
hard-to-factor problems
right now.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.410
So let's scroll down to get
some fresh real estate.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.150
Let's rewrite the formula again,
just in case we haven't

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.580
had it memorized yet. x is going
to be equal to negative

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:11.180
b plus or minus the square root
of b squared minus 4ac,

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.480
all of that over 2a.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.540
I'll supply this to
another problem.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:30.320
Let's say we have the equation
3x squared plus 6x is equal to

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.720
negative 10.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.610
Well, the first thing we want
to do is get it in the form

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.980
where all of our terms or on the
left-hand side, so let's

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.450
add 10 to both sides
of this equation.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:46.680
We get 3x squared plus the
6x plus 10 is equal to 0.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.930
And now we can use a
quadratic formula.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.320
So let's apply it here.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.050
So a is equal to 3.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:59.900
That is a, this is b and
this right here is c.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.870
So the quadratic formula
tells us the

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.060
solutions to this equation.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:09.570
The roots of this quadratic
function, I guess

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:10.570
we could call it.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.300
x is going to be equal
to negative b.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.920
b is 6, so negative 6
plus or minus the

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.350
square root of b squared.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:29.270
b is 6, so we get 6 squared
minus 4 times a, which is 3

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.630
times c, which is 10.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:37.050
Let's stretch out the radical
little bit, all of that over 2

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:42.190
times a, 2 times 3.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.380
So we get x is equal to negative
6 plus or minus the

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:57.320
square root of 36 minus-- this
is interesting --minus 4 times

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.090
3 times 10.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:05.690
So this is minus-- 4
times 3 times 10.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:11.500
So this is minus 120.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.010
All of that over 6.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.750
So this is interesting, you
might already realize why it's

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:18.220
interesting.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.970
What is this going
to simplify to?

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.610
36 minus 120 is what?

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:30.630
That's 84.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.860
We make this into a 10,
this will become an

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.159
11, this is a 4.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:39.590
It is 84, so this is going to be
equal to negative 6 plus or

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.799
minus the square root of-- But
not positive 84, that's if

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.640
it's 120 minus 36.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.920
We have 36 minus 120.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:53.630
It's going to be negative
84 all of that 6.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.140
So you might say, gee,
this is crazy.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.930
What a this silly quadratic
formula you're

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.000
introducing me to, Sal?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.790
It's worthless.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:03.020
It just gives me a square root
of a negative number.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.380
It's not giving me an answer.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.750
And the reason why it's not
giving you an answer, at least

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:11.450
an answer that you might want,
is because this will have no

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.700
real solutions.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:17.910
 

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.260
In the future, we're going to
introduce something called an

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.310
imaginary number, which is a
square root of a negative

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.720
number, and then we can actually
express this in terms

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.810
of those numbers.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.540
So this actually does have
solutions, but they involve

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:32.660
imaginary numbers.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.690
So this actually has no real
solutions, we're taking the

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.760
square root of a negative
number.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.280
So the b squared with the b
squared minus 4ac, if this

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.330
term right here is negative,
then you're not going to have

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.290
any real solutions.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:48.610
And let's verify that
for ourselves.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.240
Let's get our graphic calculator
out and let's graph

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.600
this equation right here.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.710
So, let's get the graphs that y
is equal to-- that's what I

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:10.510
had there before --3x squared
plus 6x plus 10.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.920
So that's the equation and we're
going to see where it

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.210
intersects the x-axis.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.370
Where does it equal 0?

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.150
So let me graph it.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.510
 

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.700
Notice, this thing just comes
down and then goes back up.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.880
Its vertex is sitting here
above the x-axis and it's

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.710
upward-opening.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.290
It never intersects
the x-axis.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.262
So at no point will this
expression, will this

00:10:33.262 --> 00:10:34.650
function, equal 0.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.530
At no point will y equal
0 on this graph.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.700
So once again, the quadratic
formula seems to be working.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.710
Let's do one more example,
you can never see

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.730
enough examples here.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:50.300
And I want to do ones that are,
you know, maybe not so

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.160
obvious to factor.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:11:01.930
So let's say we get negative 3x
squared plus 12x plus 1 is

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:03.770
equal to 0.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.450
Now let's try to do it just
having the quadratic formula

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:07.740
in our brain.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:12.290
So the x's that satisfy this
equation are going to be

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.690
negative b.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:18.580
This is b So negative b is
negative 12 plus or minus the

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:27.300
square root of b squared, of
144, that's b squared minus 4

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:33.870
times a, which is negative 3
times c, which is 1, all of

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:39.540
that over 2 times a, over
2 times negative 3.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.970
So all of that over negative 6,
this is going to be equal

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.630
to negative 12 plus or
minus the square root

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.030
of-- What is this?

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:51.710
It's a negative times a negative
so they cancel out.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:12:01.220
So I have 144 plus 12, so
that is 156, right?

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:06.910
144 plus 12, all of that
over negative 6.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.350
Now, I suspect we can
simplify this 156.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.270
We could maybe bring
some things out

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.850
of the radical sign.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:17.170
So let's attempt to do that.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.020
So let's do a prime
factorization of 156.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.600
Sometimes, this is the hardest
part, simplifying the radical.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:30.080
So 156 is the same thing
as 2 times 78.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.950
78 is the same thing
as 2 times what?

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:39.800
That's 2 times 39.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:48.960
So the square root of 156 is
equal to the square root of 2

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.800
times 2 times 39 or we could say
that's the square root of

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.110
2 times 2 times the
square root of 39.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.810
And this, obviously, is just
going to be the square root of

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:01.830
4 or this is the square root
of 2 times 2 is just 2.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:06.310
2 square roots of 39, if I
did that properly, let's

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.710
see, 4 times 39.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.150
Yeah, it looks like
it's right.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:17.590
So this up here will simplify to
negative 12 plus or minus 2

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:23.220
times the square root of 39, all
of that over negative 6.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.650
Now we can divide the numerator
and the denominator

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:26.590
maybe by 2.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:32.060
So this will be equal to
negative 6 plus or minus the

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:36.020
square root of 39
over negative 3.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.540
Or we could separate these
two terms out.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.800
We could say this is equal to
negative 6 over negative 3

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:49.310
plus or minus the square root
of 39 over negative 3.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:51.400
Now, this is just a 2
right here, right?

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.190
These cancel out, 6 divided
by 3 is 2, so we get 2.

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.810
And now notice, if this is plus
and we use this minus

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:59.780
sign, the plus will become
negative and the negative will

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.160
become positive.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.390
But it still doesn't
matter, right?

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:05.260
We could say minus or plus,
that's the same thing as plus

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:10.010
or minus the square root
of 39 nine over 3.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:12.940
I think that's about as simple
as we can get this answered.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.620
I want to make a very clear
point of what I

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.420
did that last step.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.530
I did not forget about
this negative sign.

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:20.430
I just said it doesn't matter.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.190
It's going to turn the positive
into the negative;

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.800
it's going to turn the negative
into the positive.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.140
Let me rewrite this.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:29.660
So this right here can be
rewritten as 2 plus the square

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:36.210
root of 39 over negative 3 or 2
minus the square root of 39

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.080
over negative 3, right?

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.610
That's what the plus or minus
means, it could be this or

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:42.600
that or both of them, really.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.430
Now in this situation, this
negative 3 will turn into 2

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:49.290
minus the square root
of 39 over 3, right?

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:51.150
I'm just taking this
negative out.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.130
Here the negative and the
negative will become a

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.090
positive, and you get 2
plus the square root

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.210
of 39 over 3, right?

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.130
A negative times a negative
is a positive.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:04.400
So once again, you have
2 plus or minus the

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.190
square of 39 over 3.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:11.550
2 plus or minus the square
root of 39 over 3 are

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:16.795
solutions to this equation
right there.

00:15:16.795 --> 00:15:17.300
Let verify.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.920
I'm just curious what the
graph looks like.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.360
So let's just look at it.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.860
Let me clear this.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.670
Where is the clear button?

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:37.280
So we have negative 3 three
squared plus 12x plus 1 and

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.721
let's graph it.

00:15:39.721 --> 00:15:42.280
Let's see where it intersects
the x-axis.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:47.180
It goes up there and then
back down again.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:51.840
So 2 plus or minus the square,
you see-- The square root of

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:56.330
39 is going to be a little
bit more than 6, right?

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.090
Because 36 is 6 squared.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.910
So it's going be a little bit
more than 6, so this is going

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:02.110
to be a little bit
more than 2.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:03.890
A little bit more than 6 divided
by 2 is a little bit

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:04.615
more than 2.

00:16:04.615 --> 00:16:06.580
So you're going to get one value
that's a little bit more

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.100
than 4 and then another value
that should be a little bit

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.690
less than 1.

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:13.590
And that looks like the case,
you have 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:18.460
You have a value that's pretty
close to 4, and then you have

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:25.020
another value that is a little
bit-- It looks close to 0 but

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.540
maybe a little bit
less than that.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.090
So anyway, hopefully you found
this application of the

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.260
quadratic formula helpful.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:31.760
