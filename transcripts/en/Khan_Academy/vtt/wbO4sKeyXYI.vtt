00:00:00.478 --> 00:00:02.347
- [Voiceover] The following
equation represents

00:00:02.347 --> 00:00:06.021
the population growth of
bacteria in a petri dish.

00:00:06.021 --> 00:00:08.900
So the population is a function of time.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.593
Is equal to 350 times

00:00:11.593 --> 00:00:14.520
two to the t power,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.843
where P of t is the population after some

00:00:16.843 --> 00:00:20.779
amount of time, t, measured in hours.

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.717
Which of the following best describes

00:00:22.717 --> 00:00:26.259
the relationship between
the population of bacteria,

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.235
P, which is a function of t,

00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:30.800
and the number of hours that have passed?

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.687
And the number of hours
is that lowercase t.

00:00:33.687 --> 00:00:36.524
The relationship is linear
since the population has

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.115
350 more bacteria than the previous hour.

00:00:41.115 --> 00:00:43.526
Well this is clearly, or we'll have to see

00:00:43.526 --> 00:00:46.660
this is not a linear
relationship right over here.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.043
What's gonna happen here?

00:00:48.043 --> 00:00:49.808
When t equals zero, you can even see it

00:00:49.808 --> 00:00:51.772
if you draw a little table here.

00:00:51.772 --> 00:00:54.872
So if you say t and P of t.

00:00:54.872 --> 00:00:58.366
When t is zero, well then the population,

00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.933
two to the zero power is one,

00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.548
one times 350 is...

00:01:01.548 --> 00:01:03.895
The population's going to be 350.

00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:06.635
When t is one, what's the population now?

00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:10.335
Well, two the first
power is two times 350.

00:01:10.335 --> 00:01:12.943
It's going to be 700.

00:01:12.943 --> 00:01:15.651
When t is two, what's
going to be the population?

00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:17.147
Well, two to the second power is four.

00:01:17.147 --> 00:01:20.157
Four times 350 is going to be 1200.

00:01:20.157 --> 00:01:23.527
Plus 200 is going to be 1400.

00:01:23.527 --> 00:01:25.573
So what you see what's
happening after every hour

00:01:25.573 --> 00:01:27.758
the population is doubling.

00:01:27.758 --> 00:01:29.210
And you see that right over here,

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.592
'cause for every hour, you're gonna take

00:01:30.592 --> 00:01:32.809
two to that power as you increment,

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:35.038
and then you're gonna
multiply that times 350.

00:01:35.038 --> 00:01:37.812
So every hour, your
population is going to double.

00:01:37.812 --> 00:01:41.714
After three hours, your
population's going to be 2800.

00:01:41.714 --> 00:01:44.720
So this is definitely not
a linear relationship.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.324
You definitely have much more than

00:01:46.324 --> 00:01:49.808
just 350 more bacteria
than the previous hour,

00:01:49.808 --> 00:01:50.807
so rule that out.

00:01:50.807 --> 00:01:51.864
The relationship is linear.

00:01:51.864 --> 00:01:53.501
No, not after you finish reading that.

00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:55.346
The relationship is exponential.

00:01:55.346 --> 00:01:57.368
Yep, that's what it looks like.

00:01:57.368 --> 00:02:00.321
Since the population is 350 times larger

00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:01.157
than the previous hour.

00:02:01.157 --> 00:02:01.934
No, no, no.

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:03.757
It's not 350 times larger.

00:02:03.757 --> 00:02:05.013
It's two times larger.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.084
To get 350 times larger it would be 350

00:02:09.084 --> 00:02:11.469
that you'd be raising to the exponent.

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:12.433
So we'll rule that one out.

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:13.630
So this better be our answer,

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.463
but let's make sure it makes sense.

00:02:15.463 --> 00:02:17.852
The relationship is exponential
since the population

00:02:17.852 --> 00:02:20.109
is two times larger.

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:23.070
The population is two times
larger than the previous hour.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.676
That's exactly what we found.
