balls to say eight this is this can
happen you know there can sometimes be

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110
happen you know there can sometimes be
 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.779
happen you know there can sometimes be
no forgiveness and we're not saying it's

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:51.789
no forgiveness and we're not saying it's
 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:54.270
no forgiveness and we're not saying it's
right but sometimes it's just gonna

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280
right but sometimes it's just gonna
 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.120
right but sometimes it's just gonna
happen um and I think people who go

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130
happen um and I think people who go
 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.430
happen um and I think people who go
through anything like what this

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440
through anything like what this
 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.089
through anything like what this
character has gone through will probably

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:02.099

the show is trying to say that it
 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:13.320
the show is trying to say that it
understands it gets it and that it's not

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330
