00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.530
There was a time when comic book movies were
seen as a joke or a poisoned chalice to an

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.870
actor's career. Not any more.
These days, the comic book movie genre is

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.760
one of the most popular in Hollywood - heck,
five of the twenty highest-grossing movies

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.650
of all time are comic book movies - and popular,
talented actors appearing in the genre is

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.200
the norm.
But not every actor has yet been given the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.490
chance to play a live action superhero. Many
of those unfortunate souls have expressed

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.340
a public interest in playing a specific one,
however - and that's what this video is about.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.739
Watch it, enjoy it, and don't forget to subscribe
to our channel to regularly see more like

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.539
it.
Here are ten popular actors who want to be

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:55.089
a Marvel or DC superhero.
Norman Reedus

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.899
The Walking Dead's Daryl Dixon - Norman Reedus
- is one of the coolest actors on television

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.159
at the moment, so it would be awesome to see
him playing a superhero. Thankfully, the former

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.090
model has expressed an interest in playing
Ghost Rider on the big screen!

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.590
He rides a motorcycle on The Walking Dead
and explores motorcycle culture in his "Ride

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.040
with Norman Reedus" show, and when he was
asked if he'd like to play Ghost Rider in

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.860
a movie reboot, Reedus replied enthusiastically
by saying "Hell yeah! It would be a blast.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:28.750
Do I get a skull face that’s on fire and
all that stuff? F**k yeah. I’m down!"

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.800
Bryce Dallas Howard
Bryce Dallas Howard - who has, of course,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.290
already appeared in a superhero movie when
she portrayed Gwen Stacy in 2007's Spider-Man

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.860
3 - expressed an interest in a certain titular
Marvel Cinematic Universe role, prior to it

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.890
being given to someone else.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.981
That role was Captain Marvel - who will now
be played by Brie Larson, of course. When

00:01:47.981 --> 00:01:52.160
asked if she would be interested in the role
at a Jurassic World press day, Howard replied

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.440
"Oh my God, will you write that? Will you
write that please? Yes, let’s start a campaign

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.479
now. That would be rad." Maybe she'll get
her chance to play a different Marvel heroine

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.860
in the future.
Ronda Rousey

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:10.520
Someone with... a little.... yeah let's go
with "a little" less acting talent than Bryce

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.849
Dallas Howard also wanted to be Captain Marvel
in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - and that

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.670
person was Ronda Rousey. The former UFC champion
first shared her interest in the part during

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.260
a Reddit AMA, then posted some fan art of
herself as the character on her Instagram

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.700
account.
As previously stated, the role ultimately

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.540
went to Brie Larson - even though Marvel Studios
head honcho Kevin Feige actually championed

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.180
Rousey for the role - but, given that her
MMA career looks to be over, Rousey will probably

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.480
turn to acting on a more full-time basis,
so maybe another opportunity in the comic

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.310
book genre will emerge for her in the coming
years.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.590
Daniel Radcliffe
Having played Harry Potter for ten years,

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.200
Daniel Radcliffe certainly knows what it's
like to play a heroic character, but there's

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.329
no way anyone could describe Potter as a "superhero."
With that in mind, it's no surprise that the

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.370
young actor wants to jump on the comic book
movie bandwagon.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.569
Back in 2014, prior to Batman's first appearance
in the DC Extended Universe, Radcliffe was

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.239
asked which other big movie franchise he'd
like to appear in. His response? "Batman!

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.650
If they reboot that again, I’ll do that,
too. It’s happening isn’t it? With Ben

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.909
Affleck. I could be Robin. I’m perfect."
Ryan Potter

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.590
From one Potter to another now, but this time
it's Ryan Potter, the actor and martial artist

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.939
who is perhaps best-known for providing the
voice of another superhero - Hiro Hamada in

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:39.120
Big Hero 6. Coincidentally, this Potter also
wants to portray Batman's sidekick, Robin

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.959
- but his casting would come with a twist.
Potter's father is Japanese, so casting him

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.070
as Robin would have to see a change in the
traditional white ethnicity associated with

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.430
the character. He wants to play the character
so badly that he made an audition video for

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.069
Ben Affleck to show him exactly what he can
offer - a level of enthusiasm that suggests

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:07.290
the ethnicity issue should be completely overlooked!
Anna Kendrick

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.840
Being Batman's sidekick seems to be a popular
choice for actors - and not just actors of

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.430
the male variety - as Pitch Perfect star Anna
Kendrick also humorously stated she'd like

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.340
to play Robin. While sat next to Ben Affleck,
participating in a comedic MTV interview/sketch

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.460
about their movie The Accountant, Kendrick
made her pitch for the role.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.950
The actress suddenly appeared dressed in a
Hamburglar costume with an "R" on the front,

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.460
having announced that she had a hole in her
schedule that could be filled with a superhero

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.700
flick. On a more serious note, there has actually
been a genuine push for Kendrick to play the

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:49.660
character - not least by Deathstroke himself,
Joe Manganiello.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.570
Tyrese Gibson
You'd think that the terrible reception to

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.480
2011's Green Lantern movie would have put
actors off appearing as Green Lanterns in

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.320
future DC offerings, but that's not actually
the case at all. In fact, Fast and Furious

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.590
star Tyrese Gibson has been campaigning quite
actively for the role - to the extent that

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:12.970
he earned himself some meetings to discuss
the possibility of playing John Stewart.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.260
A snippet from one of the many quotes Gibson
has said on the matter is as follows: "I’ve

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.200
already had a couple of meetings at Warner
Bros., so we’ll see what happens. I do believe

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.940
that there needs to be more black superheroes
out there, but that’s not even my motivation.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.850
I think I would be the best Green Lantern."
Keanu Reeves

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.560
Okay, some people might say that Keanu Reeves
has already played a superhero, but the fact

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.530
is John Constantine is the epitome of an anti-hero.
Reeves has, however, stated that there are

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.170
some more well-known heroic characters that
he'd like to play - those being Batman and

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.580
Wolverine.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.040
Within a few moments of the same discussion,
Reeves said "I always wanted to play Wolverine.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.560
But I didn't get that. And they have a great
Wolverine now" and "I always wanted to play

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.400
The Dark Knight. But I didn't get that one.
They've had some great Batmans. So now I'm

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.410
just enjoying them as an audience." Make your
mind up, Keanu!

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.650
Derek Theler
The least-known actor on this list is Derek

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.710
Theler. The star of TV's Baby Daddy is a huge
superhero fan and actually auditioned for

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.840
the role of Captain America in the Marvel
Cinematic Universe back in 2009 (and he's

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.220
also said he'd like to play Thor), but he's
now campaigning to play a DC character - a

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.460
certain Shazam!

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.060
He frequently shares fan art of himself playing
Shazam on social media, and often captions

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.720
the images with how it's his dream to play
the character, as well as with compliments

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.890
directed towards The Rock - who is, of course,
playing Black Adam in the DC Extended Universe.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.950
Megan Fox
Believe it or not, Megan Fox is something

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.810
of a comic book aficionado and is very keen
to play a superhero on screen - specifically,

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:54.990
one from quite an obscure title - DC's Gen¹³.
Fox said "There’s a comic book called Gen¹³

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.280
that they need to make into a movie. There
are three female ass-kicking superheroes.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.000
That’s an opportunity to put three super-hot,
awesome badass girls in a movie, and I imagine

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.100
it would be so lucrative."

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.360
Fox wasn't, however, remotely interested in
playing Wonder Woman in the DC Extended Universe

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.680
(who, of course, is now played by Gal Gadot).
In fact, she totally dissed the character

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:20.310
and the idea of playing her, saying "Wonder
Woman is a lame superhero. She flies around

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.540
in her invisible jet and her weaponry is a
lasso that makes you tell the truth. I just

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.470
don’t get it. Somebody has a big challenge
on their hands whoever takes that role, but

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:34.980
I don’t want to do it."
