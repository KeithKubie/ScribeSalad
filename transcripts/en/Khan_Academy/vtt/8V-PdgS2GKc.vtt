00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:03.246
- [Instructor] So we're
told here the four corners

00:00:03.246 --> 00:00:07.413
of a rectangle are located
at the points (1,1), (1,6),

00:00:08.537 --> 00:00:11.567
(9,6) and (9,1).

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:13.749
Plot the four corners of the rectangle

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:15.751
on the coordinate plane below.

00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:17.401
And they gave us these four points

00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:20.789
and we can move them around
with our mouse or our finger,

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.093
depending on what type of
a computer we are using.

00:00:24.093 --> 00:00:26.172
And so let's just go
point by point and plot

00:00:26.172 --> 00:00:28.506
the green points at those points.

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:31.159
So the first one is (1,1) and remember,

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:34.012
the first coordinate is our x-coordinate.

00:00:34.012 --> 00:00:35.924
The second coordinate is our y-coordinate.

00:00:35.924 --> 00:00:38.442
So the first coordinate
tells us how far do we move

00:00:38.442 --> 00:00:40.265
to the right of the origin.

00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:42.418
So it's one, and then
the second coordinate,

00:00:42.418 --> 00:00:45.207
the y-coordinate, tells
us how far to move up

00:00:45.207 --> 00:00:47.800
from the origin, so that's also a one.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.501
So (1,1).

00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:53.310
The next point is (1,6).

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.104
X-coordinate is one.

00:00:55.104 --> 00:00:57.174
So we move one to the right of the origin

00:00:57.174 --> 00:00:59.014
and then the y-coordinate is six.

00:00:59.014 --> 00:01:03.823
So we move six up and notice
it's at the intersection

00:01:03.823 --> 00:01:05.111
of the line ...

00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:07.951
Or it's at the intersection
of when y equals six

00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:09.459
and x equals one.

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:12.042
This is (1,6).

00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:16.721
Alright, now we have (9,6).

00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:19.212
So let's see, if we take our ...

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:21.573
If we have x equals nine right over there

00:01:21.573 --> 00:01:25.220
and y is equal to six so we go up six.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.761
So notice y is now equal to six.

00:01:27.761 --> 00:01:31.780
And we have one last point to plot: (9,1).

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.363
So when x is nine, y is one.

00:01:35.646 --> 00:01:39.605
We go nine to the right or
we're right above x equals nine

00:01:39.605 --> 00:01:41.658
and then we go up one.

00:01:41.658 --> 00:01:43.766
This is (9,1) and there you have it.

00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:46.908
We have the four corners of our rectangle.

00:01:46.908 --> 00:01:49.880
Then they say what is the
height of the rectangle?

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.746
Well if you imagine a
rectangle right over here,

00:01:52.746 --> 00:01:54.837
the height would be the
distance between that point

00:01:54.837 --> 00:01:57.136
and this point or the
distance between that point

00:01:57.136 --> 00:01:59.371
and that point and so what is the distance

00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:01.211
between these points?

00:02:01.211 --> 00:02:02.314
Let's see, they're on ...

00:02:02.314 --> 00:02:04.587
They both have the same x-coordinate

00:02:04.587 --> 00:02:06.151
and this one is at y equals six.

00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:08.456
This is at y equals one.

00:02:08.456 --> 00:02:11.051
So this is five higher than this one.

00:02:11.051 --> 00:02:13.187
So the height is five.

00:02:13.187 --> 00:02:14.592
And we can also count it.

00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:18.009
We could see one, two, three, four, five.
