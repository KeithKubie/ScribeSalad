1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.620
Um, how much did you learn about racing from your dad?

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.580
Hardly nothing, man. I mean, we, uh,

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.080
obligate asked all the time what your dad taught you about X, Y, and Z.

4
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:17.760
And we never talked about racing. Um, really never. Wow. Yeah.

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.500
We never talked about reason. You started racing professionally? Yeah. Wow.

6
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.850
Yeah, we never did. Um, he was always,

7
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.380
uh, don't, you know, finish.

8
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.700
He was so worried that me and Kelly wouldn't finish school,

9
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.380
that we would give up on school.

10
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:40.440
He gave up on school as an eighth grader at 16 years old.

11
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:44.190
He was 16 in eighth grade and quit and never finished high school.

12
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:46.110
Never got no GED, nothing.

13
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.370
And people would come up to him and say,

14
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.440
our people would talk about him. Um, even while he was lab and ever since.

15
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.660
And, uh, say,

16
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.680
look what this guy made of himself having quit the eighth grade.

17
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.380
That's awesome. And he always hated that. That was embarrassing, uh,

18
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.320
for people to S you know, he was embarrassed that he quit.

19
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.290
He knowed how bad it disappointed his own father.

20
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.220
So he was always like worried about where I was,

21
00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:21.090
who I was hanging out with, whether I was, you know, doing my homework.

22
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.710
And then even when I started racing, it was who I was hanging out with,

23
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.700
what I was doing with my free time, what I was focusing on, whether I was,

24
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.890
you know, thinking about, you know, what I was,

25
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.490
whether it was on time for sponsor appearances and never is how you drive this

26
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:41.970
corner. This is, I get around this race track. He never talked about this stuff.

27
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.950
It was always the person being a man, being right,

28
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.240
being good to people, being on time, being ready to work,

29
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.270
uh, looking your best. Um, general, you know,

30
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.060
morals and values. He didn't,

31
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.840
we never sat down and talked about racing like true.

32
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.200
You had to get around this corner and this is how you shift and shit like that.

33
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.950
Well, in that respect it was probably brilliant of them. Cause look,

34
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.980
the championships came and you also turned out to be a great man.

35
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.460
Ah, thanks. I appreciate you saying that. I, uh,

36
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.900
I don't know. I always felt like that when I was younger,

37
00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:28.320
I kind of let my father down because, um,

38
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.910
there was this one time I was probably 12 years old and there was this,

39
00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:36.030
me and my buddy, we were going to play, man, we're here, we're outside,

40
00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:36.864
we're going to play outside.

41
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.010
My dad's standing over there and there was a bucket full of shit. And he's like,

42
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.030
Hey, come here Pope junior, pick that bucket up, move it over here.

43
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.060
And I went over there and tried to pick it up and I was like, I can't lift it.

44
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.070
And he got so pissed off at me cause he knew I didn't try any gay.

45
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.650
He said to my buddy, Ryan, he goes, Ryan, come here,

46
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.300
pick the bucket up and take it over there.

47
00:02:57.301 --> 00:03:02.140
And he turned around and gave me this look of pure freaking disappointment and I

48
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:06.370
felt like that set the tone for our relationship. Wow.

49
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.630
For one bucket. I know, I feel like that, that was the,

50
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.710
uh,

51
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.710
that was our relationship in a nutshell for most of my teenage years.

52
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.120
You know, he looked at me as, you know,

53
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:23.320
I don't know what he's going to Mount to.

54
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.370
I don't know what this kid is going to do. I don't know what, what, you know,

55
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.480
what skills he has or what is he going to ever get his act together or whether

56
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:33.190
he's ever going to figure himself out. You know.

57
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.710
And I probably didn't give him much reason to think different. Um,

58
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.390
but then when we got, when I started racing, um,

59
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.580
when I started racing it, uh, light models,

60
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:49.960
I ran 159 races and he never came to one, uh,

61
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.620
through 94 95, 96, 97. I raced at Myrtle beach,

62
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:56.980
South Carolina every weekend and he never once came down there to watch me.

63
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.480
And so he didn't know whether I was a good race car driver or a bad race car

64
00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:03.760
driver. He didn't know whether I was, you know,

65
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.290
working on my car or understanding how they, you know, what, what,

66
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.760
how to build the car, fixed the car. And when I would do good,

67
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:16.150
I'd come home and I'd have a trophy and I'd say, Hey man, I won. And he'd go,

68
00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:19.810
well, who wasn't there? And I'm like, shit,

69
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.740
he really did the first I remember coming home with a trophy and I could not

70
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:30.850
wait til he wa he would walk. I kept my car in this, uh,

71
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.360
in this building that was his, and he put all his deer head up, air,

72
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.520
caught a deer hit shop. I'm talking 35, 40 miles in this place, a couple of elk.

73
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.200
And uh,

74
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.270
he'd come in there every Monday morning before lunch and I had that trophy

75
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:49.960
sitting up. We'd brought it home, man, it was right in view.

76
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.100
Soon as he walks in,

77
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.900
I got my car working on my car and he comes in there and I'm like,

78
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.750
am I? He's like, so you want, huh? So he's a trophy. I was like, yeah,

79
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.050
we did. And he's like such and such must not been there.

80
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.420
Cause there was this one guy named Robert Powell,

81
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.600
he used to beat us all the time and he goes, Robert bus not been there.

82
00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:15.460
I was like, no, he wasn't. He wasn't there. You're right. I was so pissed off,

83
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:16.294
man.

84
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.930
I finally won a damn race and I thought he was going to come in there and slap

85
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:24.670
me on the back and man, you know, give me, give me a good talk, um,

86
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.110
and give you more motivation that he didn't do that. I don't think so.

87
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.960
I don't think it did. I think it made me,

88
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.310
it did not make me want to win more. Um,

89
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.980
but then one day,

90
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.360
so right around the end of 1997,

91
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.810
I was out of money. He was like, Hey, you know, you're out of money.

92
00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:50.110
You ain't gonna race. I was like, shit, my life is coming to an end.

93
00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:53.380
As far as I know it, you know, I'm not gonna I guess my racing career, this is,

94
00:05:53.381 --> 00:05:57.380
it is, it's coming to an end. 1997. Um,

95
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.040
he was sitting down and talking to, uh,

96
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.160
he had a car that races in the Xfinity series that I told you about on Saturdays

97
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:07.280
and he,

98
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.280
his driver was leaving to go to a cup car and he was talking to his best friend,

99
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.570
Tony sr is the guy's name that actually crew chiefs that car. And he's like,

100
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.900
who we're going to get drive his thing. Well who should we get?

101
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.470
We got a higher driver and Tony sr said, why don't you put Dale jr in here?

102
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.070
He goes, what? Are you serious? You really think so? He's like,

103
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.840
you're going to spend a little money on this car.

104
00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:32.900
Why don't you spend it on your own kid? You know, why don't you just put ma,

105
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.870
I can, I can probably make a driver out of him. Tony sr says so

106
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.050
and so. They made a decision to put me in this car in the infinity series.

107
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.900
You'd think that dad would come tell me or we would have press conference,

108
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.470
not be a press release. At least I walked into,

109
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.720
this was a month before the race season starts.

110
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.380
I think I'm out of or I think I'm out of racing. Right. I ain't,

111
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.510
I ain't even talk to anybody about what I'm racing or if I'm racing in a couple

112
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.030
of months. I think that it's dried up opportunities. You're gone.

113
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.430
I'll walk into the shop to get something where Tony and senior's car,

114
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.930
Tony's Sr's race car was and my name was on the roof and I was like,

115
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.880
I thought it was a joke, like a mean joke, a prank. And they were laughing,

116
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:23.300
Tony sr and, and uh, some of the guys in the shop are laughing and I'm like,

117
00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:24.620
man, that's messed up man.

118
00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:28.910
Y'all are dicks for putting that name on there to say no funny in there.

119
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.880
And they were like, it's true, man. I was like,

120
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.780
you mean I'm going to race this car? I'm nice in this car. And they were like,

121
00:07:35.781 --> 00:07:40.070
yeah. I was like, really? And uh,

122
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.000
I mean obviously I was thrilled. Like, man, I couldn't believe it,

123
00:07:44.001 --> 00:07:47.300
but this is the way I found out, not from my own dad.

124
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.180
And I'm like, dad, I'm racing the car. Yup. I mean,

125
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:56.420
not days later when I seen him, I'm like, so I'm going to race that car.

126
00:07:56.421 --> 00:08:00.980
And he's like, yup, yup, sure. Bear, get ready. And yeah,

127
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:06.140
and I mean it was, he was the strangest dude when it came.

128
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:07.820
He didn't, he didn't really.

129
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.860
But once I started racing that car and I had had great success,

130
00:08:12.861 --> 00:08:17.180
we won six or seven races the first year we won another six or seven races the

131
00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:19.220
second year of championships in both seasons.

132
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.050
So I made the choice to put me in that car,

133
00:08:21.051 --> 00:08:26.051
worked out better than he probably ever imagined ever in 159 late model races

134
00:08:28.251 --> 00:08:32.900
that I ran from 94 to 97 I won four in 159 late model races.

135
00:08:32.901 --> 00:08:33.734
I won four.

136
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:38.630
So he put me in this car on a whim and a prayer and we ended up winning

137
00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:42.410
championship two in a row. So he is thinking, damn,

138
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.040
this little yo shit can drive a car.

139
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.760
And that's when our relationship completely changed.

140
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.230
That's when I hit his arm around me. We were doing shit together.

141
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.140
We were brewing, we were doing, we had sponsored deals and promotions together.

142
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.910
We were doing photo shoots together.

143
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.870
I saw him all the time and we talked about all kinds of, you know,

144
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:08.580
we talked about life, um, girls and and everything, but racing, you know,

145
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:13.320
we didn't talk about race in much but just fine. But, um, it was awesome.

146
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.430
And so not eight, nine and nine and then 2000 I went to cup. He, he,

147
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.470
he built a cup team around me. We had Budweiser come in for $10 million a year,

148
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:26.940
which was the biggest sponsorship anybody had. And at that time, um,

149
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:29.130
in, uh, so,

150
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.520
and then he got killed in 2001 at the start of the season in Daytona 500.

151
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:34.140
So those three years, nine, eight, nine, nine,

152
00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:37.950
2000 were as good as it could get. Wow. Yeah.

153
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.660
That must've been amazing.

154
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.630
It must have been amazing for you to turn that corner. Yeah.

155
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.810
It was like a light switch he went from,

156
00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:52.500
he went from not really engaging with me,

157
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:58.020
me not comfortable around him feeling ashamed. Um,

158
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.180
not me, not measuring up. He's,

159
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:05.430
cause he's 10 foot tall cowboy boots, black hat, tougher and shit.

160
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:06.211
N***a,

161
00:10:06.211 --> 00:10:11.190
you know intimidator that was his nickname and I was blonde,

162
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.530
pale short as hell,

163
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.750
not a muscle on me and had accomplished nothing,

164
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.330
you know, and so it,

165
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.180
but it overnight it was like completely changed.

166
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:29.220
We started running great and people were coming up to me,

167
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:34.710
I'm like, dude, you're freaking, you're doing awesome. And you know,

168
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.090
and he's, and he was, uh, he was real happy with that. He was pretty proud.

169
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:44.110
It's crazy that he never talked to you about race. No. That's just so strange.

170
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:48.960
Yeah, I can't imagine that was one, there was only one time that he did that.

171
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.480
We were at a track called Bristol, Tennessee. We were,

172
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.150
we were at a track in Bristol, Tennessee. Uh,

173
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:58.260
it's a half mile high banked race track and we run 15 second laps around there.

174
00:10:58.261 --> 00:11:02.880
It's really fast and it's, it's kinda technical and tough to get around. Um,

175
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:07.530
and I had been race, I'm out there practicing and I wasn't,

176
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.550
I wasn't doing it right. And he got up on the, uh,

177
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.620
he got up on one of the haulers and got on the radio and started talking to me

178
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:19.260
and he was like, Hey man, I'm gonna tell you how to drive it.

179
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.720
And so this one day, one time in this one practice for about five minutes,

180
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:28.230
he's like, I'm gonna tell you how to drive his track. So I'm out there driving.

181
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:29.610
And um, when, uh, he's like,

182
00:11:29.611 --> 00:11:32.010
I lift right here and I lift and he getting the gas. Okay,

183
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.920
I'm turn area and he's just telling me how to drive the track.

184
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.570
And that was the only time he ever did that to just think of how much it would

185
00:11:39.571 --> 00:11:44.520
have improved. I know it really helped me there that day. I mean like his,

186
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.340
when he told me how to do it, I'm like, Holy shit,

187
00:11:47.341 --> 00:11:50.370
this is way I would have never thought of doing it this way and this is way

188
00:11:50.371 --> 00:11:52.800
better. Right. You know? So yeah.

189
00:11:52.801 --> 00:11:55.270
Maybe you could have given me a few more tips on some things.

190
00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.240
<v 1>I mean come on man.</v>

191
00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.020
You mean that's how that has to be so crazy.

192
00:12:01.021 --> 00:12:04.560
Cause that's your profession and your dad is a superhero.

193
00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:10.370
<v 0>You know, I finally made it to cup and I think had he lived,</v>

194
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:15.440
he would have been in my ear all those years, you know, do this, do this,

195
00:12:15.441 --> 00:12:20.060
don't do this. It's the best decision today. Um, so maybe he just didn't,

196
00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:22.580
wasn't in a hurry to do it cause he didn't know that he wasn't going to be

197
00:12:22.581 --> 00:12:24.020
around for it, you know.

198
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.150
<v 1>How hard was it the race after he was gone?</v>

199
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:32.410
<v 0>How thought about whether I should quit or not? Um,</v>

200
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.910
you know, I, I probably if the,

201
00:12:36.911 --> 00:12:41.911
if it hadn't a paid a lot of money and I didn't have partners and people that

202
00:12:43.151 --> 00:12:45.550
were dependent on me or counting on me,

203
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.740
I probably could have easily walked away from it.

204
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:53.100
But we had a great partner in Budweiser that was incredibly supportive.

205
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:56.503
<v 2>Mmm.</v>

206
00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.460
<v 0>I had a lucrative opportunity in front of me personally to be a,</v>

207
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:04.840
be a race car driver for as long as I wanted to, which I wanted.

208
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:10.060
And I just had to go through missing him really bad for a few months. You know,

209
00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:13.840
I had to, I had to go to the race track and everywhere I looked, you know,

210
00:13:13.841 --> 00:13:17.920
there's dad, there were P, you know, fans morning.

211
00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:19.783
<v 2>Uh,</v>

212
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.100
<v 0>there were signs and paintings and things, you know,</v>

213
00:13:24.101 --> 00:13:28.570
there was just markings and acknowledgements and just shit everywhere for like a

214
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:32.590
year. Uh, and I appreciated it and I knew why it was like that.

215
00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.470
Um, but it took a while for me to, uh,

216
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.820
sorta get to where I didn't. Um, I was, I went,

217
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.320
there was a little period of me,

218
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:49.410
the period of time where I was real self destructive and just like a mad,

219
00:13:49.421 --> 00:13:54.190
you know, everything. And um, you know,

220
00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:59.980
took me awhile to calm down and get to work, you know, for, for,

221
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.580
for awhile there it was just sort of going through the motions,

222
00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:09.030
<v 1>the, you know, I mean, you must have always known, I mean,</v>

223
00:14:09.031 --> 00:14:12.090
everyone knows there's dangers involved in racing cars,

224
00:14:12.091 --> 00:14:17.091
but when it hits someone so close as your own father that had to change what

225
00:14:18.031 --> 00:14:19.350
racing felt like to you.

226
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.160
<v 0>Mm. Yeah. I'm sure.</v>

227
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:28.480
I'm sure it would have completely been a different experience. Um,

228
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:32.620
emotionally had that not happened, had, you know,

229
00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:37.180
racing for me would have meant something completely different. Um,

230
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.780
you know, I just was, he was in, he was a, this,

231
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:48.690
he was this invincible God that, you know,

232
00:14:48.691 --> 00:14:51.980
wasn't supposed to get hurt, wasn't supposed to. I mean, he was, he, he was,

233
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.750
he was supposed to get hurt and drive, hurt and be tough and, um,

234
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.980
he wasn't supposed to get keeled and leave us all, you know,

235
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.910
he left the whole sport, you know, and, and no one knew what to do.

236
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.700
Like that was like, the whole sport was sitting there going, shit,

237
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:13.190
what do we do? You know, he was the guy for everyone.

238
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:18.180
And even in, even the competitors, you know, looked up to him like he was the,

239
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:22.520
yeah, like that, that's the man and [inaudible]. Uh,

240
00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:26.690
so it was tough on the whole sport to big Jack Boyd for the whole sport.

241
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.880
Um, but I, you know,

242
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.270
we just, uh, huddled together, me and my team, me and our company, we, you know,

243
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.340
rice for my dad's company. So that whole company kinda just kinda held,

244
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.980
held itself together and everybody kind of pulled,

245
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.170
pulled together and worked our way through it.

246
00:15:45.171 --> 00:15:48.260
That first year in Oh one just that year, you know, that he was killed.

247
00:15:48.261 --> 00:15:50.210
That that was just a kind of a tough year.

248
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:54.140
I don't even really remember anything much about what happened that year.

249
00:15:55.910 --> 00:16:00.620
Um, won a couple of races. Uh, but it was a, otherwise,

250
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.680
you know, the races where we didn't win. I can't even,

251
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.640
I don't even remember much about them, you know,

252
00:16:07.641 --> 00:16:10.790
just retaining too much from it. It was just kind of a days, you know,

253
00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.180
Oh four was a great year.

254
00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.820
I think we kind of finally were coming out of the funk, you know,

255
00:16:15.821 --> 00:16:19.030
around 2004 kind of coming out of the cloud of that.

256
00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:25.050
I would imagine that being a race car driver and have your dad be who he was

257
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:31.300
always carried a lot of weight, but did he carry more weight after he was gone?

258
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:35.910
Were there more eyes on you? Yeah, I thought so. Um, you know, I thought he,

259
00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:40.860
he was tough. He knew who he was.

260
00:16:40.861 --> 00:16:45.090
To the sport. And he knew, he knew that, you know,

261
00:16:45.091 --> 00:16:46.380
he carried a,

262
00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:50.670
he carried a big massive fan base and he knew that people listen to when he

263
00:16:50.671 --> 00:16:54.750
spoke and all those things. And so when he was gone, I think some people,

264
00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.890
some people kind of looked at me to try to carry that same load and even be that

265
00:16:58.891 --> 00:17:03.360
same person. And I just wasn't gonna do it. Um, I was like, man,

266
00:17:03.361 --> 00:17:07.530
I'm going to be me. I'm going to be the PR, you know, like I said, he was,

267
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.790
he's this 10 foot tall black hat and I'm, I'm this short,

268
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.660
scrawny pale kid. You know, I was,

269
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:17.310
I couldn't be who he was.

270
00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:21.240
I'd have been faking it and I couldn't be the intimidator, you know,

271
00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.600
so I just have always, ever since then

272
00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:31.500
banned me and if that's good, if you'd like that. Um, great.

273
00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:38.160
Uh, I think I've been relatable, honest, genuine. Um,

274
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.720
and the fan base that I gained when he passed away,

275
00:17:42.721 --> 00:17:44.850
I thought we nurtured that and grew that.

276
00:17:44.851 --> 00:17:48.060
And I think we did a lot of great things, uh, and,

277
00:17:48.061 --> 00:17:51.690
and outside the to, uh, to do that.

278
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:56.130
Um, so I'm kind of proud of all those things.

279
00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.180
I thought I handled that well. Um,

280
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:04.770
considering there are a lot of different avenues to go at that time and I think

281
00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:08.490
I chose some good ones and certainly probably could have made some different

282
00:18:08.491 --> 00:18:10.500
decisions and have regrets.

283
00:18:10.501 --> 00:18:14.400
But for the most part I was able to, you know,

284
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.600
add to his legacy a little bit. That was something that was important to me.

285
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:23.040
I didn't go out there and win 90 day on races. I didn't win seven championships,

286
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.450
but I didn't hurt his legacy. I added to it, uh,

287
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:31.980
made a lot of people happy. Uh, there was an Earnhardt on the track,

288
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:36.720
you know, that was good for a lot of people deal.

289
00:18:36.721 --> 00:18:38.820
You got a great perspective. Well, thanks.
