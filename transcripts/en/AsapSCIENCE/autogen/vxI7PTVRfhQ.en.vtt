00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.220
 As the music legend (Whitney Houston) said: "The crack is bad." But with all this extra attention 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.460
 Recently, thanks to Toronto Mayor Rob Ford - what exactly is crack cocaine? Is it really as 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.690
 'Bad' as she portrayed us to be? 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.759
 Crack is just another form of cocaine, which comes from coca leaf leaves. 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.230
 After mixing the cocaine powder with a weak base material, such as baking soda, it changes the composition 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.109
 A solid is produced, often referred to as 'rock'. This solid material has a much lower melting temperature 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.099
 The temperature of cocaine melting (90C vs. 190C) is why it is allowed to smoke unlike its smell. 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.920
 In fact, it's called a 'crack' because of the sound it emits when heated. But why smoke it? Okay, 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.129
 Lungs are a very fast and effective way to deliver substances into the bloodstream. 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.840
 For example those who suffer from asthma, use inhalers to quickly put the medication directly into their bodies 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.929
 . When smoke meets with a large area in your lungs, it also slips through 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:53.589
 The membrane, directed directly to the brain, is in less than 8 seconds. This is much faster 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.109
 And more effective than cocaine which normally takes about 10 minutes 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.199
 To reach the brain. 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.920
 However, in both cases, when you reach the brain, the crack and cocaine have the same effectiveness. Initially users 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.000
 They feel active, alert and more feeling their senses. In the brain, the crack works 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.820
 On the ventral membranes, the release of large amounts of dopamine - a chemical often associated 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.260
 With feelings of pleasure and ecstasy. Dopamine travels between brain-called cells 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.180
 Neurons - are associated with nerve receptors that trigger good feelings. Now, usually, dopamine 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.450
 The neurons will be absorbed back into the neurons by dopamine transporter, but the crack changes 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.810
 this process. The crack is linked to the carrier and prevents re-uptake, allowing dopamine 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.470
 To build and continuously stimulate receptors. As a result, you feel - well - really 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.340
 Good for about 10 minutes. 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.320
 But shortly after, dopamine levels in the brain are rapidly decreasing, causing a severe decrease 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.090
 Often caused depression feelings. That's why many users usually smoke more, hopefully 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.170
 Reach that ecstasy again. Unfortunately, dopamine levels take a long time 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.520
 The regeneration is natural, so people contribute to the physical and psychological dependence on crack or addiction, as well as increase 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.180
 Irritability, insomnia, paranoia or suspicion. 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.990
 In some cases, crack or cocaine abuse frequently leads to so-called phantom parasites 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.130
 - The feeling that bugs or insects creep under the skin. This often leads to self-destructive behavior 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.860
 , Such as scratching or biting, trying to get rid of the imagined bugs. 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.780
 In the most serious cases, the impact of crack on the heart can cause heart attacks and strokes, 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.910
 Or even completely stop the heart, leading to death. 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.230
 Simply put, the ultimate crack possible leads to misfortunes!
