00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
- [Tutor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.515
is talk more about
inflation and deflation,

00:00:04.515 --> 00:00:06.776
which we've talked about in other videos,

00:00:06.776 --> 00:00:09.350
but we're gonna talk
about it in the context

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.670
of who benefits and who gets hurt,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.450
especially in a situation where people

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.680
are lending money to each
other at fixed rates,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.130
so let's set up a little scenario here.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.370
So let's say that this is today

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.450
and this is in one year,

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.490
so in one year

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.820
and today I need my teeth
cleaned, it's an emergency,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.950
but I don't have money to clean my teeth,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.443
it costs 100 dollars and
you're my okay friend

00:00:37.443 --> 00:00:39.810
and you say "Yes, you do
need your teeth cleaned,

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.020
"I will lend you 100 dollars,

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.530
"but I want to charge some interest,"

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.470
so today from my point of view,

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.220
I am going to borrow, I am going to borrow

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.600
100 dollars from you, my okay friend

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.123
and in a year I have to pay back,

00:00:56.123 --> 00:00:57.923
you're gonna charge me 10% interest,

00:00:57.923 --> 00:01:00.110
so I'm gonna have to pay back,

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.755
pay back

00:01:01.755 --> 00:01:04.150
110 dollars.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.310
Now let's think about some
different scenarios on inflation,

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.990
so let's imagine a world,
where there's no inflation,

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.290
so let's say today is my base period,

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.240
where the CPI is 100

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.660
and let's imagine that
the actual basket of goods

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.610
in our country is actually 100 dollars,

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.130
it'll help us visualize
things a little bit more

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.300
and let's say we have no inflation,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.120
so in one year, the CPI,
that basket of goods

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.290
is still 100 dollars,

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.363
so in real terms and in future videos,

00:01:34.363 --> 00:01:38.220
we'll talk more about
real and nominal terms,

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.741
but in real terms, you could
buy 10% more with 110 dollars,

00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:44.750
than you could with that 100 dollars,

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.710
so you really got a real 10% return,

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.791
but now let's imagine a scenario

00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:52.520
with a little bit of
inflation, a reasonable amount,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.315
where in our base here, our CPI is 100

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:59.610
and then in a year, maybe
we've had 2% inflation,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.010
so now our Consumer Price Index is 102,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.460
well in this scenario, you're now,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.390
and especially if we
view that basket of goods

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.570
as actually costing 100
dollars in the first year

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.100
and then 102 dollars one year
later, as we've talked about,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.560
that's not always going to be the case,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.920
in fact in most countries,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.860
it's not that you could actually buy

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.340
that basket of goods for 100 dollars,

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.320
the 100 is usually just to be indicative,

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.730
but this is to help us make things

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.080
a little bit more tangible.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.560
In this world, you're going to be able

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.941
to buy more than a basket
of goods, but not 10% more,

00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:36.620
you're going to be able to buy

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.740
a little bit less than 8% more

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.651
and then we can set up a scenario,

00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:43.260
where we have fairly extreme inflation

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.140
and this will make things very clear,

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.580
where our CPI goes from 100

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.880
to let's say that price
is more than double,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.406
so let's say we go to
a world, where our CPI,

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:56.254
so this would be pretty extreme inflation,

00:02:56.254 --> 00:03:00.160
where our CPI goes to 220.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.160
So this is really interesting,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.780
because in right now at the present,

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.730
what you are lending me,

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.162
that's equivalent to the basket of goods,

00:03:09.162 --> 00:03:12.000
I could actually buy the
basket of goods there,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.510
while in year one, what
I'm paying back to you,

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.300
you could only buy half a basket of goods

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.854
and so you lent me money

00:03:18.854 --> 00:03:22.086
and even though nominally
it looks just superficially

00:03:22.086 --> 00:03:25.410
like you're getting 10%
more in terms of dollars,

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.430
you can buy half as much
with that 110 dollars

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.330
as you could have bought a
year ago with that 100 dollars,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.293
so in this world, even
though it looks like

00:03:35.293 --> 00:03:38.260
you're getting a 10% nominal return,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.310
your real return is pretty bad,

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.640
your real return is negative 50%,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.040
you can buy half as much
with what you're getting

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.830
paid back as what you originally lent

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.010
and so the general trend here

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.649
is when you are in an
inflationary environment,

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:57.350
especially when the inflation
is more than expected,

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.760
oftentimes the interest rate
will bake in some inflation,

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.388
people will expect some
inflation in the interest rate,

00:04:03.388 --> 00:04:05.521
but in general, inflation is going to,

00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:06.634
the more inflation you have,

00:04:06.634 --> 00:04:08.590
if you think about it
from my point of view,

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.707
I borrowed something where

00:04:09.707 --> 00:04:11.740
I could have bought the basket of goods,

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.960
if you imagine the basket of goods

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.480
actually costs 100 dollars

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.470
and I'm paying back something,

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.840
where that would only buy
half a basket of goods,

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.090
you could even imagine
with that 100 dollars,

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.900
I buy a basket of goods
and then a year later,

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.750
I sell that basket of
goods for 220 dollars

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.130
and then I only have to pay half

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.400
of that 220 dollars back to you

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.670
and so I wouldn't have
got my teeth cleaned

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.060
in that situation,

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.520
but I would have been able
to profit from that thing

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.730
and so inflation,

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.480
especially when it's more
than expected inflation,

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.970
it benefits borrowers at fixed rates,

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.620
benefits borrowers

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.453
at fixed rates

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:49.290
and I keep saying at fixed rates,

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.040
because it's possible
that your interest rate

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.323
might somehow be pegged to inflation,

00:04:52.323 --> 00:04:54.690
in which case it might
not benefit you so much

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.960
and it hurts lenders, it hurts lenders

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.040
at fixed rates.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.270
Now as you can imagine,

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.709
deflation is going to be the opposite

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:05.300
and to make this very clear,

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.900
I'll make a very extreme
deflationary scenario.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.150
Imagine we go from a CPI of 100

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.430
to a CPI,

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.000
CPI of 55

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.394
and if we literally view
that same basket of goods,

00:05:20.394 --> 00:05:22.600
that would have cost 100 dollars

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.940
only costs 55 dollars now, think about it,

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.427
I am borrowing equivalent
of a basket of goods

00:05:29.427 --> 00:05:33.620
and then I'm paying back to
you two baskets of goods,

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.440
110 dollars would buy two
baskets of goods in a year

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.960
and so in this deflationary scenario,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.340
in this deflationary scenario,

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.218
you are actually getting,
even though nominally,

00:05:45.218 --> 00:05:47.460
it looks like you're getting a 10% return,

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.550
the lender's getting a 10% return,

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.813
the real return, they're
getting 100% return,

00:05:51.813 --> 00:05:54.220
they're able to buy twice as much

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.330
with what they get back,
than what they lent

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.370
and so this deflation hurts
borrowers at fixed rates,

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.310
hurts borrowers

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.570
at fixed rates

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.610
and it helps, and it helps lenders,

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.040
lenders at fixed rates.
