00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.730
Let's continue with our study
of the planet Lubricon VI.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.470
Now the one thing I did not
tell you in the last video

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.250
is that Lubricon VI is
not rotating at all.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.900
And because it's
not rotating, it

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.190
can really not have an equator.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.110
So when we talked about in
the path of this frozen sock,

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.310
instead of saying it's
traveling across an equator,

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.990
I should say it's traveling
along a great circle.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.730
If you assume that
earth is a sphere--

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.771
and it's not a perfect
sphere-- but if you assume

00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:32.340
it's a sphere, our equator
would be a perfect sphere.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.431
But in order to have an equator,
you need to have some rotation.

00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:36.930
This right over
here, we'll just say

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.040
it's traveling along the
largest possible circle

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.230
that it can travel along.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.480
It's traveling along one of the
great circles of this sphere,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.740
this block of sock
right over there.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.590
And now that we know
it's not rotating,

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.430
I want to enter another
thought experiment.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.850
Because this little frozen block
of sock is not the only thing

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.230
that's on the surface
of Lubricon VI.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.010
Over here-- we were
viewing it at a distance--

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.220
but right over there,
if we were to zoom in,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.870
you would see sitting on
the surface of Lubricon VI--

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.390
so once again, that's the
surface-- is a frozen banana.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.750
So this right over
here is a block of ice.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.710
And in that block of
ice we have a banana.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.750
It's a frozen banana.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.600
So that's my best attempt
at drawing our banana.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.370
And this relative to the
surface of Lubricon VI

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.030
is absolutely stationary.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.800
It has absolutely no tangential
velocity like this block had

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.500
and will continue to
have for all eternity.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.900
This has absolutely no
tangential velocity.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.650
And so my question
for you, if we

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.680
think about what are the
forces acting on this?

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.020
Well, we have the
force of gravity

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.590
towards the center
of Lubricon VI.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.350
So we have the force of gravity.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.270
And I'm drawing all the
forces from the center

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.570
of mass of this block of banana.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.940
So once again, let me
draw that same color.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.910
We have the force of gravity
acting radially inward.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.650
And then we know that
this banana is not

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.900
plummeting straight into
the center of the Earth.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.830
There must be some other force
that is keeping it stationary.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.940
And that force is the
force of the surface

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.480
of Lubricon VI on the banana or
on this block that's keeping it

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.410
from plunging towards
the center of the planet.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.540
So that, in this case,
is the normal force.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.110
And my question to you
is, are these two things

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.595
equal in the case of the banana?

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.450
Well, as far as we
can tell, this banana

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.880
is completely at rest.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.220
This planet right over here, at
least relative to the planet,

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.270
this planet right here has
absolutely no rotation.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.020
And this banana has no relative
motion towards the planet.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.990
It is not accelerating in
absolutely any direction.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.730
And if it's not accelerating
in any direction,

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.030
the net forces on
it in any dimension

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.320
must all or must be 0,
or all of the forces

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.400
must cancel out with each other.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.230
So in the case of this banana,
the normal force exactly

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.510
cancels out the
force of gravity.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.520
These two things,
the normal force

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.830
is exactly equal to the
inward force of gravity.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.730
Or I guess we should
say that they add to 0.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.320
They're going in
opposite directions.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.190
So I should say the normal
force plus the force of gravity

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.490
are going to be equal 0.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.400
They have the same
exact magnitude.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.240
They're going in
opposite directions.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.090
So when you add them together,
they are going to cancel out.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.160
Now, with that little thought
experiment out of the way,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.210
let's return to the frozen sock.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.790
The frozen sock, as
we already learned,

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.330
is orbiting around this
planet at a altitude of 0

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.660
for all eternity at
1 kilometer per hour.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.520
And we know that
the force of gravity

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.780
is acting on it towards
the center of the planet

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.740
and there is a
normal force that's

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.400
keeping it from
plummeting, from spiraling

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.950
towards the center
of the planet.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.899
But my question to you is, in
the case of the frozen sock

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.940
right over here,
are these two forces

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.790
equal like they
are for the banana?

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.090
So in the case of the
frozen sock, the traveling,

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:39.280
orbiting sock, if these two
forces had the same magnitude,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.200
but just going in opposite
directions the way

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.690
we've drawn it right over here,
it would completely cancel out.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.270
And then we would
have no net force.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.460
So let me make it clear.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:55.210
If the normal force plus
the force of gravity

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.490
canceled out with each
other, if this equalled 0,

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.270
then we would have
absolutely no net force

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.630
and the object would not
accelerate in any direction.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.114
An object in motion
will stay in motion.

00:05:09.114 --> 00:05:10.530
So this one right
over here, if it

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.740
had no net force
acting on it, it

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.360
would not stay on the
surface of the planet.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.265
It would just travel
in a straight line,

00:05:18.265 --> 00:05:20.890
in a tangential line from where
it happens to be at this moment

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:21.660
forever.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.900
So if it was right over here--
I know this isn't the path,

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.960
it would just keep
traveling forever

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.150
off the surface of the planet.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.820
We know that clearly is
not what's happening.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.740
It is orbiting
around the planet.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.860
It has a circular path.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.156
And since it has
a circular path--

00:05:39.156 --> 00:05:41.030
so if I were to draw a
cross-section of its--

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.430
if I were to look at
its path from the side,

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.730
it has a circular
path like that.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:46.880
It is going like that.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.330
It is constantly being
accelerated inward.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.910
There is some
centripetal acceleration

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.330
going on, inward acceleration.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.340
So in order for that inward
acceleration to be going on,

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.680
there must be some
net inward force.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.950
So in this situation, in the
situation for the stationary

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.020
banana, these two guys
cancelled each other out.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.020
But for the case of the moving
frozen sock, the sock that

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.850
is orbiting for all of
eternity, it is in orbit.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.600
It has a circular path.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.110
So there are centripetal motion.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.480
There is some net inward
force going on here.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.980
So

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:32.570
In this situation, the magnitude
of the force of gravity

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:40.030
is going to be greater than the
magnitude of the normal force.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.700
So we don't have this situation.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.360
In that situation,
you wouldn't orbit.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.100
We have the situation
where you do

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.690
have some net centripetal force.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.890
The force of gravity,
the magnitude of it,

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.834
is slightly larger than the
magnitude of the normal force.

00:06:53.834 --> 00:06:55.500
And an interesting
thing to think about,

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.950
and we might address it
in a future tutorial,

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.320
is what would happen if this
started going faster and faster

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.600
and faster, if the frozen
sock were to accelerate.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.520
What then?

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.370
How would the relationship
between these two things

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.930
potentially change,
if they change at all?
