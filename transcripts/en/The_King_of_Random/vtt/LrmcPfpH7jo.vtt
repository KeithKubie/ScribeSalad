00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.310
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop today

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.280
We're going to be taking a look at how you can build your own very simplified version of a potentially complicated machine

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.620
Steam engine is one of the earliest ways that people were able to harness heat and turn it into motion

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.979
We're not going to be building anything that could move something the size of a train

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.839
But we are going to try building something that uses heat to create motion the supplies

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.510
we need are really simple a tea light candle a couple of pieces of cork sheet and a very thin metal tube

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.300
Ideally we would be using a thin copper tube

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.789
since copper conducts heat better than aluminium

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.629
But copper tubing this small proved very difficult to find I picked this aluminum tube up at a hobby store for about 2 bucks

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.349
the interior diameter of this aluminum tube is probably only about

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.989
1/16 of an inch maybe one and a half millimeters tea lights are available at a lot of places

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.198
I got mine at a craft store in a pack of 50 for 3 bucks

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.320
My cork sheets are also from a craft store, and I think they're usually designed for going on the bottom of coasters

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.199
But we're gonna use them for something different the basic ideas

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.530
We'll have our tub full of water

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.330
Our cork sheets will float on that with our candle on top of it

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.500
Then a small piece of our aluminum tubing will come up through one side of the cork

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.439
wrap and a coil above the flame and then go down through the cork on the other side with our coil full of water when

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.919
We light our candle the heat should turn the water into steam which will expand and push out the bottom to start out we want

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.430
To put a nice circular bend in the middle of part of our tube. It's important

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.110
We don't kink the metal tube because we do need the water and steam to be able to travel all the way through it so

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.360
Let's try wrapping it around this bottle of paint to see if we can get a nice smooth curve in it that doesn't kink

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.270
Alright that worked out pretty well you can see that

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.779
We've got the aluminum tube going up making one complete circuit

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.000
And then heading back down through the other side we have too much metal tube on the sides here

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.240
So we want to trim that off

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.519
And we want to measure to make sure we have the right length so that it's situated just

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.680
Above our candle flame for maximum heat to get a good measurement of where we should cut our tube

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.490
Let's light our candle and then

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.740
Position our tube right over it so we can see how long we want it to be on the sides

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.639
We now have a fairly stable flame on our candle so we can measure the height that we want with our coil

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.980
You may also notice that the loop

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.669
I put in the aluminum is large enough that the sides of our aluminum tube

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.760
Fit on the sides of the candle we don't want to use something that gives us such a tight coil that they would run into

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.049
The candle with our candle on our cork sheets. We can see exactly how far down

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.510
We need the sides of our aluminum tubes to come

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.370
We do want our tubes to extend a little bit below the level of the cork

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.310
They'll push down below the cork into the water and then we'll angle them slightly to give our engine some drive

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.620
I'll use this pipe cutting tool to cut off the excess of our aluminum without crimping the ends

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:07.319
Now this aluminum tubing is so thin that it barely fits in our pipe cutter so even after using the pipe cutter

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.730
I have to give it a little bit of help

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.589
A quick test of blowing into one side lets us know that we still have a good flow all the way through our tube

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.080
Now our cork sheets are a little bit larger than we need them to be and we don't want any excess weight or drag so

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.809
Let's cut a slightly smaller circle out of our larger circles

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.959
The diameter of this electrical tape is slightly wider than the stance of our aluminum pipe, so that should be a good size

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.438
I should also say if you have thicker

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.459
Sheets of cork you probably don't need to stack two of them together the way

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.929
I'm going to this just provides a little bit of extra stability as it floats on the water

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:03.989
Now we need to poke holes in both sheets of cork so that the sides of our aluminum tube can run down through the cork

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:10.349
Into the water that will be below. Let's just use a spare piece of our aluminum tubing to stab through the cork I

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.239
Used this spare piece of tubing because

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.590
Poking through the cork can plug up the hole with some of the course material

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.519
And we want to be sure we have good flow on the tube that we'll be carrying our water and steam

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.999
We can now see the basic design that we're gonna be going for

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:36.689
With the bottom points of our tube angled slightly we should get motion that drives our entire engine in a circle

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.509
Water inside the coil should heat up from the candle turn into steam, and then be forced at the bottom of the tubes

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.279
Let's slightly bend the bottoms of the tubes so that as the steam is forced out

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.459
It's at an angle that will then push our engine into spinning

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.470
Of course we need to be very careful as we bend these to make sure we don't kink the metal

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.569
Let's just blow through the tube again to make sure we still have good airflow

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.099
Yep still good, they're still good flow through the tube just what we want now

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:12.289
Let's fit the two ends of our tube down through the cork

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.520
It'll take some angling and twisting a little bit to get it in there now that we've bent the ends

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.710
But it should fit just fine and cork is pretty flexible

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:34.279
You can see the tube comes up through one side coils around goes back down to the other and with the two ends bent at

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.320
Opposing angles hopefully when the steam is ejected it should cause the whole thing spin

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.779
We can see our set up, but before we put the candle on and light it. There's one more step

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.589
We need to take we want some water to start inside of our metal coil

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.929
so let's briefly take it off of our cork and

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.059
Use it as a straw to suck a little bit of water up through the tube and then reinstall it

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.949
All right there we go, we've got water coming through tastes like metal

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.920
Carefully line our candle up right underneath our coil

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.740
And we light that off. It should give enough heat that our whole engine begins to spin I

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.470
Spilled a little bit of candle wax on the sides, but that shouldn't affect the movement very much

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.659
Now this setup is a little bit finicky sometimes

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.589
it does a really good job of pulling more water in and continuing to spin and

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.570
Sometimes it seems to sort of stall

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.059
I think you have to get it in just the right spot

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.850
So it's really doing a good job of heating the water up

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:55.040
But I have had times where I got this to keep spinning almost perpetually for up to 20 minutes. I

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.780
Want to see if I can do something to illustrate how much the water is circulating through this coil

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:05.599
I'm gonna try adding a little bit of blue dye to some water and then filling the coil with that water

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:11.989
Hopefully when that heats up. We'll be able to see the blue squirt out of the bottom Jets now

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:17.210
I am a little bit worried that as I try and set this back in the water some of it will just drain right out

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.000
Of the tube and start coloring the water in our tub

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:26.179
Prematurely you can see a little bit of blue water is starting to escape on one side, but not too much of it

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.350
So hopefully this will still give us a good illustrative example

00:07:57.279 --> 00:08:02.609
There you have it how to take a little bit of aluminum to a tea light candle and a little bit of cork mat and

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:07.499
Turn it into a working steam engine this whole project only cost about five bucks for all of the supplies

00:08:07.499 --> 00:08:09.039
And it's pretty cool to watch it work

00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:13.889
Thanks for joining us for this project today and remember to come gear yourself up with products and merch at the king of random calm

00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:15.919
See you there

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.379
All right reset

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.279
How gosh alright that comes out really hot

00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:44.578
And powerfully you try to cover farther up my arm, and it just keeps shooting even more far of my arm
