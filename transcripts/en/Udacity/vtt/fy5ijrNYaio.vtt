00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.898
To start off, I went ahead and

00:00:01.898 --> 00:00:04.538
created all the variables that I knew I would need.

00:00:04.538 --> 00:00:10.011
I needed family1, family2, bruce, madison, and hunter.

00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:14.354
For family2, bruce, madison and hunter, I went ahead and

00:00:14.354 --> 00:00:19.120
passed in a string of an HTML element to the jQuery object.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.990
This creates a new DOM element.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.620
I made sure to include these h1, h2 and h3 tags so

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.810
I would know what I was looking at when I saw the page.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.130
After that, it was a simple matter of inserting family2 after family1,

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.820
appending bruce to family2, and then madison and hunter to bruce.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.180
But I want you to take a look at the syntax of .insertAfter because it's

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.330
a little different than what we've seen before with jQuery.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.130
insertAfter acts on some DOM element and then inserts it after the target.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.325
I also want you to notice that we could have used this command called

00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:56.040
.after instead.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.060
.after follows more normal jQuery syntax.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.160
It acts on a selector and then adds some content after it.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.849
We can go ahead and

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:08.770
check our work by looking at the resulting page, which looks pretty good.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.080
And we can open up DevTools to make sure that the DOM is

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.370
the way that we'd expect it to look
