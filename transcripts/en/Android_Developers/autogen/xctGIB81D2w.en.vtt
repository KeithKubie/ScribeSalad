app sizes and you know if you think you

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930
app sizes and you know if you think you
 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.110
app sizes and you know if you think you
know why is it important anyway why

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120
know why is it important anyway why
 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.760
know why is it important anyway why
should I care about app size and what is

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770
should I care about app size and what is
 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.910
should I care about app size and what is
app size anyway the first of all think

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920
app size anyway the first of all think
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.400
app size anyway the first of all think

megabyte they download and it's not
 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.260
megabyte they download and it's not
always easy for them to install apps to

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270
always easy for them to install apps to
 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.690
always easy for them to install apps to
keep the apps updated and it should

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
keep the apps updated and it should
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.210
keep the apps updated and it should
matter to you as developers that people

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220
matter to you as developers that people
 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.820
matter to you as developers that people
you know install your apps for one and

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830
you know install your apps for one and
 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.760
you know install your apps for one and
keep them updated and the other

keep them updated and the other
 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.060
keep them updated and the other
important thing is that people's phones

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070
important thing is that people's phones
 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.760
important thing is that people's phones
not always have like you know 16 gigs 32

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
not always have like you know 16 gigs 32
 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.810
not always have like you know 16 gigs 32
gigs of memory so they just can't keep

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820
gigs of memory so they just can't keep
 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.429

them a little bit by keeping your app
 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.450
them a little bit by keeping your app
just a little bit smaller so they maybe

alone and just not uninstall it so when
I was beginning to create this

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729
I was beginning to create this
 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.399
I was beginning to create this
presentation I was talking with lots of

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409
presentation I was talking with lots of
 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.590
presentation I was talking with lots of
developers at events and you know asked

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600
developers at events and you know asked
 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.200
developers at events and you know asked
them I had asked them a simple question

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210
them I had asked them a simple question
 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.149
them I had asked them a simple question
you know how big is your app and I

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159
you know how big is your app and I
 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.370
you know how big is your app and I
wonder if if I asked you just thinking

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380
wonder if if I asked you just thinking
 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.139
wonder if if I asked you just thinking
ahead now you know how big is your app

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149
ahead now you know how big is your app
 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.609
ahead now you know how big is your app
can you answer that in the five seconds

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619
can you answer that in the five seconds
 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.140
can you answer that in the five seconds
and if you thought a number

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150
and if you thought a number
 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.410
and if you thought a number
I'm pretty sure you thought of the raw

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420
I'm pretty sure you thought of the raw
 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.289
I'm pretty sure you thought of the raw
apk apk sighs so this is the file that

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299
apk apk sighs so this is the file that
 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.270
apk apk sighs so this is the file that
is produced by Android studio how many

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280
is produced by Android studio how many
 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.300
is produced by Android studio how many
people thought about that yeah lots of

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310
people thought about that yeah lots of
 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.949
people thought about that yeah lots of
people and that's that's correct that's

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959
people and that's that's correct that's
 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.360
people and that's that's correct that's
a correct answer it's technically

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370
a correct answer it's technically
 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.009
a correct answer it's technically
technically correct the best kind of

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019
technically correct the best kind of
 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.099
technically correct the best kind of
correct but you know application size is

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109
correct but you know application size is
 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:34.710
correct but you know application size is
not about the you know the file on your

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720
not about the you know the file on your
 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.979
not about the you know the file on your
computer their user doesn't really

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989
computer their user doesn't really
 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.849
computer their user doesn't really
interact with the file on your hard

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859
interact with the file on your hard
 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.740
interact with the file on your hard
drive that Android studio produces

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750
drive that Android studio produces
 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.309
drive that Android studio produces
so the important the other important

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319
so the important the other important
 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.020
so the important the other important
sizes we can talk about is the download

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030
sizes we can talk about is the download
 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.770
sizes we can talk about is the download
size so again if I'm on a you know not a

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780
size so again if I'm on a you know not a
 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.210
size so again if I'm on a you know not a
very good network connection if I have

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220
very good network connection if I have
 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.490
very good network connection if I have
to pay for the data that I use before

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500
to pay for the data that I use before
 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.199
to pay for the data that I use before
downloading an app I have to actually

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209
downloading an app I have to actually
 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.080
downloading an app I have to actually
look and think can I afford download

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090
look and think can I afford download
 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.670
look and think can I afford download
leda's app can I afford you know

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680
leda's app can I afford you know
 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.309
leda's app can I afford you know
spending this much money on this many

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319
spending this much money on this many
 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.619
spending this much money on this many
megabytes to download it and it's not

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629
megabytes to download it and it's not
 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.300
megabytes to download it and it's not
always the same as ROI pick a size which

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310
always the same as ROI pick a size which
 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.520
always the same as ROI pick a size which
we'll find out a moment then there's

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530
we'll find out a moment then there's
 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.259
we'll find out a moment then there's
install size so like I mentioned the

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269
install size so like I mentioned the
 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.979
install size so like I mentioned the
other important metric is how much space

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989
other important metric is how much space
 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.050
other important metric is how much space
users actually have on their devices and

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060
users actually have on their devices and
 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.300
users actually have on their devices and
how much space your app will actually

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310
how much space your app will actually
 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.520
how much space your app will actually
take up and again it's not that easy so

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530
take up and again it's not that easy so
 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.860
take up and again it's not that easy so
it's not always the same as through ipk

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870
it's not always the same as through ipk
 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.050
it's not always the same as through ipk
size nor is it the download size and

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060
size nor is it the download size and
 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.770
size nor is it the download size and
I'll tell you about why in a sec and

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780
I'll tell you about why in a sec and
 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.500
I'll tell you about why in a sec and
third of all the update size again you

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510
third of all the update size again you
 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.050
third of all the update size again you
might think people download an apk if

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060
might think people download an apk if
 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.490
might think people download an apk if
they want a new version they get a new

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500
they want a new version they get a new
 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.379
they want a new version they get a new
apk right so it must be the same as the

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389
apk right so it must be the same as the
 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.599
apk right so it must be the same as the
download size only with a new apk well

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609
download size only with a new apk well
 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.449
download size only with a new apk well
that's also not true and then there's

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459
that's also not true and then there's
 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.399
that's also not true and then there's
other metrics which are really really

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:44.409
other metrics which are really really
 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.379
other metrics which are really really
important like you know RAM footprint

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389
important like you know RAM footprint
 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.659
important like you know RAM footprint
how much memory your app uses you know

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:48.669
how much memory your app uses you know
 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.580
how much memory your app uses you know
how many methods are in your net in your

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590
how many methods are in your net in your
 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.589
how many methods are in your net in your
app that's really important for like for

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599
app that's really important for like for
 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.809
app that's really important for like for
if you have to use multi decks or not

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819
if you have to use multi decks or not
 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.969
if you have to use multi decks or not
and probably lots and lots of other

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:56.979
and probably lots and lots of other
 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:58.860
and probably lots and lots of other
metrics for app size but we're not

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870
metrics for app size but we're not
 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.539
metrics for app size but we're not
really going to talk about those we're

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549
really going to talk about those we're
 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.360
really going to talk about those we're
concentrating more on apk size and the

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370
concentrating more on apk size and the
 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.069
concentrating more on apk size and the
four metrics that I mentioned in the

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079
four metrics that I mentioned in the
 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.979
four metrics that I mentioned in the
beginning

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989
beginning
 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.099
beginning
so before we start before we start

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109
so before we start before we start
 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.710
so before we start before we start
talking about how to optimize for all

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720
talking about how to optimize for all
 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.680
talking about how to optimize for all
those four scenarios you know four apk

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690
those four scenarios you know four apk
 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.170
those four scenarios you know four apk
size download size and so on just a

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180
size download size and so on just a
 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.659
size download size and so on just a
quick primer and

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669
quick primer and
 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.760
quick primer and
look at the internals what's actually in

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770
look at the internals what's actually in
 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.550
look at the internals what's actually in
an ATK so that we can talk about you

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560
an ATK so that we can talk about you
 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.260
an ATK so that we can talk about you
know what we can what we can do with it

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270
know what we can what we can do with it
 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.269
know what we can what we can do with it
and we what we cannot do and an apk it's

00:04:32.269 --> 00:04:32.279
and we what we cannot do and an apk it's
 

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:34.369
and we what we cannot do and an apk it's
really just a zip archive you probably

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:34.379
really just a zip archive you probably
 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.860
really just a zip archive you probably
all know that if you unpack it to a

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870
all know that if you unpack it to a
 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.140
all know that if you unpack it to a
folder or just inspect it in a you know

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150
folder or just inspect it in a you know
 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.510
folder or just inspect it in a you know
archive viewer first of all you will

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520
archive viewer first of all you will
 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.089
archive viewer first of all you will
find the application code so there's

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099
find the application code so there's
 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:46.309
find the application code so there's
bytecode there's the Dex the Dex files

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:46.319
bytecode there's the Dex the Dex files
 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.320
bytecode there's the Dex the Dex files
or maybe one classes.dex there may be

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330
or maybe one classes.dex there may be
 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.029
or maybe one classes.dex there may be
more if you're using multi Dex that's

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039
more if you're using multi Dex that's
 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.070
more if you're using multi Dex that's
pretty much all your code that you wrote

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080
pretty much all your code that you wrote
 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.839
pretty much all your code that you wrote
or your libraries that you imported and

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849
or your libraries that you imported and
 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.339
or your libraries that you imported and
so on and so on

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349
so on and so on
 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.170
so on and so on
there's also native code so native

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180
there's also native code so native
 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.779
there's also native code so native
libraries compiled for a specific CPU

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789
libraries compiled for a specific CPU
 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.719
libraries compiled for a specific CPU
architecture or ABI that resides in the

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729
architecture or ABI that resides in the
 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:04.610
architecture or ABI that resides in the
lips folder and under libs you have all

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620
lips folder and under libs you have all
 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.409
lips folder and under libs you have all
these architectures so if you have an

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419
these architectures so if you have an
 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.529
these architectures so if you have an
arm device it needs arm iso files and so

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539
arm device it needs arm iso files and so
 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.219
arm device it needs arm iso files and so
on and so on then resources a pretty big

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229
on and so on then resources a pretty big
 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.070
on and so on then resources a pretty big
part of your app usually and resources

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080
part of your app usually and resources
 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.689
part of your app usually and resources
are really divided into two categories

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699
are really divided into two categories
 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.869
are really divided into two categories
so in the rest folder we have all kinds

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:20.879
so in the rest folder we have all kinds
 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:23.499
so in the rest folder we have all kinds
of resources like drawables you know PNG

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:23.509
of resources like drawables you know PNG
 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.100
of resources like drawables you know PNG
jpeg files layouts and so and so on and

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110
jpeg files layouts and so and so on and
 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.110
jpeg files layouts and so and so on and
there's also another file resources dot

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120
there's also another file resources dot
 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.070
there's also another file resources dot
arsc which contains mostly styles

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080
arsc which contains mostly styles
 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.320
arsc which contains mostly styles
identifiers and strings and also this

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330
identifiers and strings and also this
 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.269
identifiers and strings and also this
file can get pretty big so we'll talk

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:38.279
file can get pretty big so we'll talk
 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:40.279
file can get pretty big so we'll talk
about how to reduce that size as well

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289
about how to reduce that size as well
 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.589
about how to reduce that size as well
and then there's all kind of kinds of

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599
and then there's all kind of kinds of
 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.019
and then there's all kind of kinds of
miscellaneous stuff like you know other

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:45.029
miscellaneous stuff like you know other
 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:48.139
miscellaneous stuff like you know other
assets like you put any file that you

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:48.149
assets like you put any file that you
 

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:50.929
assets like you put any file that you
use as a you know binary stream anything

00:05:50.929 --> 00:05:50.939
use as a you know binary stream anything
 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:52.610
use as a you know binary stream anything
that's not an Android resource so if you

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620
that's not an Android resource so if you
 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.170
that's not an Android resource so if you
want to have like a font bundle with

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180
want to have like a font bundle with
 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.749
want to have like a font bundle with
your app or some game data or some

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759
your app or some game data or some
 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:58.670
your app or some game data or some
textures you just put it in the in

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680
textures you just put it in the in
 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.139
textures you just put it in the in
assets and you can open it later in your

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:00.149
assets and you can open it later in your
 

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:04.490
assets and you can open it later in your
app then there's the meta in folder this

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500
app then there's the meta in folder this
 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.879
app then there's the meta in folder this
contains the apps apk signature and I'm

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889
contains the apps apk signature and I'm
 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:09.320
contains the apps apk signature and I'm
gonna talk about that in the next slide

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330
gonna talk about that in the next slide
 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.709
gonna talk about that in the next slide
and then there's the Android manifest so

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:11.719
and then there's the Android manifest so
 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:14.170
and then there's the Android manifest so
when you work on Android studio when you

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180
when you work on Android studio when you
 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.760
when you work on Android studio when you
actually compile your app Android studio

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770
actually compile your app Android studio
 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.850
actually compile your app Android studio

puts in the apk and one important thing

00:06:29.329 --> 00:06:29.339
puts in the apk and one important thing
 

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:31.879
puts in the apk and one important thing
is if you actually do what I said and

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:31.889
is if you actually do what I said and
 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.580
is if you actually do what I said and
extract the apk and try to inspect

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590
extract the apk and try to inspect
 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.040
extract the apk and try to inspect
file you will find that it's it's in a

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050
file you will find that it's it's in a
 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.450
file you will find that it's it's in a
dollar format it's actually in a binary

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460
dollar format it's actually in a binary
 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.640
dollar format it's actually in a binary
compressed format so you will not be

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650
compressed format so you will not be
 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.700
compressed format so you will not be
able to inspect it easily and I will

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710
able to inspect it easily and I will
 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:49.240
able to inspect it easily and I will
talk about how to do that in a sec so

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250
 
 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.100
 
apk signing like I said there's a whole

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110
apk signing like I said there's a whole
 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.190
apk signing like I said there's a whole
folder that contains the cryptographic

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.200
folder that contains the cryptographic
 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.560
folder that contains the cryptographic
signature for your apk we all know

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570
signature for your apk we all know
 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.000
signature for your apk we all know
that's important so that Android can

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.010
that's important so that Android can
 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.980
that's important so that Android can
verify that the app was produced by you

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990
verify that the app was produced by you
 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.930
verify that the app was produced by you
it comes from you it's you know it can

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940
it comes from you it's you know it can
 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.110
it comes from you it's you know it can
install it securely and how apk signing

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120
install it securely and how apk signing
 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.500
install it securely and how apk signing
a v1 works the important part to know

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.510
a v1 works the important part to know
 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.190
a v1 works the important part to know
here is that Android actually when

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:13.200
here is that Android actually when
 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.380
here is that Android actually when
verifying the signature it goes file by

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:15.390
verifying the signature it goes file by
 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.470
verifying the signature it goes file by
file but on every file in your archive

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:18.480
file but on every file in your archive
 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.950

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.870
and see and actually decompresses the
file then goes over the full file

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:23.880
file then goes over the full file
 

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.790
file then goes over the full file
contents check simply against the

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800
contents check simply against the
 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.270
contents check simply against the
signature and if it matches then the

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280
signature and if it matches then the
 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.770
signature and if it matches then the
signature it verifies its correct

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:30.780
signature it verifies its correct
 

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.010
signature it verifies its correct
so one thing that one one cool thing

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020
so one thing that one one cool thing
 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.810
so one thing that one one cool thing
that we can do about that this is

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:35.820
that we can do about that this is
 

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.180
that we can do about that this is
changing compression levels on files is

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:38.190
changing compression levels on files is
 

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.190
changing compression levels on files is
actually allowed so if you have an IP k

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:40.200
actually allowed so if you have an IP k
 

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.650
actually allowed so if you have an IP k
if it's a cryptographically sign you can

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:42.660
if it's a cryptographically sign you can
 

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.720
if it's a cryptographically sign you can
actually change compression on a file

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:44.730
actually change compression on a file
 

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.760
actually change compression on a file
inside the archive and that that will

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:46.770
inside the archive and that that will
 

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.120
inside the archive and that that will
not invalidate the signature another

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:50.130
not invalidate the signature another
 

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:51.470
not invalidate the signature another
thing that's useful to know is that

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:51.480
thing that's useful to know is that
 

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.660
thing that's useful to know is that
removing any files is not allowed so if

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:53.670
removing any files is not allowed so if
 

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.430
removing any files is not allowed so if
you remove a file you will have to

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440
you remove a file you will have to
 

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.610
you remove a file you will have to
resign your app and after making any

00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:58.620
resign your app and after making any
 

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.970
resign your app and after making any
changes to the archive to the apk

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:00.980
changes to the archive to the apk
 

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.500
changes to the archive to the apk
remember that you have to you you have

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:03.510
remember that you have to you you have
 

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.320
remember that you have to you you have
to run zipper line and after any changes

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:06.330
to run zipper line and after any changes
 

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.330
to run zipper line and after any changes
so even if you like change something

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:08.340
so even if you like change something
 

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.150
so even if you like change something
then sign the image sign the apk then

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.160
then sign the image sign the apk then
 

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.220
then sign the image sign the apk then
you always have to run the per line so

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:13.230
you always have to run the per line so
 

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:17.000
you always have to run the per line so
just a few rules but we have this new

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.010
just a few rules but we have this new
 

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:20.240
just a few rules but we have this new

said no changes are allowed and what's

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:51.960
said no changes are allowed and what's

fortunately Android studio has made some

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:03.150
fortunately Android studio has made some
 

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:07.660
fortunately Android studio has made some
improvements and I'm gonna tell you why

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:07.670
improvements and I'm gonna tell you why
 

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.880
improvements and I'm gonna tell you why
but what am I talking about all this why

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:10.890
but what am I talking about all this why
 

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.190
but what am I talking about all this why
why did I not go straight to the point

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200
why did I not go straight to the point
 

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.350
why did I not go straight to the point
and tell you you know what you can do to

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360
and tell you you know what you can do to
 

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.540
and tell you you know what you can do to
make your 80k smaller I think it's very

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:17.550
make your 80k smaller I think it's very
 

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.610
make your 80k smaller I think it's very
important to understand those things to

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:19.620
important to understand those things to
 

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.470
important to understand those things to
understand the role of every file in

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:21.480
understand the role of every file in
 

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.500
understand the role of every file in
this archive for example I said that

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:24.510
this archive for example I said that
 

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.560
this archive for example I said that
resources adult AARC can get pretty big

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:27.570
resources adult AARC can get pretty big
 

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.780
resources adult AARC can get pretty big
and so lots of developers notice that

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:29.790
and so lots of developers notice that
 

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.610
and so lots of developers notice that
they noticed that this file in their app

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:31.620
they noticed that this file in their app
 

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.400
they noticed that this file in their app
takes you know even 10 megabytes 15

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:34.410
takes you know even 10 megabytes 15
 

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.860
takes you know even 10 megabytes 15
megabytes and they also notice that it's

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:36.870
megabytes and they also notice that it's
 

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.680
megabytes and they also notice that it's
uncompressed so if you create an apk in

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:39.690
uncompressed so if you create an apk in
 

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.510
uncompressed so if you create an apk in
Android studio and you look at the

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:41.520
Android studio and you look at the
 

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.280
Android studio and you look at the
compression level of the of all the

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:43.290
compression level of the of all the
 

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.140
compression level of the of all the
files you will see that this file is

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:45.150
files you will see that this file is
 

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.240
files you will see that this file is
actually uncompressed so why doesn't

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:47.250
actually uncompressed so why doesn't
 

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.310
actually uncompressed so why doesn't
waste all this space I just said that it

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320
waste all this space I just said that it
 

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.590
waste all this space I just said that it

this knowledge of apk signing v1 they go
and compress this file and you know

00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160
and compress this file and you know

have to be decompressed into memory so
that's one thing you just shouldn't do

for example Playstore serves a

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:07.660
for example Playstore serves a
 

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.290
for example Playstore serves a
compressed version of your apk so in

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:10.300
compressed version of your apk so in
 

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.240
compressed version of your apk so in

Playstore will compress the apk

00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:19.569
Playstore will compress the apk
 

00:11:19.569 --> 00:11:21.180
Playstore will compress the apk
beforehand so we don't lose any

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:21.190
beforehand so we don't lose any
 

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.069

bytes over the network so that's good

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:25.290
bytes over the network so that's good

the user partition and will take up
 

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:25.590
the user partition and will take up
space on the user partition so so that

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600

libraries they take up more space but we

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:38.380
libraries they take up more space but we
 

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.780
libraries they take up more space but we
cannot remove them from the apk so

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:39.790
cannot remove them from the apk so
 

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.120
cannot remove them from the apk so
that's space wasted and fortunately

not going to cover that as much but
 

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.110
not going to cover that as much but
remember this is a very important part

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120

size so why is the update size different

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:19.090
size so why is the update size different
 

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:21.570
size so why is the update size different
than the download size and well I don't

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:21.580
than the download size and well I don't
 

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.400

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:41.210
what you can do if you want to actually
 

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.259
what you can do if you want to actually
you know measure if your efforts if what

00:18:44.259 --> 00:18:44.269
you know measure if your efforts if what
 

00:18:44.269 --> 00:18:46.389
you know measure if your efforts if what
Android studio is doing is doing any

00:18:46.389 --> 00:18:46.399
Android studio is doing is doing any
 

00:18:46.399 --> 00:18:48.489
Android studio is doing is doing any
good for for your update size and I'm

00:18:48.489 --> 00:18:48.499
good for for your update size and I'm
 

00:18:48.499 --> 00:18:50.830
good for for your update size and I'm
happy to say we finally released a tool

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:50.840
happy to say we finally released a tool
 

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.499
happy to say we finally released a tool
that will help you estimate and let me

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:53.509
that will help you estimate and let me
 

00:18:53.509 --> 00:18:55.210
that will help you estimate and let me
stress that estimate the update size

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:55.220
stress that estimate the update size
 

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.570
stress that estimate the update size
again there's there may be new argument

00:18:58.570 --> 00:18:58.580
again there's there may be new argument
 

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.430
again there's there may be new argument
algorithms there may be experiments that

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:00.440
algorithms there may be experiments that
 

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.139
algorithms there may be experiments that
are going on but this will give you a

00:19:02.139 --> 00:19:02.149
are going on but this will give you a
 

00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:04.269
are going on but this will give you a
good estimate on the current algorithms

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:04.279
good estimate on the current algorithms
 

00:19:04.279 --> 00:19:06.609
good estimate on the current algorithms
and how they work for your apk so

00:19:06.609 --> 00:19:06.619
and how they work for your apk so
 

00:19:06.619 --> 00:19:08.379
and how they work for your apk so
basically you're running it against an

00:19:08.379 --> 00:19:08.389
basically you're running it against an
 

00:19:08.389 --> 00:19:10.599
basically you're running it against an
old 80k a new apk you see the size

00:19:10.599 --> 00:19:10.609
old 80k a new apk you see the size
 

00:19:10.609 --> 00:19:12.909
old 80k a new apk you see the size
difference and you can see if any

00:19:12.909 --> 00:19:12.919
difference and you can see if any
 

00:19:12.919 --> 00:19:19.509
difference and you can see if any
changes you make make sense for that so

00:19:19.509 --> 00:19:19.519
changes you make make sense for that so
 

00:19:19.519 --> 00:19:20.950
changes you make make sense for that so
now I'm moving on to the second section

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960
now I'm moving on to the second section
 

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.049
now I'm moving on to the second section
which is kind of like a tips recipes on

00:19:23.049 --> 00:19:23.059
which is kind of like a tips recipes on
 

00:19:23.059 --> 00:19:25.960
which is kind of like a tips recipes on
how to actually actually make your apk

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:25.970
how to actually actually make your apk
 

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:30.519
how to actually actually make your apk
smaller and let's go through some of

00:19:30.519 --> 00:19:30.529
smaller and let's go through some of
 

00:19:30.529 --> 00:19:32.409
smaller and let's go through some of
those things and first of all how many

00:19:32.409 --> 00:19:32.419
those things and first of all how many
 

00:19:32.419 --> 00:19:34.419
those things and first of all how many
of you had read my articles on medium on

00:19:34.419 --> 00:19:34.429
of you had read my articles on medium on
 

00:19:34.429 --> 00:19:37.389
of you had read my articles on medium on
keeping apk size low some of you okay so

00:19:37.389 --> 00:19:37.399
keeping apk size low some of you okay so
 

00:19:37.399 --> 00:19:39.759
keeping apk size low some of you okay so
let me first explain one one point of

00:19:39.759 --> 00:19:39.769
let me first explain one one point of
 

00:19:39.769 --> 00:19:41.470
let me first explain one one point of
contention about using something

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:41.480
contention about using something
 

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.810
contention about using something
compression compression for apk so in

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:43.820
compression compression for apk so in
 

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.410
compression compression for apk so in
the Articles I

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:45.420
the Articles I
 

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.180
the Articles I
actually wrote that you can reduce the

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:47.190
actually wrote that you can reduce the
 

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:49.460
actually wrote that you can reduce the
size of our apk just by using better

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:49.470
size of our apk just by using better
 

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:50.990
size of our apk just by using better
compression method that's called softly

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000
compression method that's called softly
 

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.180
compression method that's called softly
it's an algorithm that was created by

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:53.190
it's an algorithm that was created by
 

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:56.090
it's an algorithm that was created by
Google engineers and yes it did make

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.100
Google engineers and yes it did make
 

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.630
Google engineers and yes it did make
your ATK smaller by a couple of percent

00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640
your ATK smaller by a couple of percent
 

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.090
your ATK smaller by a couple of percent
nothing much change for for like users

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:02.100
nothing much change for for like users
 

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.670
nothing much change for for like users
where they were decompressed just as

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:04.680
where they were decompressed just as
 

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.960
where they were decompressed just as
fast and so on and so on

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:05.970
fast and so on and so on
 

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:08.690
fast and so on and so on
but currently we advise against using

users did write to me saying that

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:15.270
users did write to me saying that
 

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.360

certain devices and certain versions of

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:17.370
certain devices and certain versions of
 

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:21.080
certain devices and certain versions of
Android might have had a kind of problem

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:21.090
Android might have had a kind of problem
 

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:23.660
Android might have had a kind of problem
with the optic impressed apk like they

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:23.670
with the optic impressed apk like they
 

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:26.330
with the optic impressed apk like they
just threw an exception so that's one

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:26.340
just threw an exception so that's one
 

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:29.030
just threw an exception so that's one
thing another thing is they take an

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:29.040
thing another thing is they take an
 

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.920
thing another thing is they take an
awful lot of time to compress on your

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:30.930
awful lot of time to compress on your
 

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:33.320
awful lot of time to compress on your
computer which well you don't make a

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:33.330
computer which well you don't make a
 

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:34.850
computer which well you don't make a
release you know every five minutes so

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:34.860
release you know every five minutes so
 

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.340
release you know every five minutes so
it's not that of a big deal but the next

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:37.350
it's not that of a big deal but the next
 

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.620
it's not that of a big deal but the next
thing is really really important so like

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:39.630
thing is really really important so like
 

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.300
thing is really really important so like
I said the Play Store team likes

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:41.310
I said the Play Store team likes
 

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.430
I said the Play Store team likes
experimenting with stuff and actually

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440
experimenting with stuff and actually
 

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.260
experimenting with stuff and actually
using zopfli because it's so resource

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:45.270
using zopfli because it's so resource
 

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:47.270
using zopfli because it's so resource
intensive and it needs you know so much

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280
intensive and it needs you know so much
 

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.700
intensive and it needs you know so much
as so much CPU and memory to compress it

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:49.710
as so much CPU and memory to compress it
 

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:51.860
as so much CPU and memory to compress it
might actually in the future it might

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:51.870
might actually in the future it might
 

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:54.620
might actually in the future it might
actually make new kinds of differential

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:54.630
actually make new kinds of differential
 

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:59.630
actually make new kinds of differential
updates impossible so if you read my

00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640
updates impossible so if you read my
 

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.490
updates impossible so if you read my
articles if you're thinking of you using

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:01.500
articles if you're thinking of you using
 

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.860
articles if you're thinking of you using
zap see forget about it just don't

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:03.870
zap see forget about it just don't
 

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.350
zap see forget about it just don't
especially since the new packaging

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360
especially since the new packaging
 

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.900
especially since the new packaging
system and Android studio actually

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:07.910
system and Android studio actually
 

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:09.920
system and Android studio actually
experiments when compressing files in

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:09.930
experiments when compressing files in
 

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:11.660
experiments when compressing files in
your archives and it actually figures

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:11.670
your archives and it actually figures
 

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.910
your archives and it actually figures
out the best gzip compression for the

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:13.920
out the best gzip compression for the
 

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.250
out the best gzip compression for the
files so that's that's also something

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:16.260
files so that's that's also something
 

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:21.740
files so that's that's also something
new in Android studio 2.2 next images

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:21.750
new in Android studio 2.2 next images
 

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.210
new in Android studio 2.2 next images
how many of you have been to call

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:23.220
how many of you have been to call
 

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:28.730
how many of you have been to call
session just just before yep so I'm just

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:28.740
session just just before yep so I'm just
 

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:32.300
session just just before yep so I'm just
gonna do a quick recap remember that you

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:32.310
gonna do a quick recap remember that you
 

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.750
gonna do a quick recap remember that you
can always pre optimize your images the

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:34.760
can always pre optimize your images the
 

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.310
can always pre optimize your images the
the tools that we currently have in

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320
the tools that we currently have in
 

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.230
the tools that we currently have in
Android studio in the in the in our

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240
Android studio in the in the in our
 

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.810
Android studio in the in the in our
build tools don't always do the best job

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:41.820
build tools don't always do the best job
 

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.610
build tools don't always do the best job
of figuring out the best compression for

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:43.620
of figuring out the best compression for
 

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.170
of figuring out the best compression for
images you know the best optimizations

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:45.180
images you know the best optimizations
 

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.110
images you know the best optimizations
they can make so you can you are free to

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120
they can make so you can you are free to
 

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.300
they can make so you can you are free to
use external tools to pre-process images

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:50.310
use external tools to pre-process images
 

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.990
use external tools to pre-process images
and your drawable folders they might be

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000
and your drawable folders they might be
 

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.210
and your drawable folders they might be
a lot smaller from that just remember

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:56.220
a lot smaller from that just remember
 

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:57.200
a lot smaller from that just remember
that

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:57.210
that
 

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:00.470
that
you used to have to add these lines to

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480
you used to have to add these lines to
 

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.860
you used to have to add these lines to
your build.gradle that's simply because

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:02.870
your build.gradle that's simply because
 

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:06.049
your build.gradle that's simply because
the again the packaging system had its

00:22:06.049 --> 00:22:06.059
the again the packaging system had its
 

00:22:06.059 --> 00:22:08.990
the again the packaging system had its
own optimizer and it wasn't let's say

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.000
own optimizer and it wasn't let's say
 

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.720
own optimizer and it wasn't let's say
smart enough to figure out that if you

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:11.730
smart enough to figure out that if you
 

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:15.139
smart enough to figure out that if you
pre process an image then our built

00:22:15.139 --> 00:22:15.149
pre process an image then our built
 

00:22:15.149 --> 00:22:17.389
pre process an image then our built
tools processes again they could

00:22:17.389 --> 00:22:17.399
tools processes again they could
 

00:22:17.399 --> 00:22:19.460
tools processes again they could
actually make it a little bit bigger so

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:19.470
actually make it a little bit bigger so
 

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:22.190
actually make it a little bit bigger so
this actually disables crunching of of

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.200
this actually disables crunching of of
 

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.279
this actually disables crunching of of
images so that your pre-processing is

00:22:25.279 --> 00:22:25.289
images so that your pre-processing is
 

00:22:25.289 --> 00:22:28.070
images so that your pre-processing is
left intact I'm happy to say I've talked

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080
left intact I'm happy to say I've talked
 

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.519
left intact I'm happy to say I've talked
to the people at an Android studio and

00:26:33.059 --> 00:26:35.230
easy to add to your build.gradle file
and then things will break

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:35.240
and then things will break
 

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.900
and then things will break
so yeah just add this line there's also

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:38.910
so yeah just add this line there's also
 

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:42.500
so yeah just add this line there's also
a new a new way of using the built-in

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:42.510
a new a new way of using the built-in
 

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:44.630
a new a new way of using the built-in
shrinker and our tools so you can if you

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640
shrinker and our tools so you can if you
 

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.820
shrinker and our tools so you can if you
do minify enable true that enables

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:46.830
do minify enable true that enables
 

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:48.860
do minify enable true that enables
ProGuard but you can then go and

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:48.870
ProGuard but you can then go and
 

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:51.200
ProGuard but you can then go and
actually say use ProGuard false and this

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:51.210
actually say use ProGuard false and this
 

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.240
actually say use ProGuard false and this
will use our built-in shrinker it's a

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:53.250
will use our built-in shrinker it's a
 

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:54.740
will use our built-in shrinker it's a
little bit faster but it doesn't do all

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:54.750
little bit faster but it doesn't do all
 

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.510
little bit faster but it doesn't do all
the things that ProGuard does so it just

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520
the things that ProGuard does so it just
 

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.399
the things that ProGuard does so it just
removes classes the classes it doesn't

00:26:58.399 --> 00:26:58.409
removes classes the classes it doesn't
 

00:26:58.409 --> 00:27:00.080
removes classes the classes it doesn't
obfuscate but it works better with

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:00.090
obfuscate but it works better with
 

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:01.940
obfuscate but it works better with
instant run for example but anyway

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:01.950
instant run for example but anyway
 

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:05.060
instant run for example but anyway
whichever option you decide to use you

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:05.070
whichever option you decide to use you
 

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.770
whichever option you decide to use you
don't have this notion of ProGuard

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:06.780
don't have this notion of ProGuard
 

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.500
don't have this notion of ProGuard
configuration files and by default we

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:09.510
configuration files and by default we
 

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.320
configuration files and by default we
have one and the SDK which has some

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:12.330
have one and the SDK which has some
 

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.840
have one and the SDK which has some
likes and the same defaults for any

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:14.850
likes and the same defaults for any
 

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:17.930
likes and the same defaults for any
Android app so for example the built-in

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:17.940
Android app so for example the built-in
 

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:22.450
Android app so for example the built-in
ProGuard file already has rules that

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:22.460
ProGuard file already has rules that
 

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.190
ProGuard file already has rules that
keep all the setters and getters on your

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200
keep all the setters and getters on your
 

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.110
keep all the setters and getters on your
view so that animations work and so on

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120
view so that animations work and so on
 

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.610
view so that animations work and so on
because otherwise they would be

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:28.620
because otherwise they would be
 

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.560
because otherwise they would be
optimized away and you know your app

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:30.570
optimized away and you know your app
 

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:32.750
optimized away and you know your app
will break but then if you're not

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760
will break but then if you're not
 

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.640
will break but then if you're not
familiar with ProGuard rules it's a

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:34.650
familiar with ProGuard rules it's a
 

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:36.500
familiar with ProGuard rules it's a
really complex topic I will not teach

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:36.510
really complex topic I will not teach
 

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:39.110
really complex topic I will not teach
you that here but you can go and look

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120
you that here but you can go and look
 

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.840
you that here but you can go and look
and in your build folders in the Android

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:41.850
and in your build folders in the Android
 

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:43.580
and in your build folders in the Android
studio there's actually an organic

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:43.590
studio there's actually an organic
 

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:46.010
studio there's actually an organic
generated file that's generated by a apt

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:46.020
generated file that's generated by a apt
 

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.990
generated file that's generated by a apt
and it looks that basically as your

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000
and it looks that basically as your
 

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.430
and it looks that basically as your
Android manifest it looks at your

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440
Android manifest it looks at your
 

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.649
Android manifest it looks at your
layouts and it generates rules for your

00:27:51.649 --> 00:27:51.659
layouts and it generates rules for your
 

00:27:51.659 --> 00:27:53.510
layouts and it generates rules for your
activities for you views that you use in

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:53.520
activities for you views that you use in
 

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.310
activities for you views that you use in
your layouts and again by looking at

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:55.320
your layouts and again by looking at
 

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.730
your layouts and again by looking at
those and by looking at the default

00:27:57.730 --> 00:27:57.740
those and by looking at the default
 

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.409
those and by looking at the default
program file you can learn a lot and

00:28:00.409 --> 00:28:00.419
program file you can learn a lot and
 

00:28:00.419 --> 00:28:05.659
program file you can learn a lot and
start writing your own and there's also

00:28:05.659 --> 00:28:05.669
start writing your own and there's also
 

00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:07.580
start writing your own and there's also
another way easy way if you know that

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:07.590
another way easy way if you know that
 

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:09.799
another way easy way if you know that
you're doing something in your code that

00:28:09.799 --> 00:28:09.809
you're doing something in your code that
 

00:28:09.809 --> 00:28:11.630
you're doing something in your code that
will be optimized the way because you

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640
will be optimized the way because you
 

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.700
will be optimized the way because you
access it by a reflection for example

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:13.710
access it by a reflection for example
 

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:15.169
access it by a reflection for example
there's the new way just add an

00:28:15.169 --> 00:28:15.179
there's the new way just add an
 

00:28:15.179 --> 00:28:17.450
there's the new way just add an
annotation keep use the new built tools

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:17.460
annotation keep use the new built tools
 

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.549
annotation keep use the new built tools
pro-gard we'll just leave it as is it

00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559
pro-gard we'll just leave it as is it
 

00:28:19.559 --> 00:28:23.930
pro-gard we'll just leave it as is it
will not be like removed from your code

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:23.940
 
 

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.970
 
if you're writing libraries for other

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:26.980
if you're writing libraries for other
 

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.830
if you're writing libraries for other
users or just libraries that are

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840
users or just libraries that are
 

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.110
users or just libraries that are
components in your app sometimes those

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120
components in your app sometimes those
 

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.870
components in your app sometimes those
those libraries just need their own

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:33.880
those libraries just need their own
 

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.789
those libraries just need their own
ProGuard rules so that when someone uses

00:28:35.789 --> 00:28:35.799
ProGuard rules so that when someone uses
 

00:28:35.799 --> 00:28:38.130
ProGuard rules so that when someone uses
them they don't break their app and just

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:38.140
them they don't break their app and just
 

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.750
them they don't break their app and just
remember be a good citizen if you're

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760
remember be a good citizen if you're
 

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.340
remember be a good citizen if you're
writing a library if it needs ProGuard

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:41.350
writing a library if it needs ProGuard
 

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:43.620
writing a library if it needs ProGuard
you can put your own ProGuard

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:43.630
you can put your own ProGuard
 

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:45.360
you can put your own ProGuard
configuration inside your library and

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:45.370
configuration inside your library and
 

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:48.510
configuration inside your library and
then anyone who imports it will it will

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:48.520
then anyone who imports it will it will
 

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:56.280
then anyone who imports it will it will
just work but you know not always you

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:56.290
just work but you know not always you
 

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:58.409
just work but you know not always you
can always remove code because you don't

00:28:58.409 --> 00:28:58.419
can always remove code because you don't
 

00:28:58.419 --> 00:29:00.900
can always remove code because you don't
need it so sometimes you actually need

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:00.910
need it so sometimes you actually need
 

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:02.909
need it so sometimes you actually need
the things you're attached you're adding

00:29:02.909 --> 00:29:02.919
the things you're attached you're adding
 

00:29:02.919 --> 00:29:05.159
the things you're attached you're adding
to your project but it's not easy to

00:29:05.159 --> 00:29:05.169
to your project but it's not easy to
 

00:29:05.169 --> 00:29:06.930
to your project but it's not easy to
keep track of all the libraries that

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:06.940
keep track of all the libraries that
 

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.700
keep track of all the libraries that
bring in other libraries and other

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:08.710
bring in other libraries and other
 

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:10.650
bring in other libraries and other
libraries and so on so we call these you

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:10.660
libraries and so on so we call these you
 

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:12.480
libraries and so on so we call these you
know transitive transitive dependencies

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:12.490
know transitive transitive dependencies
 

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:16.350
know transitive transitive dependencies
and if you add just one one dependency

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:16.360
and if you add just one one dependency
 

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.720
and if you add just one one dependency
to your build.gradle file it might bring

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:18.730
to your build.gradle file it might bring
 

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:20.850
to your build.gradle file it might bring
in lots and lots of those transitive

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:20.860
in lots and lots of those transitive
 

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:22.919
in lots and lots of those transitive
dependencies so if you weren't aware

00:29:22.919 --> 00:29:22.929
dependencies so if you weren't aware
 

00:29:22.929 --> 00:29:27.299
dependencies so if you weren't aware
there's a whole command line command for

00:29:27.299 --> 00:29:27.309
there's a whole command line command for
 

00:29:27.309 --> 00:29:29.220
there's a whole command line command for
Gradle well let you see a tree of all

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:29.230
Gradle well let you see a tree of all
 

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:30.480
Gradle well let you see a tree of all
those dependencies that you bring in

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:30.490
those dependencies that you bring in
 

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:32.549
those dependencies that you bring in
with your libraries and here the only

00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559
with your libraries and here the only
 

00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:34.740
with your libraries and here the only
advice is just be aware of what you're

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:34.750
advice is just be aware of what you're
 

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:37.049
advice is just be aware of what you're
using and what kind of libraries you're

00:29:37.049 --> 00:29:37.059
using and what kind of libraries you're
 

00:29:37.059 --> 00:29:38.970
using and what kind of libraries you're
pulling in and make the right decisions

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:38.980
pulling in and make the right decisions
 

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:43.530
pulling in and make the right decisions
by looking at this and if you're still

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:43.540
by looking at this and if you're still
 

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:46.500
by looking at this and if you're still
not sure if what's inside your apk what

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:46.510
not sure if what's inside your apk what
 

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:49.140
not sure if what's inside your apk what
kind of classes you know finally make it

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:49.150
kind of classes you know finally make it
 

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:50.490
kind of classes you know finally make it
through the ProGuard through the

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:50.500
through the ProGuard through the
 

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.919
through the ProGuard through the
optimizations through pulling in other

00:29:52.919 --> 00:29:52.929
optimizations through pulling in other
 

00:29:52.929 --> 00:29:55.020
optimizations through pulling in other
libraries there's a tool that we open

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:55.030
libraries there's a tool that we open
 

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:57.630
libraries there's a tool that we open
sourced recently called classy shark and

00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:57.640
sourced recently called classy shark and
 

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.539
sourced recently called classy shark and
it's it's basically an apk Explorer so

00:30:00.539 --> 00:30:00.549
it's it's basically an apk Explorer so
 

00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:03.030
it's it's basically an apk Explorer so
it'll let you go into your Dex files it

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:03.040
it'll let you go into your Dex files it
 

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.409
it'll let you go into your Dex files it
will show you all the packages and

00:30:04.409 --> 00:30:04.419
will show you all the packages and
 

00:30:04.419 --> 00:30:06.810
will show you all the packages and
they're great for debugging ProGuard and

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:06.820
they're great for debugging ProGuard and
 

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.090
they're great for debugging ProGuard and
you will do that a lot if you enable it

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:09.100
you will do that a lot if you enable it
 

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.580
you will do that a lot if you enable it
for your app let me tell you and I

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:11.590
for your app let me tell you and I
 

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:15.090
for your app let me tell you and I
really encourage you to try it so we

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:15.100
really encourage you to try it so we
 

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:19.799
really encourage you to try it so we
have ProGuard for byte code but if you

00:30:19.799 --> 00:30:19.809
have ProGuard for byte code but if you
 

00:30:19.809 --> 00:30:21.780
have ProGuard for byte code but if you
if you go through this you know this

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:21.790
if you go through this you know this
 

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:23.730
if you go through this you know this
pain of enabling ProGuard you actually

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:23.740
pain of enabling ProGuard you actually
 

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.830
pain of enabling ProGuard you actually
get one more very important thing and

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840
get one more very important thing and
 

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.950
get one more very important thing and
that's the resource shrinker and once

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:28.960
that's the resource shrinker and once
 

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.450
that's the resource shrinker and once
you have program enabled you can get

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:30.460
you have program enabled you can get
 

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.549
you have program enabled you can get
another option called shrink resources

00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559
another option called shrink resources
 

00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:34.710
another option called shrink resources
true and that will go and figure out

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720
true and that will go and figure out
 

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.080
true and that will go and figure out
which resources in

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:37.090
which resources in
 

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:39.989
which resources in
in your app are actually referenced from

00:30:39.989 --> 00:30:39.999
in your app are actually referenced from
 

00:30:39.999 --> 00:30:42.779
in your app are actually referenced from
the code from the code that is left

00:30:42.779 --> 00:30:42.789
the code from the code that is left
 

00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:44.669
the code from the code that is left
after ProGuard doesn't runs its course

00:30:44.669 --> 00:30:44.679
after ProGuard doesn't runs its course
 

00:30:44.679 --> 00:30:47.940
after ProGuard doesn't runs its course
and it can remove any resource that is

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:47.950
and it can remove any resource that is
 

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.580
and it can remove any resource that is
unused in your code which is pretty

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:50.590
unused in your code which is pretty
 

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:56.190
unused in your code which is pretty
awesome and again it has a configuration

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:56.200
awesome and again it has a configuration
 

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.399
awesome and again it has a configuration
so you can add this really on any

00:30:59.399 --> 00:30:59.409
so you can add this really on any
 

00:30:59.409 --> 00:31:01.919
so you can add this really on any
resource file on any XML resource and

00:31:01.919 --> 00:31:01.929
resource file on any XML resource and
 

00:31:01.929 --> 00:31:05.789

many people are aware of and that's the

many people are aware of and that's the
 

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.580
many people are aware of and that's the
problem of sparse resource conflicts and

problem of sparse resource conflicts and
 

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:55.320
problem of sparse resource conflicts and
so if you if you notice that your

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:55.330
so if you if you notice that your
 

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:58.499
so if you if you notice that your
resources dot a RC file is bloated it's

00:32:58.499 --> 00:32:58.509
resources dot a RC file is bloated it's
 

00:32:58.509 --> 00:33:00.450
resources dot a RC file is bloated it's
it's very big but you don't know why

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:00.460
it's very big but you don't know why
 

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:04.350
it's very big but you don't know why
it's worth trying to figure out if maybe

it's worth trying to figure out if maybe
 

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.210
it's worth trying to figure out if maybe
that is your problem and let me try to

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:06.220
that is your problem and let me try to
 

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:08.820
that is your problem and let me try to
explain that it's not a very simple so

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:08.830

I'm not gonna teach you how the

resources file format works let me tell
you this is a big oversimplification but

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:15.700
you this is a big oversimplification but
 

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.060
you this is a big oversimplification but
hopefully it'll get the point across so

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:18.070
hopefully it'll get the point across so
 

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:20.190
hopefully it'll get the point across so
imagine you have a you have an app that

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:20.200
imagine you have a you have an app that
 

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.440
imagine you have a you have an app that
has five strings the strings are

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:22.450
has five strings the strings are
 

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:23.999
has five strings the strings are
somewhere in the string pool they take

00:33:23.999 --> 00:33:24.009
somewhere in the string pool they take
 

00:33:24.009 --> 00:33:25.740
somewhere in the string pool they take
up some memory and then we have your

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:25.750
up some memory and then we have your
 

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:28.169
up some memory and then we have your
default config you have your string my

00:33:28.169 --> 00:33:28.179
default config you have your string my
 

00:33:28.179 --> 00:33:30.419
default config you have your string my
app hello exit and so on just labels for

00:33:30.419 --> 00:33:30.429
app hello exit and so on just labels for
 

00:33:30.429 --> 00:33:33.330
app hello exit and so on just labels for
things in your app but then you decide

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:33.340
things in your app but then you decide
 

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:36.539
things in your app but then you decide
well I'm adding a new feature to my app

00:33:36.539 --> 00:33:36.549
well I'm adding a new feature to my app
 

00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:38.730
well I'm adding a new feature to my app
it's gonna be named new feature instead

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:38.740
it's gonna be named new feature instead
 

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.730
it's gonna be named new feature instead
of feature so you get a new string right

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:40.740
of feature so you get a new string right
 

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.649
of feature so you get a new string right
but this new feature only works for a

00:33:43.649 --> 00:33:43.659
but this new feature only works for a
 

00:33:43.659 --> 00:33:45.749
but this new feature only works for a
version 21 and above so you have a

00:33:45.749 --> 00:33:45.759
version 21 and above so you have a
 

00:33:45.759 --> 00:33:48.539
version 21 and above so you have a
config you create a new you know you a

00:33:48.539 --> 00:33:48.549
config you create a new you know you a
 

00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:51.570
config you create a new you know you a
new folder under your resources with V

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:51.580
new folder under your resources with V
 

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.019
new folder under your resources with V
21 and you're just switching this

00:33:55.019 --> 00:33:55.029
21 and you're just switching this
 

00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:57.539
21 and you're just switching this
feature to new feature in that config

00:33:57.539 --> 00:33:57.549
feature to new feature in that config
 

00:33:57.549 --> 00:34:00.299
feature to new feature in that config
well it should take up only space for

00:34:00.299 --> 00:34:00.309
well it should take up only space for
 

00:34:00.309 --> 00:34:02.940
well it should take up only space for
one string right but it actually has to

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:02.950
one string right but it actually has to
 

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:06.029
one string right but it actually has to
keep no entries on all the positions for

00:34:06.029 --> 00:34:06.039
keep no entries on all the positions for
 

00:34:06.039 --> 00:34:07.680
keep no entries on all the positions for
other strings that you're not using in

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:07.690
other strings that you're not using in
 

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:09.750
other strings that you're not using in
this config so you lose a lot of space

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760
this config so you lose a lot of space
 

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.000
this config so you lose a lot of space
it still takes up a lot of space even

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:12.010
it still takes up a lot of space even
 

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:14.069
it still takes up a lot of space even
though you're just using this to

00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079
though you're just using this to
 

00:34:14.079 --> 00:34:16.079
though you're just using this to
override this one string and I know

00:34:16.079 --> 00:34:16.089
override this one string and I know
 

00:34:16.089 --> 00:34:18.300
override this one string and I know
these kind of bytes

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:18.310
these kind of bytes
 

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:20.069
these kind of bytes
who cares about bytes but if you think

00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079
who cares about bytes but if you think
 

00:34:20.079 --> 00:34:22.530
who cares about bytes but if you think
about that if you have an app that has

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:22.540
about that if you have an app that has
 

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.649
about that if you have an app that has
3,000 strings if you have 50

00:34:25.649 --> 00:34:25.659
3,000 strings if you have 50

3,000 strings if you have 50
translations and there's a lot of apps

00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:28.119
translations and there's a lot of apps
 

00:34:28.119 --> 00:34:29.940

on the Play Store I'm sure lots of them
 

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:35.579
on the Play Store I'm sure lots of them
have even more than that the cost of

languages will give you a 600 kilobytes
overhead and that's something we can

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:47.260
overhead and that's something we can
 

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:50.159
overhead and that's something we can
work with especially if we can have lots

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:50.169
work with especially if we can have lots
 

00:34:50.169 --> 00:34:52.950
work with especially if we can have lots
of other dimensions than just V 21 you

00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960
of other dimensions than just V 21 you
 

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.500
of other dimensions than just V 21 you
can actually shrink your file a lot but

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:55.510
can actually shrink your file a lot but
 

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:57.440
can actually shrink your file a lot but
how do you know that you're doing that

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:57.450
how do you know that you're doing that
 

00:34:57.450 --> 00:34:59.300
how do you know that you're doing that
it's not very easy to guess like which

00:34:59.300 --> 00:34:59.310
it's not very easy to guess like which
 

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:02.599
it's not very easy to guess like which
string do I remove and we just recently

00:35:02.599 --> 00:35:02.609

for this talk and basically it's a

00:35:15.079 --> 00:35:15.089
for this talk and basically it's a
 

00:35:15.089 --> 00:35:17.120
for this talk and basically it's a
command-line tool you run your apk

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:17.130
command-line tool you run your apk
 

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:19.700
command-line tool you run your apk
through it and you get a CSV file you

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:19.710
through it and you get a CSV file you
 

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:21.770
through it and you get a CSV file you
upload the CSV to sheets or use some

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:21.780
upload the CSV to sheets or use some
 

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:27.020
upload the CSV to sheets or use some
other program for that and gives you

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:27.030
other program for that and gives you
 

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:29.270
other program for that and gives you
this kind of nice overview of where the

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280
this kind of nice overview of where the
 

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.550
this kind of nice overview of where the
resources are in your application and if

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560
resources are in your application and if
 

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.920
resources are in your application and if
you sort that by no entry by the no

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:33.930
you sort that by no entry by the no
 

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:39.470
you sort that by no entry by the no
entries column then you can find which

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480
entries column then you can find which
 

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.690
entries column then you can find which
configs are the most sparse in your app

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:41.700
configs are the most sparse in your app
 

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:44.150
configs are the most sparse in your app
so which configs wastes the most space

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160
so which configs wastes the most space
 

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:47.270
so which configs wastes the most space
so in this example if you look at the

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280
so in this example if you look at the
 

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.060
so in this example if you look at the
rightmost column I can identify that the

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:50.070
rightmost column I can identify that the
 

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:53.690
rightmost column I can identify that the
string that's called apps list you know

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:53.700
string that's called apps list you know
 

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.420
string that's called apps list you know
it's wasting almost 200 kilobytes in my

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:56.430
it's wasting almost 200 kilobytes in my
 

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:59.000
it's wasting almost 200 kilobytes in my
app Oh 200 kilobytes is not a lot right

00:35:59.000 --> 00:35:59.010
app Oh 200 kilobytes is not a lot right
 

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:01.910
app Oh 200 kilobytes is not a lot right
but the next one if I remove descriptive

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920

this file and you can do this over and

00:36:07.609 --> 00:36:07.619
this file and you can do this over and
 

00:36:07.619 --> 00:36:11.420
this file and you can do this over and
over and you know remove a lot of really

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:11.430
over and you know remove a lot of really
 

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:13.730
over and you know remove a lot of really
unneeded data from from your resources

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:13.740
unneeded data from from your resources
 

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.550

and some of our apps I want to say

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.950
and some of our apps I want to say
remove two and a half Meg's by removing

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960
remove two and a half Meg's by removing
 

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.190
remove two and a half Meg's by removing
just three strings so that's pretty big

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200
just three strings so that's pretty big
 

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:26.750
just three strings so that's pretty big
savings so that's that let me just say

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760
savings so that's that let me just say
 

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.990
savings so that's that let me just say
that it really works for only big apps

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000
that it really works for only big apps
 

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.300
that it really works for only big apps
if your app is not really huge with lots

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:32.310
if your app is not really huge with lots
 

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:33.710
if your app is not really huge with lots
of configurations and so on then

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720

probably what you won't get anything
from that and finally getting to the

it was just not supported you have to go
and manually decompress those files and

00:37:43.309 --> 00:37:43.319
and manually decompress those files and
 

00:37:43.319 --> 00:37:45.200
and manually decompress those files and
store them and so on I'm happy to say
