00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.850
What Causes Dark Circles Under Your Eyes

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.869
It is often claimed that periorbital dark
circles are caused by tiredness or working

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.490
too hard or even just staying up late.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.670
While this can be true, the truth is that
your genes play a huge role here.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.510
So what exactly is happening when you get
dark circles under or around your eyes?

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.400
Simply put, periorbital dark circles are a
result of the thin layer of skin below your

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.039
eyes showing the blood vessels and the blood
they contain more clearly than anywhere else

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:38.039
on your body.

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:42.920
(For reference, this skin around your eyelids,
called periorbital skin, is on average about

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.050
0.5 mm thick compared to an average of about
2 mm thick on most of the rest of your body.)

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.819
Now, as you may or may not already know, the
reason veins often look blue isnâ€™t because

00:00:53.819 --> 00:01:00.649
the blood inside them is blue; itâ€™s because
your skin/subcutaneous tissue only lets blue/violet

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.699
wavelengths of light pass through it.

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.180
As a result, only blue light is reflected
back and the veins look, well, bluish.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.159
(Veins often wonâ€™t appear blue if a person
has darker or lighter skin.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.009
Rather, the veins tend to appear green or
brown.

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.500
On the other hand, people with extremely light
skin, such as albinos, will typically have

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.480
veins that show up as dark purple or dark
red, more closely resembling the actual color

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.460
of the blood running through the veins.)

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.909
Itâ€™s the exact same concept with the skin
below your eyes.

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.869
Those dark bluish circles are (usually) just
the result of light being reflected back off

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.219
of the blood vessels sitting just below the
surface of that incredibly thin patch of skin.

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.880
This is the same reason facial bruises are
more prominent below or around the eyes; the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.259
thin skin just shows the blood from the ruptured
blood vessels a little bit more clearly.

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.090
Again, as you may or may not know, as we age,
our skin loses its elasticity and ability

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.700
to regenerate and as a result, it becomes
thinner.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.719
This is why more often than not, elderly people
will have rather prominent periorbital dark

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.840
circles regardless of how much they sleep.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.509
As with those who are genetically predisposed
to having thinner skin below the eyes, itâ€™s

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.760
just biology.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.450
Another thing that can cause dark circles
beneath the eyes is something known as periorbital

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.840
hyperpigmentation, which is basically a condition
that results in more melanin being produced

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.640
by the skin below the eyes, resulting in it
appearing to be a darker color.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.940
This is mostly a condition that affects (or
is at least more noticeable in) darker skinned

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:31.940
people.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.280
According to Pratik B Sheth et al. of the
PDU Government Medical College and Hospital

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.200
in India, this is one of the most common complaints
dermatologists have to deal with.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.600
Unfortunately, as explained in this case study
about an Indian gentleman with a particularly

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.840
severe case of periorbital melanosis, itâ€™s
very difficult to treat in darker skinned

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.790
patients, which has led to a booming niche
market of cover up make-up for people with

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.790
darker complexions.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.540
All that said, there are a number of factors
that can make dark circles appear worse, even

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.490
if youâ€™re not genetically predisposed to
them.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.750
One of the more serious sounding is the oxidisation
of blood leaking from the periorbital blood

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.960
vessels, which is just a fancier way of saying
that sometimes the blood vessels around your

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.490
eyes can get damaged, blood leaks out, and
youâ€™re left with puffy dark circles under

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.490
your eyes.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.730
Itâ€™s a relatively harmless problem and even
the chronic sufferers of this sort of blood

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.360
leaking need not worry too much about it.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.800
It is also technically reversible with the
right treatment, though changes in lifestyle

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.190
are often recommended before one should consider
opting for surgery.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.370
Another problem that goes hand-in-hand with
periorbital dark circles is periorbital puffiness,

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.720
a.k.a. bags below your eyes.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.970
In young folk, this is almost always caused
by fluid buildup below the eyes, either due

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.730
to illness, allergies or simply excessive
salt consumption which can result in the body

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.990
retaining more fluid than usual.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.210
This can place increased pressure on the skin
and blood vessels around the eyes which can

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.900
force blood vessels closer to the surface
of the skin, making dark circles appear more

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.900
prominent.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.080
Eye puffiness can also simply be a result
of old age.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.210
Now all of that is (hopefully) interesting
to you, but we still havenâ€™t specifically

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:17.540
answered the question: Can those dark circles
be caused by fatigue and, if so, why?

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.500
Well the answer to the former is: sometimes.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.290
So why exactly is this the case?

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.630
Itâ€™s not like lack of sleep makes your skin
thinner, right?

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.340
The answer is thought to lie in how the body
acts when itâ€™s low on energy.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.290
When the body is tired, production of the
chemical cortisol is dramatically increased

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.090
to help give you the energy you need to stay
awake.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.910
Among many other things, cortisol actually
increases the volume of the blood in your

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.440
body, which causes the blood vessels (including
the ones below your eyes) to engorge to accommodate

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.440
it.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.100
As weâ€™ve already mentioned, dark circles
are mostly caused by us seeing our blood vessels

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.450
/ blood through our skin, so it stands to
reason that when those blood vessels are engorged,

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.000
theyâ€™d be easier to see, even in people
who may have been blessed with thicker skin

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.250
below their eyes.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:10.340
So, whether by passing on their genes to you
or for not letting you sleep in after a gaming

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.720
all-nighter when youâ€™re young, itâ€™s all
your parentâ€™s fault.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.130
ðŸ˜‰ Something that is/was even more reckless
of them as cortisol promotes fat accumulation.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:35.020
So your lack of sleep is likely contributing
to more than just under-eye cosmetic issues.
