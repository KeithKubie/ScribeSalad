&gt;&gt;David Wurtz: Let's get started, shall we?
Hi, everybody. My name is David Wurtz. I'm

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.970
product manager for Google Web Fonts, and
I'm very excited to talk about Web Fonts,

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.009
which was a technology that has the potential
to change the Web. Soon I will be joined by

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:25.210
my teammate Raph Levien as well as Darren
Glenister, who is standing right next to me.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.320
Darren is from a Swedish company, TypeDNA.
So a few logistics before we get started.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.410
We have a moderator page and a feedback page
set up. Please vote and submit questions so

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:41.190
we can make best use of the 15-minute question-and-answer
at the end. We have some official hash tags:

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.170
Google fonts, Chrome and IO. For your convenience,
the moderator and feedback link will actually

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.671
be at the bottom of every one of our slides
in the presentation.

00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:54.600
Before I get started, I would actually like
to take a poll. With a show of hands, I would

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.960
like to know if you have used Web Fonts before.
Wow, great. It looks like about 50% of you

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.360
have used Web Fonts, which is awesome to see.
For those of you who have used Web Fonts,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.331
hopefully this presentation gives you a little
bit more detail into what Google is doing

00:01:10.331 --> 00:01:14.600
in this space. For those of you who haven't
used Web Fonts, it will be a pleasure to introduce

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.020
you to the topic.
Here is a quick overview of what we will be

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.619
talking about in the next 45 minutes. We will
start with a Web Fonts crash course. We are

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.880
going to describe what Web Fonts are, why
you should potentially be excited about Web

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.860
Fonts, and why Google is excited about Web
Fonts.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.310
We will then go into Google Web Fonts' overview,
which is Google's offering in this space.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.671
It is available at google.com/webfonts. It
was launched last year one year ago at Google

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:48.310
I/O.
Next we are going to talk about some interesting

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.390
trends we have been seeing with Web font adoption.
Finally, we are going to talk about what the

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.330
Web Fonts teams at Google has been up to,
specifically three areas: Our efforts to increase

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:06.380
the fonts we offer as well as to change how
users surf and choose and select their Web

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.399
Fonts. Second, we are going to talk about
our efforts to make Web Fonts faster and more

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.140
efficient.
And, third, our efforts to incorporate Google

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.910
Web Fonts into all the tools that you use
every day in your everyday workflows.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:26.720
Let's jump into the crash course. Until recently,
the state of web typography has resembled

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:34.440
a barren desert. When you are writing your
CSS and you decided you would like to style

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.600
a bit of text on your page. You have been
constrained to use the font families that

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.160
are installed on Microsoft Windows, which
is the prevalent operating system. This means

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.980
we've seen a lot of Arial, Courier, Georgia,
Times, Verdana. We know these font families

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.530
very well because they are really the only
ones you can use as true, selectable Web-safe

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.400
fonts.
Now, if you compare the visual diversity of

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.510
the average Web site to the visual diversity
of the average magazine, for example, the

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.070
difference is quite staggering. What you will
find in the print world is that fonts are

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.710
used to convey much more subtle ideas and
the variation of fonts in the print world

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.540
is staggering relative to the Web.
So we think this limitation is unfortunate

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.050
to say the least and it is rather artificial.
But we've seen nice fonts on the Web before.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.890
So there's obviously a way to do it. But we
do consider these things the ugly work-arounds.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.990
You embed text in images which, basically,
means that the content is not semantic anymore.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.260
You are going to have to rely on alt tags,
which not everyone uses. And it doesn't seem

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.220
-- it is an abstraction of the content that
you would like to embed in your page. It is

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.830
not actually the content.
And if you embed text in images, your text

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.070
isn't selectable so it is not copy and pasteable.
And it is not zoomable. So perhaps your users

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:57.460
prefer to see the text slightly larger sizes.
And if you increase the page size in your

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.690
browser and you have text in image, it quickly
degrades in quality. If it is actually a real

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.210
font, it looks really nice and the curbs are
maintained.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.430
And there is another way to do it. You can
use what's called a Flash replacement technique

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:17.190
which, basically, renders an Adobe Flash object
on top of the object for your text and that

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.729
Adobe Flash object contains your font file
but it requires a plug-in. And there is a

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:29.039
slight flash of unstyled text before the Adobe
Flash loads on top of the unstyled text. And

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:35.710
the selection field is a bit odd. You can
tell it is not HTML. So it is obvious the

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.360
Web needed a better way to use and select
fonts.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.349
So the solution is Web Fonts. Web Fonts free
of you of the constraint. You no longer need

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:49.870
to refer to fonts that are installed on a
user's local machine when you are writing

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.370
your CSS stack. Instead, you can refer to
any font because, theoretically, any font

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.240
can be served via HTTP request.
So there's other benefits to Web Fonts. Web

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.560
Fonts are semantic. What you type, what you
mark up into your pages is what you mean to

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.849
mark up. It is not an abstraction of the content.
And because it is more semantic, there's a

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:17.060
load of other benefits. It is more translatable
into other languages. It is more accessible

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.240
to screen readers. It is zoomable. And as
Raph is going to talk about just a little

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.189
bit later, Web Fonts can be super efficient
as well.

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:32.240
Google loves Web Fonts. Web Fonts not only
make the Web more expressive, more semantic,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.360
more accessible, more translatable, but they
also make it more searchable. And we think

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.350
Web Fonts is a win for everybody involved.
It is a win for you, the webmasters and content

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:47.319
creators of the Internet, because you have
access to a much wider font selection to express

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:50.560
yourselves and you can make your pages more
semantic and accessible.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.890
It's a win for your users because they can
increase font size. They can copy and paste.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.710
They can translate it into other languages.
And it is a win for Google users because Google

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.280
Search is going to become better. Google wants
Web Fonts to be ubiquitous, and that's part

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:11.240
of the reason why we launched Google Web Fonts
last year at Google I/O.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.620
Web Fonts is not cutting edge HTML5 stuff.
It is actually supported in 98% of browsers

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:23.159
right now. Now, support for Web Fonts actually
goes back to the days of IE4. It has been

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:27.650
on and off in the early browsers. Back then
it wasn't a reliable choice for webmasters

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.800
because not all browsers supported it. When
a browser didn't support Web Fonts, it would

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.499
have a very bad failure case where the font
would just not -- your text would just not

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:39.319
display.
But recently in the last two years, browsers

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:45.229
started supporting Web Fonts, which means
right now they are a great choice for production

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:51.801
applications in Web sites.
When I say "the browsers support Web Fonts,"

00:06:51.801 --> 00:06:57.520
what I'm referring to specifically is the
@font-face CSS rule. This is the underlying

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.249
technology behind Google Web Fonts.
What we are showing on screen here is what's

00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:07.680
called the bullet-proof syntax which is, basically,
the CSS you would use if you wanted to host

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.669
a font yourself and serve it as a Web font.
And so let's go through it one by one. First

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:17.199
we are defining the font family. In this case,
Droid Sans. And there is the font style and

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:21.850
the font weight. Then we get to the point
where we source it. It can either be a URL,

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:27.169
which is a remote source or a local source.
There are various formats.

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:31.409
Now, it might look like there's some typos
in this snippet, but it ends up this is -- everything

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:39.099
in here is intentional. Certain browsers ignore
certain bits of the snippet. And if you do

00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:43.749
it exactly like this, you can have reasonable
confidence that your font will work across

00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:49.680
browsers and platforms. But there are some
downsides of using font-face directly. As

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.400
we saw, there is a lot of font file formats
that are used. And this is because different

00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:00.560
browsers require different font formats.
And if you'd like to host a font yourself,

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.809
you're going to have to, basically, take that
font file and convert it into SVG and WOFF

00:08:04.809 --> 00:08:08.569
and EOT.
The second is that you will need to find a

00:08:08.569 --> 00:08:13.260
host for these font files and one you can
trust because if it breaks, your Web page

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.550
is going to look completely different. Now,
for many of you who have a Web host already

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.779
set up, this is probably not a huge requirement.
But think about the bloggers, the mom-and-pop

00:08:21.779 --> 00:08:26.350
bloggers out there which don't necessarily
have ready access to a Web host. This could

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:31.729
actually be a huge deterrent from using Web
Fonts.

00:08:31.729 --> 00:08:38.760
Third, there's CSS maintenance involved. As
the browsers evolve, they support different

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:44.830
font snippets. Just recent -- or font-face
CSS snippets. So just recently, for example,

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:51.810
IE9 actually changed the requirement for what
it would look for in the CSS snippet. And

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:57.120
it meant that for all the webmasters out there
that have used the bullet-proof syntax, they

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.470
actually had to go back and change how they
used it so that it could work in IE9. And

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:06.630
there is no telling how many times this will
happen again. So there is a bunch of CSS maintenance

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:11.810
involved when you host font files yourself.
Fourth, there is lots of browser quirks. We

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:18.380
all know what browser quirks are. It turns
out that certain Android browsers break when

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:24.280
you source a Web font via the local selector
that we saw in the previous slide.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.510
And, also, Chrome Frame is another example.
In certain instances, Web Fonts will simply

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:34.090
not work if you are using the @font-face CSS
rule in Chrome Frame.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:38.370
And, finally, there's licensing complexities
involved. Just because you own a font and

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:43.830
can use it on your local machine doesn't necessarily
mean you can use it on the Web. And oftentimes,

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:49.020
and probably more often than not, the license
to use a font as a Web font is completely

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:54.320
different.
So that's why Google launched Google Web Fonts.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.680
We're, basically, looking to reduce all these
pain points and make Web Fonts ubiquitous.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:05.200
If you go to Google.com/webfonts you will
be greeted with basically a simple list of

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.650
the fonts that we offer.
Today it is 175 open source, free-to-use Web

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:14.890
fonts. And as you browse, you can quickly
discover which ones you would like to use

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:19.110
on your Web sites and then grab a snippet
of code and embed that in your HTML document.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:24.530
And I am going to show you in detail how that
works later.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:28.740
We've designed a couple other advantages into
Google Web Fonts. So the first thing is that

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:34.990
Google handles the browser quirks. When your
end user goes to your Web site or blog, we're

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:39.000
going to sniff which browser and platform
they're on and we're going to serve exactly

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.071
the CSS snippet that's required as well as
the font file that's required. And so you,

00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:48.180
basically, don't need to worry about it. You
can have the confidence that the fonts you

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:53.510
select from Google Web Fonts will work on
all browsers going forward.

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:58.000
Because we do this -- because we do this dynamically,
there is actually a lot of optimizations we

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.710
can have, too. And Raph is going to talk a
little bit about this a little bit later on.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:06.990
Second, there is no licensing worries because
all the fonts are open source. You never have

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:11.590
to worry about being constrained for how to
use Google Web Fonts. We think this is really

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:14.420
important.
Third, there's lots of speed and reliability.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:21.880
You're using Google CDN, which is very reliable.
Finally, there's lots of font updates, optimizations

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:28.030
and quality improvements. And the message
here is that as we continue to improve these

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:32.720
fonts and we change it in a central location,
all the integrations just get it for free

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.920
with no further work required.
And we're also working on some innovative

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.740
font-serving features that we are excited
to share with you today.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:47.620
So meet some of the family. This is some of
the 175 fonts that we currently offer in Google

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:53.170
Web Fonts. Now, these don't look like Times
and Arial. Some of them look wild and crazy,

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.360
and that's what we want. We want the Web to
be more expressive and fun and also selectable.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:03.750
So I encourage you guys to visible google.com/webfonts
and choose some of your favorites, but here's

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:09.600
some of mine. I like Pacifico. This is a designed
by a gentleman named Vernon Adams, who is

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:16.040
a furniture restorer and designer but he is
also a very good font designer.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.770
Philosopher.
Permanent Marker, which is actually designed

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:28.820
by a popular font foundry, font diner, which
specializes in high-quality retro fonts.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:33.700
And Arvo.
You get all of that font selection for, basically,

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:39.290
30 seconds of integration. The first thing
you do is you include this special snippet

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:43.760
in the header of your HTML document.
And in this case, we're requesting the Arvo

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.670
font family. The second thing you do -- this
is the easy part -- you just use the font

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:54.220
you would any other font. So in this case,
we're using Arvo to style an H1 element. And

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.640
we are using it right next to Arial and Serif.
It is just that easy. There is no keys involved.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:06.120
There is no sign-up required. It is just copy
and paste integration.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.870
So far we have talked about what Web Fonts
are. We have talked about what Google Web

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:14.720
Fonts is and why Google has entered this space.
But where are we in the adoption curve?

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:20.160
We are really excited about what we're seeing
here. This is our graph since last year at

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:25.200
Google I/O. And the graph looks very promising
to us. We are seeing up and to the left. It

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.780
looks like the growth is accelerating. We
think this is very indicative of the latent

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:34.700
demand from developers, designers like you,
basically who have been constrained to using

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:38.690
a small set of fonts on your Web pages or
blogs but now all of a sudden the restriction

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:44.040
is limited. There really is a huge surge of
demand from the Internet and we're really

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:50.730
excited about this.
So today we're happy to announce that last

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:57.640
week we hit a peak of 110 font requests per
day. And that's across 1.29 million unique

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:03.100
domain names, and we're sustaining about 30%
month-over-month growth.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:08.210
So 1.29 million unique domains is actually
a fairly small slice of the actively developed

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:12.990
Internet. But what's really exciting to us
is the 30% month-over-month growth because

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:17.310
it if it keeps up it seems like Web fonts
are quickly becoming part of mainstream design

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:22.970
and development practices for the Web.
So who is using Web Fonts? The first thing

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:28.090
is the signs outside are actually using Open
Sans which we are happy to announce is for

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:33.200
the first time available via Google Web Fonts
today. Open Sans is a great font family. It

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:38.360
has got about 12 variants. I encourage you
to check it out.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:44.970
The official royal wedding Website uses Google
Web Fonts. The specific way they use Web Fonts

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:50.450
is worthy of paying attention to.
They designed a virtual guest book. They are,

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:56.140
basically, using a handwriting font called
indy flower. They have allowed users on the

00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.090
Web site to basically sign this virtual guest
book in a way they would have signed a physical

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:04.830
guest book. This is something that's really
exciting to us because it is a new interaction

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:08.800
that would have been very difficult to build
prior to Web Fonts existing.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:19.310
Mahalo, a popular how-to Web site uses the
font Arvo. Sourceforge uses the popular font

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:23.610
Ubuntu.
And to bring in some holiday cheer, the Norad

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:29.400
Santa tracker uses Mountains of Christmas,
which is obviously a font that's popular around

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.490
Christmastime.
But the list goes on and on. It is not just

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:39.500
large properties that use Google Web Fonts.
It's lawyers' Web sites, small businesses,

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:46.220
schools, builds, startups like JustinTV, Review
Magazine, ZipRealty, lots of Google properties

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:50.530
like Blogger, Google TV and YouTube use Web
Fonts as well. The list goes on and on. The

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:58.050
long tail is very, very long, and it is as
long as 1.29 million unique domains.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:01.850
What's next for us? What have we been working
on at Google Web Fonts? Here is where our

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:05.740
three sections are. First we are going to
talk about our plans to add more fonts to

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:09.240
our library. Currently, we have 175 but we
don't want to stop there.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.930
And in this section, I'm going to give you
a sneak peek of something we have been working

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:20.060
very hard on which is the new version of google.com/webfonts.
As we add more fonts to the library, it becomes

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:24.910
increasingly important that we do a much better
job of allowing to compare and contrast the

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:31.160
differences between Web Fonts and truly understand
the fonts that you would like to use in your

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.920
applications.
Second, we're going to talk about faster fonts.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.850
And, third, we're going to talk about how
we're integrating these fonts into all the

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:41.010
tools you use.
We're trying to make sure that you -- the

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:45.280
content creators of the Web have adequate
font selection. We want you to be able to

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:50.250
express yourselves and to build semantic and
efficient pages in applications.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:55.160
We know that if you are in the process of
designing an application for a Web site and

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.720
you don't find exactly the font that you're
looking for, you're going to think twice about

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.620
using Web Fonts. You might actually resort
to some of those dirty tactics we talked about

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:07.250
earlier in the presentation, and we don't
want this to be true. We want you to find

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:12.089
the font you would like to use.
We are relentlessly focused on increasing

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:19.490
the size of the library that we offer.
We started with 18 one year ago, and we have

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:27.649
175 font families in the Google font directory.
And we're aiming for 1,000 within 12 months.

00:17:27.649 --> 00:17:31.720
If you follow us on Google -- on Twitter at
Google Fonts, you will, basically, be subscribing

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.510
to new font announcements. I recommend you
do that because it is kind of fun to see the

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:40.600
new stuff coming hot off the press.
In the past, we worked with about 45 font

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.009
designers from all over the world. And we're
commissioning these fonts mostly to be built

00:17:45.009 --> 00:17:50.909
from scratch and optimized for the screen.
So let's take Lobster. Lobster is a font that's

00:17:50.909 --> 00:17:57.330
designed by a gentleman named Pablo Implari.
Pablo is a relative newcomer to the font design

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:04.679
space. But Lobster has amassed 178 million
font views in the last 30 days. And we think

00:18:04.679 --> 00:18:08.820
Lobster is a great example of the platform
that Google Web Fonts is providing to font

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.889
designers, both established and new to the
industry.

00:18:12.889 --> 00:18:17.039
We're really excited about the stage that
we can offer these font designers. Lobster

00:18:17.039 --> 00:18:22.039
has, basically, become a brand. Just a couple
months ago I was at South by Southwest and

00:18:22.039 --> 00:18:27.909
I saw Lobster on T-shirts. I saw it spray
painted to the sidewalk. So I was impressed

00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:33.320
with the way Lobster had spread around.
And as we add more fonts to our library, we're

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:38.190
also very committed to keeping the open source
license. We think this is incredibly important.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:42.940
And the reason is because there's no telling
what device or platform will be announced

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:47.360
in the future. And we don't want you to have
to worry about not being able to use these

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:51.900
fonts. We want you to have complete control
over their use. Put them in logos. Put them

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.480
on T-shirts. Spray paint them to the sidewalk.
They are your fonts just as much as they are

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:59.200
Google's. We would like you to know that.
We would like you to be creative with your

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:05.700
use.
So the V1 directory is currently available

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:11.190
at google.com/webfonts. But what does the
V2 look like? So here's -- I'm going to give

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:16.779
you a quick demo of our V2.
Just a note. This is a sneak peek. We're not

00:19:16.779 --> 00:19:22.350
announcing our timeline just yet, but this
is something we are hard at work to productionize.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:27.320
So what you are seeing on screen here on the
left-hand side are filters. And these filters

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:32.999
allow you to choose whether you want Serif,
Sans Serif, display or handwriting fonts.

00:19:32.999 --> 00:19:38.889
You can also choose the thickness of the font
you are looking for as well as the language

00:19:38.889 --> 00:19:40.669
you are looking for.
You can search for specific font names if

00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:45.749
you are looking for something in particular.
Up top, you can type some custom text. "Hello

00:19:45.749 --> 00:19:50.850
Google I/O." And this is really important
if you want to see what certain letters look

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:54.299
like.
Now, what we found is there's different -- you

00:19:54.299 --> 00:19:58.801
have a certain idea in mind for when you are
choosing a Web font. You know how you are

00:19:58.801 --> 00:20:04.710
going to use it, in a paragraph, as a logo.
And so we designed three view options, and

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:09.850
the three view options are sentence view and
this is the default view. And it shows, basically,

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:17.379
in a string that's about a sentence long.
So you can type a couple more things.

00:20:17.379 --> 00:20:21.590
But maybe you know you want to use only five
or six characters. So in this case, you will

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:26.750
put it into letter view. What happens is the
whole interface focuses around those first

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:32.429
letters in your preview text. Perhaps we are
just interested in how IO looks or maybe just

00:20:32.429 --> 00:20:38.520
the ampersand, which is an interesting character.
Along those same lines, if you are interested

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:42.399
in choosing body text, you can put it into
the paragraph view. And what this will do

00:20:42.399 --> 00:20:46.840
is show you what the font looks like in a
paragraph.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:52.610
So let's take an example. Let's pretend like
we're choosing the fonts to use on a blog

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:59.960
that covers Google I/O. So let's type "Google
I/O." And let's have an ampersand there. I

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:05.660
will put it into sentence view. And let's
say we want to create -- we want to choose

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:12.120
a heading font. So we want to a really thick
font. So let me go down -- I will choose Black.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:17.519
And so what we're seeing here are all our
options. And so what I'm going to do is add

00:21:17.519 --> 00:21:21.700
I will add a few to our collection. Our collection
is, basically, just a bucket. It is a collection

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.179
of things we might want to check out later.
We are not really sure. We are not committing

00:21:25.179 --> 00:21:30.470
yet at this stage, but we might like Syncopate.
There are two styles of Syncopate. There's

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:34.659
a bold and a normal, which is great. It might
come in handy.

00:21:34.659 --> 00:21:38.669
Coda looks pretty good. Let's add that to
our collection.

00:21:38.669 --> 00:21:43.809
And Bevan looks great, too. Now we have three
fonts in our collection.

00:21:43.809 --> 00:21:49.070
If I click on the second step "review," this
is where you can get much more detail about

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:52.720
the fonts in your collection. And you can
see them side by side which we found is a

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.700
very common use case when selecting fonts,
especially if there's very subtle differences

00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:02.690
between them.
And so here we can decide which font would

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:09.950
work best in our application. And so I can
rearrange.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:16.960
And, you know, it looks like Coda is a little
bit too bold so let's just "X" that out, and

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:23.070
Syncopate Bold looks pretty nice, so let's
"X" out Bevan. Now, if I want more information

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:28.779
about syncopate, I can click the description
tab up top and learn about its origins, as

00:22:28.779 --> 00:22:32.700
well as the character set tab, to make sure
that it includes all the characters that I

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.960
intend to use.
And so at this point, I'm ready to grab the

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:44.110
code and I proceed to Step 3.
In Step 3, we've realized that in our first

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:49.059
version, Google web fonts, we didn't do a
very good job of communicating the payload

00:22:49.059 --> 00:22:54.990
to webmasters, how much font data was actually
coming down, and so we have focused a lot

00:22:54.990 --> 00:23:00.509
on communicating that in this last step, and
you'll see, as I check and uncheck the variants

00:23:00.509 --> 00:23:04.789
beneath the syncopate font family, we have
an indicator in the right-hand side right

00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:07.960
over here that's changing and telling us what
the payload is like.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.110
And so at this step, you're basically going
to ask yourself "Am I going to use Syncopate

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:16.039
Normal and Bold or am I just going to use
Bold?" In this case, we're just going to use

00:23:16.039 --> 00:23:22.009
Bold, so I'm going to uncheck Normal 400 and
now I'm just down to a 30K request.

00:23:22.009 --> 00:23:26.139
Finally, like we covered earlier, I'm basically
going to copy this code into the header of

00:23:26.139 --> 00:23:31.940
my HTML document and I can then use it in
my CSS just like it's a regular font, right

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:36.669
next to Arial and Serif.
And so that concludes the live demo portion

00:23:36.669 --> 00:23:40.770
of things.
At this point, I'm going to invite Raph up

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:46.669
to the podium and he's going to talk about
the very awesome things we're doing to speed

00:23:46.669 --> 00:23:49.769
up web fonts. Raph?
[Applause]

00:23:49.769 --> 00:23:55.610
&gt;&gt;Raph Levien: Thanks, David.
I'm Raph Levien. I'm an engineer on the Google

00:23:55.610 --> 00:24:01.160
web fonts team and I'm going to talk to you
about faster fonts. So I'm going to go into

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:05.489
kind of a case study here, kind of work through
an example.

00:24:05.489 --> 00:24:10.429
One of the use cases for web fonts is building
a logo. When you look at logos, a lot of logos

00:24:10.429 --> 00:24:15.570
are primarily text. Of course there's lots
of other use cases, and what I'm talking about

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:22.289
is going to be good for navigational elements,
headlines, all kinds of things.

00:24:22.289 --> 00:24:25.779
And, you know, one of the other things about
logos is it's not -- most logos are not just

00:24:25.779 --> 00:24:31.499
pure text. A lot of times they have color,
really cool graphic elements in them too.

00:24:31.499 --> 00:24:36.919
So the example I'm going to work through is
a, you know, surfing company. So this is Pacifico

00:24:36.919 --> 00:24:41.950
Surf. It's using the Pacifico font that Dave
told you about a little earlier.

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:46.619
And how would you do this kind of the old
way? How would you do this before web fonts?

00:24:46.619 --> 00:24:52.320
You'd make an image out of it.
And I'm going to talk about how fast is this?

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:59.119
How much -- that really comes down to how
much is the payload? How many kilobytes is

00:24:59.119 --> 00:25:04.119
this that have to be transferred from the
server to the user's browser?

00:25:04.119 --> 00:25:10.129
Of course when you do text as image, it's
not searchable or zoomable, but you can still,

00:25:10.129 --> 00:25:17.259
you know, get it down to about 7.3K in this
particular case. That's pretty heavily optimized.

00:25:17.259 --> 00:25:24.149
So now let's do the same thing with web fonts,
and I mean, you know, it's -- now it's searchable,

00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:30.620
selectable, accessible, and if you browse
it on a mobile device, for example, then when

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.919
you zoom, it doesn't degrade like an image
does.

00:25:33.919 --> 00:25:38.150
But we're up to 50 kilobytes.
And again, this is going to depend on the

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:44.659
use case, how much of a -- you know, whether
that is an advantage, whether that pays off,

00:25:44.659 --> 00:25:50.460
or whether it's actually a little bit of a
step backwards for page speed.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.660
So at the bottom of the screen, you can see
the HTML snippet that we're using to select

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:58.929
this font, and it's straightforward. You just
pull it in Pacifico.

00:25:58.929 --> 00:26:03.320
And then also in the middle of the screen,
what you're seeing is the inspect element

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:07.880
view, which is a really, really great tool.
If you're not using this in Chrome, you should

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:13.749
be. This gives you a view of all of the resources
that your page is using, how big they are

00:26:13.749 --> 00:26:16.340
in kilobytes, and how much time they're taking
to load.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:22.230
So this is a really good way of visualizing
what -- the performance impact of all of the

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:28.889
resources that use fonts, images, et cetera.
So again, as I go through this, I'll be showing

00:26:28.889 --> 00:26:35.480
some graphs that show how many kilobytes we're
actually needing to transfer to get all of

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:40.530
this stuff rendered.
So I was talking about use cases a little

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:46.940
bit. You know, most pages are going to have
a lot of different navigational elements,

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:51.960
a lot of different headlines or whatever,
and if you are doing text as images, then

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:56.139
you have to do a separate image download for
each one of those uses of text.

00:26:56.139 --> 00:27:01.009
If you're using web fonts, you can transfer
the font once and have it apply across all

00:27:01.009 --> 00:27:04.769
of those graphic elements on the page.
So in a lot of these use cases, one -- if

00:27:04.769 --> 00:27:12.279
you build a big site, not just the one-image
use, then web fonts -- even just the simplest

00:27:12.279 --> 00:27:17.210
application of web fonts -- can be a huge
performance win.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:22.389
So we're always looking, how can we make this
faster? I mean, Google is obsessed with speed.

00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:26.299
The faster the pages run, the better the user
experience is, the better conversion rates

00:27:26.299 --> 00:27:29.509
are, so we want to do everything we can to
make that faster.

00:27:29.509 --> 00:27:34.590
And especially for mobile. So I'm going to
talk about that a little bit too today.

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:40.230
When you look inside of a font, you find that
a little bit more than half of it typically

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:45.820
is in the glyph shapes, the metrics, what
actually makes the font the font, and almost

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:51.109
half of it is metadata that's used only for
making Windows rendering better.

00:27:51.109 --> 00:27:54.450
Well, that's really important, and in fact
we've been doing -- in the last year, we've

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:59.399
been doing a lot of work kind of quietly a
little bit behind the scenes to make Windows

00:27:59.399 --> 00:28:04.389
rendering better quality. So almost all of
our fonts today have high-quality Windows

00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:10.249
metadata to improve that hinting.
But if you're on a mobile device, that's data

00:28:10.249 --> 00:28:13.889
you're transferring over the line that you
really don't need.

00:28:13.889 --> 00:28:20.369
So in February of this year, we rolled out
an optimization that detects when you're on

00:28:20.369 --> 00:28:26.460
a Mac, an Android device, or a iOS device
-- a iPhone or an iPad -- in other words,

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:32.620
a device that doesn't need that extra metadata.
When we detect that, then we serve an optimized

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:38.879
version of that font on the fly that, in this
case, brings the request down to 29K, which

00:28:38.879 --> 00:28:43.489
is a pretty good improvement.
And you'll notice the HTML snippet that you

00:28:43.489 --> 00:28:48.299
used to select that font is exactly the same.
You didn't have to change anything in your

00:28:48.299 --> 00:28:54.759
page. All of the users of the Google Font
API got this optimization completely for free.

00:28:54.759 --> 00:29:02.659
And that is something that would not be possible,
using the pure CSS at font face. You get that

00:29:02.659 --> 00:29:07.139
because of the dynamic work that the Google
Font API is doing behind the scenes.

00:29:07.139 --> 00:29:13.769
So that's bringing the request down to 29K.
A nice -- you know, something that really

00:29:13.769 --> 00:29:17.140
is practical, even if you're building sites
that are optimized for mobile.

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:23.570
But of course we weren't satisfied there.
Why are we sending the entire font to build

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:28.799
this logo when we're only using 10 characters
out of it?

00:29:28.799 --> 00:29:33.549
What if there was some way that we could ask
for just the letters out of this font that

00:29:33.549 --> 00:29:38.269
we're actually using?
So I'm really excited to introduce today the

00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:43.149
text equals parameter to the Google web fonts
API.

00:29:43.149 --> 00:29:49.249
And so you can see it at the bottom, that
we add to the request the exact text that

00:29:49.249 --> 00:29:52.559
we're going to render. Actually, you can use
the letters. They don't have to be in order

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:56.999
and they don't have to contain duplicates,
but here it's easy to see what we're doing.

00:29:56.999 --> 00:30:02.929
And now the font that you get back is 4.6K.
I mean, it's incredibly tiny. You can use

00:30:02.929 --> 00:30:09.749
this on a mobile device, and it's effectively
instant. Except 4.6K is the version that we

00:30:09.749 --> 00:30:17.559
give to Windows, so you can see in the chart
the amazing, you know, reduction in size that

00:30:17.559 --> 00:30:21.350
we were able to get.
But you can actually do both of the optimizations

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:24.850
to get there, and again, this is done with
the same HTML snippet. You don't have to do

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:29.220
anything special to get the mobile Android
and iOS optimization.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:35.109
And when both of these optimizations are applied
together, it brings the request down to 2.8K,

00:30:35.109 --> 00:30:43.059
which is just, you know, amazing in terms
of how fast that will transfer over the wire.

00:30:43.059 --> 00:30:50.970
So in this case, it's even significant improvement
over an optimized image for that page.

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:55.489
So there's lots and lots of benefits of using
this feature. It's fast. Especially for mobile.

00:30:55.489 --> 00:31:00.389
And we heard a lot about Android this morning.
Mobile web is a huge part of the web, and

00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:05.729
growing fast, and so we really want to optimize
sites for mobile web as well.

00:31:05.729 --> 00:31:10.169
You can use one font. You can use one text
equals request for all of the text on your

00:31:10.169 --> 00:31:15.460
page. So if you've got lots of navigation
elements or menus, you can combine all of

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:20.830
that into one request to the Google Font API,
get one font that renders for all of those

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:26.210
uses, whereas images would require one image
per use on that page.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:30.139
And another thing that we're really excited
about, going forward, is that this technique

00:31:30.139 --> 00:31:34.850
works very well for international fonts. Multilingual
fonts can be huge.

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:41.109
A Chinese or Japanese font can get into multiple
megabytes. So we're -- all of these -- the

00:31:41.109 --> 00:31:46.119
text equals feature works on all the international
fonts in the Google Font -- Google web font

00:31:46.119 --> 00:31:54.179
service as well, and we think this is really
key to get worldwide adoption of web fonts.

00:31:54.179 --> 00:31:59.389
So I want to step back a little and just go
through all of the things that we're doing

00:31:59.389 --> 00:32:03.830
to make web fonts fast.
In addition to the features that I talked

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:09.340
about before, the size optimization for mobile
and Mac and the text equals feature, we're

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:14.179
doing a lot of innovative things behind the
scenes in our serving infrastructure. We're

00:32:14.179 --> 00:32:19.029
setting maximal caching of those fonts. We
can do that because they're open source. There's

00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:25.870
no peg 8 that we need to put in place, so
we can go completely floor to the -- you know,

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:31.440
foot to the floor to get those fonts as fast
as possible, and that includes our caching

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:38.210
strategy. That includes across sites.
So if somebody has navigated to a site that

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:43.950
uses a Google Font and then they navigate
to your site that uses that same font, that

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:48.119
font will already be in the user's cache and
there isn't even a network request to check

00:32:48.119 --> 00:32:52.840
whether it's in the cache. It just renders
instantly in that case. That's one of the

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:58.639
reasons we're so excited to see the incredible
increase in adoption that Dave was talking

00:32:58.639 --> 00:33:04.090
about earlier.
The more popular the Google Font service becomes,

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:10.440
the faster it's going to be.
We, of course, use maximal compression on

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:15.830
all of our fonts, and today that's including
the WOFF format on all modern browsers. On

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:21.600
browsers that don't support it, we use different
forms of compression, but we use the maximum

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:26.679
compression that's available.
I talked about the optimizations, the size

00:33:26.679 --> 00:33:31.789
optimizations for mobile, text equals, and,
you know, don't forget that everything is

00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:36.690
being served from Google's worldwide infrastructure,
so we've got data centers around the world

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:40.799
and you'll get the fonts served to the user
from their nearest data center, no matter

00:33:40.799 --> 00:33:46.690
where they are and no matter where the site
developer is.

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:52.159
So, you know, we're hard at work. That's a
big part of what we do is building the fastest

00:33:52.159 --> 00:33:55.190
infrastructure for serving web fonts that's
possible.

00:33:55.190 --> 00:34:01.049
But the integration for you is easy and quick.
The 30 seconds that you saw is all you need

00:34:01.049 --> 00:34:07.090
to integrate the Google web fonts and you
get all of the benefits, including all the

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:12.450
speed, as part of that.
So next I'd like to talk about web fonts in

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:17.990
more places.
You already see web fonts integrated into

00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:21.309
Drupal, WordPress, and Google properties such
as blogger.

00:34:21.309 --> 00:34:28.280
The Drupal and WordPress plug-ins were done,
you know, by independent developers on their

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:33.679
own initiative, and to get the list of fonts,
they use a combination of, in some cases,

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:38.079
hard wiring in the list or in some cases scraping
it off of our HTML.

00:34:38.079 --> 00:34:43.559
And so we figured there must be a better way
to do this, to get a fresh, up-to-date list

00:34:43.559 --> 00:34:48.290
you know, with all the fonts that we're launching
every week now, you know, that list is growing

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:51.619
fast.
And so we're announcing currently in a trusted

00:34:51.619 --> 00:34:59.360
tester status the Google web fonts developer
API, which gives a fresh up-to-date list of

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:03.059
those fonts.
So if you're a developer and you want to put

00:35:03.059 --> 00:35:07.780
Google web fonts in the menu of any of your
products, come see me afterwards or send me

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:13.490
an e-mail and we'll get you listed in the
trusted tester program, and of course we'll

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:18.490
see this rolling out soon and benefiting all
of the users.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:26.150
We also want to see it integrated into more
tools. A lot of web developers use the Adobe

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:34.530
Creative Suite -- In Design, Photoshop -- and
so we want to -- you know, we want to see

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:39.319
Google web fonts used everywhere, including
in these tools, and so I'm really happy to

00:35:39.319 --> 00:35:44.869
introduce to you Darren Glenister from a Swedish
company, TypeDNA, and he'll be talking to

00:35:44.869 --> 00:35:52.390
us about the tools that his company is developing
to get Google web fonts in products, including

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:58.640
the Adobe Creative Suite.
[Applause]

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:04.390
&gt;&gt;Darren Glenister: Thank you, Raph. My name
is Darren Glenister. I'm development director

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:09.630
for TypeDNA. TypeDNA is a Swedish company
that specializes in font technologies.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:14.730
We create tools that actually analyze characteristics
of fonts and help designers choose and use

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:19.410
fonts. TypeDNA's core product is a unique
font manager that works stand-alone and also

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:23.559
directly in Adobe CS5.
I'm going to start by showing you a quick

00:36:23.559 --> 00:36:34.809
video that highlights TypeDNA's features.
[Video.]

00:36:34.809 --> 00:37:32.830
&gt;&gt;Darren Glenister: So over the past few months,
we've been using the Google web font developer

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:37.910
API to enhance our CS5 plug-ins, and so today
I'm proud to announce the inclusion of Google

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:41.710
web fonts direct inside Photoshop In Design
Illustrator via TypeDNA.

00:37:41.710 --> 00:38:00.610
So this here is TypeDNA running in Photoshop.
Many of you probably use Photoshop to mock

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:05.880
up web pages or applications. I will show
you how TypeDNA gives direct access to Google

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:09.119
web fonts and how they can be applied to this
example web page template.

00:38:09.119 --> 00:38:16.430
By default, TypeDNA shows fonts from a hard
drive as you can see listed you here. To get

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:24.109
access to the Google web fonts, I click the
web fonts channel here, and then select Google.

00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:31.839
Now, here I have a list of Google web fonts.
TypeDNA's tools are available to me to help

00:38:31.839 --> 00:38:38.630
me find the font I want.
Tools that TypeDNA provide are Similarity,

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:45.940
for finding similar fonts, Harmony for mixing
fonts, Smart Choice for suggesting fonts,

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:50.200
and attribute filters for detailed filtering
by weight, width, italic angle, and optical

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:54.039
size.
And all of these tools work by character analysis

00:38:54.039 --> 00:39:00.809
and do not use any metadata.
For my design, I'm going to pick two fonts.

00:39:00.809 --> 00:39:04.170
Firstly, a headline font and secondly a body
font.

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:08.270
Let's start by finding a headline font.
I want to use something quite heavy, but rather

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:11.789
than scrolling through hundreds of fonts,
I'm just going to use TypeDNA's attribute

00:39:11.789 --> 00:39:15.819
filters.
All I need do is select the weight filter

00:39:15.819 --> 00:39:26.069
and "very heavy."
And as you see now, the results are filtered.

00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:31.210
From these results, I personally quite like
Candal but I still don't think it's actually

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:36.109
heavy enough so what I'm going to do is use
the TypeDNA Similarity function to find more

00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:44.109
fonts like Candal Regular. So now I'm shown
a list of similar fonts. And again, this is

00:39:44.109 --> 00:39:47.619
all by characteristics.
So what I'm actually going to do is use -- I'm

00:39:47.619 --> 00:39:53.760
going to pick Paytone One Regular as the font,
and as I do is double-click here and it installs

00:39:53.760 --> 00:40:00.270
it locally on my machine and it's ready to
use. And as you can see here as well, I actually

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:07.380
have the code that I need to add to my HTML.
I'm going to find a second font now. I'm going

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:10.920
to find a complementary body font and I'm
going to do this by using TypeDNA's Harmony

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:17.070
feature. So as I have Paytone One selected,
all I do is collect Harmony and then click

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:22.400
Harmony body and then TypeDNA analyzes the
characteristics of Paytone 1 and makes suggestions

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:28.200
of body fonts that work well with that headline
font. So I'm actually going to go for Arvo

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:34.630
Regular as my body font and again, all I do
is double-click and this time I'm going to

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:39.559
as to view the installed fonts. So now I get
the fonts that I've actually installed on

00:40:39.559 --> 00:40:43.940
my machine that are suitable as web fonts.
And now I'm outside of the Google web font

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:48.559
directory but I still have access to the CSS
code required to use the font.

00:40:48.559 --> 00:40:54.390
So to apply these fonts in my document, all
do you is go back to my document, I pick the

00:40:54.390 --> 00:41:02.630
headline, apply Paytone, then I pick the body
and apply Arvo Regular and as you can see,

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:08.480
it's very simple to bring Google web fonts
direct inside the CS suite via TypeDNA.

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:18.460
I just want to show one more example of a
tool that we have. This is a page that I created

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:22.930
earlier, and this is -- this is a font I actually
chose, and this font is a font that's on my

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:28.500
system. I know it's not available as a web
font, so what I'm going to do is use TypeDNA

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:32.660
to suggest to me similar Google web fonts
that are available.

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:41.579
So I go into my local directory. I click the
plus here, and then ask to tell me what the

00:41:41.579 --> 00:41:47.049
current font is in the document, which is
Abadi MT Condensed. I just click here and

00:41:47.049 --> 00:41:55.270
then click the similar web fonts body which
then takes me into Google and it makes suggestions

00:41:55.270 --> 00:42:00.319
of similar Google web fonts.
I'm going to take the top match here, double-click

00:42:00.319 --> 00:42:07.589
to install, view, and then swap it out and
as you can see, there was hardly a change,

00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:14.640
but that font is free to choose, direct from
the Google web font directory. So that gives

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:19.750
you an idea of what TypeDNA have been doing
with the Google web fonts directory, and over

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:25.200
the coming weeks we'll be releasing tools
you're going to use directly online. For example,

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:29.599
we'll be releasing some tools that reads all
the fonts from your hard drive and you can

00:42:29.599 --> 00:42:38.470
use similar fonts from the Google web fonts
directory. I thank you for your time and pass

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:41.080
you back.
[ Applause ]

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:47.970
&gt;&gt; David Wurtz: Thanks very much, Darren.
So let's recap. We first started with a web

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:52.350
fonts crash course where we learned what web
fonts are and why you should potentially be

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:57.210
excited about them. We then talked about Google
web fonts, which is Google's offering in the

00:42:57.210 --> 00:43:04.279
space and is available at Google.com/webfonts.
We then talked about Google trends. The exciting

00:43:04.279 --> 00:43:09.480
trends we've been seeing with web font adoption.
And, finally, we went into more detail on

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:13.329
what Google web fonts team is working on,
specifically, our plans to add more fonts

00:43:13.329 --> 00:43:19.040
to our library and to redesign the front-end
browser experience for those fonts, to make

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:24.240
web fonts faster, and to integrate them into
all the tools that you use every day. So,

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:28.410
with that, we'll go to questions.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi. Have you thought about using -- getting

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:32.660
some mathematical fonts? Mathematics is very
font-intensive. I'm involved with an open

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:37.839
source math project called mathJax, which
is a JavaScript engine for displaying math.

00:43:37.839 --> 00:43:46.230
And it's heavily dependent on fonts, and the
subsetting, the caching, all the things that

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:59.880
you mentioned are even, you know, huge advantages
in this case. Because you're always working

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:08.730
with huge numbers of symbols in the font but
any one page will only use a small subset

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:12.520
of it.
&gt;&gt;David Wurtz: So we hear a lot of requests

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:18.650
like this. There's icon fonts. There's symbol
fonts. There's mathematical fonts. The truth

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:22.220
is we're not prioritizing it at the moment,
but we definitely recognize there's a lot

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:24.060
of opportunity to do this.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You could actually go a long way by supporting

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:29.119
one font. There is the sticks font, which
is an open source font that a bunch of organizations

00:44:29.119 --> 00:44:32.680
and publishers got together and designed.
And most, you know, online math is starting

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:41.720
to use that font.
&gt;&gt;David Wurtz: That's great to know. Thank

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:47.850
you. I'm going to take one from our moderator
page.

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:52.580
"What are your thoughts on served web fonts
and their inability to render 100% properly

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:58.539
on Windows 7 PCs? Some fonts look great, and
some are just plain unusable."

00:44:58.539 --> 00:45:03.860
&gt;&gt;Raph Levien: So this is a really interesting
question. First of all, we're doing a lot

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:08.309
of work. We're going over the fonts that are
currently in the directory, and we're commissioning

00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:14.660
new fonts. We're doing a lot of work to improve
the quality of Windows rendering. It's not

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:18.940
really just Windows 7. It's all versions of
Windows that have two rendering engines. There's

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:24.839
GDI, and then there's the new rendering engine
that's used, among other places, by Internet

00:45:24.839 --> 00:45:29.740
Explorer 9. And the new rendering engine is
actually capable of a lot better quality.

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:34.400
And we're again doing work on Google fonts
to make the best use of this. We're aware

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.400
of this and definitely making a lot of progress
on it.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.400
&gt;&gt;&gt; Great to hear about your progress over
the last year. 1,000 new fonts sounds wonderful.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:40.500
Good work. I have one question about the markup
that you generate. You say you generate CSS

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:53.090
code, but you're not clear you generate HTML
code -- right? -- with CSS kind of tucked

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:57.280
in there.
&gt;&gt;David Wurtz: Right.

00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:08.079
&gt;&gt;&gt; In my -- aesthetically, I'd rather use
CSS code. I think it looks better. It sort

00:46:08.079 --> 00:46:12.690
of puts the presentation into one container
and the HTML into another. Others may disagree.

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:13.980
And I know you also generate the CSS code
if you go into advanced techniques. Would

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:20.359
you consider switching, or is there a reason
you choose to generate HTML inside CSS?

00:46:20.359 --> 00:46:27.150
&gt;&gt;Raph Levien: Yes, there is a reason. And
it's, basically, the import rule for CSS actually

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:33.240
causes some blocking that you can serialize
the loading of the different CSS elements

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:40.130
on some especially older browsers. So, if
you are designing primarily for newer modern

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:42.830
browsers, then doing it completely in CSS
is a great option.

00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:47.039
&gt;&gt;David Wurtz: Let's take another one from
the moderator.

00:46:47.039 --> 00:46:51.869
"Will web fonts work with any potentially
offline solution, such as the mobile web app?"

00:46:51.869 --> 00:46:58.460
&gt;&gt;Raph Levien: That's a great question. I
really don't have an answer for it. It's kind

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:02.619
of an emerging space.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You mentioned that the fonts are open

00:47:02.619 --> 00:47:06.770
source. Which license is being used?
&gt;&gt;David Wurtz: We actually use a variety of

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:10.970
licenses. The most common one is OFL.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Does that allow for derivative works?

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:18.730
&gt;&gt;Raph Levien: Yes, it does. Both of the primary
licenses we use, Apache 2 and SIL open font

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:24.890
license, do allow for derivative works. There's
some -- you have to do attribution. And there's

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:29.619
some rules about, you know, what you name
the fonts that you have to kind of respect

00:47:29.619 --> 00:47:34.190
the wishes of the font designer around the
names of those derivative works. But you're

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:36.540
free to mix them all together, you know, add
your own characters, basically, do anything

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:39.529
you like.
&gt;&gt;&gt; And then, related to that question, the

00:47:39.529 --> 00:47:42.799
gentleman talked about the math font that
is available. Is there a model for people

00:47:42.799 --> 00:47:47.680
to contribute fonts in your repository at
this point in time?

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:55.150
&gt;&gt;Raph Levien: We work with lots of font developers.
There's no kind of -- you know, self-serve

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:56.150
mechanism --
&gt;&gt;&gt; So no.

00:47:56.150 --> 00:48:00.780
&gt;&gt;Raph Levien: -- now. But, if you're developing
fonts, we probably want to talk to you.

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:03.349
&gt;&gt;&gt; All right. Thanks.
&gt;&gt; David Wurtz: I'll take another one from

00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:06.319
the moderator.
"Great job on the optimizations. Is it possible

00:48:06.319 --> 00:48:10.630
to reduce HTTP requests as well when using
multiple web fonts?"

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:16.400
So the answer is yes. That's exactly what
the version of Google version 2 web fonts

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:24.150
will do. It's support in v1 as well. Basically,
in the snippet that you include, it's possible

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:29.420
to just request multiple fonts in that one
HTTP request. But the v2 makes it really simple

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:34.470
for you to understand the payload differences.
And, as you uncheck and check the variants

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:37.130
that they're using, you'll see the snippet
actually change in realtime.

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:42.590
&gt;&gt;&gt; Just wanted to preface my question with
the statement that I have a company I work

00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:46.660
for. We're real happy with Google font API
and what it's been able to do for us. However,

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:50.260
as a digital agency, we're involved in fairly
highly creative works. And we've used Typekit

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:53.369
and others because they're integrated with
several popular and vast font foundries. And

00:48:53.369 --> 00:49:08.670
the fact that we pay for it -- pay for that
service gives us that ability to access those

00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:13.950
-- that large library of fonts and appreciate
what you're doing with adding more fonts to

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:19.240
the library. But the fact that you plan to
stay free, I gather, seems like that it might

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:28.480
prohibit you from getting some more of those
other foundries involved or, I guess, better-looking

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:29.869
fonts.
&gt;&gt;David Wurtz: First of all, I want to say

00:49:29.869 --> 00:49:34.640
we actually love the fact that there's many
different options in the space. So, to remind

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:41.650
you why Google is in the space, we want to
see web fonts as ubiquitous technology. The

00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:45.990
fact that Typekit is doing amazingly well
is really great for Google as well as it is

00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:53.970
for the Typekit folks. I think it's true that,
if we decided to do some type of commercial

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:57.270
offering, there would be lots of foundries
that would be more willing to hand their fonts

00:49:57.270 --> 00:50:01.839
over to our serving infrastructure. But what
we're finding and what our goals is is that

00:50:01.839 --> 00:50:07.880
we want to grow the pie. We want to make sure
that the folks that are just the casual bloggers

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:14.460
have sufficient access to high quality fonts.
And we'll fill the market from below, make

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:18.130
a solid foundation. And then there could be
other commercial offerings like Typekit, which

00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:23.579
will partner directly with the who's who of
the font industry and bring really high quality

00:50:23.579 --> 00:50:26.170
fonts to users. So we see it working synergistically,
actually.

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:31.130
&gt;&gt;&gt; When I advocate people using Google webkit
web forms, I say they should use JavaScript

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:38.220
API because it allows you for to use fallback
font to have another font size. Like, when

00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:42.210
you fall back to Arial and you have a font
that looks great in 300 pixels, you don't

00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:52.329
want to have 300 pixel Arial on the page.
So can the previewer also generate Java code

00:50:52.329 --> 00:50:57.599
for me as an extra option? Because that would
be something to promote that feature because

00:50:57.599 --> 00:50:58.970
it's much more bulletproof than just putting
the new font in.

00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:04.231
&gt;&gt;Raph Levien: That's a great question. Today,
no. Certainly, as we develop version 2 of

00:51:04.231 --> 00:51:09.760
the directory, that's one of the things we're
going to be look at. You're absolutely right.

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:15.740
JavaScript API has some real advantages to
controlling the fallback fonts with the way

00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:23.779
the fonts stage in a lot better. In the case
where the font is, you know, is slow to load

00:51:23.779 --> 00:51:30.099
or if the Google web font server goes down,
which it hasn't yet, by the way, you have

00:51:30.099 --> 00:51:36.380
to plan. You have to prepare.
It's more complicated to integrate the JavaScript.

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:41.720
And so, you know, it's there as, basically,
a feature for more advanced developers. There's

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:47.619
definitely more that we can and should do
to advocate it and to make that adoption simpler.

00:51:47.619 --> 00:51:50.230
So thanks for bringing that up.
&gt;&gt;David Wurtz: Let's take another one from

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:55.920
the moderator. "Is there some plans to bring
web fonts to Android?" The good news is that

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:59.609
Google web fonts do work in the Android browser,
so, in a way, they're already there.

00:51:59.609 --> 00:52:03.119
&gt;&gt;Raph Levien: 2.2+.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think I tried it in one browser. I forget

00:52:03.119 --> 00:52:10.849
which one. Does text shadow and all that stuff
work on the web fonts?

00:52:10.849 --> 00:52:11.849
&gt;&gt;David Wurtz: It does. Yeah.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It does. Maybe it was just the browser.

00:52:11.849 --> 00:52:22.230
&gt;&gt;&gt; How is the support for international characters
in the current -- in the family of web fonts

00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:23.460
that are in the Web site?
Do they have an extended character set, or

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:38.480
do they mostly support Latin and Western European?
&gt;&gt;Raph Levien: Another great question. We've

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:45.440
been slowly building out the range of international
character set. So we have -- most of the fonts

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:51.720
are supporting Latin. A growing number of
the fonts are also supporting Cyrillic and

00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:57.210
Greek and a few other, like, Latin extended
ranges. There are a few others. We actually

00:52:57.210 --> 00:53:04.849
have a lot of Kumar fonts in the directory.
For the more complex scripts, we're working

00:53:04.849 --> 00:53:10.160
with the browser manufacturers, of course,
including Chrome, to really make the support

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:15.250
for those scripts bulletproof. One of the
things that we really try to do in the Google

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:20.980
web fonts is make all of our fonts rock solid.
We don't want to have anything in there that

00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:27.289
only works a little bit or only works in some
cases. So we're really trying to make the

00:53:27.289 --> 00:53:33.849
support for that 100% rock solid before we
roll it out. But it is definitely important

00:53:33.849 --> 00:53:39.260
for Google to make these fonts worldwide,
all languages. And so that's what we're working

00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:40.380
on.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you. Very good.

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:45.049
&gt;&gt;David Wurtz: Let's take one more question.
&gt;&gt;&gt; With regard to performance, if I have

00:53:45.049 --> 00:53:51.450
a page and I load A, B, C and a second page
loads D, E, F and I get to a third page and

00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:54.390
I load A, C, F, what happens on that third
page?

00:53:54.390 --> 00:54:02.579
&gt;&gt;Raph Levien: Well, so that's a great question.
And we're -- we are going through our data

00:54:02.579 --> 00:54:08.910
and trying to figure out how to optimize those
cases. So, you know, it might load a different

00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:13.779
font. Or we might be able to figure out how
to aggregate and optimize those. So that's

00:54:13.779 --> 00:54:16.510
one of the -- again, going forward, one of
the things that we're going to try to figure

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:20.960
out what is the most optimized way that we
can respond to those requests?

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:25.300
&gt;&gt;David Wurtz: All right. Thanks, everyone.
If you have any more questions, feel free

00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:28.010
to join us up here. We'll be hanging out.
Thanks.
