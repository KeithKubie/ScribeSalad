00:00:05.942 --> 00:00:07.900
GRAHAM ALLISON: So thanks
very much for coming.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.020
And I look forward to
a lively discussion.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.210
I was-- I guess
this is the 13th day

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.340
of the rollout of the new book.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.860
It's called "Destined for War:
Can America and China Escape

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.270
Thucydides' Trap?"

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.460
I was out on the
West Coast last week,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.590
actually did an event
in Silicon Valley

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.405
with the Andreesen
Horowitz folks, to which

00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:35.500
some Google people came.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.670
And I mentioned at the
event that basically I'm

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.510
a big fan of Silicon
Valley, and it's even more--

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.410
it's Boston based equivalents,
since this is where I live,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.820
and the ways in which you're
blowing my mind almost

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.280
every day, or every
week, or every month,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.560
with products that I
couldn't have imagined,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.930
of which Google is
kind of a poster child.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.920
But I hope that what I'm going
to do in the next 20 minutes

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.040
is expand your mind a
little bit about some things

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.730
that you may not
have thought about,

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.660
but that which
are likely to have

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.610
great consequence for your lives
and for actually your activity.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.380
So most of you are too young
to imagine that there could

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.440
be wars between great powers.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.960
I teach at Harvard, as
I've done for a long time.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.430
Students say, well no, no,
that's a last century thing.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.980
It's been seven decades
since World War II

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.340
without great power
war, so great power wars

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.140
have been consigned to the
dustbin of history, move on.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.160
To which the answer is
that's historically ignorant.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.070
And this seven decade
without great power war

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.041
is historically an anomaly.

00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:56.540
Indeed there's a
great essay written

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.060
by a Yale historian,
John Gaddis,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.340
about the so-called long
peace, and how anomalous it is.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.330
So before I'm done, I hope
I will have persuaded you

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.030
that if that's what you
thought when you came in,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.510
you should think again, that
wars between great powers

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.650
are possible, maybe even a
lot more possible than you

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.360
would have imagined.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.510
And if there were to
be a great power war,

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.209
your lives will
change fundamentally.

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.250
What you're working on
will change fundamentally.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.500
What you're thinking about
will change fundamentally.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.120
You might even be drafted to
have to go fight somewhere

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.070
where you wouldn't like to be.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.940
And if that seems
incredible, you

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.650
should try to think
back 100 years ago.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.660
I think one of the
ways of locating

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.230
yourself is to think what was
going on 100 years ago today,

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.270
or this month.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.710
A hundred years ago,
Europe was consumed

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.820
by the first great
war, a war that

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.730
was so devastating
that at the end of it,

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.740
historians felt
obliged to create

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.530
an entirely new category.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.050
That's why if you Google
it, it says World War,

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.716
and it's was called World War I.

00:03:09.716 --> 00:03:13.070
Now World War I was not
just that it encompassed

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.830
so many people and
so many countries,

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.400
but that it was so
ultimately devastating.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.730
At the end of it, about 25
million people had perished.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.230
And the Americans
actually had just

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.254
entered World War I two
months ago, in April of 1970.

00:03:30.254 --> 00:03:31.670
So you can go back
and look at it,

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.711
and think a little bit
about it, and think, well,

00:03:33.711 --> 00:03:36.790
what if I were living in 1970.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.180
What would I be thinking about?

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.740
What would be my orientation?

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.180
What would I be
having to work on?

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.170
What [INAUDIBLE]?

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.350
So in any case, that's
the big picture.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.760
This is about China,
and the US, and today.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.170
And I'm going to do three
questions, three big questions.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.960
I'll give you three tweet
versions of an answer,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.150
so that you've got the picture.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.480
And then I'll do a little
elaboration on each.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.400
So first question, what
is the geopolitical event

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.850
of your lifetime to date?

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.680
So let's imagine you
were born in 1990,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.829
let's say, a little
after or a little before.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.290
So over the last 25 years.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.156
What's the big, big,
big, geopolitical event?

00:04:23.156 --> 00:04:25.790
And the tweet
version of the answer

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.575
is that it's the rise of China.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.800
The second question, what will
be the geo strategic challenge

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.080
for the rest of your
professional life, for today,

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.450
and as far as any eye can see?

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.610
And the tweet version
is that that's

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:54.020
the impact of the rise
of China on the US

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.170
and the international order
that the US constructed

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.550
in the aftermath of World
War II, and has maintained,

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.980
that principally
accounts for the fact

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.190
that there's been seven decades
without any great power war.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.910
So the impact of
the rise of China

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.600
on the US and the
international order.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.600
And the third question is
the subtitle of the book,

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.800
can America and China
escape Thucydides' trap?

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.100
And the answer is--

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.580
excuse me for being professorial
real, but that's my job--

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.460
no, and yes.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.690
So what about no?

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.790
No-- if we, in the relations
between the US and China,

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.020
this year, and next
year, and the year after,

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.100
only see business
as usual, then we

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.500
should expect history as usual.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.980
And history as usual in
this case would be a war

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.940
and it would be catastrophic.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.150
And that's pretty plain
for everybody to see.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.130
So that's no, OK.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.180
But yes, as the saying
goes, only those

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.610
who fail to study history
are condemned to repeat it.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.630
So we're not required by
some iron law of history

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.020
to repeat mistakes that
people made that led them

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.880
into World War I. We're not
required to repeat mistakes

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.240
that lead into World War II.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.570
And we can learn from
the cases in which states

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.990
have successfully averted
war, lessons that we can

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.130
apply in the current instance.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.030
So that's my three tweet
versions, a little bit more

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.820
on the lot.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.760
So start with Thucydides.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.360
For most American audiences,
I've been now 13 days

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.930
doing this.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.730
I have a little
bit of experience,

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.540
especially for
radio call-in shows.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.450
Yes, this is multi-syllabic.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.850
I know that in your Google
efforts to communicate,

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.990
you can get people down to a
single syllables, or at least

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.010
two.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.350
And yes, it's a mouthful.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.100
And it's a little
difficult to pronounce.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.150
But a group like this should
know who Thucydides is.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.290
If he's not part of your mental
canon, part of your library

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.880
that helps orient you,
you've missed a big thing

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.400
and a big opportunity.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.420
So just to make sure we all
know how to pronounce his name,

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.680
let me remind you,
it's Thu-ci-di-dees--

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.250
Thucydides.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.340
So let's say it
out loud together--

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.510
Thucydides,
Thucydides, Thucydides.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.240
So you should not
stumble over that.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.820
Yes, multi-syllabic,
yes complicated,

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.820
but he should be
somebody you know.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.450
And actually, in
this wonderful world

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.260
today, you can go
download Thucydides

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.760
"Great History of the
Peloponnesian War," for free

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.780
and just read the
first 100 pages.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.340
And if it doesn't knock your
socks off, I'll be surprised.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.155
I'll be very surprised,
brilliant book.

00:08:07.155 --> 00:08:09.029
Thucydides, who is that?

00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:10.070
Well, you can Google him.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:15.340
You'll find he was the
founder and father of history.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.390
So he's the person who defined
the discipline of history,

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:23.032
which is getting the facts
about what happened right

00:08:23.032 --> 00:08:25.490
so that other people can read
about it them, and learn what

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.090
happened, and learn
the lessons from them.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.679
So the founder of history,
he wrote about the conflict,

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.630
the competition
and then conflict

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.850
between the two
great city-states

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:41.169
of classical Greece,
Athens and Sparta.

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:45.010
And he wrote most
famously, "It was the rise

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:49.960
of Athens and the fear that
this instilled in Sparta

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.820
that made the war inevitable."

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.980
So Thucydides' trap,
which is a term I coined,

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:02.860
takes Thucydides insight,
and Thucydides' trap says

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:07.520
when a rising power threatens
to displace a ruling power,

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.890
basically shit happens--

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.500
alarm bells should
sound, danger ahead.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:19.640
I looked in this book at the
last 500 years of history.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.230
And I give you in the appendix
little potted plant versions

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:27.250
of 16 cases, where if you
go to the Thucydides' Trap

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.820
website, which is up
live, we're actually

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.800
inviting additional cases.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.370
These are 16 cases
over the last 500 years

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.220
in which a rising power
threatened to displace

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.280
a major ruling power.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.040
In 12 of these cases,
the outcome was war.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.850
In four of the cases,
the outcome was no war.

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.610
So Thucydides' line
about inevitable,

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:55.060
that's an exaggeration,
that's hyperbole,

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.040
exaggeration for the
sake of emphasis.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.370
He just means
likely, very likely.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:04.240
So 12 of the cases ended
in war, four of the cases

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.720
ended in no war.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.070
And what the book
does is try to look

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:13.000
at both the failures
and the successes

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.900
for lessons that might
be relevant for us today.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:21.850
So to think about this dynamic--

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:25.510
actually this came up in
the discussion last week

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:26.950
in Silicon Valley--

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.330
I think for you
all, probably you

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:33.400
should think of an
incumbent and a upstart,

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.310
a disruptive upstart.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.320
So what happens?

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.700
So basically, a rising
power feels like I'm bigger,

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:48.100
I'm stronger, my interests
deserve more weight.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.690
I deserve more say,
I deserve more sway.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.190
Actually, the
current arrangements

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.850
are discriminating against me,
because they were established

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.660
before I was even a player.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.640
So things need to adjust.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.090
I'm being confined.

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:08.550
So think of Uber and
the taxi industry.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.680
Think of Google when
it was an upstart.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.240
Actually, Google
now is interesting

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.670
because, you live on
both sides of this fence.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.730
You're a upstart in some
domains, where you're

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:25.606
trying to disrupt some
incumbent, and at the same time

00:11:25.606 --> 00:11:26.980
you're looking
over your shoulder

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.590
where you're an
incumbent in some spaces,

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:34.040
finding Baidu or somebody,
coming to see what they can do.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.330
So what does the
ruling power think?

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:43.600
Well, the ruling power
thinks this is natural.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.920
The way things are
it's good, maybe even

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.540
the way they should be.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.240
The status quo has
provided an environment

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.900
in which actually you, upstart,
have had a chance to grow up.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.430
So we say to the Chinese, quite
reasonably, how in the world

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.320
have you had seven decades
of peace in which you've

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.430
had the opportunity to grow in
the manner in which you have?

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.620
I mean, actually, it's
because of us, because

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.510
of the order we provided.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.350
You should be grateful.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:17.070
But in general, upstarts are
not grateful for the conditions

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:23.760
that the incumbent provided
And in general, the incumbent,

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.830
their entreaties don't end
up having that much impact.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.130
So think about this
as a general dynamic.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:33.720
Indeed, I even described
it in the book as--

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.890
if you can see--

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:39.210
this is a version of
hierarchical dominance systems

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:41.190
that you can see in
the animal kingdom.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:44.520
Take for example gorillas,
with an alpha gorilla,

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.850
who's the dominant,
and the want to be.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.834
You can even see in
families, as one child

00:12:50.834 --> 00:12:53.250
who's shorter than the other
one, all of a sudden sprouts.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.530
And pretty soon,
the taller child,

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.620
when they sit down at the
dinner table, talks more,

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.870
thinks he has more to say.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:03.420
Maybe even wants to discuss
whether the bedrooms have

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.899
been appropriately
allocated, who knows what.

00:13:05.899 --> 00:13:06.565
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:06.565 --> 00:13:10.980
- Well, first, I want to make
a comment about this track.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.990
I find it difficult,
because I don't know

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:17.100
how to pronounce that name.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.980
- You know, the Thucydides
trap that people talk about.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.800
- The so-called Thucydides trap.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.050
- The Thucydides trap.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.090
- Thucydides trap.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:27.360
- Thucydides trap.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.410
- Thucydides trap.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:29.680
- The Thucydides trap.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.769
[END PLAYBACK]

00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:33.060
GRAHAM ALLISON: OK, so, we
can have fun pronouncing it.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.250
We put up in conjunction
at the website,

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.530
look who's talking
about Thucydides

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:40.290
and the various ways in
which they mush it up.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.840
But this group is going
to be sophisticated.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.880
And when somebody
else is pausing

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.940
over the title of the book,
you tell them Thucydides.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.050
That's not hard to say--

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:50.330
Thucydides.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.210
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.730
- The committee meets today
to consider the nomination

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.340
of General James Mattis to
be the Secretary of Defense

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.990
of the United States.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:01.560
- I thank both Senator Nunn and
Senator Cohen for being here.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.810
- He's probably the only
one here at this table

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:07.410
who can hear the
words Thucydides trap

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.200
and not have to go to Wikipedia.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.150
- Of course, Secretary Cohen
has insulted every member

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.730
of this committee by suggesting
that we don't readily

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:15.750
understand that.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.440
- We're going to have to manage
that competition between us

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.090
and China.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:25.380
There's another piece
of wisdom from antiquity

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.110
that says fear,
honor, and interest

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.270
always seem to be
the root causes

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:34.007
of why a nation chooses
to go to hostilities.

00:14:34.007 --> 00:14:34.590
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.250
GRAHAM ALLISON: Well,
that's another hot line

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:37.670
from two Thucydides
"Peloponnesian

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:40.900
War," why do nations go to war?

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.960
Interests, fear,
honor, and respect,

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.760
that I should be given the
deference that I'm due.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.670
This idea, this concept, as I
published an article about it

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.820
about four years
ago, and then I've

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:58.330
been working on this book,
five years in the making--

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.580
Xi Jinping, the
President of China

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:04.120
is very interested in this
idea and argues about it

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.210
or discusses it often,
insisting, rightly,

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.810
that it's not necessary to
be caught in Thucydides trap.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:14.140
And President Obama has
opined on the subject as well.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.510
We're still waiting to see what
we hear from President Trump,

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:21.760
though his National Security
Adviser, H.R. McMaster, as well

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.070
as the Secretary of
Defense, Jim Mattis,

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:26.080
are quite familiar
with the idea.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.230
And I've actually
discussed it with them.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.370
So that's the basic idea.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:34.660
Thucydides trap, a
rising power threatens

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.850
to displace a ruling power.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:41.330
In general, bad things
happen, but not necessarily.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.300
So that's the big intro.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.820
Let me be very quick
about a little bit

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.190
on the rise of China, and
then a little bit more

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.020
about what to do.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.320
So go back to the
first question,

00:15:53.320 --> 00:16:00.310
the geopolitical event of your
lifetime, the rise of China.

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:04.210
So some of you will be
familiar with this bridge.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.920
I'm very familiar
with it since it

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.980
connects the Harvard Business
School and the Harvard Kennedy

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:12.220
School, and often
produces a traffic jam

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.770
that I've spent
too much time in.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:21.040
So renovation of this bridge
began, the discussion of it,

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.530
while I was still dean
at the Kennedy School.

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:27.010
I quit being dean in 1988.

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:30.360
The construction project
actually began in 2012.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.621
It was a two year project.

00:16:32.621 --> 00:16:34.870
Then it was announced to be
a three year project, then

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:35.810
a four year project.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.890
They've given up announcing
the completion date.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:43.990
So now if you go to the website,
it just says question mark.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.720
And it's already three
times over budget.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.770
There's a bridge in Beijing
that's called Sanyuan Bridge.

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.150
I've been across this bridge.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:56.170
Actually, I'll go cross it
next week when I'm in China.

00:16:56.170 --> 00:17:00.430
They began to renovate
this bridge in 2015.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.980
It's three times larger
than the Anderson Bridge.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:07.119
How long does it take to
complete the renovation?

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:10.040
Take a guess.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.310
How long?

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:14.640
How long?

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.490
How much?

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.450
43 hours.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:21.260
You can watch it.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.280
Go to YouTube.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.400
Forty three hours, and
see the timeline on it.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.890
Now, of course, they work
hard, and they work at night.

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:30.740
But if they would come and
fix the Anderson Bridge now,

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.170
I would pay.

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:36.470
And I think some of you
have seen the BU Bridge

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:39.320
or your own versions of this.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.830
So that's China.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:46.490
So a country that
in 1990, when you--

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:49.490
about when you were born,
or a few years after--

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:51.850
didn't appear on any
international league chart.

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:58.820
By 2014, it was declared
the largest economy

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:03.020
in the world by the best
yardstick for measuring

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.910
and comparing
national economies,

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:06.860
purchasing power parity.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.350
And on the current trajectory
will be half again larger

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:13.600
than the US in 2024.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.950
What?

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.220
This doesn't make any sense.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:21.410
So in my class at
Harvard, I give people

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:25.070
a quiz with 26 indicators.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.470
This is an abbreviated
version from the book.

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:30.220
So when will China
become number one?

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:36.680
Auto maker, trading nation,
middle class, billionaires,

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:41.709
fastest supercomputer,
AI, primary engine

00:18:41.709 --> 00:18:42.500
of economic growth.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.660
Generally, Harvard
students guessed

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:49.990
2040, 2050, not in my lifetime.

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:54.080
Then I give them a second
chart, which says already.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.840
Basically, all this
already happened.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.750
Vaclav Havel, who was the
President of the Czech

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:03.920
Republic, has a great line
that I quote in the book.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.850
He says things have happened
so fast that we have not yet

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:11.630
had time to be astonished.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:19.160
So if you have not seen China in
your face, you are not looking.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:25.210
If you haven't seen China
in your space, just wait.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:31.820
Because in every domain, the
Chinese people have awakened,

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.680
they are emerging.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.020
They're proud of
what they're doing.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:40.190
And all the lines about,
well, they can only copy,

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.970
I would say go look at
Alibaba's pay system.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.640
Only copies, I don't think so.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.740
Well, they can only--

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.030
go, take your line only,
and go look around.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:55.520
And it mainly is because I
think you haven't looked to see.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.890
This is extremely
creative people.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.590
I think they're emerging
with a lot of enthusiasm.

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:02.240
They're very hungry.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.030
And I think everywhere,
in every way,

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:08.090
you're going to see
the impact of China.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:12.290
So that puts me to the second
question that I started with,

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:15.050
what's the great geo
strategic challenge?

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:18.410
And it's the impact,
the impact, of the rise

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:22.580
of China on the US and
the international order.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.550
So I was testifying to the
Senate Armed Services Committee

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:26.390
about this.

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:31.280
A former student of mine is the
ranking Democrat, Jack Reed.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.440
And he said, you've got to
make this simple, very simple.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.830
So I sent him 10 pages.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.440
And he said, no, simple, simple.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.520
I sent him five pages.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:41.720
He said, nope.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.995
So I finally did a cartoon.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:49.820
So this is a seesaw.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:56.290
I imagine, this is now 2004.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:57.744
US is on one end of the seesaw.

00:20:57.744 --> 00:20:58.910
Chinese is on the other end.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:02.810
At this point, China's about
20% the size of the US.

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:08.180
2004, excuse me, you were
alive then, even awake, yeah?

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:12.320
2014, China is equal to the US.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.900
2024, substantially larger.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.260
So, basically, think of
the seesaw just moving.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:23.120
Now in the Obama administration,
the big debate about Asia,

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.520
and the thing that President
Obama features actually

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:30.530
in his swan song about what
was accomplished in the Obama

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:33.990
foreign policy, was the
so-called pivot to Asia.

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:35.270
You've heard about that.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:36.290
So go Google it.

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:38.660
The pivot to Asia
said we're putting

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.160
too much weight
on our left foot,

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.040
in the Middle East, where
we were fighting wars.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.290
And we need to
lighten there, to put

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:48.020
more weight on our right
foot, in Asia, where

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.210
the future's going to be.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:52.580
So there we were
trying to do this.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.260
And I say in the
book, and I think

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.510
this is correct, that all
the time we're arguing about

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:59.750
that, we don't seem to notice
that our feet have just

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:02.500
lifted off the ground.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.970
So this is a tectonic
shift in basically

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:08.100
the principal
substructure of power

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.040
in the World, economic power.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.600
It's not the only measure.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.230
I give you a number of
other measures in the book.

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:15.720
So that's been happening.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:22.020
And the impact of that on
China, as it emerges and feels

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:27.450
its oats, and the US, as
we think, wait a minute,

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:30.840
we are the dominant
power in the world.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.580
We have provided the
international order.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.970
The international
rule-based order

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:38.670
has provided seven
decades of peace.

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:42.750
China should take its place
in this and be comfortable.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.190
That's what we say.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:47.220
But the Chinese
say, excuse me, we

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:48.960
have something to
say about this.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.990
We were not consulted when
these rules were written.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.690
We didn't set the
set of arrangements.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:57.480
So just to conclude
here, as we see

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.500
the impact of the rise
of China on the US,

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:05.250
the place where this comes the
closest to coming to a head

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:08.880
is in North Korea today.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.372
So if I were picking a
path from here to war--

00:23:12.372 --> 00:23:13.830
I have a chapter
in the book called

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.920
"From Here to War,
Five Scenarios"

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.010
to get from where we are
now to a war between--

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:22.800
with thousands of Americans and
Chinese killing each other--

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.730
with no leaps, only short
steps, step by step.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.820
But the one that's most
dangerous is North Korea.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.210
Most of you will
remember that Xi Jinping

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:39.240
met with President Trump in
Mar-a-Lago about six weeks ago.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.900
At that meeting the principal
message from President Trump

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:47.340
was North Korea is a threat
we are not going to tolerate

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:50.440
and you've got to
solve this problem.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.020
So what's the issue?

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.670
The issue is as follows.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:58.260
North Korea, this isolated
impoverished state,

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:02.610
will, in the months ahead,
not longer than a year or two,

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:06.900
for sure, test an
ICBM that will allow

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.680
it to deliver a nuclear warhead
against San Francisco or Los

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.780
Angeles.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.940
That's hard to believe,
but that's a fact.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.330
North Korea already can
deliver a nuclear warhead

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:20.340
against Japan.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.710
North Korea can already
delivered a nuclear warhead

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:24.150
against South Korea.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:26.040
So that's already happened.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.990
That's already a fact.

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:30.420
So in the months
ahead, it's going

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.805
to conduct tests that
will allow it to deliver,

00:24:32.805 --> 00:24:37.700
or it's somehow going
to be interrupted.

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.800
So when President Trump
first heard of this,

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.220
it was in the handoff
between President Obama

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:43.800
and President-Elect Trump.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.840
Trump said I never heard
of this before in my life.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.460
And the answer, most
Americans haven't.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.150
But Obama said, I'm
sorry, but that's

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:54.610
the facts, that's the problem
you're going to have to face.

00:24:54.610 --> 00:25:00.460
Trump went out immediately and
tweeted not going to happen.

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.350
Maybe Obama let
these things happen,

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.000
and maybe Bush let
these things happen,

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.450
and maybe Clinton let these
things happen, but not Trump.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.660
This is not going to happen.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:14.720
And every day since then, he's
been saying and repeating.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.240
So at the Mar-a-Lago summit,
what he said to Xi Jinping was

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.260
you can solve this problem.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.550
But if you don't
solve this problem,

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:26.660
I can solve this problem.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:30.750
But if I do, you're
not going to like it.

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:34.760
And then he served chocolate
cake at the opening dinner,

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.550
excused himself, and
went out and announced

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:41.450
that the US had launched 50
cruise missiles against Syria,

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:44.450
just in case you
missed the point.

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:50.030
So can the US deliver cruise
missiles against North Korea

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:52.700
to prevent it conducting
tests that could launch ICBMs?

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.230
Absolutely.

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:55.490
Can we do that successfully?

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:57.000
No question about it.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
The question is what does
North Korea do in response?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
And the most likely response
would be an attack on Seoul.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.700
They'd kill a million
people in 24 or 48 hours.

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.700
Whereupon, the US will
then, with South Korea,

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.760
destroy all the additional
artillery and rockets

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.520
that could kill even more
people in South Korea.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.370
Whereupon, we have
the second Korean War.

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:20.874
And most of you
probably don't even

00:26:20.874 --> 00:26:22.790
remember from your history
books what happened

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:23.960
in the first Korean War.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:27.950
In the first Korean War,
the US was marching rapidly

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:31.970
towards China's border,
going to unify the country

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:33.920
under South Korea's control.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.190
The Chinese entered the
world, beat the US back down

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:39.480
the peninsula to
the 38th parallel,

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.740
which is the
dividing line today.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.450
And in that war, thousands
of Americans and thousands

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:46.400
of Chinese died.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.560
So could we see a
second Korean War?

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.660
I think, God forbid, we could.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:55.490
Now could you imagine, the
US and China, Trump and Xi,

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:58.190
sitting down and saying let's
be adults and figure out

00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:59.390
a solution to this problem?

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:00.890
I think you could.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:04.100
But this problem arises in
the context of this Thucydides

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.714
dynamic, in which, because
we look at the Chinese

00:27:08.714 --> 00:27:10.130
and think really
what they want is

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:12.120
for us to just be out of here.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.680
And that is what they want.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.270
I mean, I spent two days doing
a post-mortem on Mar-a-Lago

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:19.490
with some of the Chinese
and some of the Americans

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:20.410
who were there.

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:23.120
And they said if
you were not there,

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.400
we wouldn't have this problem.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.400
So just leave.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.960
And we say, wait a minute.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.210
South Korea is one of the
most successful countries

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:33.590
in the world.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:35.390
South Korea is a
poster child of what we

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:37.550
are hoping to see in the world.

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:38.910
South Korea is a democracy.

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:41.390
South Korea is a market economy.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:44.160
South Korea has the 13th
largest economy in the world.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.680
It's a fantastic success story.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.690
We're not going anywhere.

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:51.830
This is part of the order
that's the order of Asia.

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:53.755
And if we were to
walk away from there,

00:27:53.755 --> 00:27:56.255
what's going to happen to the
whole international structure?

00:27:56.255 --> 00:27:59.780
So under those
conditions is zero trust.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.250
Everything, each
thing any party--

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:05.390
either of the parties
does is misinterpreted.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:07.010
So you try to do
something helpful,

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:09.440
and I think you have
an ulterior motive.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.500
And then external
events, like Kim Jong-un

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:16.760
deciding to launch a
missile, it triggers a set

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.680
of actions and reactions
that get people

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.360
to where they don't want to go.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.330
So to conclude, what
is the big idea?

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:26.560
Big idea, Thucydides' trap.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.190
Rising power
threatens to displace

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:32.510
ruling power, basically
serious structural stress that

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:36.890
allows external events,
or external actors, who

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:40.160
would otherwise be
inconsequential or easily

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:45.440
manageable to trigger cascades
of consequences that get you

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.090
to places you don't want to go.

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:49.370
And the big takeaway
from this is

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:54.830
we should be serious about
avoiding preventable wars.

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:55.850
If this war happens--

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:58.340
I pray it won't-- but if a
war between the US and China

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:03.590
happens in your lifetime, it
will not be because of the iron

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:04.640
laws of history.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:08.150
It will be because of
mistakes that people made.

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:09.620
And because of
mistakes that they

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.260
make that they
could have avoided.

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.730
So the object of
the book is to try

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:19.430
to help stimulate a great debate
about what we should be doing

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:22.850
in a more imaginative fashion
to get beyond the business as

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:25.580
usual, which is how I
characterize what we have been

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.500
doing for the last 20 years.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.730
So that's once over lightly.

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:35.240
I'm happy to take the arguments
and discussions on all topics.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.670
AUDIENCE: It seems like
it's easiest to get concrete

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:39.300
around a specific scenario.

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:42.860
So it's valuable for you to
have brought up the possibility

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.740
of a second Korean War.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:48.740
The first Korean War,
as you described it,

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:52.820
with China having
entered it, and being

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:55.080
many Americans
and Chinese dying,

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:59.310
that was not due to
Thucydides' trap, right?

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:02.300
GRAHAM ALLISON: It's just
another war for another set

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.560
of dynamics, yes.

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:07.690
AUDIENCE: So it seems like
there's nothing that--

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:10.790
the motives would be similar
if it were to happen again.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:13.400
And it's not related
to the fact that China

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.440
is a growing power, right?

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:19.880
If the scenario played out
as you say as you said,

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.830
that's not because
they're a growing

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:24.390
power and they think they need
to change the world order.

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:26.810
It's just territorial
issues, the same

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:29.276
as it would be in the
first Korean War, right?

00:30:29.276 --> 00:30:30.650
GRAHAM ALLISON:
Well, yes and no.

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:33.900
So I would say it certainly
is a very good question.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.370
So in the first case--

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:37.947
just again, for people
that don't remember,

00:30:37.947 --> 00:30:39.530
and you obviously
have read about it--

00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:45.680
but, basically, in
1950, North Korea

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.280
attacked South Korea,
just out of the blue.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.200
That the country was divided
where it is currently.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.490
North Korea attacked
South Korea,

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:56.780
and almost captured
the whole peninsula.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:00.080
Americans came to the rescue
at the very last minute.

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.830
MacArthur was in Japan
with a division of troops,

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:07.050
because this was just five years
after the end of World War II.

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:10.370
The American troops pushed
the North Koreans right back

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:14.000
up the peninsula and across
the 38th parallel, which

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.280
is the dividing line today,
as it had been before,

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.420
and were rapidly approaching
the Chinese border.

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:23.150
The Americans thought
it was inconceivable

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:28.010
that China, which Mao was just
barely consolidating control

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:30.800
of China after a
long civil war, would

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.540
think of attacking the US.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.840
The US was the world supremo.

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:37.280
Five years earlier, we
had dropped atomic bombs

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:41.450
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, just
next door, to end World War II.

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:44.930
So the idea that some little
country, 150th our size,

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:47.000
would attack us
was inconceivable.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.400
They did, and lo and
behold, as I said,

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.200
they beat us and
pushed us back down.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.410
That had nothing to do with any
Thucydides dynamic, for sure,

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:55.910
for sure.

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:59.720
In this case, if I
imagine we didn't

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.720
have that Thucydides
dynamic, which

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:07.160
creates such a degree of
mistrust, and misunderstanding,

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:13.070
and makes it so difficult
for adult behavior,

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:16.250
I believe that we could,
China and America,

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:19.470
resolve the North Korean
problem fairly easily.

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:23.390
So in the book, I even try to
imagine an adult supervisor.

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:26.250
I do this in my class at
Harvard from time to time.

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:29.050
I say, remember in
international relations,

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:32.440
there are no adult supervisors.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.750
This is a jungle.

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:38.070
So there's nobody superior to
Donald Trump and Xi Jinping.

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:41.640
Nobody that can just
say guys, hello.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.000
But let's imagine there were.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.240
So there's a
Martian strategists,

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:49.144
and she parachutes
down to Mar-a-Lago,

00:32:49.144 --> 00:32:51.310
and sits down, and says
guys, sit down for a minute.

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:54.250
I'm just going to
tell you a few things.

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:58.410
She could easily say this
problem can be solved.

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:01.270
This is this little
pipsqueak country.

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:03.910
It's going to drag the
two of you into a war?

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:06.670
This would be stupid,
I mean really stupid.

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:09.730
Now, you would have to
stand back a little bit.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:11.980
You probably would have to
adjust some things that you

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:15.520
would otherwise imagine
you want to hold onto,

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.920
but let's talk about
ways of solving this.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.990
So if this was
Britain and the US,

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:22.920
and the problem was
created by Ireland,

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.880
this would be easily solved.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:29.260
But in the cases in which you
have a Thucydides dynamic,

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:33.790
external events are able to
have this exaggerated impact.

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:34.730
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:36.040
GRAHAM ALLISON: Please, sir.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.540
AUDIENCE: Your
book and your talk

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:40.660
raises a whole set of
issues around China

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:43.030
and the US as actors.

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:46.030
And one view is to think
of those issues assuming

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.600
that China and the US are
each monolithic actors.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.280
I want to offer you a whole
collection of new issues,

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.770
and let you take a pick
of which ones to tackle,

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:56.320
that drill down a layer.

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.150
The US is not monolithic.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:33:59.770
There's multiple power centers.

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:02.710
There's multiple political
divisions and personalities,

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:03.670
individually.

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:06.400
I don't know about China, but
I assume there's something

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.409
below the surface there.

00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:10.300
When you talk about
we can solve this,

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.776
we can learn the lessons
of history, who are the we?

00:34:13.776 --> 00:34:14.900
What are the power centers?

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.510
Who needs to be educated?

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:19.750
And when you look at your
table of 16 cases of which

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:21.820
went to war, and
which did not, what

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.489
do we learn about the dynamics
of the internal politics

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:25.989
and powers of those
nations and how

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:28.803
they contribute to the outcome?

00:34:28.803 --> 00:34:30.219
GRAHAM ALLISON:
You see me smiling

00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:35.260
because actually the
first book I ever wrote

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:37.639
called "Essence of Decision:
Explaining the Cuban Missile

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:40.929
Crises," which some of you
probably have looked at,

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:44.620
makes up this argument
that while mostly we

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:46.570
think about
international relations

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:49.960
as if it were a game
between two monolithic chess

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:53.199
players, or billiard
balls, it's sometimes said,

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:56.830
that in fact
desegregating the actors

00:34:56.830 --> 00:35:00.460
to the large organizations
of which they're components,

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:04.510
or even in a third frame that
I offer, desegregating them

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:07.805
into the individual human beings
who are players, who may have

00:35:07.805 --> 00:35:12.610
quite contrary views, are
also necessary if you're

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.440
going to try to
understand the actions

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.720
of this so-called monolith.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:20.560
So this book has model one,
model two, and model three,

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:22.720
and shows how by using
them, you can better

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.600
understand what happened in
the Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.397
So in this case, I love the
idea of taking them and working

00:35:29.397 --> 00:35:29.980
your way down.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.150
The book does not do that.

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:35.650
It says-- again the book
would not be 270 pages,

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:38.960
it would be considerably longer.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:44.200
But in the case of
the US, obviously it

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.470
matters a whole lot who is
the president, because he's

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:50.630
the biggest player and gets
the biggest set of choices.

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:54.145
So if I go back to the
Cuban Missile Crisis

00:35:54.145 --> 00:35:56.560
just for that
analog, John Kennedy

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.560
was president in his first--

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:03.340
in April of 1961, four
months into office.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:06.300
He authorized an
invasion of Cuba,

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:10.090
this so-called Bay of Pigs,
which was catastrophic.

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:14.050
A bunch of Cuban
refugees trained by CIA

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:18.430
and was CIA instructors
invaded Cuba and were captured.

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:20.770
And it was a total mess.

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:24.070
A year and a half later, in
the Cuban Missile Crisis,

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:27.070
when the US found the
Soviet Union installing

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:30.130
nuclear tipped
missiles in Cuba, he

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:33.490
conducted an exercise,
which was still

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:39.430
one of the great performances
and brilliant imaginative type

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:40.870
diplomacy.

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:45.730
But if the Kennedy
of the first year--

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:49.000
if the Cuban Missile Crisis had
occurred in John F. Kennedy's

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.790
first year, there's
no question whatever

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:54.970
we would have gone to nuclear
war with the Soviet Union.

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:58.350
Because a novice,
even a novice who's

00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:02.100
been a senator, trying to
operate the US government

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.150
doesn't really understand
how things work.

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:06.690
Now, in the case
of Trump, you have

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:11.490
a person who doesn't know
anything about the government

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:15.610
before, and having to learn
entirely new situations.

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:17.160
I say you have him.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:20.860
Then you have the principal
players around him.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.520
And I think there's a lot
of comfort in the fact

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.280
that in H.R. McMaster,
the National Security

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:29.460
Adviser, you've got a
seasoned professional who's

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.820
very independent minded,
and Jim Mattis, who

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:37.260
we saw in the video, you've
got a seasoned warrior, who's

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.650
very professional.

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:40.650
In Tillerson,
you've got a person

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:43.320
who's got a significant
international vision.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.540
So they're are also players.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.895
You then have the
military establishment.

00:37:47.895 --> 00:37:50.760
The military establishment
has developed capabilities

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.410
that are just magical.

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:54.180
I'm a Defense Department type.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:58.890
So the US has the
finest military

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:00.750
that the world has ever seen.

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:04.140
Any target, anywhere in the
world that Google can find,

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:05.400
we can destroy.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.410
And actually, we
can do a better job

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:11.450
than that in terms
of the coordinates.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:13.230
So that's for destroying things.

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:17.640
So we have a whole
toolbox of hammers,

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.460
and we can nail any target.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:23.580
Unfortunately, most of the
problems in the world cannot be

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.780
solved as if they were
a nail with a hammer.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.110
That's a problem.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:30.540
That's a problem when you
end up having your best

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:34.290
hope in the structure of
the government's decision

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:37.350
making military people, because
military people or defense

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:40.680
types come thinking look,
excuse me, we have hammers,

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.750
we need to find a nail.

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:44.970
So I would say that's
for desegregating

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:45.760
the US side of it.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:51.240
On the Chinese side, Xi Jinping,
If we just take the year ahead,

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:55.290
he is the Supremo in an
authoritarian system.

00:38:55.290 --> 00:39:01.050
But it's not totalitarian,
and not everything,

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:02.850
not all power runs through him.

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:05.700
His big idea this
year is getting

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:08.460
through what's called the
19th Party Congress, which

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:11.700
is an event that will occur
this fall, where he's going

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:15.000
to win a second term of
office, a second five-year term

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.080
as president.

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.630
But more importantly,
he's going to try

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:21.210
to put in place a
standing committee, which

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:23.640
are seven people
who were supposed

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:26.160
to be the collective
leadership, even though he's

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.420
pretty much excluded them now.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:32.820
And he's called the COE,
the Chief of Everything.

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:36.000
So he tries to run everything,
and all the power verticals

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.150
are going to him.

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:39.780
He's going to have a standing
committee, in which there

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:42.540
is no obvious successor.

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.750
So that he'll be able
to look at runway of 15

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:49.800
or even 20 years, because he
has an agenda that he thinks

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.540
is going to be that long to run.

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.000
So you would have
to desegregate that.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.730
You look at this, and you
say, in this structure,

00:39:56.730 --> 00:40:00.210
is there anybody who thinks
war on the Korean peninsula

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:00.960
is a good idea?

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:01.800
No.

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:02.790
Is this a good thing?

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:03.810
Yes.

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:06.030
So there's not one
person in China

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:08.370
who thinks war with
the US is a good idea.

00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:09.180
That's great.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.080
Nor in the US, with China.

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:14.420
So we could work our way
down this piece by piece,

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:17.160
and I'd be happy to
talk about it after,

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:20.700
because it's a topic that
excites my imagination.

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.500
But in this book,
I try to do it--

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.544
I just have to do it
at the first level.

00:40:25.544 --> 00:40:27.910
Please sir--

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:31.420
AUDIENCE: Not everybody at
Google was born after 1990.

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:34.020
GRAHAM ALLISON:
Thank goodness, yes.

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:40.420
Actually, I had Eric Schmidt
over visiting me a month ago,

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:44.380
and he said that yes,
there were a few stars that

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:48.430
were, not my age, but
in any case, your age.

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:52.210
AUDIENCE: So one thing that
bothers me, or has worried me

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:54.670
for a long time, is the
so-called long peace.

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:56.740
The fact that the
whole generation

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.270
that had any experience
at all with World War II

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:00.650
is pretty much gone.

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:04.120
So we have nobody left who
has any direct experience

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.560
with World War.

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:10.720
And just on the topic of
the American military magic,

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.180
you know one of the
wars of my lifetime

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:17.170
was the Vietnam War, where the
sense of American arrogance

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:20.050
about the capabilities
of the military

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:22.540
was pretty well shattered,
although we seem

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:26.200
to have lost a lot of those
lessons in Afghanistan, Iraq,

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.047
whatever.

00:41:28.047 --> 00:41:29.380
That's just a throwaway comment.

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:30.546
That's not my real question.

00:41:30.546 --> 00:41:33.340
My real question has to do
with nuclear weapons, actually.

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:37.930
And you know, I grew up during
the Cold War between the United

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:39.880
States and the Soviet Union.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.550
And by the way, the
key geopolitical event

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:44.740
of my lifetime before
the rise of China

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:46.750
was clearly the collapse
of the Soviet Union.

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:49.430
That is by far the
most important thing.

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:52.510
But I vividly remember
the Cuban Missile Crisis

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:57.040
and how frightening
it was to everybody.

00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:01.840
And how, you know, close we
actually came to nuclear war

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.040
at that time.

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:06.520
My sense though is that
throughout the Cold War,

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:09.310
mutually assured
destruction really did work.

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:10.700
Maybe you disagree with this.

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.720
You're an expert on
this subject, I'm not.

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.370
But really kind of
did work, in the sense

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:19.690
that whenever things got close
enough to really threaten

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:23.830
nuclear war, both sides
ultimately did back off.

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:28.150
And my sense is that it was
that understanding-- and again,

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:31.570
people at that time
knew about Hiroshima,

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:33.050
had been through that--

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:35.260
but that was the
understanding that this

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:38.020
would be the end of the world,
basically, at least the world

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.580
as we knew it.

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:44.680
So here's my question, in the
rising conflict between the US

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:49.210
and China, is there still a
sense that nuclear weapons

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:52.240
provide a sort of mutually
assured destruction

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:56.410
that could play a role
in keeping the lid on,

00:42:56.410 --> 00:43:00.250
so to speak, in terms of a new,
really, totally destructive

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:02.980
World War breaking out?

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:06.850
If it does, and if
we're not really likely

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:10.480
to see nuclear war develop
between the US and China,

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.820
although of course, North
Korea is a complete wildcard.

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:16.030
But if it does, then--

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:17.770
I haven't read your
book, you've said

00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:20.650
you have scenarios
advancing toward war--

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:23.140
what kind of war are
we looking at if it's

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:27.250
a war that will not be a
totally destructive nuclear war?

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:30.640
Is this going to be a
war that's a cyber war?

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:34.810
Or is it going to be a war
that's actually a military arms

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:35.434
war?

00:43:35.434 --> 00:43:36.600
GRAHAM ALLISON: I've got it.

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.779
Good, it's a great
question and I could go on

00:43:39.779 --> 00:43:40.820
for a long time about it.

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:44.080
But given that we have a
number, let me try to be brief.

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:47.530
Your first point, just
your preface, I agree with.

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:50.740
Because it's been so long
since there has been a war,

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:54.640
and all the people who saw
great wars, basically are gone,

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:57.910
there's a temptation to think
wars have been consigned

00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:00.070
to the dustbin of history,
as I said, and therefore

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:01.350
complacency.

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:03.250
So complacency,
a very big worry.

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:05.710
Secondly, arrogance
in the US military

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:08.590
is absolutely,
absolutely a problem.

00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:11.170
And actually, in this
rise versus rule,

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:14.350
the rising power thinks our
forces are so great that nobody

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:15.550
can possibly challenge them.

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:18.910
We say, for example, you know,
China, my goodness, we've

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:20.410
been investing
five times as much

00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:23.090
as they have per year
for the last 25 years.

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:24.430
So they can't catch up.

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:28.390
But we failed to notice, you
don't have to play the game--

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:30.250
you don't have to replicate.

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:33.040
You can play it asymmetrically.

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:36.740
So I build a billion dollar,
multibillion dollar, carrier.

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:41.970
And you develop a million
dollar missile that can kill it.

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:43.720
So if you can play
million dollar missiles

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.790
against my billion
dollar carriers.

00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:49.930
China is not investing in
all of the legacy systems

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:52.480
that the US continues
building and buying.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.760
So I would say again,
there's a danger there.

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.400
But the fundamental question,
mutual assured destruction,

00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.590
the answer is yes.

00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:02.770
In the case of the US
and the Soviet Union,

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:05.680
the fact that once we had
each developed arsenals

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:10.480
so big that after you attack me
and do your best to disarm me,

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.750
I can still kill
you, that creates

00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:16.810
what's called mutually
assured destruction.

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:21.470
And that becomes a fundamental
fact about life for the two

00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:25.540
of us, if we keep it in
mind, and if we deal with it.

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:29.930
And that's now a fact, not just
in our relations with Russia,

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:31.960
but in our relations with China.

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:35.320
Now in the book, I
described this, as if--

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.750
in a grotesque analogy,
but if you think about it--

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:41.350
it's as if you and I
wake up tomorrow morning,

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:44.080
and we each have our
head, we have our arms,

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.810
but our backbone and
our respiratory systems

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:52.360
have been unified.

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.940
And we therefore
are Siamese twins.

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:59.320
And now you look at me and you
say, well, this guy is evil.

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:00.490
This guy is dangerous.

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:02.430
This guy is delirious.

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:06.840
This guy deserves
to be strangled.

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:11.610
But then you think about,
well, if I strangle him,

00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:14.560
in the next minute, I will
have committed suicide.

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:16.820
So it's like a suicide pact.

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:19.290
But one that you
can't get out of.

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:23.610
In that case, yes, indeed,
as in the Cold War,

00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:27.567
that creates a caution, even
a willingness to compromise.

00:46:27.567 --> 00:46:28.650
So that's on the one hand.

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:33.210
On the other hand,
that obtained in 1962.

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:37.440
In 1962, to prevent
the Soviet Union

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:40.620
from placing nuclear
tipped missiles in Cuba,

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:43.170
John Kennedy ran
what he thought was

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:46.710
a one in three
chance of nuclear war

00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:49.320
to prevent the
missiles being there.

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.180
Say what?

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:54.450
We took a chance of nuclear
war to prevent your adversary

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:56.150
from doing something.

00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:57.450
The answer is yes, I would.

00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:58.680
He did.

00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:00.810
So that's a fact.

00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:04.510
Under conditions of mutual
assured destruction,

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:10.850
can parties take risks that
don't have a certainty attached

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:15.240
to them, especially if the other
party is prepared to yield?

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.720
In fact, I discuss this a
little bit in the book about--

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:20.930
this is basically, if you
model it in game theory,

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:22.610
it's a chicken game.

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:26.030
If we both know that the
collision between the two cars

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:28.610
will be destruction,
then each of us

00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:31.430
have an incentive to swerve.

00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:34.340
And if I think you're more
likely to swerve than I am,

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:36.140
then I don't need to swerve.

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:39.710
And then under those
conditions, occasionally we

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:42.140
end up with a collision
that kills us all.

00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:44.870
So that's the path on this.

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:46.990
I think, was this
gentleman next?

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:48.414
Please--

00:47:48.414 --> 00:47:50.705
AUDIENCE: This is a slightly
more lighthearted comment.

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:56.910
I hadn't heard the name
Thucydides in a little while.

00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:59.420
And I went to the Wonder
Woman movie on Saturday,

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:02.270
and he gets name checked,
you know, very explicitly.

00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:04.475
You know, Wonder Woman
mentions his name.

00:48:04.475 --> 00:48:06.850
GRAHAM ALLISON: Oh, I didn't
know that, that's fantastic.

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:08.933
AUDIENCE: Yeah, he says--
somebody says, you know,

00:48:08.933 --> 00:48:11.060
peace is merely an
armistice in an endless war.

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.950
And she goes Thucydides.

00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:13.547
And so--

00:48:13.547 --> 00:48:14.630
GRAHAM ALLISON: Fantastic.

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:17.720
AUDIENCE: And so, just thinking
is there an opportunity for you

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:22.386
to capitalize on this new-found
publicity to maybe tie in--

00:48:22.386 --> 00:48:25.640
hey, you want to know more about
what Thucydides actually said--

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:29.150
GRAHAM ALLISON: You just sold
a ticket to Wonder Woman.

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:30.810
I'm going to go see.

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:32.060
And if we're going to be--

00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:35.390
in fact, here's a
request for any of you.

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:39.530
So I'm absolutely serious
about that set of ideas.

00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:42.050
I'm passionate about
the ideas in the book,

00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:44.960
about the danger that we
face and about the necessity

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:47.030
to recognize the
danger to motivate you

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:48.500
to doing something about.

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:51.110
So if you have any good
ideas, of which I've just

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:54.980
heard a great idea, for
trying to promote the book,

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:56.730
first if you can do it, do it.

00:48:56.730 --> 00:48:59.167
And if you have a suggestion
that somebody else can do it,

00:48:59.167 --> 00:48:59.750
send it to us.

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:01.874
So I've got this one, yes.

00:49:01.874 --> 00:49:02.540
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:07.190
GRAHAM ALLISON: Actually, at
the Silicon Valley last week,

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:10.040
a fellow who used to work for me
is a research assistant, who's

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:14.780
now the chief revenue officer
for Facebook, David Fisher,

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:18.120
said, gee, I have an idea
how Facebook can do this.

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.960
And I said, this
is way beyond me.

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.430
This is not my space.

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:23.870
So he's giving me six ideas.

00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:27.020
So please, I'm eager
for suggestions.

00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:28.760
If you can do it, just do it.

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:32.580
But if you have an idea that we
can do it, you know, I'm game.

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:34.520
Thanks, I didn't know that.

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:36.610
Now, I have new respect
for Wonder Woman.

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:38.169
Yes--

00:49:38.169 --> 00:49:39.460
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:40.810
A really interesting talk.

00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:44.092
I wanted to get your thoughts
on Ian Bremmer's theory of G0.

00:49:44.092 --> 00:49:45.550
I don't know if
you've heard of it?

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:46.010
GRAHAM ALLISON: Yes.

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:47.884
AUDIENCE: The basic idea
is that China is not

00:49:47.884 --> 00:49:50.090
interested in
being the new ruler

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:52.100
of the international
order, like the US was.

00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:53.450
Just wanted to get
your thoughts on that.

00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:54.783
GRAHAM ALLISON: Very good point.

00:49:54.783 --> 00:49:59.020
And in fact, Ian did
his podcast with me,

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:04.080
you know, he interviewed me for
his podcast, whenever it was.

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:07.947
Somewhere in this 13 day period,
so if you go to his thing,

00:50:07.947 --> 00:50:09.530
you'll see his back
and forth on this.

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:11.280
He likes this idea a lot.

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.800
I would say his idea is right.

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:17.160
China, there's no
evidence that China today

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:21.390
is thinking about replacing
the US as the global leader.

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:24.090
In fact, China has
been actually puzzled

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:26.460
by the extent to which
it has been pushed forth

00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:31.050
to be the global leader
by the American exit.

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:35.940
So at Davos this year,
the US had basically

00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:41.040
trashed the so-called TPP,
the Trans Pacific Partnership

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:43.020
and the global trading system.

00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:44.860
And Xi Jinping was
standing there.

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:47.130
And so people said,
well, you're the leader

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:52.170
of the Liberal economic order.

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:55.530
And he's looking, thinking,
wait a minute, this is me?

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:59.170
Then the spotlight comes
on, yeah, this is me.

00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:02.510
China is the most protectionist
economy in the world.

00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:05.710
China is the most mercantilistic
economy in the world.

00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:07.935
And here's Mrs. Merkel and
everybody else celebrating

00:51:07.935 --> 00:51:12.450
Xi Jinping as the leader of
this because the Americans just

00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:13.590
retreated from the field.

00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:17.190
So he will bask in
the-- and the same thing

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:18.120
in the climate space.

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:20.160
I would say that's even more so.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:24.360
I mean basically, China is
the number one greenhouse gas

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:25.300
emitter.

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:28.020
China does 70% of
its energy from coal.

00:51:32.112 --> 00:51:33.570
But if you want to
tell me that I'm

00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:36.370
the leader of the Green
Revolution, you know,

00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:37.260
that's OK with me.

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:42.720
So Mrs. Merkel and Xi were in
Germany a couple of weeks ago,

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:45.010
and she's saying, OK.

00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:48.180
But does China aspire
to be a global leader

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:50.610
in the sense of
playing a role the way

00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:54.320
the US has done in attempting
to manage affairs everywhere?

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:55.212
No.

00:51:55.212 --> 00:51:56.170
That's on the one hand.

00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:58.899
On the other hand, in
Asia, what about Asia?

00:51:58.899 --> 00:52:00.190
So in the book, I discuss this.

00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:04.140
So the world's premier China
watcher was Lee Kuan Yew.

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:06.660
Lee Kuan Yew was the founder
and builder of Singapore.

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:10.110
He took a little rock,
and by the end of--

00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:12.370
after a generation
of running it,

00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:15.230
it's wealthier per
capita than the US.

00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:16.810
So it's a fantastic megalopolis.

00:52:16.810 --> 00:52:18.210
Some of you have been there.

00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:19.800
It's an amazing society.

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:22.190
Now it's got six or
seven million people.

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:24.930
So Lee Kuan Yew spent a
lot of time studying China

00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:27.330
because he knows
Singapore survives

00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:29.040
at China's forbearance.

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.530
It's a big country
right beside it.

00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:34.620
And also, all of the leaders
of China since [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:37.620
Xiaoping, when they started
their march to the market,

00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:40.770
have consulted Lee
Kuan Yew as kind of--

00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:43.440
he's been the one
that led the way.

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:45.990
And Singapore's
looked like a model.

00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:49.180
So he's had thousands of hours
talking to Chinese leaders,

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:50.850
including Xi Jinping.

00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:54.180
And I asked him, and I
say this in the book,

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:56.220
are China's current
leaders, including

00:52:56.220 --> 00:53:00.420
Xi, serious about
displacing the US

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:04.920
as the predominant power in
Asia in the foreseeable future.

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.290
Now if you go read my old
professor, Henry Kissinger's

00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:11.610
book, you'll find in 700 pages,
it says it's complicated--

00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:14.540
on the one hand, on the
other hand, and so forth.

00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.440
Lee Kuan Yew-- of
course, why not?

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:18.090
Who could imagine otherwise?

00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:21.810
How could they not aspire
to be predominant in Asia?

00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:24.450
Indeed, if you look at the
Chinese narrative about what's

00:53:24.450 --> 00:53:27.900
going on, which has
some merit, they

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:32.130
say for 5,000 years we
were the dominant power.

00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:33.990
So they're line about
making China great

00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:38.160
again, they mean again,
just back to where we were.

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:41.160
There was this 200
year anomaly when

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:45.660
the Westerners came, and
invaded us, and imperialized us,

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:48.090
and exploited us.

00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:50.460
But that period is now over.

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:53.850
We are reemerging back
to where we were before.

00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:57.590
And as we reemerge, you're not
supposed to be where you are.

00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:00.090
You're not supposed to be the
arbiter of events in the South

00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:01.170
China Sea.

00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:03.780
Why should the US
Navy decide who

00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:07.570
can build an island,
who owns an island?

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:09.210
I mean, it's not--

00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:10.820
as I say in the book--

00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:14.010
one of my Chinese friends
says, go look at your map.

00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:17.130
Look what's adjacent
to the Chinese border.

00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:19.680
It's called South China Sea.

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.390
It's not called American Sea.

00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:23.850
This other one called
East China Sea.

00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:25.110
Why is it called that?

00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:28.360
Because Chinese
see Chinese seas.

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:29.700
That's our sea.

00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:32.350
That's like the
Caribbean is for us.

00:54:32.350 --> 00:54:35.400
And if you want even a more
shocking version of this,

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:37.830
I have a great chapter
in the book on what

00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:40.380
if Xi's China were just like us.

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:42.930
Americans love to lecture
other countries about why

00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:44.520
they should be more like us.

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:45.960
I've given this
lecture many times

00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:49.860
when I was working
for the US government.

00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:52.650
I imagine what if China
were just like the US,

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:57.510
who when we were emerging
into what Teddy Roosevelt was

00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:59.010
supremely confident
was going to be

00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:02.710
in American century, the
beginning of the 20th Century.

00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:06.850
And if you look and see what we
did, the idea that the Spanish

00:55:06.850 --> 00:55:09.910
were in Cuba.

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:12.420
He called that an abomination.

00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:15.940
On the first occasion we got,
when a mysterious explosion

00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:18.580
occurred on a ship
in the Havana Harbor,

00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:20.840
we declared war on Spain.

00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:22.000
And we beat them quickly.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.110
And we liberated Cuba.

00:55:23.110 --> 00:55:25.360
And we took Puerto Rico.

00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:28.239
And we took Guam
as a spoil of war.

00:55:28.239 --> 00:55:30.280
And a whole bunch of else
that follows from that.

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:33.699
So I would say watch
this space, yes.

00:55:33.699 --> 00:55:35.240
Let me take this
last one, and then I

00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.239
got to run because I'm
got to go to the airport.

00:55:37.239 --> 00:55:37.900
Please--

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:38.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much, first of all.

00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:39.950
It was extremely interesting.

00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:42.116
My one question, and I'm
going to try to phrase this

00:55:42.116 --> 00:55:43.242
in a positive light--

00:55:43.242 --> 00:55:44.200
GRAHAM ALLISON: Please.

00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:45.770
AUDIENCE: --is
around as you said,

00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:47.853
it's been business as usual
for the past 20 years,

00:55:47.853 --> 00:55:49.420
and business as
usual going forward

00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:52.344
would lead us to this, into
this trap, and this war.

00:55:52.344 --> 00:55:54.010
We could all probably
agree that there's

00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:59.230
nothing business as usual going
on right now with how President

00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:00.640
Trump is leading this country.

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:03.700
Is there an argument to be
made in a positive light

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:06.460
that maybe that is
what can break us out

00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:09.354
of leading down this
path and trying to take,

00:56:09.354 --> 00:56:11.020
like I said, this not
business as usual,

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:12.440
and moving in the
right direction?

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.440
GRAHAM ALLISON: Good, a
very good place to stop.

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:23.920
So let me-- so we're all
denizens of the Republic

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:27.400
of Cambridge, and we know
that like Manhattan, and DC,

00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:31.510
and the blue coast, and the
West Coast, 95% of people

00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:34.600
voted for Hillary, and
Trump was hardly imaginable.

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.960
But, you know, God works
in mysterious ways.

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.200
I'm ultimately an optimist.

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:41.830
So I like the question.

00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:43.450
So this is now a fact.

00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:46.720
This is the Mar-a-Lago summit.

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:50.590
Trump did something no
president has ever even imagined

00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:51.730
and done.

00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:57.320
And that was so amazing that
he blew Xi Jinping right away.

00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:59.590
So in the Chinese
tradition, they

00:56:59.590 --> 00:57:02.830
think of the emperor as God.

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:06.460
And foreigners, when you
approach the emperor,

00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:08.500
you have to get on your--

00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:11.170
flat on the ground, with
your head on the ground,

00:57:11.170 --> 00:57:12.550
showing your respect.

00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:16.210
That's what it is to
show proper respect.

00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:17.840
Again, nobody does that now.

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:22.660
But how would you respect the
emperor that is his stand in,

00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:25.970
President Xi Jinping,
and his wife today?

00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:29.410
So Trump had his
granddaughter, she's

00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:33.550
standing there, Arabella,
she's five years old.

00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:39.160
Xi Jinping's wife is a famous
singer in China, very famous.

00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:42.400
And her signature song
is "Jasmine," which

00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:44.290
is a very famous Chinese song.

00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:51.250
So Arabella sang
"Jasmine" in Mandarin--

00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:53.045
excuse me, in Mandarin.

00:57:53.045 --> 00:57:55.600
And Xi Jinping, you can
see him and his wife

00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:59.860
looking at it, thinking Holy
Moses, where have we come?

00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:01.540
What is going on?

00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:04.360
After that, Trump
had him, absolutely,

00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:08.050
in terms of just kind
of consciousness.

00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:12.130
So if you could be that
imaginative in trying

00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:14.940
to deal with the North
Korean problem, that

00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:18.830
could be finished in a second,
in a second, wouldn't be in it.

00:58:18.830 --> 00:58:21.190
So it is perfectly
possible, perfectly

00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:24.810
possible that Trump is
certainly unorthodox.

00:58:24.810 --> 00:58:27.030
And if you're trying
to get beyond the box,

00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:28.660
and you're trying
to be optimistic.

00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:31.890
So I would say that's
probably a good place to stop.

00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:33.670
Thank you.
