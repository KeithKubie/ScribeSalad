00:00:00.102 --> 00:00:00.935
- Hey everyone.

00:00:00.935 --> 00:00:01.909
I hope you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:02.742
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:02.742 --> 00:00:03.612
I'm in Bangkok, Thailand.

00:00:03.612 --> 00:00:05.078
I'm handing with my friend, Drew,

00:00:05.078 --> 00:00:06.558
- Hey, guys. How you doing?

00:00:06.558 --> 00:00:08.571
And today we are in Silom, which is,

00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:10.975
It's one of the main downtown financial

00:00:10.975 --> 00:00:14.323
districts of Bangkok. Full
of sky rise office buildings,

00:00:14.323 --> 00:00:17.578
and, so, at lunchtime,
just floods of people

00:00:17.578 --> 00:00:19.366
come here to eat street food.

00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.662
And so, we thought it
would be a lot of fun to

00:00:21.662 --> 00:00:24.864
take you today on a Silom, Thai,

00:00:24.864 --> 00:00:26.878
streetfood, lunch tour of Bangkok.

00:00:26.878 --> 00:00:28.672
We're not even sure exactly
what we're gonna eat,

00:00:28.672 --> 00:00:30.584
but we're just gonna go
to some of the popular,

00:00:30.584 --> 00:00:33.053
famous, stalls, and share it all with you

00:00:33.053 --> 00:00:33.886
in this video.

00:00:33.886 --> 00:00:36.625
(traffic sounds)

00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:37.600
That was okay.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.591
- Could have been better.
- It was okay.

00:00:38.591 --> 00:00:41.508
(electronic music)

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.346
- (Speaking in Thai) Okay.

00:00:53.346 --> 00:00:57.049
Okay, the first place we're
stopping is called [Store]

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:58.105
Hey, what's up, man?

00:00:58.105 --> 00:00:59.096
- Mark Wiens!

00:00:59.096 --> 00:01:00.751
- (laughing)
- What's going on, brother?

00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:01.636
- [Mark] What's up, man?

00:01:01.636 --> 00:01:02.469
- Oh man, I watch ...

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:03.302
I watch all your food videos, man.

00:01:03.302 --> 00:01:05.498
That's so crazy to see you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:07.202
- I'm having a little
trouble reading the font

00:01:07.202 --> 00:01:08.305
of this Khao Man Gai spot,

00:01:08.305 --> 00:01:09.819
but it's a chicken and rice spot called

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:11.701
"Khao Man Gai Ban Deed Kim."

00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:14.498
It's right in the heart of Saladang.

00:01:14.498 --> 00:01:15.717
Right on [Street].

00:01:15.717 --> 00:01:18.968
If you have gotten off the
BTS at Saladang station

00:01:18.968 --> 00:01:19.941
and walked down this road,

00:01:19.941 --> 00:01:22.717
there's no doubt that you
have passed by this stall

00:01:22.717 --> 00:01:23.836
many, many, times.

00:01:23.836 --> 00:01:27.348
We're here before lunch,
it's just after 10:30 AM,

00:01:27.348 --> 00:01:29.089
so it's not very full yet.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:30.613
But if you come here ... Drew, man-

00:01:30.613 --> 00:01:32.181
If you're here right at noon,

00:01:32.181 --> 00:01:34.204
these tables will just be packed.

00:01:34.204 --> 00:01:35.490
And the good thing is we're here early,

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.809
so we can get a couple meals in

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:39.570
before the main lunch rush arrives.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.472
So, we're gonna have
chicken and rice first.

00:01:41.472 --> 00:01:42.305
- Yes, sir.

00:01:42.305 --> 00:01:43.562
- You're ready?
- Yes, man. Let's do it.

00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:46.115
- (speaking Thai)
(grunts)

00:01:46.115 --> 00:01:48.500
- [Mark] Oy. (laughs)

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.377
(knife hitting chopping block)

00:01:52.377 --> 00:01:55.044
(speaking Thai)

00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:02.011
(chair being pulled)

00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:03.396
- [Mark] Alright. Cool.

00:02:03.396 --> 00:02:04.694
- [Drew] Yeah. Looks good, man.

00:02:04.694 --> 00:02:06.965
- Yeah. As soon as you
order- Maybe we're a little-

00:02:06.965 --> 00:02:09.294
We're on a little bit
of a wobbly table, here.

00:02:09.294 --> 00:02:10.905
- [Mark] 'Khao' means "rice",

00:02:10.905 --> 00:02:13.738
'Man' is like the fat, or the oil,

00:02:14.826 --> 00:02:16.470
and then 'Gai' is "chicken".

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.023
So you have "Khao Man Gai",
"Chicken Rice" that is

00:02:18.023 --> 00:02:19.478
exactly chicken rice.
- Sure.

00:02:19.478 --> 00:02:20.597
- [Mark] And then there's always sauce.

00:02:20.597 --> 00:02:21.676
You have to have sauce.

00:02:21.676 --> 00:02:22.667
- [Drew] And we just watched a guy

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:23.749
chop the chicken in the back,

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:25.404
and you know- he really dissects it

00:02:25.404 --> 00:02:26.835
at a perfect angle every time.

00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:27.668
- [Mark] They also sort of

00:02:27.668 --> 00:02:29.518
flatten it with the knife,
- [Drew] Right.

00:02:29.518 --> 00:02:32.515
so that it ... Yeah, it
just fits beautifully

00:02:32.515 --> 00:02:33.879
over your plate of rice.
- Yep.

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:34.712
- [Mark] Before we try the sauce,

00:02:34.712 --> 00:02:35.741
let's just try a bite of the rice,

00:02:35.741 --> 00:02:37.500
'cause either rice has got to be fragrant.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.843
You can see that it's
just kind of glistening.

00:02:39.843 --> 00:02:40.676
Cheers.

00:02:43.732 --> 00:02:45.278
- (humming)
- (humming)

00:02:45.278 --> 00:02:46.777
- Garlic-y. Right?

00:02:46.777 --> 00:02:47.873
- It is, yeah.

00:02:47.873 --> 00:02:49.981
I like the rice. It's very fluffy.

00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:51.216
- It's delicious, man.

00:02:51.216 --> 00:02:53.175
- And it is very fragrant.

00:02:53.175 --> 00:02:55.900
And you can feel each
individual grain of rice

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.163
because it's so fluffy.

00:02:57.163 --> 00:02:58.080
Then, you got the chicken,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.324
which is actually
almost... It's very moist.

00:03:01.324 --> 00:03:02.157
Very succulent chicken.

00:03:02.157 --> 00:03:06.515
(traffic and people speaking)

00:03:06.515 --> 00:03:07.563
- That chicken's so soft.

00:03:07.563 --> 00:03:08.518
- It's time to sauce.

00:03:08.518 --> 00:03:10.120
I believe there's some
[Sauce Name] in here

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.216
from what I can smell.

00:03:11.216 --> 00:03:12.616
It's fermented soy beans,

00:03:12.616 --> 00:03:15.398
but then there's also
ginger and chilies in here.

00:03:15.398 --> 00:03:18.320
It really is all about the sauce.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.961
I mean, the chicken
and rice are excellent,

00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:21.778
but the sauce is almost drinkable.

00:03:21.778 --> 00:03:26.217
And you can see the
shredded ginger in there.

00:03:26.217 --> 00:03:29.299
Let me get a nice, good, giant,

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.966
bite to just maximize the sauce.

00:03:35.743 --> 00:03:38.469
- That sauce. Addicting, that flavor.

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.264
- [Mark] It's the fermented
soy beans, which make up

00:03:41.264 --> 00:03:42.392
most of that flavor.
- [Drew] Right.

00:03:42.392 --> 00:03:44.397
But that gives it such a depth of flavor.

00:03:44.397 --> 00:03:45.779
Then, you've got the ginger in there.

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:47.276
- The ginger kind of kicks in after.

00:03:47.276 --> 00:03:49.094
When you said, then I started tasting it,

00:03:49.094 --> 00:03:51.381
but the first taste is not ginger.

00:03:51.381 --> 00:03:52.728
- So, they only add a little bit of ginger

00:03:52.728 --> 00:03:54.306
to the actual sauce.

00:03:54.306 --> 00:03:56.705
That's why there's an entire bowl full of

00:03:56.705 --> 00:04:00.771
extra ginger for people
like us that need it.

00:04:00.771 --> 00:04:03.311
And the, of course, chopped chilis.

00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:07.394
Okay. That should be good
for the next few bites.

00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:10.014
Maybe a little bit of extra sauce on there

00:04:10.014 --> 00:04:12.847
for extra good measure, of course.

00:04:14.105 --> 00:04:17.226
Oh, and that is a perfect bite.

00:04:17.226 --> 00:04:21.643
(traffic sounds and people speaking)

00:04:23.692 --> 00:04:25.859
(humming)

00:04:26.777 --> 00:04:28.181
- With that extra ginger.
- Yeah.

00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:30.864
- [Mark] But even the
ginger is not that pungent,

00:04:30.864 --> 00:04:32.143
'cause I believe that it's young ginger.

00:04:32.143 --> 00:04:33.614
- You can tell if it's young or old?

00:04:33.614 --> 00:04:34.447
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:34.447 --> 00:04:35.690
- That's experience, guys.
- Oh, yeah.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.525
He knows if it's young or old ginger.

00:04:37.525 --> 00:04:40.136
- [Mark] Younger ginger is more juicy

00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:41.645
and a little bit sweeter.

00:04:41.645 --> 00:04:43.467
Then, the final component
to Khao Man Gai is

00:04:43.467 --> 00:04:44.332
the chicken soup.

00:04:44.332 --> 00:04:46.060
And there's some winter
melon in here, too.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.727
Okay, I'll eat the winter melon.

00:04:52.528 --> 00:04:54.666
(hums) Yeah, chicken soup is nice.

00:04:54.666 --> 00:04:56.942
That winter melon just actually dissolves

00:04:56.942 --> 00:05:01.942
right down your throat.
(electronic music)

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.413
( traffic sounds)

00:05:06.602 --> 00:05:07.450
- [Mark] That was a great way

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.165
to begin.
- [Drew] Yeah, dude.

00:05:09.165 --> 00:05:10.671
- [Drew] Good little
appetizer for the day.

00:05:10.671 --> 00:05:13.477
- We're gonna move on
now to the next spot,

00:05:13.477 --> 00:05:16.097
which is just down the road,

00:05:16.097 --> 00:05:18.393
and hopefully they're open.

00:05:18.393 --> 00:05:21.132
( people speaking and traffic noises)

00:05:21.132 --> 00:05:22.332
- [Mark] It's now 11 AM,

00:05:22.332 --> 00:05:24.251
so a lot of carts are starting to set up.

00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:27.401
Street food is starting to set
up for the main lunch rush.

00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:28.795
I think we can fit two lunches in

00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:30.513
before the main lunch.
- Absolutely.

00:05:30.513 --> 00:05:31.598
Before the real lunch.

00:05:31.598 --> 00:05:33.163
- Absolutely. I'm looking forward to it.

00:05:33.163 --> 00:05:34.699
- We're getting a head start.

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.656
(traffic sounds)

00:05:36.656 --> 00:05:38.296
- [Mark] Passing by this place,

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:40.427
it's called [Store Name].

00:05:40.427 --> 00:05:42.879
This is one of my absolute favorite places

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:44.793
for green papaya salad.

00:05:44.793 --> 00:05:46.853
- That's one of the best.
- Oh, my favorite.

00:05:46.853 --> 00:05:49.770
(electronic music)

00:05:53.025 --> 00:05:55.945
- We walked almost- it's almost to Satun,

00:05:55.945 --> 00:05:58.416
which is the adjacent business,

00:05:58.416 --> 00:05:59.844
financial district of Bangkok.

00:05:59.844 --> 00:06:03.437
But we just made it to the
spot, this is the place.

00:06:03.437 --> 00:06:06.650
- Alright, Drew. Oh, cool. They have these

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.003
stands for the chair.
- Oh, yeah.

00:06:08.003 --> 00:06:09.102
Look, they have your chair

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:10.838
standing up there.
- Whoa.

00:06:10.838 --> 00:06:11.855
- Never seen that before.

00:06:11.855 --> 00:06:15.772
- [Waitress] (speaking in Thai)

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:19.842
- (speaking in Thai)

00:06:22.477 --> 00:06:23.473
Awesome.

00:06:23.473 --> 00:06:24.306
(laugh)

00:06:24.306 --> 00:06:25.139
- What just happened?

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.053
(laughing)

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.281
- So, we just decided to get beef ...

00:06:29.281 --> 00:06:31.268
(speaking in Thai)

00:06:31.268 --> 00:06:34.387
We decided to get beef
soup with everything.

00:06:34.387 --> 00:06:37.533
There's meatballs,
there's the braised beef,

00:06:37.533 --> 00:06:42.237
there is probably some
organs, there is tendon.

00:06:42.237 --> 00:06:46.004
(people speaking in Thai)

00:06:46.004 --> 00:06:47.673
- When we ordered a mix of everything,

00:06:47.673 --> 00:06:49.862
it means all the meats, all the beef.

00:06:49.862 --> 00:06:52.492
What he does is he takes
the basket strainer,

00:06:52.492 --> 00:06:56.315
which is the boiler, he
grabs some of the fresh beef,

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:59.616
there's some liver there.
There is some tripe.

00:06:59.616 --> 00:07:02.879
He sticks it in the basket,
then he blanches it real fast,

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:05.980
just a quick blanche, and
dunks it into that hot

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.026
beef soup. It's so aromatic.

00:07:08.026 --> 00:07:11.102
Then, he takes some of the
pre-cooked braised beef,

00:07:11.102 --> 00:07:14.353
which is sort of like
brisket-y, brisket-y meat.

00:07:14.353 --> 00:07:15.714
Just blanches that real fast,

00:07:15.714 --> 00:07:17.125
sticks it into your bowl.

00:07:17.125 --> 00:07:19.092
Then, add some of the soup into the bowl,

00:07:19.092 --> 00:07:21.428
then finally finishes off with some of the

00:07:21.428 --> 00:07:24.168
fried garlic, and a sprinkle of pepper.

00:07:24.168 --> 00:07:25.001
- So excited

00:07:25.001 --> 00:07:26.203
- (laughs) You ready to go eat it?

00:07:26.203 --> 00:07:27.036
- Yeah.

00:07:27.036 --> 00:07:27.869
- Okay. Let's go back to our chairs.

00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:28.877
- [Drew] That smells delicious

00:07:28.877 --> 00:07:31.222
- [Mark] You can really smell
the star anise in there.

00:07:31.222 --> 00:07:33.692
They also include some
lettuce, as well as some

00:07:33.692 --> 00:07:36.227
water morning in there ...
- Right here, this guy.

00:07:36.227 --> 00:07:38.999
- Yep, to it. And that even
increases the fragrance.

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:40.967
So, we got that Gao Lao version,

00:07:40.967 --> 00:07:42.743
which is just a soup
with rice on the side.

00:07:42.743 --> 00:07:44.203
You could also order this with noodles.

00:07:44.203 --> 00:07:45.619
You can get it however you like,

00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:49.702
and you can get whatever
organs you like as well.

00:07:53.016 --> 00:07:53.849
- Man.

00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:56.949
- Yeah. It's almost, it's so aromatic.

00:07:56.949 --> 00:07:59.447
You taste all of the
Chinese herbs in there.

00:07:59.447 --> 00:08:01.315
It has this sweetness to it.

00:08:01.315 --> 00:08:02.694
- Kind of like soy, too.

00:08:02.694 --> 00:08:04.250
- [Mark] I'm just gonna
reach my chopsticks in

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.351
and take whatever I get,
which in this instance,

00:08:06.351 --> 00:08:08.068
happens to be a piece of liver

00:08:08.068 --> 00:08:10.568
and a piece of the fresh beef.

00:08:15.992 --> 00:08:16.825
- [Drew] That broth.

00:08:16.825 --> 00:08:18.503
- [Mark] So fresh tasting,
because all of the meats

00:08:18.503 --> 00:08:20.299
apart from the beef that's been braised,

00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:22.064
everything is just flashed blanched.

00:08:22.064 --> 00:08:23.222
- [Drew] There are all
kind of different textures

00:08:23.222 --> 00:08:24.055
going on in here.
- [Mark] Yeah, it is.

00:08:24.055 --> 00:08:26.122
I mean, it's not like one consistent meat.

00:08:26.122 --> 00:08:28.209
They're different shapes, different sizes.

00:08:28.209 --> 00:08:29.760
- [Mark] Now that we've
tried the broth and the meat,

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.083
it's time to make our sauce.

00:08:31.083 --> 00:08:33.202
It's fish sauce in a soy sauce bottle.

00:08:33.202 --> 00:08:35.457
You add chili, a little bit of fish sauce,

00:08:35.457 --> 00:08:39.027
and then mainly is
chili vinegar, which is-

00:08:39.027 --> 00:08:41.199
yep, this one would be the green sauce.

00:08:41.199 --> 00:08:43.482
There it is. That is the perfect ...

00:08:43.482 --> 00:08:45.769
Give that a little chopstick twirl.

00:08:45.769 --> 00:08:48.607
That's your beef dipping sauce.

00:08:48.607 --> 00:08:49.757
- What is this one?

00:08:49.757 --> 00:08:51.164
- That should be liver.

00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:51.997
- Liver.

00:08:51.997 --> 00:08:53.319
(electronic music)

00:08:53.319 --> 00:08:55.051
- [Mark] Into the sauce.

00:08:55.051 --> 00:08:55.884
Oh, yes.

00:08:55.884 --> 00:08:56.717
- [Drew] Lunch crowd is coming in.

00:08:56.717 --> 00:08:57.800
- [Mark] Yep.

00:08:59.842 --> 00:09:01.142
- Wow.

00:09:01.142 --> 00:09:01.975
- Oh.

00:09:01.975 --> 00:09:04.706
- [Drew] Spicy, sour. They
add all the kicks, man.

00:09:04.706 --> 00:09:08.390
- [Mark] And I just kind of
almost let it sit in the sauce,

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:10.151
'cause this sauce is so good.
- [Drew] Dunk it.

00:09:10.151 --> 00:09:13.101
- [Mark] Dunk it, and let it just soak.

00:09:13.101 --> 00:09:13.934
- [Drew] Like a sponge.

00:09:13.934 --> 00:09:16.883
(electronic music)

00:09:16.883 --> 00:09:18.679
- [Mark] Okay, I'm gonna try meatball next

00:09:18.679 --> 00:09:21.801
and another thing you can do
that I like to do sometimes

00:09:21.801 --> 00:09:23.525
is ... Pour it on.
- [Drew] Pour it on?

00:09:23.525 --> 00:09:25.225
- Dropped the ball, too.

00:09:25.225 --> 00:09:27.308
- Oh. It's really spongy,

00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:32.205
but firm at the same time.
- It is, yeah.

00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:34.872
- Good.
- Go down with some rice.

00:09:37.104 --> 00:09:38.068
- Thing about this chili sauce,

00:09:38.068 --> 00:09:40.608
when you mix the chili
flakes with fish sauce

00:09:40.608 --> 00:09:43.793
it becomes a liquid chili
paste and it burns your lips.

00:09:43.793 --> 00:09:46.285
It just stays on your lips the whole meal.

00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:47.118
Whether that's a good or bad thing ...

00:09:47.118 --> 00:09:49.353
For me, it's a good thing,
but you're always reminded

00:09:49.353 --> 00:09:50.936
of that spice, man.

00:09:53.172 --> 00:09:55.232
- Oh, the tripe is incredible.

00:09:55.232 --> 00:09:56.899
It has a snap to it.

00:09:57.819 --> 00:10:01.915
Like a little, just wonderful,
cartilage-y crunch to it.

00:10:01.915 --> 00:10:04.978
(people speaking and dishware sounds)

00:10:04.978 --> 00:10:07.484
- [Mark] (speaking Thai)

00:10:07.484 --> 00:10:10.365
now as we're leaving, it's
actually even still before,

00:10:10.365 --> 00:10:13.142
I think it's still before
... Yeah, it's 11:50,

00:10:13.142 --> 00:10:16.475
but you can see the Silom lunch rush now

00:10:17.366 --> 00:10:19.469
is starting to build up.

00:10:19.469 --> 00:10:23.222
Now there's a whole crowd
waiting to eat here,

00:10:23.222 --> 00:10:25.331
so it's good we got here 30 minutes ago.

00:10:25.331 --> 00:10:28.600
And by the way, the
place is called Yee Jay.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.269
- Amazing man. Like, I'm
already getting kind of full,

00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:32.517
and I know that's a bad thing,

00:10:32.517 --> 00:10:33.611
because we have more coming, right?

00:10:33.611 --> 00:10:34.444
(laughs)

00:10:34.444 --> 00:10:35.807
- [Mark] Now we're ready
for the real lunch.

00:10:35.807 --> 00:10:36.640
- [Drew] Can't wait.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.983
- [Mark] But yeah, that was ...

00:10:37.983 --> 00:10:38.922
- Give you the sweats.

00:10:38.922 --> 00:10:39.755
- I got the sweats. I got the sweats.

00:10:39.755 --> 00:10:41.718
- It's already humid
outside we had the soups.

00:10:41.718 --> 00:10:42.709
- Yes. Exactly.

00:10:42.709 --> 00:10:43.842
(laughs)

00:10:43.842 --> 00:10:46.855
(electronic music)

00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:49.444
(people talking)

00:10:49.444 --> 00:10:52.077
- This is the next
restaurant street food stall.

00:10:52.077 --> 00:10:54.617
This is a place that's
very famous for noodles

00:10:54.617 --> 00:10:55.840
and it is right at noon.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.708
This is perfect time
for ultimate busyness.

00:10:58.708 --> 00:11:00.505
This is just the atmosphere

00:11:00.505 --> 00:11:02.291
that I love so much about Bangkok.

00:11:02.291 --> 00:11:03.920
- [Drew] Yep. Right on the street.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.547
- Stalls, the aromas of
beautiful soups and chilis

00:11:07.547 --> 00:11:09.425
and limes.
- Absolutely, man

00:11:09.425 --> 00:11:11.225
- [Mark] Oh, yeah.

00:11:11.225 --> 00:11:13.892
(speaking Thai)

00:11:16.305 --> 00:11:18.205
(laughing)

00:11:18.205 --> 00:11:21.353
- This places is called Kuay Teow Khae.

00:11:21.353 --> 00:11:23.668
You can choose your size,
40 bot, 50 bot, 60 bot.

00:11:23.668 --> 00:11:26.347
She told us that the 60 bot
version, that's the special,

00:11:26.347 --> 00:11:28.404
that's the big bowl that
comes with everything

00:11:28.404 --> 00:11:31.614
including Moo Grob, which
is the crispy pork belly.

00:11:31.614 --> 00:11:34.006
(bowl being filled)

00:11:34.006 --> 00:11:36.964
- The action and energy
here is so beautiful,

00:11:36.964 --> 00:11:39.423
and what's noticeable when
I'm standing here by the cart

00:11:39.423 --> 00:11:40.985
where she's assembling the noodles,

00:11:40.985 --> 00:11:45.029
she's actually blanching the
noodles back there somewhere

00:11:45.029 --> 00:11:46.366
you can't really see.

00:11:46.366 --> 00:11:49.687
Then, they've got some of
the seasoning ingredients

00:11:49.687 --> 00:11:50.520
here at the front.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.273
The final step, if she
blanches the noodles,

00:11:53.273 --> 00:11:56.033
then he adds in the mixed pork, the egg.

00:11:56.033 --> 00:11:59.955
The nice touch is that he
squeezes on the lime juice.

00:11:59.955 --> 00:12:01.629
The lime juice is not cooked out,

00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:03.383
which preserves the flavor.

00:12:03.383 --> 00:12:06.181
Tosses noodles, adds
on some more seasoning,

00:12:06.181 --> 00:12:09.042
so that's ... You just smell the citrus,

00:12:09.042 --> 00:12:12.658
the lime aroma. It smells so good.

00:12:12.658 --> 00:12:14.601
And that's why there
are so many people here.

00:12:14.601 --> 00:12:15.434
- Did we even get a table?

00:12:15.434 --> 00:12:16.780
- [Mark] We're waiting for a table

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.604
because there's kind
of a queue over there.

00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:19.437
- Okay.

00:12:19.437 --> 00:12:20.424
So she's ...
- You ain't gonna lie.

00:12:20.424 --> 00:12:21.927
- [Mark] No, we've got it.
We're waiting for a table.

00:12:21.927 --> 00:12:23.755
We're in line. We're in line.

00:12:23.755 --> 00:12:25.210
- This is the heat of the moment, guys.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:26.295
This is what it's all about.

00:12:26.295 --> 00:12:27.740
- [Mark] Whoa (speaking thai).

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.323
(crowd sounds)

00:12:32.174 --> 00:12:33.679
- We waited about 30
minutes to get this chair,

00:12:33.679 --> 00:12:34.512
but we finally got it.

00:12:34.512 --> 00:12:35.345
- [Mark] Yes we did.

00:12:35.345 --> 00:12:36.432
- You're in the frame more,

00:12:36.432 --> 00:12:37.951
and there's more action
behind you on that side.

00:12:37.951 --> 00:12:39.181
- Yeah, this is cool.

00:12:39.181 --> 00:12:41.149
- That is our (dish name)(laughs)

00:12:41.149 --> 00:12:42.855
- [Drew] Did you get that?

00:12:42.855 --> 00:12:43.900
- [Mark] Okay, now.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.343
- [Ying] (speaking Thai)

00:12:45.343 --> 00:12:46.590
- [Drew] Oh, yeah.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.628
- [Ying] Oops. Sorry.
(eltro music)

00:12:48.628 --> 00:12:49.461
- [Mark] But it comes with
soup on the side, yeah?

00:12:49.461 --> 00:12:50.864
- [Ying] Yeah, I think that

00:12:50.864 --> 00:12:53.546
she's gonna bring it ... Yeah.

00:12:53.546 --> 00:12:55.097
- [Drew] You have two cameras on you.

00:12:55.097 --> 00:12:55.930
(laughs)

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.013
Don't worry, no pressure.

00:13:01.672 --> 00:13:02.839
- Really good.

00:13:03.751 --> 00:13:06.418
(speaking Thai)

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:10.952
- The first expression that
I'm gonna say is (speaks Thai)

00:13:10.952 --> 00:13:13.290
means I desperately want
to eat this.(laughs)

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:14.835
- [Drew] This is true, this is true.

00:13:14.835 --> 00:13:17.145
- Definitely you could put
your whole face in this bowl,

00:13:17.145 --> 00:13:18.312
it's that big.

00:13:19.344 --> 00:13:21.726
You've got the bami,
which are egg noodles,

00:13:21.726 --> 00:13:25.867
but they're not the ...
spaghetti egg noodles,

00:13:25.867 --> 00:13:28.770
but they're the thick ...
Look at that bunch of noodles.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.215
Actually, you know what?
I just grabbed in one

00:13:30.215 --> 00:13:31.677
chopstick all the of the
noodles in my entire bowl.

00:13:31.677 --> 00:13:32.820
- You could eat it all in one bite.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:33.918
- That's how sticky they are.

00:13:33.918 --> 00:13:38.918
- Yeah (laugh) But they're
the semi wide egg noodles.

00:13:39.791 --> 00:13:42.844
So, wheat based with egg,
but then all of the toppings,

00:13:42.844 --> 00:13:45.337
you see the red barbecue
pork, you've got the moo grob,

00:13:45.337 --> 00:13:47.877
which looks incredible, which
is the crispy pork belly.

00:13:47.877 --> 00:13:50.330
A variety of meatball looking things,

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.490
some of the minced pork,
and just thin and wavy.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.907
Wavy, that's what they are, they're wavy.

00:13:59.937 --> 00:14:00.770
- Man.

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:04.887
- Oh, wow.

00:14:04.887 --> 00:14:05.729
- Dude.

00:14:05.729 --> 00:14:08.581
- [Mark] They're tangly,
and they're so ...

00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:10.176
They're soft, but not mushy at all

00:14:10.176 --> 00:14:12.421
and they're very, very thin.

00:14:12.421 --> 00:14:15.770
I mean, not the width, but
the thickness is of noodles.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:16.732
- [Drew] They kind of grip together

00:14:16.732 --> 00:14:17.565
in your mouth when you chew them.

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:18.398
- [Mark] They do.

00:14:18.398 --> 00:14:19.231
- [Drew] Like, they don't separate.

00:14:19.231 --> 00:14:20.364
They kind of go in a ball in your mouth,

00:14:20.364 --> 00:14:21.197
but it's a great ball(laughs).

00:14:21.197 --> 00:14:23.360
- [Mark] It has a gummy
texture at the same time.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.295
... Actually oil,
there's dry chili flakes.

00:14:25.295 --> 00:14:27.578
There's vinegar, and this another vinegar.

00:14:27.578 --> 00:14:30.062
These would be all the
essential seasoning for this.

00:14:30.062 --> 00:14:32.912
Oh, look at this. This is a beauty.

00:14:32.912 --> 00:14:34.482
- [Drew] Are you putting all that in?

00:14:34.482 --> 00:14:37.102
- [Mark] I am putting all of this in, yes.

00:14:37.102 --> 00:14:37.935
- [Drew] You're insane.

00:14:37.935 --> 00:14:42.228
- [Mark] One more scoop
just for good, good measure.

00:14:42.228 --> 00:14:46.442
Oh, perfect. Good. Then,
I'm gonna go in for also

00:14:46.442 --> 00:14:49.300
some of vinegar and some
chili flakes as well.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.697
Little bit of dried chili flakes on here.

00:14:52.697 --> 00:14:55.614
Finally, some of the chili vinegar,

00:14:57.373 --> 00:15:00.494
and probably two scoops
of this to complete my

00:15:00.494 --> 00:15:01.412
seasoning for the moment.

00:15:01.412 --> 00:15:03.264
- [Drew] Can I tell you something?

00:15:03.264 --> 00:15:04.097
- [Mark] Yeah.

00:15:04.097 --> 00:15:05.405
You want to say it on ...
- [Drew] Wait, no no.

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:06.238
Wait until we'll talking.

00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:07.071
- No, go ahead.

00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:10.318
- Alright, guys. I don't
think an average person

00:15:10.318 --> 00:15:12.330
would put that much chili on it.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:13.759
I know this guy loves spice,

00:15:13.759 --> 00:15:16.371
but it's mind blowing how
spicy he makes his dish.

00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:18.384
He wouldn't say say that,
so I want to say that

00:15:18.384 --> 00:15:21.713
on the camera. That's it.(laugh)

00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:22.796
look at that, man.

00:15:22.796 --> 00:15:25.666
It's like, a full layer thick of spice.

00:15:25.666 --> 00:15:27.531
- [Mark] A blanket of chili.

00:15:27.531 --> 00:15:28.947
- [Drew] A blanket of chili,
yeah. A blanket of chili.

00:15:28.947 --> 00:15:31.357
- [Mark] That's my
favorite kind of blanket.

00:15:31.357 --> 00:15:32.820
Okay. I'm gonna give this a little ...

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.706
Whoa, it's kind of sliding
on the metal table.

00:15:35.706 --> 00:15:39.790
Give this a little stir,
let it coat those noodles.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:40.722
- [Drew] So good.

00:15:40.722 --> 00:15:43.211
- [Mark] This is where things
get more and more beautiful

00:15:43.211 --> 00:15:45.597
and more flavorful. Oh,
and the crispy pork belly.

00:15:45.597 --> 00:15:46.815
Okay, I'm gonna definitely

00:15:46.815 --> 00:15:48.540
get some crispy pork belly on this bite.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:53.123
Check out how these noodles
have just been transformed.

00:15:55.844 --> 00:15:56.844
- Oh my god.

00:15:58.196 --> 00:15:59.029
Dude.

00:15:59.029 --> 00:16:01.926
- Dude. The crispy pork belly.

00:16:01.926 --> 00:16:02.773
Did you get a bite of that yet?

00:16:02.773 --> 00:16:03.773
- Yeah. Wow.

00:16:05.369 --> 00:16:07.385
- [Drew] This is our third
meal in the last hour

00:16:07.385 --> 00:16:10.271
and even though I'm full,
this is the best one.

00:16:10.271 --> 00:16:11.344
This is my favorite one.

00:16:11.344 --> 00:16:12.608
- This is crazily good, yeah.
- So good.

00:16:12.608 --> 00:16:15.094
I need a little more vinegar
to balance everything

00:16:15.094 --> 00:16:17.436
and will be balanced out to perfection.

00:16:17.436 --> 00:16:18.408
Okay, perfect.

00:16:18.408 --> 00:16:22.736
- [Drew] I got to get
that pork belly, again.

00:16:22.736 --> 00:16:23.569
- [Mark] And I'll get some moo dang,

00:16:23.569 --> 00:16:25.993
which is the barbecue part on this bite.

00:16:25.993 --> 00:16:28.051
- [Drew] I'm surprised that you actually

00:16:28.051 --> 00:16:29.349
eat everything in the background.

00:16:29.349 --> 00:16:30.182
(laughter)

00:16:30.182 --> 00:16:32.231
- As Drew and I were filming,

00:16:32.231 --> 00:16:34.725
Ying managed to finish her entire bowl.

00:16:34.725 --> 00:16:36.615
- [Drew] Like, practically
clean. Look at that.

00:16:36.615 --> 00:16:37.685
(laughing)

00:16:37.685 --> 00:16:41.053
Ying you are a champion.
You are a champion.

00:16:41.053 --> 00:16:42.036
- [Mark] Yeah.

00:16:42.036 --> 00:16:45.030
That's the reason we get along so well.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.908
- Focus there.

00:16:45.908 --> 00:16:47.651
- [Mark] Oh, let me see that skin.

00:16:47.651 --> 00:16:49.818
- See that skin? See that?

00:16:53.037 --> 00:16:55.704
Oh yeah. That crunchy, but soft.

00:16:57.531 --> 00:16:59.235
- The final component
of this dish is the soup

00:16:59.235 --> 00:17:00.773
because we got the dry noodle soup.

00:17:00.773 --> 00:17:02.121
The soup is on the side.

00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:04.829
You can see the (ingredient),

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:08.412
which is the coriander,
the cilantro roots.

00:17:09.768 --> 00:17:12.419
Yeah, very light. Another
thing you could do, Drew,

00:17:12.419 --> 00:17:13.252
- Yeah?

00:17:13.252 --> 00:17:14.175
You can take some of your soup

00:17:14.175 --> 00:17:16.117
and add it to your
noodles to rehydrate them

00:17:16.117 --> 00:17:19.057
as you continue to eat,
which I love to do.

00:17:19.057 --> 00:17:20.833
It's like rejuvenating ...

00:17:20.833 --> 00:17:21.666
- [Drew] Bringing them back to life.

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:23.923
Because, your noodles get a little dry.

00:17:23.923 --> 00:17:26.499
You can keep on rolling with it.

00:17:26.499 --> 00:17:29.217
Look at ... These are just so tasty,

00:17:29.217 --> 00:17:31.055
I love the texture, it's great.

00:17:31.055 --> 00:17:33.722
(electro music)

00:17:35.247 --> 00:17:38.664
- [Mark] I think this egg is a one biter.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:45.975
Oh, that yolk. Oh, it's so creamy.

00:17:45.975 --> 00:17:48.642
(electro music)

00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:52.314
- Down to my last bite. I
think this is a fish ball

00:17:52.314 --> 00:17:54.831
and I'm just gonna scrape up, wipe up,

00:17:54.831 --> 00:17:57.079
some of that final chili
oil and nuts down there.

00:17:57.079 --> 00:18:00.589
(laughs) yes. Right off
the lip the of the bowl

00:18:00.589 --> 00:18:03.172
with the thumb. Okay, I got it.

00:18:05.915 --> 00:18:09.332
- Oh. Cool. That's a totally new texture.

00:18:10.286 --> 00:18:12.705
That was one of a kind in the bowl.

00:18:12.705 --> 00:18:13.538
- [Mark] Good job, Drew.

00:18:13.538 --> 00:18:15.481
- Oh, dude. The best.
I'm so happy right now.

00:18:15.481 --> 00:18:17.874
I'm so satisfied, I don't
even need to eat until dinner.

00:18:17.874 --> 00:18:19.503
(laughs)

00:18:19.503 --> 00:18:21.268
I mean, I meant tomorrow.

00:18:21.268 --> 00:18:22.638
- [Mark] How's the noodles?

00:18:22.638 --> 00:18:23.471
- Very good.

00:18:23.471 --> 00:18:24.773
- Very good. As I've mentioned,

00:18:24.773 --> 00:18:26.965
my lips are burning(laughs).

00:18:26.965 --> 00:18:29.712
Welcome to Thailand. Welcome to Bangkok.

00:18:29.712 --> 00:18:32.379
(electro music)

00:18:34.524 --> 00:18:37.187
- So good. She is a
master. She is a master.

00:18:37.187 --> 00:18:39.025
You've got to come here
when you're in Silom, man.

00:18:39.025 --> 00:18:41.778
The lunch rush, it's so much energy,

00:18:41.778 --> 00:18:44.371
it's so action packed, her noodles ...

00:18:44.371 --> 00:18:46.708
(speaking Thai)

00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:48.994
- She knows what she's
doing, guys. Really.

00:18:48.994 --> 00:18:49.827
(laughing and speaking Thai)

00:18:49.827 --> 00:18:52.494
(electro music)

00:18:55.995 --> 00:18:57.656
- [Mark] He has called us over.

00:18:57.656 --> 00:19:00.323
(speaking Thai)

00:19:03.705 --> 00:19:04.755
- [Mark] You want half of the sample?

00:19:04.755 --> 00:19:06.791
- [Drew] Yeah, dude.

00:19:06.791 --> 00:19:09.106
- [Mark] This is one with taro inside.

00:19:09.106 --> 00:19:12.190
We've stopped for the final
thing on this Thai street food

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:14.557
tour of Silom at lunch.

00:19:14.557 --> 00:19:17.051
We've stopped at Khanom
Tokyo, which is a sweet,

00:19:17.051 --> 00:19:18.438
it's kind of like a pancake,

00:19:18.438 --> 00:19:20.427
which [Person] is really friendly.

00:19:20.427 --> 00:19:22.760
This is with taro inside it.

00:19:26.997 --> 00:19:27.830
Oh, yeah.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:28.663
- It is like a pancake.

00:19:28.663 --> 00:19:29.621
(calling sounds)

00:19:29.621 --> 00:19:33.871
- Oh, and he's ... Okay.
He's making a fresh batch.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.657
- [Drew] That's good. Really good.

00:19:39.657 --> 00:19:41.382
- [Mark] Unless you want to
try to the hotdog one, we can.

00:19:41.382 --> 00:19:42.215
- [Ying] I had the hotdog.

00:19:42.215 --> 00:19:44.892
- [Mark] Oh, you did?(laughs)

00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:46.739
'Cause the hotdog one has the coil in it.

00:19:46.739 --> 00:19:48.736
(speaking Thai)

00:19:48.736 --> 00:19:53.244
(cooking sounds)
(speaking Thai)

00:19:53.244 --> 00:19:54.542
- Lung Tokyo.

00:19:54.542 --> 00:19:56.763
- [Mark] Lung Tokyo, mean 'Uncle Tokyo'.

00:19:56.763 --> 00:19:57.868
- [Man] Uncle Tokyo.

00:19:57.868 --> 00:19:58.701
(traffic sounds)

00:19:58.701 --> 00:20:00.951
(laughing)

00:20:01.935 --> 00:20:04.066
- [Mark] Uncle Tokyo on [Street Name],

00:20:04.066 --> 00:20:05.178
he's such a friendly man.

00:20:05.178 --> 00:20:08.011
He's been making this
same snack for 20 years.

00:20:08.011 --> 00:20:09.584
- [Drew] 20 years.

00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:13.009
- Yeah, we've already tried
some of the sweet versions.

00:20:13.009 --> 00:20:14.936
Just snacking right off the griddle,

00:20:14.936 --> 00:20:17.700
but the one I'm most interested to try

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:21.593
is the Thai 'pig in the
blanket.' The Thai corn dog.

00:20:21.593 --> 00:20:23.618
The entire hotdog, the ketchup,

00:20:23.618 --> 00:20:26.564
oh, the quail egg,
- [Drew] The quail egg.

00:20:26.564 --> 00:20:29.905
is all wrapped up on a stick on a skewer.

00:20:29.905 --> 00:20:31.822
How convenient is that?

00:20:34.947 --> 00:20:35.780
- Oh, man.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.615
(laughs)

00:20:38.615 --> 00:20:43.166
Wow. I need to think about
this for a second.(laughs)

00:20:43.166 --> 00:20:46.255
- That is oddly delicious.
- [Drew] Yeah.

00:20:46.255 --> 00:20:51.255
It's like a sweet pancake
with a slightly mushy hotdog,

00:20:51.503 --> 00:20:53.048
the quail egg,
- Ketchup.

00:20:53.048 --> 00:20:54.204
And you've got that tangy ketchup.

00:20:54.204 --> 00:20:55.172
- I vote this is great, man.

00:20:55.172 --> 00:20:56.081
I'll come back and get this again.

00:20:56.081 --> 00:20:58.334
- [Mark] Even if the hotdog
is not my favorite thing,

00:20:58.334 --> 00:21:00.175
the experience ...
- it's an art in itself.

00:21:00.175 --> 00:21:02.813
Just the art of uncle making it,

00:21:02.813 --> 00:21:06.799
his passion for it, and his
positivity, and just ...

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:08.423
- [Drew] He's been doing it for 20 years,

00:21:08.423 --> 00:21:10.699
making the same exact thing every ...

00:21:10.699 --> 00:21:12.237
I asked him how many he sells in a day,

00:21:12.237 --> 00:21:14.318
and he said he can't even
count 'cause he sells so many.

00:21:14.318 --> 00:21:16.364
- [Mark] Just the convenience
of this, it's all on a stick.

00:21:16.364 --> 00:21:17.716
You never need to touch it.

00:21:17.716 --> 00:21:19.414
I happen to be on my final bite.

00:21:19.414 --> 00:21:20.497
- This is kind of a sad moment.

00:21:20.497 --> 00:21:21.330
- Yeah, I know.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:23.017
That means its gonna end.
- It's kind of bittersweet.

00:21:23.017 --> 00:21:26.334
Alright, this is the final bite of hotdog.

00:21:26.334 --> 00:21:31.334
(electro music)
(traffic sounds)

00:21:31.554 --> 00:21:34.064
- That was a lot of fun, and
that was a perfect ending.

00:21:34.064 --> 00:21:36.369
Drew, what was your
favorite dish of the day?

00:21:36.369 --> 00:21:37.732
- I have to say it was
the third one we ate,

00:21:37.732 --> 00:21:39.759
the dried noodles, man. That was amazing.

00:21:39.759 --> 00:21:40.592
- It was.

00:21:40.592 --> 00:21:41.425
- Yeah.

00:21:41.425 --> 00:21:42.731
- It really was incredibly good.

00:21:42.731 --> 00:21:44.518
Well, we've come to the
end of this food tour.

00:21:44.518 --> 00:21:47.721
I want to say a huge thank
you to Drew for joining me.

00:21:47.721 --> 00:21:50.123
Drew, can you just tell
everybody what you do?

00:21:50.123 --> 00:21:52.209
- Sure. Thanks, man. It
was a pleasure being here.

00:21:52.209 --> 00:21:54.646
I make daily travel videos
on Facebook and Youtube.

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:57.118
Just two to three minute
little documentary style

00:21:57.118 --> 00:21:58.186
telling unique stories and everything,

00:21:58.186 --> 00:22:00.548
just like the guy that we just met.

00:22:00.548 --> 00:22:01.661
- I'll leave all his links below.

00:22:01.661 --> 00:22:04.361
Check him out. He also
makes videos with a message

00:22:04.361 --> 00:22:06.598
and also really explains the culture.

00:22:06.598 --> 00:22:07.507
Yeah, Drew is cool.

00:22:07.507 --> 00:22:08.340
- Cool.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:09.485
- Anyway, thank you all
- Thanks man

00:22:09.485 --> 00:22:10.726
so very much for watching this video.

00:22:10.726 --> 00:22:12.516
