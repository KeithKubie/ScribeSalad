1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,600
The Joe Rogan experience.
Hey, wait, that's this.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,070
This reminds me of when you talk about
that island, that private island.

3
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:11,180
Do you know Sentinel Sentinel's
sensible? Our Central Island? Yeah.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,650
Planes still fly over that or no?

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,020
Are they not allowed to tell
about it as a restricted airspace?

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,910
I don't think it's restricted.
No,

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,860
but you can't land there
and you can't circle. Right.

8
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:25,410
You can't visit. India owns it.
Right. It doesn't, it doesn't.

9
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:28,230
India control leaves and
it's like 10 mile radius.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,470
I saw a thing online that said a boat
crash there and you could still see on

11
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:32,940
Google images the remnants of the boat.
Yeah.

12
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:34,560
They came for the people in the boat too.

13
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:36,390
And the helicopters got them off the boat.

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,230
Right as the people were like pulling up
and Oh, so they lit raps and shit. Yeah.

15
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:44,670
Fuck yeah, they, they live. But those, the
villages were common for them. Wow. Yeah.

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,750
Can you imagine stumbling across a village
they've been fucked with sometime in

17
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:53,520
the past? You know that a commander
Maurice Vidal Portman. Yeah. Guy. Yeah.

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,950
Shout out to a respectable
law on, uh, Twitter.

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,010
He has a, a, a giant thread about it.

20
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:06,870
It may be pinned on the top of
his Twitter page, but explaining,

21
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,700
uh, like one of the reasons why
those people were so hostile. Right.

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,480
And it has to do with this British
explorer who was really kinky and, uh,

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,260
he went there to fuck. Who knows, we
want to fuck island as what he did,

24
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:21,870
but people got sick because
of them. You know, this,

25
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,670
I had this Guy Graham Hancock on yeah.
And he was talking to me about, um, uh,

26
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,900
all the different shit
that they're finding in the
Amazon and in South America,

27
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,740
and that they used to be 20 million people
that live in the Amazon and they died

28
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:36,480
off because of sickness.

29
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,350
They were visited most apparently
Europeans when they came in like the 15

30
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:41,070
hundreds,

31
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,520
they would tell these incredible stories
about these huge civilizations in the

32
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,910
Amazon. But then when explorers
came back 200 years later,

33
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,020
there was nothing there. And they were
like, this is crazy. They do. They lied.

34
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,360
They must've lied,
but it turns out they didn't lie.

35
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,590
What happened was smallpox ran through
the fucking jungle. And white people.

36
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,530
Everybody.
We did it and then these,

37
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,610
the jungle just overtook the cities and
now they're finding these cities with

38
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:06,840
something called Lidar.

39
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,680
They use these planes and they circle
over this area or helicopters or whatever

40
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:13,860
the fuck they do and they shoot
this shit down this lidar.

41
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,160
It's like laser radar and it gives you
a detailed image of what's below the

42
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:23,160
surface and what's there. And it
shows them all these crazy structures,

43
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,540
all these like uh,

44
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,600
like roadways and irrigation systems
and circles inside of a square.

45
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,270
Like it was villages and cities and the
millions of people probably live there.

46
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,390
I couldn't look at it. That's all
stuff. They're finding that yeah.

47
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,520
And all of it was
swallowed up by the jungle.

48
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,030
They think within like a hundred
years just vanished in the jungle.

49
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,690
Oh cause it's so, so lush and
tropical down there. Dude.

50
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:50,691
It was one of the most amazing podcasts
I've ever done to listen in to that guy.

51
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,890
Tell this story right after
this one though. No, you are
the best. You're the best.

52
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,010
He's a, this is kind of, well this is
like, this is like the of Atlantis, right?

53
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:00,880
Like when they started finding,

54
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,960
you started finding more and more land
under in this they found traces of five

55
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:09,550
drugs including dime methyl trip to mean
on a thousand year old South American

56
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:14,420
ritual. DMT Baby. That's
like proof positive. Um,

57
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,930
evidence that it least 1000 years
ago they were using Iowasca.

58
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,790
Wow. This was the drug pouch
that was made from Fox snouts.

59
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,970
That sounds so crazy. It
literally look, when you see it,

60
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:32,971
it looks like they used everything and
the first reason it looks really nice and

61
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:35,980
knows,
I wonder why they do that with a Fox.

62
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,330
It's probably like some cleverness
somehow that that's what a shaman,

63
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,580
that's like literally what a shaman
is supposed to. That's what the, the,

64
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,770
the definition is supposed to be in
certain cultures, certain cultures.

65
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:51,340
It's a clever fellow. That's who
the chef, the Shawman is. Okay.

66
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:54,040
That kind makes sense. They are just
clever fellows. But I mean imagine that.

67
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:57,460
Like he takes a Fox, that clever little
fucker. I'm going to take his face.

68
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,620
I want to split my drugs in his face.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,670
Only a person would think to do something.
So creepy trucks.

70
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,770
No exact chipmunk cheeks. Yeah, right.
That would be a good move. Yeah.

71
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,360
A little pouch.
Sugar pouches at hangs for your belt.

72
00:04:11,361 --> 00:04:13,330
It's just chipmunk cheeks
while your coins in it.
