What’s the secret to comedy?

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:16.260
Hey there everyone, Julian here for DNews.
Have you ever wondered how long a second is?

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.769
You’re probably thinking it’s a second.
A second is a second. But how did we come

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.949
up with that? The exact length of a second?
After all it’s an important measurement

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.320
because so much depends on it. Everyone has
to agree on how long a second is to accurately

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.040
measure speed, frequency, and of course, time
itself. And as it turns out the second has

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.020
gone through a few minute but important definition
changes over its history.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.700
When defining just how long a second is it’s
tempting to start with the length of a day

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.450
and break it up. 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes
to an hour and 60 seconds to a minute means

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.480
a there are 86,400 seconds in a solar day.
Solar day meaning the amount of time it takes

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.930
the sun to come back to the same spot in the
sky. And for a while this was indeed the definition,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.540
until the 1950s when people realized that
the Earth’s rotation wasn’t uniform enough

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.760
to consistently measure seconds. So rather
than define a second by how long it took the

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.619
earth to spin around, it’s more accurate
to measure seconds as a subdivision of a year,

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.259
or how long it takes the earth to orbit the
sun.

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.549
That exact amount of time can vary slightly
from year to year as well so in 1960 it was

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.600
decreed by the Eleventh General Conference
on Weights and Measures that seconds would

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.509
be based off the year 1900. Yep, there are
people who represent dozens of countries and

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.640
their job is to get together every so often
and figure out how to measure everything.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.810
I bet no one is ever late to those meetings.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:39.039
Anyway, 1900 was calculated to be 365.242198
days long, which means the second was officially

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:48.009
defined by the conference as 1/31,556,925.9747
of the year.

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.310
But even while this new definition was being
ratified, people were already working on defining

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.700
a second even more accurately. The thought:
maybe time could be based on atoms. The element

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.069
cesium 133 has just one electron in its outermost
shell, and in 1958 it was discovered this

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:12.640
electron switches from one possible spin to
the other and back again 9,192,631,770 times

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.870
every second. There’s still some uncertainty
here, as the cesium electron can give or take

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.340
20 oscillations per second, but being off
by 20 hz for every 9 billion means that atomic

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.100
clocks are off by only a nanosecond each month.
The 13th General Conference on Weights and

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.830
Measures changed the definition of a second
to this atomic standard in 1967 and it’s

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.220
been the same ever since.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.620
Now though an even more precise standard is
on the horizon. Cesium’s electron vibrates

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.750
in the microwave range, so scientists rely
on microwave clocks, not to be confused with

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.200
the clock on your microwave. But some atoms
like strontium have measurable oscillations

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.250
100,000 times faster than cesium, in the optical
range. These so called optical clocks have

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.030
been known about for some time but it’s
difficult to keep them running reliably. Now

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.100
though Dr Christian Grebing and a research
team from the National Metrology Institute

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.290
of Germany have made them a bit more practical
by using a microwave laser to keep track of

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.300
time when the optical clock is down.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.660
This may all sound confusing, but basically,
a clock like this could tick for 14 billion

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.320
years and only be off by 100 seconds. Something
this accurate could make gps satellites precise

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.470
down to the centimeter, or make financial
transactions on global stock markets faster

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.930
and more numerous. Grebing still thinks optical
clocks are another 10 years away from being

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.340
implemented. But after that it sounds like
the General Conference on Weights and Measures

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.860
won’t have to bring up seconds in their
minutes for a long long time.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.860
