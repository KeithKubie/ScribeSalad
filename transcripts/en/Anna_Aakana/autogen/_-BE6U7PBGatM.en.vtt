00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.980
You know what I've noticed?

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.600
Every time a girl compliments another girl's piece of clothing,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.080
We always respond with where we got it from and how good of a deal it was.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.560
Thanks! I got it from a thrift store for five dollars.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.000
Thanks! Anthropologie. On sale.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.560
Thanks! My friend did a clothing swap so I got it for free.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.460
But anyway. That has absolutely nothing to do with the video at all.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.100
I just thought that it was pretty funny.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.700
And now you're gonna notice just how often it happens.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.920
But onto why you're potentially ruining your chances at happiness!

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.220
I've been reading a plethora of psychology books this year,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.500
specifically those focused around the issues of relationships, how we attach,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.920
and the science behind emotional connectivity.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.340
And one thing I've found incredibly fascinating is that there are two main fears

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.120
that show up over and over again around love.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.740
The first one is the fear of abandonment.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.360
Ding ding ding! Does that sound familliar?

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.940
It definitely does for me.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.040
Fear of abandonment looks like:

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.560
Hi! I know I just met you, but now I'm attached.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.120
Please don't leave me because it will just devastate my life.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.520
I'll stay with you no matter how unhealthy this relationship gets.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.480
I am now clingy and demanding!

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.460
Because I'm totally insecure about the natural space that has evolved over time in our relationship

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.760
And I'm gonna overreact to and overthink everything.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.100
The second is the fear of engulfment.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.780
Your love and affection makes me simultaneously feel like I'm on fire and drowning.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.780
I desperately want love, but I'm afraid that loving means losing myself and my freedom.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.780
You're too close, I need you to back up.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.700
Still too close.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.740
Keep going.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.100
And sometimes we can have both of these fears

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.080
depending on the dynamics of our relationships. Yay! [kids cheering]

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.660
And talking to my therapist about my fear of abandonment

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.780
He said that the number one thing one can do to be more secure in their relationships

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.100
Is to build self reliance.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.580
To know that these fears are triggered by the traumatising death in my past,

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.440
as well as patterns of physical and emotional unavailability from my parents.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.420
Fun stuff.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.440
As always, awareness of why you're acting the way you're acting is the first step

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.340
And slowly but surely cultivating parts of yourself that disallow those fears to be triggered

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.400
until they no longer hold power over you.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.700
It's just so much fun. Growing is the best.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.880
But he did say that all of our fears come from who we were as children.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.720
And that,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.840
[kids cheer]

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.940
[kids cheer]

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.860
[kids cheer]

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.940
[deep voice] WISDOM

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.540
Thank you to Audible for sponsoring today's video.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.520
One book I can't wait to recommend is Attached by Amir Levine and Rachel S.F. Heller

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.240
which goes into the three attachment styles that we developed

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.900
based on our early relationships with our parents or caregivers.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.480
This book was just so helpful in allowing me to understand the healthy and unhealthy ways

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.320
that I connect with the  people in my relationships.
