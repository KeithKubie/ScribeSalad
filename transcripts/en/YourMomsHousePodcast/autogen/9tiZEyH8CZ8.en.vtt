really comes down to mineral content
 

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:57.410
really comes down to mineral content
right so it measures by TDS total

01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:57.420
right so it measures by TDS total

the price is much higher exactly the
 

01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:12.580
the price is much higher exactly the
same with water so this is the more

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:12.590
same with water so this is the more
 

01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:15.160
