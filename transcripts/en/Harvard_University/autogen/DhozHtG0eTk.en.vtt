particular interest in focus on medical
 

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.700
particular interest in focus on medical
error but I was interested in

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:30.710
error but I was interested in
 

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.370
error but I was interested in
identifying problems that we could solve

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:33.380
identifying problems that we could solve
 

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.360
identifying problems that we could solve
and I had started a set of studies that

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:37.370
and I had started a set of studies that
 

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.000

and what I was interested in is how much

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:04.540
and what I was interested in is how much
 

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:07.949
and what I was interested in is how much
of the people who died was because they

00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:07.959
of the people who died was because they
 

00:09:07.959 --> 00:09:11.190
of the people who died was because they
had complications of care where we just

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200
had complications of care where we just
 

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.170
had complications of care where we just
didn't know the answers and the problem

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:13.180
didn't know the answers and the problem
 

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.970
didn't know the answers and the problem
is ignorance and we need to overcome

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:14.980
is ignorance and we need to overcome
 

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.370
is ignorance and we need to overcome
that with more scientific research

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:16.380
that with more scientific research
 

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.009
that with more scientific research
around in the bench lab and how much was

00:09:20.009 --> 00:09:20.019
around in the bench lab and how much was
 

00:09:20.019 --> 00:09:22.410
around in the bench lab and how much was
because then they just didn't execute

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:22.420

we found that two-thirds of the surgical
 

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:37.230
we found that two-thirds of the surgical
deaths were from really error and that

this project which was to see if we
 

00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:48.340
this project which was to see if we
could reduce deaths and surgery globally

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:48.350

and I was still in the back of my mind
 

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.490
and I was still in the back of my mind
thinking that this might be about

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:51.500
thinking that this might be about

well it was a small amount of money to
 

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:03.640
well it was a small amount of money to
convene a lot of leaders in and around

guidelines about care but what was clear

00:18:10.269 --> 00:18:10.279
guidelines about care but what was clear
 

00:18:10.279 --> 00:18:13.000

with the team that I assembled as we all
 

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.909
with the team that I assembled as we all
wanted to actually see whatever we did

00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919
wanted to actually see whatever we did

of guidelines that's that doesn't get
 

00:18:22.309 --> 00:18:24.130

anywhere and the more we dug into it

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:24.140
anywhere and the more we dug into it
 

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.560
anywhere and the more we dug into it
more we felt and that the problems were

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:26.570
more we felt and that the problems were
 

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:29.320
more we felt and that the problems were
not ones a policy but how to reduce

not ones a policy but how to reduce
 

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.330
not ones a policy but how to reduce
deaths and surgery how to make a

doing surgery could successfully lower
 

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.070
doing surgery could successfully lower
deaths and that was what we decided to

deaths and that was what we decided to
 

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.370

that you could do to reduce infections
 

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:50.279
that you could do to reduce infections
in surgery and make sure that you had

00:18:50.279 --> 00:18:50.289
in surgery and make sure that you had
 

00:18:50.289 --> 00:18:52.240
in surgery and make sure that you had
problems with bleeding brought under

recognized you could just make a
checklist for surgery and then it was

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:17.350
checklist for surgery and then it was
 

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:20.740
checklist for surgery and then it was
selling it from Boeing but very much

that there are known ways that you can
be more effective and can we make it

is do you feel that your theory can be

00:30:53.549 --> 00:30:53.559
is do you feel that your theory can be
 

00:30:53.559 --> 00:30:56.519
is do you feel that your theory can be
adaptable to doctor patient healthcare

00:30:56.519 --> 00:30:56.529
adaptable to doctor patient healthcare
 

00:30:56.529 --> 00:30:59.729

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:48.130
around creating a homicide checklist so
I don't know yet about how you might

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:48.140
I don't know yet about how you might
 

00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:49.690
I don't know yet about how you might
apply it in wrongful shootings but he

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:49.700
apply it in wrongful shootings but he
 

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.670
apply it in wrongful shootings but he
applied into homicide investigations and

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:51.680
applied into homicide investigations and
 

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.390
applied into homicide investigations and
found incredible value Boston had one of

00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:55.400
found incredible value Boston had one of
 

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.130
found incredible value Boston had one of
the lowest clearance rates for homicide

00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:57.140
the lowest clearance rates for homicide
 

00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:59.700
the lowest clearance rates for homicide
investigations in the country and they

00:34:59.700 --> 00:34:59.710
investigations in the country and they
 

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:02.230
investigations in the country and they
followed and mirrored the approach we

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:02.240
followed and mirrored the approach we
 

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.390
followed and mirrored the approach we
followed with surgery they gathered a

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400
followed with surgery they gathered a
 

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.430
followed with surgery they gathered a
lot of information from how other police

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:06.440
lot of information from how other police
 

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.350
lot of information from how other police
departments did it tried to figure out

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:08.360
departments did it tried to figure out
 

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.820
departments did it tried to figure out
what those police departments thought

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:09.830
what those police departments thought
 

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:12.460
what those police departments thought
were their best practices and then they

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:12.470
were their best practices and then they
 

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:14.440
were their best practices and then they
created a checklist for homicide

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:14.450
created a checklist for homicide
 

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:16.510
created a checklist for homicide
investigators and he said there were

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:16.520
investigators and he said there were
 

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.880
investigators and he said there were
things on there like you know in many

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:18.890
things on there like you know in many
 

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:22.780
things on there like you know in many
cities in Boston it's up to the crime

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:22.790
cities in Boston it's up to the crime
 

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:24.790
cities in Boston it's up to the crime
scene up to the homicide investigator

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800
scene up to the homicide investigator
 

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.110
scene up to the homicide investigator
whether they bring a crime scene

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:26.120
whether they bring a crime scene
 

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.069
whether they bring a crime scene
investigators see

00:35:27.069 --> 00:35:27.079
investigators see
 

00:35:27.079 --> 00:35:29.249
investigators see
sigh to gather evidence in a really

00:35:29.249 --> 00:35:29.259
sigh to gather evidence in a really
 

00:35:29.259 --> 00:35:31.660
sigh to gather evidence in a really
structured way or whether they do it

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:31.670
structured way or whether they do it
 

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:33.849
structured way or whether they do it
themselves it's up to their discretion

00:35:33.849 --> 00:35:33.859
themselves it's up to their discretion
 

00:35:33.859 --> 00:35:36.459
themselves it's up to their discretion
in other cities they always have a CSI

00:35:36.459 --> 00:35:36.469
in other cities they always have a CSI
 

00:35:36.469 --> 00:35:38.799
in other cities they always have a CSI
on scene and they found that one of the

00:35:38.799 --> 00:35:38.809
on scene and they found that one of the
 

00:35:38.809 --> 00:35:41.229
on scene and they found that one of the
reasons why in Boston they had failures

00:35:41.229 --> 00:35:41.239
reasons why in Boston they had failures
 

00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:43.170
reasons why in Boston they had failures
was that they didn't gather the evidence

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:43.180
was that they didn't gather the evidence
 

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.459
was that they didn't gather the evidence
appropriately and now you lost your

00:35:45.459 --> 00:35:45.469
appropriately and now you lost your
 

00:35:45.469 --> 00:35:46.749
appropriately and now you lost your
evidence and it made it hard to reach a

00:35:46.749 --> 00:35:46.759
evidence and it made it hard to reach a
 

00:35:46.759 --> 00:35:49.120
evidence and it made it hard to reach a
conviction or a clearance on what

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:49.130
conviction or a clearance on what
 

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:51.400
conviction or a clearance on what
actually happened so that's just one of

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:51.410
actually happened so that's just one of
 

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:53.469
actually happened so that's just one of
several steps that they identified and

00:35:53.469 --> 00:35:53.479
several steps that they identified and
 

00:35:53.479 --> 00:35:55.839
several steps that they identified and
they were able to make it go and then

00:35:55.839 --> 00:35:55.849
they were able to make it go and then
 

00:35:55.849 --> 00:35:57.219
they were able to make it go and then
they were able to walk through the hard

00:35:57.219 --> 00:35:57.229
they were able to walk through the hard
 

00:35:57.229 --> 00:35:58.870
they were able to walk through the hard
process how do you convince surgeons

00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880
process how do you convince surgeons
 

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.640
process how do you convince surgeons
well how do you convince homicide

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:00.650
well how do you convince homicide
 

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:03.400
well how do you convince homicide
investigators to not do things their own

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:03.410
investigators to not do things their own
 

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:06.190
investigators to not do things their own
way whatever way and they just mirrored

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:06.200
way whatever way and they just mirrored
 

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.930
way whatever way and they just mirrored
the way it went and now there's a

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:07.940
the way it went and now there's a
 

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:09.670
the way it went and now there's a
National Institute of Justice study a

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680
National Institute of Justice study a
 

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.190
National Institute of Justice study a
randomized trial evaluating whether this

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:12.200
randomized trial evaluating whether this
 

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.599
randomized trial evaluating whether this
is what all cities should do because

00:36:13.599 --> 00:36:13.609
is what all cities should do because
 

00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:15.309
is what all cities should do because
it's worked phenomenally well in Boston

00:36:15.309 --> 00:36:15.319
it's worked phenomenally well in Boston
 

00:36:15.319 --> 00:36:18.489
it's worked phenomenally well in Boston
so I think that you know people have

00:36:18.489 --> 00:36:18.499
so I think that you know people have
 

00:36:18.499 --> 00:36:20.549
so I think that you know people have
brought that approach to successfully

00:36:20.549 --> 00:36:20.559
brought that approach to successfully
 

00:36:20.559 --> 00:36:24.640
brought that approach to successfully
reducing the domestic abuse deaths with

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:24.650
reducing the domestic abuse deaths with
 

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:26.440
reducing the domestic abuse deaths with
what police should do and with domestic

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:26.450
what police should do and with domestic
 

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:29.739
what police should do and with domestic
violence victims and I think in wrongful

00:36:29.739 --> 00:36:29.749
violence victims and I think in wrongful
 

00:36:29.749 --> 00:36:31.959

that these are probably fundamentally

00:36:33.609 --> 00:36:33.619
that these are probably fundamentally
 

00:36:33.619 --> 00:36:36.039
that these are probably fundamentally
