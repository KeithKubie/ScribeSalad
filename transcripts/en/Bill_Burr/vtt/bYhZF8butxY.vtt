1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:00.943
Okay.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.610
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill bird and it's time for the Thursday afternoon,</v>

3
00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:08.160
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.960
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

5
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.250
<v 1>just checking in on you.
I'm just checking on you.
I hope this isn't too loud.</v>

6
00:00:15.251 --> 00:00:19.570
Hope it doesn't make too much noise.
I'm on the road.
Um,

7
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.940
so you get even even more of the bootleg experience Echo.

8
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.310
For some reason I am in a,
a hotel room that has,
I would say,
Oh,

9
00:00:30.311 --> 00:00:33.610
if I had to guess,
uh,
18 foot ceilings and no,

10
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.280
this is not some super swanky friggin place.

11
00:00:36.281 --> 00:00:39.300
I think it's just an old building and uh,

12
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.850
and people was shorter back then walking around in wool suits.
All,

13
00:00:42.851 --> 00:00:47.470
you know what it was,
they wore hats.
They were big hats back then.

14
00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:52.180
That was it.
That was the deal.
And was like,
probably no one guys,

15
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.861
there's probably no,

16
00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:58.750
whoever had the biggest fancy has hat that the women back then with their hoop

17
00:00:58.751 --> 00:01:01.020
skirts are probably all like,
oh,
he probably guys,

18
00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:04.630
he's probably got all the money.
He's probably got all kinds of money.
Right.

19
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.260
Um,
of course,
you know,
psychologists would probably say that.
It was,

20
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.890
that was all about Dick size.
You know what I mean?

21
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.540
I don't think any guy really thinks about dick size unless he has a little Dick.

22
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.680
Other than that,
if you fucking,
you know,
it's like I'm an average runner.

23
00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:25.350
I never think of,
no,
I actually wasn't.

24
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.760
I was slow and I never even thought about that.

25
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.220
You know what the reality comes down to,

26
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.350
it's not about Dick size.
It's about how much fucking money you make.

27
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.750
You know what I mean?
You meet some broad Nabar.
What does she say?

28
00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:45.010
How big is your Dick?

29
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.090
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

30
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.690
<v 1>she doesn't,
she says,
what do you do?</v>

31
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.120
All right.
Are you worth my time tonight?
You know,

32
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.380
and even when she's out there,
they're just trolling for some cock.

33
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.850
You know what I mean?
And she's doing a little fucking checking your feet,

34
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.960
your hands maybe taking a glance down to see how you're hanging.
Right.

35
00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:13.120
If he was some dockers and he was sitting down,

36
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.300
I don't know how the fuck they would tell fry.
Um,

37
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.690
she showed up in the bar and sweatpants.

38
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.660
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.480
<v 1>At some point,
even if she's out there just to get bank,</v>

40
00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:30.040
she is going to ask you what you fucking do.
They can help.

41
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.370
And then I guess part of it is,
you know,

42
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.190
you want to get past the awkward conversation and that is,
you know,

43
00:02:36.191 --> 00:02:38.140
what do you do is also like,
you know,
hey,

44
00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:42.310
can you believe this weather and can you believe this weather?
What do you do?

45
00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:44.800
How big is your Dick?
You know,
Bang,
Bang,
Bang.

46
00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:47.800
And they go right down the thing and then that's when they determine if there's

47
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.420
going to be a white one nightstand.

48
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.450
If they're going to pretend you know that they're not just some size queen and

49
00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:58.240
that that,
you know,
maybe they go and they'll start talking about their family.

50
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.600
You know what I mean?
That's when you know you're fucked.

51
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.130
They started talking about their family.
It's like,
Oh God,
not this.

52
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.270
I hope when you were just going to treat me like a piece of meat,

53
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.140
now you want to have a fucking relationship.
Fuck,
I should've lied about my job.

54
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.500
I don't know what I'm talking about.
As always.

55
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:21.880
I have no idea what the fuck I'm talking about.
Am I contractually obligated,

56
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:23.920
even though there's no contract on this podcast,

57
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:26.230
it's a verbal contract and I honor it.

58
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

59
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.870
<v 1>Unlike what happened to Jakey Lee and a bunch of other musicians when they</v>

60
00:03:30.871 --> 00:03:33.630
played with for a certain somebody that everybody thinks is cute.

61
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.690
Oh,
Sharon,
Sharon [inaudible] glad you all remember all that shit.

62
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.610
I went down to fucking Jakey Lee,
Randy Rhodes,

63
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.610
um,
I dunno what you call brown down a rabbit hole.

64
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.590
And then that led me to bring up,

65
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:57.460
I always read up on that fucking case where the original drummer and bass player

66
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.330
never got played on,
uh,
you know,

67
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.090
was it blizzard of Oz and diary of a madman?
Is it?
Well,

68
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.530
the two albums,
I don't fuck it though.

69
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.890
And they actually asked for the money for paying on those things.

70
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:16.360
So they fucking,
oh wait.
They ended up buying the rights to the album.

71
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.080
It was fucking in cruises.
I got this,
I got it.
It was a mini series.

72
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:24.490
It was like the OJ trial,
except with like recording.
So then our,

73
00:04:24.491 --> 00:04:28.810
the Ozzy camp rerecorded the drums in the bass on it.

74
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.570
It's fucking unreal.
Let me,
let me look that shit up.

75
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.800
Let me look that up here as I'm just sitting here babbling.
Um,

76
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.160
but anyways,
Jakey Lee,
what a fucking player.
I know Randy Rhoads is just unreal,

77
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:45.490
but shaky Lee never,
he never gets teen.
Never gets a fucking shout out.

78
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

79
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.270
<v 1>It goes,
it goes from fucking,
you know,
obviously Hendrix,
you know,</v>

80
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:53.890
and then they'll throw some Clapton in there,

81
00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:58.120
then they go to Jimmy page and then boom.
Then it's like Eddie van Halen.

82
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.290
There's like before Eddie and after a,
when it comes to white guys shredders.

83
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.650
And then they always go to Randy Rhodes and then they skip right past it seems

84
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.410
they skip right past Jakey Lee and then they go right to that guy from white

85
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.770
line.
I Dunno.
I Dunno what it is.
No,
cause I've done,

86
00:05:16.771 --> 00:05:19.620
I think they get into the guy,
the fucking speed metal guys.
I have no idea.

87
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.190
All right,
let's see.
Drummer for

88
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.940
blizzard of Oz.
Blizzard of all Aussie.

89
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.560
Uh,
yeah,
Lee Kerslake.

90
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.850
<v 0>Okay.</v>

91
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.800
<v 1>Oh by the way,
just let himself go to health.
Christ Almighty.</v>

92
00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:40.370
He looks like he sold tires his whole fucking life.
That's how much stress,

93
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.100
this whole thing
case,
um,
took on the guy.

94
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:46.700
<v 0>Okay.</v>

95
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.750
<v 1>Alright.
After being fired,
wait a minute.
Where are we?
Where are we?
List of Oz.</v>

96
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.430
Osborne band members.

97
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.680
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

98
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.650
<v 1>He doesn't even have his own fucking Wikipedia page.</v>

99
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.000
Jesus Christ did Ozzy.
Got Some fucking guitars to what?

100
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.260
Randy Rhodes Jakey Lee.
Zack wild.
Steve Vai.

101
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.840
I don't know if any of these other fucking guys broody size,

102
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.420
size on base.
Come on man.

103
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.633
<v 0>Okay.</v>

104
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.461
<v 1>Isn't that crazy?</v>

105
00:06:24.461 --> 00:06:29.390
He had both fucking a bass players surviving bass players from Metallica.

106
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.820
Robert Hilo,
he came in and rerecorded the basis basis where recorded the bass,

107
00:06:33.821 --> 00:06:38.650
I guess.
Jason Newstead,
Tommy Aldridge.

108
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.420
I ran into him and fucking Belgium freaked him out cause I was freaking out

109
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.210
and then I didn't ask for a picture.
He looked relieved.
I was just like,

110
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.170
sorry man.
Thank you for all the great music you've,
you've given me.

111
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.640
I really appreciate it.
He goes,
all right,
cool.
And that was it.
All right,

112
00:06:57.641 --> 00:07:02.020
I'm going to get off this fucking subject.
I'm sorry.
Um,
anyways,

113
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.410
I'm in Saint Petersburg,
Florida.
Tomorrow night.
However,

114
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.200
tonight I am in Tampa to see bump bump,
bump on

115
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.470
[inaudible].
Yeah,
I'm going to see the Patriots play at,
uh,

116
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.880
at Joe Robbie Stadium.
Whatever the fuck they call it up here.
Um,
Donovan Smith.

117
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.690
Fucking memorial stadium.
I don't want you to call it Tampa.
The fucking

118
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:26.060
<v 0>okay.</v>

119
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.680
<v 1>Pirates of the Caribbean stadium.</v>

120
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.010
What the fuck is the name of it that actually has a regular name?

121
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.770
The fuck is Tampa.

122
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.140
God Damn fucking Tampa football stadium.

123
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.200
I know it.
I know this fucking name.
But anyways,

124
00:07:43.201 --> 00:07:48.040
this is the last one I have to go to.
There we go.
Football Stadium.

125
00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:52.930
Come on,
come on.
What's it?
Raymond James Raymond James Stadium.

126
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.840
Um,
this is the last,
uh,

127
00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:01.330
the 32 professional football teams that I need to see a home game of a,

128
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.490
this will be the 34th one that I've been to.

129
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.030
Cause I went to St Louis Rams and also the San Diego chargers and then they both

130
00:08:07.031 --> 00:08:11.740
moved to La and I went to those games because I,
cause I have a problem.
Um,

131
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.310
so I'm looking for,
this is going to be fucking awesome.
Thursday night football,

132
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.580
they're going to get out there and they're under roos wearing all the same

133
00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:23.310
colored fucking clothes.
Now that the Patriots go was blue rather than red.

134
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.550
Um,
the red on red,
Jesus Christ is just,
I don't know,

135
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.440
somebody's going to have to wear it cause I think that a,
but maybe Tampa,

136
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.570
we'll go with the gray.
I don't know guys.

137
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:38.250
I think that they should have a fashion runway to start it.
Um,

138
00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:41.220
so of course the big,
the big question you gotta ask 'em you know,

139
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.100
I'm always into fucking,
uh,
I'm a content,
you know what I mean?

140
00:08:44.101 --> 00:08:46.050
So I don't give a fuck about the wide receivers.

141
00:08:46.051 --> 00:08:48.240
I don't give a shit a bunch of quarterbacks.
Your running back,

142
00:08:48.241 --> 00:08:52.450
what's going on at the offensive line for Christ's sake,

143
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.480
if he can't defend you fucking quarterback and you can't fucking blow open some

144
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.970
God damn holes,
you're not going to make any passes of running again.

145
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.050
I'll tell you right now,
you're not going to go 80 yards in this fucking week.

146
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.770
I gotta be quiet cause this thing is echoing.
So have loud here.
Um,

147
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:13.080
so what does it come down to?
The,
the fucking diva.
The offensive line.

148
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.450
All right.
They'll rock star the one that makes all the fucking money.

149
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.950
Nobody cares about the fucking guards.
Nobody gives a shit about the center.

150
00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:25.650
Nobody gives a fuck about the right tackle.

151
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.400
It's all about the left tackle in the NFL,
protecting the blind side.

152
00:09:29.401 --> 00:09:32.820
Unless you have a lefty,
unless she have a lefty.

153
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.360
How many lefty NFL fucking quarterbacks are there?

154
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.560
And how pissed is the left tackle on that fucking line?

155
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:46.110
You know,
he finally gets his name,
shouted out the naked soldier,

156
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.780
right?
Cause that he say themed naked soldier.

157
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:53.640
He's only been with us for fucking ever.
They just never say his name,

158
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:57.940
cause he rarely fucks up.
Donovan Smith,
I see you met new thing.

159
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.400
No one the left tackles no one who's making the money up there on the offensive

160
00:10:03.401 --> 00:10:07.780
line.
So according to the scouting report,
Donovan Smith,
a Penn State guy,

161
00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:11.650
Penn state guys,
always,
always solid football players.

162
00:10:11.651 --> 00:10:14.470
Just a great program up there when they're not up there touching kids,

163
00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:18.010
they just do wonderful things.
Wonderful Goddamn things,
you know,

164
00:10:18.011 --> 00:10:21.130
and they're not snapping towels and unsuspecting eight year olds,
sorry,

165
00:10:21.131 --> 00:10:25.270
Penn state,
you fucking earned it.
All right.
And you know good.
And God damn well,

166
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.680
despite what happened up there,

167
00:10:26.681 --> 00:10:29.470
you still want to see the Joe Pa statute come back.
And what does that,

168
00:10:29.471 --> 00:10:32.600
what does that say about you?
Um,

169
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.600
what does that say about statues?
What is,
you know what I do love about,
you know,

170
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.490
Penn state and it's not the molestation of children.
What I love,

171
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.410
you're going to get it.
This civic,
I'm going to give the Catholic church shit.

172
00:10:48.411 --> 00:10:51.050
I got to give it to you too.
You know what I mean?

173
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:56.410
Penn state football program was like the Catholic Church fucking slide up.

174
00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.230
You know what I mean?
Like the Catholic churches,

175
00:11:00.231 --> 00:11:04.010
like the Big Burger with the bacon on it when it comes to fucking rape in kids.

176
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:08.920
And uh,
but you know,
just sheer number,
you know,
if you looked at,

177
00:11:08.921 --> 00:11:11.270
at,
at,
at molested kids,

178
00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.120
like you were counting calories,

179
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.660
all right there definitely that Wendy's triple cheeseburger,

180
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.150
the Catholic churches where Penn state is just,
that's,
you know,

181
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.810
little sliders.
I'm just going to have,
I'm just going to nibble.

182
00:11:25.811 --> 00:11:29.590
I told myself I've been doing so great at the gym.
I could cheat tonight,

183
00:11:29.591 --> 00:11:34.420
but I'm check's going to fucking nibble.
Um,
what I do love about the Penn State,

184
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:39.190
uh,
and I realize it wasn't everybody up there who is raping children.

185
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.820
Okay.
Now that's when you know,
you've,
I know that's when you know,

186
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:47.890
your program is in trouble.
When in order to defend it you have to say,

187
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.170
hey,
not everybody was up there raping kids.

188
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:56.080
Bump.
Um,
all right.

189
00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:01.450
I just liked that they have the basic simple fucking uniforms.
Okay.

190
00:12:01.451 --> 00:12:05.560
Cause I gotta be honest with you,
the first time I saw those Oregon ducks,

191
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.160
those crazy uniforms,
I was like,
what the fuck is that?

192
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:11.980
And then after a while I kinda liked him like,
Eh,
you know,
it's Kinda cool,

193
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.490
whatever.

194
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:16.930
But now it's just become a fucking fashion show and there's a bunch of Shitty

195
00:12:16.931 --> 00:12:20.140
fucking football programs out there.
You know what I'm talking about?

196
00:12:20.141 --> 00:12:21.340
University of Illinois,

197
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.790
where the fuck do you get off with that disco ball in your head?

198
00:12:24.791 --> 00:12:28.660
Like you've never even sniffed a big 10 championship since we were even in

199
00:12:28.661 --> 00:12:31.360
fucking Vietnam.
Let's look that up right now.

200
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.250
Let's look that up right fucking now.

201
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.970
When was the last time that basketball school won a big time?

202
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:41.230
Big 10 champ championship.
I can't fucking talk.
All right.

203
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.850
University of Indiana's,
I suppose I saying Illinois.
Sorry,
Indiana.
Um,

204
00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:55.560
last big 10 football.

205
00:12:55.561 --> 00:12:59.670
I guarantee you we were in covered covered wagons here.
Football Championship.

206
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.970
<v 0>Okay.</v>

207
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:06.490
<v 1>I guarantee you the starting 11 were all white guys.
Indiana.</v>

208
00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:10.580
Who's your football?
Here we go.
This ought to be a quick Wikipedia page.

209
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:16.220
All right.
Um,
why am I picking on these guys?
All right.
Location,

210
00:13:16.221 --> 00:13:20.840
conference,
bowl,
record three and eight.
Conference titles.
Two,

211
00:13:20.841 --> 00:13:24.510
they won one in 1945.
Baba Dopa.

212
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.190
[inaudible] we won the war.
Let's all make kids.
Let's all cure diseases.

213
00:13:31.191 --> 00:13:35.510
Then we'll have a bunch of hurricanes cause with throwing plastic in the ocean.

214
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.170
I'm 1967 because

215
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:43.460
I will not seek,

216
00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:48.490
nor will I accept a second term as your prayer.

217
00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.970
Who the fuck does
LBJ Sing?

218
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.370
And Sunshiny Life,
Huh?

219
00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:59.120
Who should be is more importantly probably the question.

220
00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:05.390
Um,
so anyways,
I'm going to the fucking game tonight.
Uh,
look for

221
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:10.520
Jameson Winston to have a career day because our defense is like the make a wish

222
00:14:10.521 --> 00:14:14.090
foundation opposing quarterback.
What is your dream?
Gee,

223
00:14:14.091 --> 00:14:18.020
I've always wanted to throw for 400 yards.
No problem.

224
00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.650
Not only are we gonna make that happen,
we're going to do it in the first half.

225
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.140
[inaudible] all right,
go fuck yourself now.

226
00:14:27.141 --> 00:14:31.190
I just trashed my own team before you guys all get all butthurt no fucking pun

227
00:14:31.191 --> 00:14:35.450
intended.
All right about me.
Making fun of your Goddamn team.

228
00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:40.680
Donovan Smith is the left tackle
for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

229
00:14:40.681 --> 00:14:41.970
He is from Penn state.

230
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:45.630
He is evidently according to the one scouting report that I looked up,

231
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:49.080
has yet to live up to his potential

232
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:55.160
quick footed,
very athletic for his size,
has great hands,

233
00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.350
but has yet to live up to his potential.
I don't know if that's true or not,

234
00:15:00.351 --> 00:15:05.210
but if it is,
then I am going to,
I want to nominate him for the delight.
Howard,

235
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:10.130
not the white.
The white white people do White Howard,
not white.

236
00:15:10.131 --> 00:15:14.540
Dwight Black Dwight Dwight.
All right,
Howard.

237
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.360
Given the Dwight Howard award,

238
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:22.160
every time you look at Dwight Howard,
you gotta be thinking,

239
00:15:22.161 --> 00:15:25.400
what the fuck is wrong with that guy?

240
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.210
That guy is like,
he's like a fucking superhero.

241
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:30.760
<v 2>Okay.</v>

242
00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.040
<v 1>He's so God damn big.
It's so strong.
It's like,</v>

243
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.840
why don't you just steal one move from Kevin Mchale two from a chemo lodge one

244
00:15:37.841 --> 00:15:39.940
and just dominate the fucking league.

245
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:43.280
I don't know what he does all day.

246
00:15:43.281 --> 00:15:45.560
He looks like he does curls and goes to the barber shop.

247
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:49.443
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

248
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:55.040
<v 1>hair is always perfect.
He's always fucking shredded,
but he just like,</v>

249
00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:59.330
there's no fire in the man's game,
you know,

250
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:04.130
you know when you go and get play pickup hoop,
right.
Mike,
I've done that.

251
00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:07.120
And this decade I haven't played,
I can't remember the last time I play pickup.

252
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:11.660
Who put the fucking worst was,
well,
if you got that little fella garden,

253
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.730
you're on defense.
You know what I mean?
And you'd fuck it.

254
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:16.550
Fucking guy was just all over you.

255
00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.213
<v 2>You know what I mean?</v>

256
00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:22.210
<v 1>His fucking junk was right on your leg.
It's like,
I get it.
I get it.</v>

257
00:16:22.211 --> 00:16:27.100
You're taking this seriously where you get the fuck off me and you're up full

258
00:16:27.101 --> 00:16:28.780
court fucking press.
It's like,
buddy,

259
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:33.490
we're just out here to fucking burn off some calories.
You know,

260
00:16:33.491 --> 00:16:36.430
we all ate a Caesar Salad and then just figured out the dressing.

261
00:16:36.431 --> 00:16:39.130
It was like eating a fucking burger.
Can you just,

262
00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:41.980
can you let me just run to the fucking half court line?

263
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.823
<v 2>Um,</v>

264
00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.000
<v 1>anyways,
so,
uh,
yeah,</v>

265
00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.910
I don't know what the fuck is going on with our defense.
Um,

266
00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.760
I have no idea.
As I mentioned,

267
00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.710
as I mentioned on our last podcast,
our safeties

268
00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:06.000
and and in our corner,
one of our corners,

269
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.610
they've all played with each other for fucking years.

270
00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.180
And the only thing the new guys is Stefan Gilmore and I,

271
00:17:12.181 --> 00:17:16.740
I can't imagine that the entire defense is going to shit because of one fucking

272
00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:21.570
cornerback.
I left the watch tonight sitting up high.

273
00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.260
What does he play?
Does he play on the right side of the defense?
I don't know.

274
00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.100
All I know is Tampa doesn't have any fucking sacks for this year.

275
00:17:29.101 --> 00:17:30.630
I kept looking up.
There's no fucking way.

276
00:17:30.631 --> 00:17:33.900
They have no sex when in October they have no sex.

277
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:35.570
<v 2>Okay.</v>

278
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.690
<v 1>You don't,
I I they protesting.
Um,</v>

279
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.330
I dunno what violence against fucking white quarterbacks.

280
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.730
You never know what the NFL,
it's always about a co,
uh,

281
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.100
cause they finally got rid of the pink.

282
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.280
Now it's still mystic violence awareness month as if nobody aware that there was

283
00:17:51.391 --> 00:17:53.670
domestic violence.
You know,

284
00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:58.870
I'll tell you what's fucked up is anytime professional football player beats his

285
00:17:58.871 --> 00:18:01.990
wife,
it becomes a national fucking news.
Okay.

286
00:18:01.991 --> 00:18:04.510
Yet a plumber can slap his wife around.

287
00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:08.380
Threw a fucking 25 30 year marriage and you're never going to hear about it on

288
00:18:08.381 --> 00:18:13.010
ESPN,
are Ya?
No,
you are not.
And what are they going to do?

289
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:18.190
They're going to create this false fucking image that athletes are the only ones

290
00:18:18.441 --> 00:18:23.441
out there who occasionally flip out when there's ranch dressing rather than blue

291
00:18:25.321 --> 00:18:27.570
cheese for their buffalo wings.
Right?

292
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:28.913
<v 2>Okay.</v>

293
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.980
<v 1>God forbid if an athlete does something,
it's all over the fucking news.</v>

294
00:18:34.981 --> 00:18:36.060
But if an accountant,

295
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:37.180
<v 2>okay,</v>

296
00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:40.760
<v 1>accountant fucking starts shaking his wife a little bit too much in an apple.</v>

297
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.290
Bese you know,
does ESPN,
do they cover that?

298
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:45.200
<v 2>Okay.</v>

299
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:50.120
<v 1>Does the NFL suspend that account?
No,
they do not.</v>

300
00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.470
So I want to ask you,
how much does ESPN,

301
00:18:53.471 --> 00:18:58.471
how much does the NFL truly care until they start covering the domestic violence

302
00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:03.730
done by all men comedians too.
I'll tell you right now,

303
00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.350
I put my wife in a triangle right before I went on the road.
Okay?
I said,

304
00:19:08.351 --> 00:19:11.480
this house is going to be clean when I get home.
Um,

305
00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.980
this isn't a funny topic.
This should not be joked about.

306
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.540
I'm now going to fucking grand stand about it as I wear clothes that were made

307
00:19:22.541 --> 00:19:26.170
in a sweatshop
because I care.

308
00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.940
I got my wife with a good one yesterday.
Um,

309
00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:36.280
I texted her,
uh,
I texted her,
hey,

310
00:19:36.281 --> 00:19:39.670
when I get back to town,
I'm going to take you to Barney's.
You know,

311
00:19:39.671 --> 00:19:41.380
it's this fancy clothing place,
right?

312
00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:44.830
That I never heard about until there was a woman in my life.
And that is,

313
00:19:44.831 --> 00:19:46.540
that is a 100% truth.

314
00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.300
And then they turn around and they wonder why every once in a while they catch

315
00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.830
your backhand.
We're taking collars.
Um,

316
00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.420
<v 2>I uh,</v>

317
00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.570
<v 1>yeah,
it's a fancy place.
This clothing store called Barneys.
So I text her,</v>

318
00:20:01.571 --> 00:20:06.070
you know,
cause now that I have the little one,
my little boo bear,

319
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:11.140
um,
the level of guilt that I have when I go on the fucking road.

320
00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.470
I mean,
I gotta to ask other parents like,

321
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.380
when do you hit the ceiling of the love that you feel for your kid?

322
00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:22.020
It's like every day.
It just,
it just keeps,
you know what I mean?
It's like a,

323
00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:25.150
it's like Wah,
you know,
I don't watch game of Thrones,

324
00:20:25.151 --> 00:20:28.900
but like every year when the new season comes out,

325
00:20:28.901 --> 00:20:32.410
like the fucking excitement gets higher.
And I always think,
well,

326
00:20:32.411 --> 00:20:36.820
at some point it's got to level off and it's not happening.

327
00:20:36.821 --> 00:20:41.821
So like if you've never had a kid coming home to your kid is the same level of

328
00:20:42.101 --> 00:20:46.330
excitement of these nerds on Twitter when a new season of game of Thrones comes

329
00:20:46.331 --> 00:20:50.740
out.
Okay.
The same falsetto excitement goes into your voice.

330
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.630
It's unbelievable.
Um,
so I have a tremendous amount of guilt,
uh,
when I leave now,

331
00:20:55.631 --> 00:20:59.350
but I mean,
everybody's got to eat.
So I gotta you know,
I mean,

332
00:20:59.351 --> 00:21:04.180
a plumber keeps plumbing is sinks.
Right?
Um,
so,

333
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:05.763
um,

334
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:07.893
<v 2>okay,</v>

335
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:12.160
<v 1>what the fuck was my point
coming home?
Oh yeah.</v>

336
00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:17.430
So I have all this guilt.
So,
um,
I texted Nia,
I said,

337
00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:22.290
hey Neil,
when I get home,
when I get back,
I'm taking it to Barney's.

338
00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:27.510
And she goes,
she's like,
oh my God,
explanation.
At some point she goes,
yes,

339
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:30.930
<v 3>really?
And then I text back beanery</v>

340
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.990
Oh,
I got it.

341
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:39.350
<v 1>The good one.
And she's such a hot shit.
She fucking laughed.</v>

342
00:21:39.351 --> 00:21:42.000
RSF Barney's beanery by the way,
is a a,

343
00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:47.380
isn't isn't a an La eatery out here where they give you a completely

344
00:21:47.511 --> 00:21:49.940
irresponsible level of food when you go in there.

345
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:53.720
[inaudible] irresponsible if you cared about human life,

346
00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.110
a heroic portion of food,

347
00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:02.680
if you're truly informed and concerned about the environmental issues that are

348
00:22:03.531 --> 00:22:04.460
about to hit us.

349
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:12.550
Last week I was writing for hurricane monthly

350
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:18.820
and if you look up that article recently,
I want a doctorate at uh,

351
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:22.870
at Massasoit community college and now I feel I know things.

352
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.900
So of course now I'm going to have people refer to me as a doctor for the rest

353
00:22:28.571 --> 00:22:32.530
of my life.
Like bill Cosby did bill,
cause we always do that.

354
00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:36.310
Dr Bill Cosby.
It's like,
dude,
you got an honorary degree.

355
00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.560
Unless I'm out of my fucking mind,
I shouldn't have said his name.

356
00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:44.010
Speaking of Penn state.
Oh Geez.
It's spelled Jesus.
Jesus.
Yeah,

357
00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.020
everybody's just getting trashed on this one.
Well,
you know what,

358
00:22:47.021 --> 00:22:50.920
I'm a little grumpy.
Okay.
I took a fucking rent out.
You know,
it was funny.

359
00:22:50.921 --> 00:22:52.090
I'm sitting there saying I miss my kid,

360
00:22:52.091 --> 00:22:55.150
but I'm still a selfish cut and came out here a day early to go to a football

361
00:22:55.151 --> 00:22:58.480
game to,
to fucking well,
you know what?
I still act out my hobbies.

362
00:22:58.481 --> 00:23:01.180
I'm a big believer in that.
You gotta be a little selfish.
Still's a debt.

363
00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.550
All right,
Bill,
Talk Yourself off the guilt ledge.

364
00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:08.380
Give yourself the free fucking pass here.
No,

365
00:23:08.381 --> 00:23:09.880
you still have to have you fucking hobby.

366
00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:11.963
<v 2>Um,</v>

367
00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.470
<v 1>you know something to look forward to when the,
when your kid,</v>

368
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.020
you're fucking bundle of joy finally falls asleep.
You know what I mean?

369
00:23:19.021 --> 00:23:22.440
Everybody goes,
Hey,
when your kids sleeps you sleep.
You know what I say?

370
00:23:22.441 --> 00:23:25.450
I say fuck that.
You go out in the garage,
you play a couple of paradiddles.

371
00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:29.550
All right?
You go on the Internet and you learn how to fly a crazy train.

372
00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.090
That's what you do,
okay?

373
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:38.960
You don't sleep before sleep is for liberals that care about other air quote

374
00:23:39.841 --> 00:23:43.650
care about other people,
okay?
If you look at conservative people,

375
00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.370
those people never sleep,
okay?

376
00:23:46.371 --> 00:23:49.610
Cause they don't like anybody and they just sit there staring out their fucking

377
00:23:49.611 --> 00:23:53.030
window.
Even if they have a conservative next door neighbor,

378
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:57.320
they do not trust them.
Okay.
Cause they are,

379
00:23:57.321 --> 00:23:59.420
they are type A,
can you be a type a liberal?

380
00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.840
I don't know what type A is type A is fucking annoying.
You know what I mean?

381
00:24:04.841 --> 00:24:06.130
That's basically what it is.

382
00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:11.920
Type based the kind of person that needs a fucking entourage.
Right.

383
00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:15.400
Type A's,
the kind of person that goes through the security line at the airport.

384
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.860
Right.
And when he goes,
gets to the other side,

385
00:24:17.861 --> 00:24:20.980
takes all his fucking shit out and doesn't fucking get,

386
00:24:20.981 --> 00:24:24.040
has been out of the fucking way.
He doesn't give a shit.
It's all about him.

387
00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:25.913
<v 2>You know,</v>

388
00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:31.200
<v 1>if you broke,
if you did like a fucking,
uh,</v>

389
00:24:31.201 --> 00:24:35.220
an airport security combine,
okay.

390
00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:39.630
And you watched me go through,
rather than running the 40 yard deaths,
it's,

391
00:24:39.631 --> 00:24:42.480
you get in,
you're getting ready to get,

392
00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:46.440
you have all your shit off and your fucking laptop out.
Okay.

393
00:24:46.441 --> 00:24:50.160
I would test off the fucking charts.
Of course.

394
00:24:50.161 --> 00:24:52.470
I'll always be the slow fucking white dude that I am,

395
00:24:52.471 --> 00:24:54.570
but when I get to the other fucking side,

396
00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:56.730
<v 2>all right,</v>

397
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:59.250
<v 1>well when I get to the other side,</v>

398
00:24:59.251 --> 00:25:02.870
after I'd been fucking slowly cooked in that little microwave that they sticky

399
00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.970
in,
which you know,
something I've actually just given into at this point,

400
00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:11.280
if they want to slowly kill me,
I say good.
I say good for them.
You know,

401
00:25:11.281 --> 00:25:15.690
why?
Because we're overpopulated and who am I to say that I should still be here?

402
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:21.030
Lead the lizard people fucking kill everybody and start over again with the

403
00:25:21.031 --> 00:25:23.650
robots.
We're taking calls.
Um,

404
00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:26.970
so I get through when I get on the other side.

405
00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:31.440
That's when Bill Belichick's gonna draft me when everybody else looks past me.

406
00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:36.270
Okay.
With my Bunker Hill community college educational background,

407
00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:40.650
just given all kinds of community colleges shouts out from Massachusetts.

408
00:25:40.651 --> 00:25:45.570
Shout outs this week,
this Thursday.
Um,
this is when

409
00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:48.323
bill Belicheck,

410
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:53.160
we finally smiled like the Grinch at the end of the Grinch stole Christmas is

411
00:25:53.161 --> 00:25:58.161
when he saw me fucking not only get my fucking bins,

412
00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.660
I grabbed everybody else's bins

413
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:03.280
<v 2>and</v>

414
00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:07.510
<v 1>Mumble,
come on people loud enough for people to hear,</v>

415
00:26:07.511 --> 00:26:09.640
but not loud enough for anyone to address me,

416
00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:11.890
<v 2>right?
Okay.</v>

417
00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:16.330
<v 1>And he sees that I lead by example,</v>

418
00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:19.760
but the,

419
00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:23.040
the level of judging that I do when I go through the fucking airport security

420
00:26:23.041 --> 00:26:23.550
line,

421
00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:26.640
and when you fucking take your shit out of the band and you just fucking leave

422
00:26:26.641 --> 00:26:31.620
it there,
I'm like,
you are a selfish fucking cunt.
You're a terrible mother.

423
00:26:31.621 --> 00:26:34.770
You're a terrible father.
You're a terrible fucking person.

424
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:36.493
<v 2>Okay?</v>

425
00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:42.290
<v 1>And if I was as blessed is that fat fucking North Korea to be running everything</v>

426
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:47.760
and stealing all the ham,
keeping it all from myself,
right?

427
00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.650
He gets a haircut every day.
That's selfish.
Fuck,

428
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:52.920
<v 0>okay.</v>

429
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.010
<v 1>There's all these people are fucking starving probably because of the economic</v>

430
00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.700
stank shanks and sanctions that the free world has placed upon him.

431
00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:03.930
And he's like,
fuck that.
I'm the leader.
I get all the pork chops.

432
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:09.080
I need to stay clear between my big butcher block fucking head.

433
00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:16.340
All right.
I need to stay clear to know when it is,
when it's time,

434
00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.190
because we're dealing with the loo.
I want to how scared they are of Trump.

435
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:21.500
It's just kind of fun.

436
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:25.260
This is like we're matching crazy homeless guy to crazy homeless guy.

437
00:27:25.261 --> 00:27:25.640
I remember that.

438
00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:30.290
Those things bumfights that's what's going on at the fucking political level.

439
00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:34.300
This is a bum fight.
Alright.

440
00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:36.400
Don't let the uniform in the fucking suit,

441
00:27:36.401 --> 00:27:38.710
which a lot of people will say is a uniform.

442
00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:44.490
A lot of people in the liberal arts major of a college will say that it is a,

443
00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:47.380
that it is a uniform,
that it is a boys club.

444
00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:48.970
<v 0>Okay.</v>

445
00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:53.530
<v 1>That it is a system that needs to be shut down and they'll say this as they</v>

446
00:27:53.531 --> 00:27:54.790
don't wear a fucking Bra.

447
00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:59.020
What the Ted swinging two and fucking fro as if they're making a statement.

448
00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.650
I love that thing that women want to do,
like the people who,

449
00:28:01.651 --> 00:28:04.330
the women that are rejecting bras.
It's just,

450
00:28:04.331 --> 00:28:08.050
this is some sort of restricted thing.
It's like,
Hey,
we were doing you a favor.

451
00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.850
We already stair your titties enough.

452
00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:13.030
If you want to walk around with the nipple sticking out of your fucking shirt,

453
00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:17.290
if you ever think that that's going to get fucking old on our side of the fence,

454
00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:21.760
I say,
you remove your bras and you room,
you remove them.
Now,
um,

455
00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:26.410
you know I should do more podcasts with 50 foot ceilings.
I think my ego just it.

456
00:28:26.411 --> 00:28:30.250
There's finally enough space in a room for my fucking head.

457
00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:36.160
I'm excited.
I'm going to a football game tonight.

458
00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.750
My last one,

459
00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:43.390
my last one that I have to go to and I've been to all the baseball,

460
00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:47.140
all of the football.
Who the fuck can say that?
You think I'm going to stop there?

461
00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:51.190
I'm not.
I'm going to see all the hockey and all the basketball.

462
00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.350
You think I'm going to stop there?
I'm not.

463
00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:58.870
I went to the Daytona 500 I'm going to Talladega next year.

464
00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:02.140
I've been to the Kentucky Derby.
I don't give it this.
I'm doing the fucking road.

465
00:29:02.141 --> 00:29:04.990
I'm going to every breads circus.

466
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:10.510
So put your fucking thoughts on hold sporting event that this great nation has.

467
00:29:11.231 --> 00:29:16.180
And when I'm done here,
I'm going overseas.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

468
00:29:16.181 --> 00:29:19.720
Do think I'm fucking above going to a cricket match.

469
00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:21.230
<v 0>Okay.</v>

470
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:25.670
<v 1>Arguably the greatest drinking game ever,
ever created.</v>

471
00:29:25.671 --> 00:29:28.370
If you go to a traditional one,
it takes a fucking week to play.

472
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:33.200
You can literally go on a week long fucking bender and your wife can't say

473
00:29:33.201 --> 00:29:36.470
anything.
It's like what honey?
I told you I was going to the game.

474
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:43.000
Am Am I allowed to have a little bit of fun life?
Um,

475
00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:44.620
NHL starts tonight.

476
00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.240
[inaudible] um,

477
00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:55.630
and I believe I heard through the grapevine that ESPN guts the Formula One

478
00:29:55.631 --> 00:29:58.990
contract for next year.
So ESPN,
could you do me a favor?

479
00:29:58.991 --> 00:30:03.991
Can you please not apply your progressive formula?

480
00:30:04.211 --> 00:30:06.160
Whatever the fuck it is that you're doing.

481
00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:12.220
I know you've taken on water over there because everybody's watching sports on

482
00:30:12.221 --> 00:30:17.080
the app,
but can you please,
can you please keep Formula One,

483
00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:19.930
the international gym that it is?

484
00:30:19.931 --> 00:30:24.931
Can you please not replace everybody and get a bunch of Americans in there,

485
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:26.313
right.

486
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:30.820
One from each race like they do on the MTV w real world.

487
00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.550
And then you have a woman running it,
whatever it is.

488
00:30:33.551 --> 00:30:37.360
And then in the end you feel good about yourselves before you go back to your

489
00:30:37.361 --> 00:30:40.000
white,
your whites only gated community.

490
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:45.460
I'm fucking with you.
I don't give a shit.
Just,

491
00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:47.110
I don't give a fuck if it's all women.

492
00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.590
I don't give a fuck if everybody's healing helion.

493
00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.660
However you say Kenya Chess,

494
00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:56.740
get somebody out there that knows what the fuck they're talking about and can

495
00:30:56.741 --> 00:31:00.550
deliver their points without screaming movie quotes.

496
00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:02.220
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

497
00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.680
<v 1>Okay.
Can you do that?</v>

498
00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:10.580
Can you do that without going around the horn and having some fucking goddamn

499
00:31:10.581 --> 00:31:13.850
air raid siren going off for fucking every 20 minutes?

500
00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:15.990
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

501
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.751
<v 1>that fucking show.</v>

502
00:31:16.751 --> 00:31:20.890
If anybody can explain to me how points are earned and lost on that show,
uh,

503
00:31:20.891 --> 00:31:22.920
I swear to God you should be running this nation.

504
00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:24.500
<v 0>Okay.</v>

505
00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.290
<v 1>All right.
Ah,
you,
why you guys listening?</v>

506
00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:30.030
This is just the ramblings of a crabby old man.
I'll tell you,

507
00:31:30.031 --> 00:31:31.290
you know something that I don't understand.

508
00:31:31.291 --> 00:31:34.800
I don't understand why the Internet every fucking day has to tell me that this

509
00:31:34.801 --> 00:31:37.470
is the greatest fucking thing that I'm ever going to see.

510
00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.860
And I also don't understand why I'm so fucking stupid.

511
00:31:40.861 --> 00:31:44.730
Like a moth flying towards a fucking bright light in the middle of the night.

512
00:31:44.731 --> 00:31:47.700
I always click on it and it,
oh,
it always underwhelms me

513
00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.350
like the Shannon sharp thing this week.

514
00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:54.350
What the fuck was so fucking amazing about that?

515
00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:00.090
I'm on that and mild in that hand dog and everybody,

516
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:02.880
like the one that I clicked on was,

517
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:08.370
and it was at this moment that Shannon sharp became the president of the United

518
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:12.990
States.
He's putting a cheap cigar in his mouth,

519
00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.180
making a reference to the boozy lakes.

520
00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:20.320
That's the greatest thing that ever happened.
I mean,
I,
I guess,
I don't know.

521
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.590
You're telling me you're telling me like that that's better than,
than

522
00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:29.403
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>

523
00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:33.970
<v 1>When Ozzie played live
on that fucking TV show,</v>

524
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:38.590
it looks like a basic cable show and he came out with a track suit that said

525
00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:43.440
Ozzie on it in case he forgot what his fucking name was.
And he had Rudy SARS,

526
00:32:43.441 --> 00:32:44.630
O on Bass,

527
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:51.740
Randy Rhodes on guitar and fucking Tommy Aldridge on drums.
And you see,

528
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.940
you see like Ozzie literally turning around in awe of his own fucking band.

529
00:32:55.941 --> 00:32:56.840
You're telling me

530
00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:03.390
that a guy taking a Dutch master and he we want to get,

531
00:33:03.391 --> 00:33:08.270
if he had the fucking bottle of booze right there,
you know what it is built.

532
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:13.280
It's just young people having fun and you're taking it literally and you know

533
00:33:13.281 --> 00:33:15.950
what you're doing.
You're doing what you said you always weren't going to do,

534
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:19.580
which is you.
You were not going to hang around young people.
You,

535
00:33:19.581 --> 00:33:22.880
you knew that your time had come and gone and you're going to let them have

536
00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:27.140
their fucking fun.
You know what?
So I apologize.
You guys are absolutely right.

537
00:33:27.141 --> 00:33:30.020
That was the greatest thing that ever happened and he should be the next wall.

538
00:33:30.021 --> 00:33:33.740
I mean the next leader,
that'd be actually a great fucking thing.

539
00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:38.741
If you had him as leader and then he was communicating with that guy in North

540
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:41.450
Korea,

541
00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:45.950
then the guy in North Korea could not get mad because he could not understand

542
00:33:45.951 --> 00:33:47.600
what the fuck Shannon sharp's talking about.

543
00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:53.020
Do you remember in World War II when we had like native Americans speaking in a

544
00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.600
communicate and shit and the Japanese couldn't crack it yet?

545
00:33:56.601 --> 00:34:00.650
Shannon sharp is the modern day version of that.
I'll never understand it.

546
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:02.323
I don't want us to,

547
00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.940
because I could understand every fucking word that he said as a pro.

548
00:34:04.941 --> 00:34:09.020
He was fucking hilarious,
you know,
sending the Patriot missiles and all that.

549
00:34:09.021 --> 00:34:13.490
The second he became a commentator,
I don't know what happened.
I'm all right,

550
00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:17.930
Lou crate,
so he stuck his tongue in a fucking beehive.
All right,

551
00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:20.480
Luke crate be the envy.

subscriptions.

555
00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:34.280
The nerve of me saying that Shannon is difficult to understand when I can't even

556
00:34:34.281 --> 00:34:39.230
fucking read out loud.
October's loot crate theme is mythical.

557
00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:45.600
Luke crate offers an epic range of pop culture items for less than $20 a month.

558
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:51.550
If you're more of a fanatical fashionista than try loot where all of this shit's

559
00:34:52.941 --> 00:34:56.600
going to end in an ocean someday and in at least develop a tropical storm

franchises.
If you want to get fancy,

562
00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:10.610
if you want to get a bigger box with even bigger loop with Lou crate dx a,

563
00:35:10.611 --> 00:35:11.630
you hear the stories,

564
00:35:11.631 --> 00:35:15.170
the whispers of creatures and beings beyond your imagination.

565
00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.620
I go every time.
I think it's a phrase,
it's a fucking sentence.

566
00:35:19.621 --> 00:35:22.650
I don't even know what I'm saying here.
You hear the stories,

567
00:35:22.651 --> 00:35:26.420
the whispers of creatures and beings beyond imaginations.

582
00:36:20.911 --> 00:36:23.490
they could literally write that in Spanish and I would fucking understand it

583
00:36:23.491 --> 00:36:27.720
just as much as what I just said there thoughtfully.
Everybody me out,

everyone at some point has wished they could have have beer,

585

wine or liquor delivered.
Oh,
absolutely.
Absolute fucking Lily.

586
00:36:36.371 --> 00:36:39.160
We have,
well,
someone finally decided to do something about it.

587
00:36:39.161 --> 00:36:42.580
I love it and I loved the John Wade vibe of this copy.

588
00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:45.290
<v 2>Um,</v>

589
00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:48.890
<v 1>okay.
Next please mention all of the talking points below.</v>

590
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:50.420
Well just write them and I'll read them.

591
00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:54.890
Introducing thoughtfully the alcohol delivery app,

592
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:59.750
saucy delivers your favorite wine,
beer and liquor,
right to your door on demand.

593
00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:01.970
You know,
I watched this fucking twilight zone,

594
00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:05.683
<v 2>um,</v>

595
00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:11.050
<v 1>the twilight zone of what's it called,
16 millimeter prison or whatever.</v>

596
00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:14.200
And it was about this aging ingenue.

597
00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:17.440
She used to be this big star in the 1930s and she couldn't handle the fact that

598
00:37:17.441 --> 00:37:18.520
she wasn't young anymore.

599
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:23.670
So she just sat in her mansion in this dark room watching all of her old movies,

600
00:37:24.401 --> 00:37:29.350
drinking booze.
And as I watched it,
I was like,
I would love to fucking do that.

601
00:37:29.351 --> 00:37:31.660
What'd you just love to take a decade off from your life?

602
00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:36.700
You can just watch old home movies of back when you were sober,
you know,

603
00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:40.630
to get out of bed without making noises and shit.
Ah,
right.

604
00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:42.310
And just sit there and you know,

605
00:37:42.311 --> 00:37:46.550
there is some to be said about drinking yourself to death,
you know,

606

as long as you can walk around like a nice fancy evening gown with a train like

607
00:37:49.961 --> 00:37:53.710

634
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:30.730

642
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:04.960

643

This is fucking ridiculous.

644

666
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:38.570
like you have way too many fucking photos on your fucking wall.

00:41:38.571 --> 00:41:42.170
is this person stalking somebody?

any blood clots from whatever the fuck I did to my leg.
You know what I mean?

710
00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:20.790
They didn't want to stroke out while I was doing fucking jumping jacks.
Um,

711
00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:24.330
so anyways,
Jesus Christ,
it's fucking hilarious.

712
00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:27.270
You go in there and sometimes they let you use headphones from what I've heard.

713
00:44:27.271 --> 00:44:30.600
But my place that I went to,
which by the way was fucking hilarious.

714
00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:34.410
I'll walk and the chick behind the desk is all tatted up and I'm like,

715
00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:38.040
like to the point,
it's like,
do you play in a band?
If you don't,
you should.

716
00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:41.910
She look like a rock star,
but she's wearing scrubs.
You know,

717
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:44.040
that should've been my first red flag.

718
00:44:44.041 --> 00:44:47.460
Like what kind of fucking medical places is,
I mean she was Cooley Shit.

719
00:44:47.461 --> 00:44:48.330
But I'm just saying,
you know,

720
00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:52.140
so then I go down there and when I get out it's cash only.

721
00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:57.810
The second business is cash only and there's not a bunch of of Italians running

722
00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:59.610
it.
I'm like,
all right,
what the fuck is going on here?

723
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:03.090
There's something about Italians cash only.
You know what I mean?
It's just,

724
00:45:03.091 --> 00:45:07.920
it's like,
oh,
that piece of America that's now gone.
It's actually quaint,

725
00:45:07.921 --> 00:45:11.820
but everybody else,
I'm like,
what kind of fucking funny shit is going on here?

726
00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:15.840
Um,
all right,
so that's the podcast here.
Oh,
look at that.

727
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:20.880
I'll give you 45 minutes on a Thursday.
Um,
that's it.
Oh,
Billy.
No Fun.

728
00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:24.990
49 days.
No Busan,
no fucking Busan.

729
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:30.600
Um,
oh Geez.
I gotta take this call.
All right.
Have a great weekend.

730
00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.880
Your cons and I'll,
uh,
I'll talk to you on Monday there.

731
00:45:47.890 --> 00:45:50.530
<v 4>She's
out of town at</v>

732
00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:57.640
[inaudible] college.
Beulah rat with dominion and boas on it.

733
00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:58.810
Indiana nine

734
00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:11.570
[inaudible] down here.

735
00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:15.800
The AGTS to the board's way was more than they'd seen.

736
00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:16.970
I was in

737
00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:32.803
[inaudible]

738
00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:53.753
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

739
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:04.320
<v 5>Ah,
wife's family.
The secret upstairs.
Alright.
Hey,</v>

740
00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:06.450
bill loved the podcast and all the bullshit.

741
00:47:06.451 --> 00:47:10.980
So I've been dating this lady who I completely love,
can't get enough of her.

742
00:47:10.981 --> 00:47:14.640
We've been going out for a solid two years now.
Good for you.
Um,

743
00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:17.670
there has always been a rule at her house.

744
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:21.780
She lives with their parents because she's in a program in order to become a vet

745
00:47:21.781 --> 00:47:26.100
tech.
So money's tight for her that I am not allowed to go upstairs ever.

746
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:30.970
All right.
Being a guy,
I have no problem with this.
A,

747
00:47:30.971 --> 00:47:35.340
I'll bender over the pool table and her f Jesus Christ.
Dude,
whenever this,

748
00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:38.110
this took a left turn,
I'll bender over the pool table.

749
00:47:38.111 --> 00:47:39.940
Her father built because fuck it.

750
00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:43.780
If you try to stop me from banging her in the bed,
I'll just find another way.

751
00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:50.720
All right,
do what?
What did that have to do with what you're talking about?

752
00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:55.280
You got me all interested in,
why can't you go upstairs?

753
00:47:56.570 --> 00:47:59.000
Like there's this big mystery.
Now all of a sudden you're like,
well,

754
00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:03.740
final vendor over the fucking hot water heater downstairs.
You can't stop me.

755
00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:07.280
All right,
I am hoping you're going to get back on track here.

756
00:48:07.281 --> 00:48:10.760
That was like a weird beat,
a B story.
Um,
he goes,

757
00:48:10.761 --> 00:48:15.761
so I finally get annoyed at this whole no upstairs policy and decide to do a

758
00:48:16.101 --> 00:48:19.520
little investigating.
Well,
aren't you just a nosy little conti?

759
00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:23.270
Did you finally get annoyed of the rules of a house that isn't yours?

760
00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:28.370
You know what,
sir?
So this far into your email,
I don't like you.

761
00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:31.770
I don't like that whole shit.
We at Deere,

762
00:48:31.771 --> 00:48:34.110
you haven't your disrespect in her father and Santa Mom.

763
00:48:34.111 --> 00:48:38.250
I'm gonna Fuck your daughter over the pool table that you built.
All right.

764
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:41.430
That's supposed to be internal monologue.

765
00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:43.380
You're not supposed to share that with others

766
00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:50.130
anyways.
Uh,
no one in the house at this point,
by the way.

767
00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:56.330
Oh,
there's no one in the house.
Why can't you guys help me out?

768
00:48:56.331 --> 00:49:01.190
You know I suck at reading.
He,
okay.
There's no one in the house at this point,

769
00:49:01.191 --> 00:49:04.640
by the way.
I work third shift,
so they leave me the fuck alone.

770
00:49:04.641 --> 00:49:09.641
Between 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM I went upstage upstairs and I find a garbage in the

771
00:49:11.181 --> 00:49:12.014
hallway.

772
00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:16.400
Every room is filled with junk and there's only one way to enter it.

773
00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:21.860
This is every room,
her parents' room,
hers,
the office.

774
00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:26.180
It's all a complete nightmare.
Just waiting for TLC to show up.

775
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:29.840
I'm now giving you that.

776
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:32.150
How can I approach this ordeal with her?

777
00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:37.420
I love her to death and she may be moving in with me sometime between the next

778
00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:39.560
few months.
This shit is not going to fly with me,

779
00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:44.770
but I know that if a resident gets that bad that there is something wrong with

780
00:49:46.161 --> 00:49:49.370
them.
Mentally.
She has always been messy.
But then again,

781
00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:52.310
I'm a fucking cop who doesn't have time to clean up my place.

782
00:49:52.311 --> 00:49:56.570
So maybe this is the calm before the storm with this chick.

783
00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:01.880
Um,
yeah,
that's really fucked up now.

784
00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:07.000
All right,
well you know something.
You're already broke the seal.

785
00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:10.390
This is what I would do.
This is so fucking creepy.

786
00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:17.590
If she,
if you really want to make it,
go with this girl,
I guess.

787
00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:22.250
I guess.
I guess I would go back up there again

788
00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:31.460
and I into her room and just have a look around and look like if that's some

789
00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:36.440
parent shit or if that's her shit.
You know what I mean?

790
00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:42.920
Um,
and if it's her shit,
I would be,
uh,
ah.

791
00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.720
Jesus is fucking brutal.
The thing,
you know what the big thing is,

792
00:50:45.721 --> 00:50:47.970
is the fact that the downstairs is immaculate,

793
00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:52.890
so they're there.
They're only halfway down the rabbit hole.

794
00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:58.490
Um,
I dunno,
Dude.
You know what?
This is your tree.
You're fucking sitting in it.

795
00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:01.760
I don't that there's no way to bring up that you went upstairs without just

796
00:51:01.761 --> 00:51:03.560
saying I went upstairs.

797
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:05.260
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

798
00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:09.880
<v 5>What are you going to say?
Well,
the bath,
the ice is what years is what you do.</v>

799
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:14.860
This is what you do.
You clog up the bathroom downstairs.
All right?

800
00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:19.260
Just clog up the fucking toilet downstairs.

801
00:51:21.130 --> 00:51:24.370
I Dunno how you'd do it,
but just clogged that fucker up.

802
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:29.400
Okay.
And then just say I had to take a shit.

803
00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:33.720
It was nowhere else to go.
I had to do it right.

804
00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:38.010
And then you just say you went upstairs,
saw what the fuck it was,

805
00:51:38.011 --> 00:51:41.550
and then you went back downstairs.
All right?
So that's what you do.

806
00:51:41.551 --> 00:51:44.880
Clog up the toilet and just blame it on the fact that you had to take your shit.

807
00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:48.840
Why am I helping you with this lie?
And it was funny to me.
Who gives a fuck?

808
00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:53.830
There you go.
And that's what you do and then address it.

809
00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:59.710
All right boy,
you just man up and just say listen.
All right,

810
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:03.790
the curiosity.
This is probably,
this is,
this is the man's way of doing it.
That's,

811
00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:06.800
that's the bitch way of doing it.
So of course I know how to do that way.

812
00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:10.400
The man just sits down and says,
listen,
all right,

813
00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:15.080
who's fucking weirded me out that I can never go upstairs?

814
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:19.430
I just wanted to top of stairs and I looked to see what the fucking big deal
was,

815
00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:23.900
you know,
like was it made out of gold?
You've got a sex slave up there,
you know,

816
00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:27.410
there's some dead body.
What the fuck's going on up there?
And uh,
yeah,

817
00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:31.610
that type of shit.
You know,
that's your world.
That's your life.
But uh,

818
00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:36.010
that's not going to happen if we ever move in together.
All right?

819
00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:37.443
And then she's going to give it,

820
00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:42.540
I can't believe that you went upstairs when I told you not to.

821
00:52:42.911 --> 00:52:46.780
You just broken the trust and they be like,
all right,
and let it just do it.

822
00:52:46.781 --> 00:52:49.540
Let it get all of that out.
And then you go,
oh,
wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

823
00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:54.610
What about you?
Okay,
so I just broke the trust.
But you know,
you're the one,

824
00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:59.130
you Kinda,
you had this giant secret,
you got secret.

825
00:52:59.131 --> 00:53:03.110
So you kind of fuck with the trust first.
You know,

826
00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:06.510
you know there's a dead cat up there.
Do you understand that visit?

827
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:08.090
Fucking dead cat up there.

828
00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:13.270
So I dunno.
Do,
do one thing or another.

829
00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:15.720
You can do the pussy thing and do the toilet clogged up thing.

830
00:53:15.721 --> 00:53:19.920
I gave you two options there,
sir.
The pussy bitch way or just be a fucking man.

831
00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:24.530
Just take her out,
set it down and just say,
listen,

832
00:53:24.531 --> 00:53:27.240
I gotta I got to tell you something.
All right.

833
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:31.330
Uh,
I feel ashamed that I did this,

834
00:53:31.331 --> 00:53:35.440
but my curiosity got the best of me and I went to the top of stairs and I just

835
00:53:35.441 --> 00:53:37.810
peeked to see what the big deal was with the upstairs.

836
00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:40.410
<v 6>Uh,</v>

837
00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:43.620
<v 5>and you know,
then she'll probably start running away.
But you know,
women,</v>

838
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:46.500
they don't know how to run.
Most of them.

839
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:50.250
Women can either run like a fucking track star or they just ran,

840
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:53.460
they run like it's you.
They run like toddlers.

841
00:53:58.730 --> 00:53:59.563
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

842
00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:01.870
<v 5>You know,
so many of them,
I swear to God,</v>

843
00:54:01.871 --> 00:54:05.170
I'm not saying you don't see the and uncoordinated guy jogging every once in a

844
00:54:05.171 --> 00:54:08.440
while,
but we,
you know,
we play sports.
We know how to run you guys.

845
00:54:08.441 --> 00:54:10.300
I don't know what you do.
You sit around plotting,

846
00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:14.950
making fucking rumors about each other.
Jesus bill.
Well,
you know what,

847
00:54:14.951 --> 00:54:16.540
it took a while this week,
didn't it?

848
00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:20.470
43 minutes in before I said some ignorant shit about women.
I'm getting better.

849
00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:23.110
I had to get a nice clean half hour there.

850
00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:25.603
<v 6>Um,</v>

851
00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:28.250
<v 5>so when she runs away from you like a,
you know,</v>

852
00:54:28.251 --> 00:54:29.740
somebody blew out her knee getting,

853
00:54:29.741 --> 00:54:32.180
I'll just sort of jog behind her until she gets tired.

854
00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:34.330
<v 6>Um,</v>

855
00:54:34.330 --> 00:54:37.010
<v 5>or just wait til she's wearing high heels until you tell her though,</v>

856
00:54:37.011 --> 00:54:40.300
that gives you an even better chance,
you know?
And as she's screaming,

857
00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:43.640
screaming and boohooing and crying and all that,
you know,

858
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:45.520
he just walked behind it with the hands out.
You know,

859
00:54:45.521 --> 00:54:50.200
looking at other people like,
you know,
you,
you know,
you do that classic,
you know,

860
00:54:50.201 --> 00:54:53.650
this isn't my fault shit that that body language to other people,

861
00:54:53.651 --> 00:54:56.740
which is basically you put your hands,
you know,

862
00:54:56.741 --> 00:55:00.910
basically parallel to your shoulders straight out like that.
You know,

863
00:55:00.911 --> 00:55:04.390
like you're going to shrug like a,
you know,
I dunno,
you haven't liked that.

864
00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:08.140
And then after you do that,
then you bring them together in front of you,

865
00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:12.890
motioning at her,
you know,
like,
Eh,
you bring them back out again.
High Minute.

866
00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:17.230
Let me just,
she's,
she's just,
I don't know,
Eh,
right.

867
00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.220
Just back and forth

868
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:26.240
and then you just say,
well we know something.
And as much as she gives a shit,

869
00:55:26.241 --> 00:55:29.420
just be like,
you know what?
I'm glad I looked.
I'm glad I looked,

870
00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:32.630
cause I didn't look,
I wouldn't,
I,
you know,
we got to talk about this.

871
00:55:32.631 --> 00:55:34.250
I'm willing to help you through this and everything,

872
00:55:34.251 --> 00:55:35.120
but I can tell you right now,

873
00:55:35.121 --> 00:55:37.820
if you think you're going to move in with me and start doing that stuff,

874
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.940
there's going to be a mountain of shit getting thrown out every fucking week.

875
00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:46.100
All right?
So there you go,
sir.
That is my advice.

876
00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:50.240
That is my advice to your fucking ass.
Good luck to Ya.

877
00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:51.473
<v 4>All right,</v>

878
00:55:55.850 --> 00:55:58.120
Joe never slowed down.

879
00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:04.240
God is screwing up going down.
Chad,
my sales guy,

880
00:56:04.241 --> 00:56:08.550
this town.
Oh Man.
Oh hell yes.
Honey.

881
00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:13.570
Butoh net body dress
drag.
Same is out.

882
00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:15.600
Take my ass.
Cop caught the case.

883
00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.073
[inaudible]

884
00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:49.963
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

885
00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:54.190
<v 5>the fuck was I going to talk about the sea?
Oh,
guess what I did this week.
Oh,</v>

886
00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:56.320
freckle face bill.
Guess what I did,
you know,

887
00:56:56.321 --> 00:56:59.830
a year ago I wrote a fucking motorcycle or whatever.
I went dirt bike riding.

888
00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:03.850
I actually took a motorcycle safety course.
It was a,

889
00:57:03.851 --> 00:57:08.170
it was a day and a half,
and I got to tell you,
man,
it was fucking,
uh,

890
00:57:08.171 --> 00:57:11.710
exhilarating and terrifying.
So I actually,

891
00:57:11.711 --> 00:57:14.770
I passed the class somehow.
I don't think I should have.

892
00:57:15.550 --> 00:57:18.220
I was doing my little ute turns.
I had to put my little foot down there.

893
00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:24.550
Uh,
um,
no,
it was a great fucking time.

894
00:57:25.570 --> 00:57:29.380
So basically how it worked was you wrote for like four hours and then you had a

895
00:57:29.381 --> 00:57:30.214
class.

896
00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:32.573
<v 6>Um,</v>

897
00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:36.540
<v 5>and I realized how spoiled I am as a fucking human being,
you know,</v>

898
00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.433
just having this,

899
00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:41.190
the life that I have where I don't have a boss and I basically do whatever the

900
00:57:41.191 --> 00:57:43.250
fuck I want.
I have not been in a classroom.

901
00:57:45.050 --> 00:57:45.883
<v 6>Um,</v>

902
00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:47.160
<v 5>and I just immediately,</v>

903
00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:51.540
I just takes me back to why I chose the route I chose.

904
00:57:51.541 --> 00:57:54.570
I just never liked the classroom situation,
but this,
this was a,

905
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:55.650
was actually a great time,

906
00:57:56.100 --> 00:58:00.510
but I just immediately had anxiety and I'm like half paying attention and then,

907
00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:03.000
and then in the end they're like,
okay,
now we're going to do the test.

908
00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:07.560
And I went right back to when I was like in eighth grade and I got,
I've got,

909
00:58:07.561 --> 00:58:10.890
I'm going to fail this.
The guy's like,
no one has ever failed this.
And he like,

910
00:58:10.891 --> 00:58:13.080
Oh,
good pressure pressure.
I'm a moron.

911
00:58:13.850 --> 00:58:16.200
We're sitting there at the table and everybody's fucking finishing.

912
00:58:16.201 --> 00:58:20.910
Before I was like,
there was like,
I don't know,
40 people in the class.

913
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:26.250
I think I finished 37th as far as completing the test.
Um,

914
00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:31.470
I don't know.
This is 50 questions.
I got four wrong,
something like that.

915
00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:36.230
I'll fucking though.
But somehow I passed and um,
that was funny.

916
00:58:36.231 --> 00:58:39.560
I've never flipped flops so much in my life on a decision.
I was thinking,

917
00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:41.870
am I going to get a bike?
Should I just get a dirt bike?

918
00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:45.080
Should I just know how to do this.
And then,
you know,

919
00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:48.860
I just want to learn how to ride a motorcycle.
You know,

920
00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:51.440
I grew up in the 80s all right.

921
00:58:51.830 --> 00:58:55.370
I watched a lot of action movies and one of the things that I always was envious

922
00:58:55.400 --> 00:59:00.400
of the Action Heroes Aside from their oiled up fucking eighties lifting weights,

923
00:59:00.651 --> 00:59:04.280
no squats ever bodies was uh,

924
00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:08.630
the fact that no matter what vehicle they approached,

925
00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:12.170
not only with the keys always in it,
they knew how to drive it.

926
00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:17.630
They knew how to drive everything from a dump truck to a fucking helicopter

927
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:22.850
airplane.
They could sail,
they could fucking do anything.
So,
you know,

928
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:26.180
it's coming up where,
you know,
we got to raise the debt ceiling again.

929
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:30.980
Eventually the wave's going to hit the beach and there's going to be a period

930
00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:36.560
where you could quite possibly be getting chased down the street by an angry

931
00:59:36.561 --> 00:59:41.450
fucking mob.
Is,
is just everything goes to shit,
you know?

932
00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:47.030
So at that point it would be nice if you had the ability to,

933
00:59:47.031 --> 00:59:50.210
whatever escape vehicle you meet you ran into,

934
00:59:50.211 --> 00:59:53.570
you could actually just jump in and just be all right with it.
Right.

935
00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:58.190
Sylvester Stallone,
Fucken uh,

936
00:59:58.250 --> 01:00:02.450
Arnold Schwartzenegger,
Steven Seagal,
Chuck Norris,

937
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:03.710
they never,

938
01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:08.390
and I challenge you to find anything that they fucking ran up to in any of those

939
01:00:08.391 --> 01:00:12.530
movies that they did not jet ski,
fucking motorboat,

940
01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:16.610
sailboat,
submarine,
combine helicopter,

941
01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:20.000
fucking plane with,
with,
I only can land on water.

942
01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:23.480
Those skis or the tires doesn't make a difference.

943
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:28.520
They could instrument rated the everything,
everything.

944
01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.270
They could be on a fucking plane,
a commercial airline,

945
01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:34.430
and somehow kill the person next to him,

946
01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:36.890
put a hat over their face without anybody noticing,

947
01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:40.940
crawl down into where the luggages and then jump off the landing gear and do a

948
01:00:40.941 --> 01:00:45.290
fucking mash at the end of the,
the,
the runway.

949
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:48.790
They were unstoppable.
So I've added motorcycle.

950
01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:51.090
All right.

951
01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:55.890
I could drive a car stick or regular and now I can drive a motorcycle.

952
01:00:55.950 --> 01:00:57.420
I'm just checking off the list.

953
01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:03.380
I have a day and a half of experience now.

954
01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.940
It was actually really fascinating and it made me a better driver.

955
01:01:05.941 --> 01:01:10.620
And I actually have a much more appreciation of,
uh,

956
01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:15.330
of this skill it takes to ride a motorcycle.
It's not like a car.
Yeah,

957
01:01:15.331 --> 01:01:20.250
no shit bill now,
but just shit that you wouldn't think like I didn't,

958
01:01:20.251 --> 01:01:24.000
I didn't understand all that went into just going around a turn on a motorcycle.

959
01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:27.180
And now not only do you hit the,
do you not hit the break,

960
01:01:27.181 --> 01:01:31.350
but if you hit the brake,
you're actually gonna you know you're going to crash.

961
01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:34.050
You got to judge,
look through the whole turn,

962
01:01:34.051 --> 01:01:37.020
judge you speed and then fucking power your way through it.

963
01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:43.260
I'm pretty intense.
I got not going to lie to you.
I'm not gonna act like I was,

964
01:01:43.570 --> 01:01:46.530
eh,
got this,
this is easy.
Then we would go into the class and like,

965
01:01:46.531 --> 01:01:48.750
has anybody seen it?
And I'm getting excited like,
wow,

966
01:01:48.751 --> 01:01:51.480
that I just rode a bike for four hours.
I've got it up to third gear,

967
01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.610
down shift and this is fucking great.

968
01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:57.120
And then I went into the class and one of the things,
you know,

969
01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:58.410
the group discussion,
they was like,

970
01:01:58.411 --> 01:02:01.290
anybody ever see a motorcycle accident are better than motorcycle accidents?

971
01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:03.300
It's like fucking almost everybody,

972
01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:07.380
or at least half the class puts their hands up and they start telling stories.

973
01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:11.850
And this one guys was like a paramedic and he's going like,
yeah,
you know,

974
01:02:11.851 --> 01:02:16.851
I saw this guy guy was going like 90 hit a car head on and his heart came out of

975
01:02:16.891 --> 01:02:17.724
his chest.

976
01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:23.280
He had like stories and I was sitting there,
I'm like,

977
01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:28.290
like laughing to myself,
go,
what the fuck am I signing up for here?

978
01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:30.960
This is insane.
Um,

979
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:32.260
<v 2>yeah.</v>

980
01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:35.220
<v 5>And then like the guy who was teaching the class who looked like he was born on</v>

981
01:02:35.221 --> 01:02:39.330
a motorcycle and was fucking,
you know,
rote the same way was,
you know,

982
01:02:39.331 --> 01:02:42.030
obviously he's the instructor's fucking Great Ryan Bikes.

983
01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:44.670
He even had a story of a couple months ago.
Yeah.
You know,

984
01:02:44.671 --> 01:02:46.470
I hit some sand and I was like saying,
you know,

985
01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:48.540
I'm going over the fucking handlebars and I'm like,

986
01:02:48.541 --> 01:02:51.960
keep my body relaxed and all I'm thinking in my head is,
is like,
dude,

987
01:02:51.961 --> 01:02:54.510
you went down,
you went down.

988
01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:56.320
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

989
01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:57.670
<v 5>right.
This guy,
I'm telling you,</v>

990
01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:00.340
I'll just look like he was just made the right a fuck them.
You just had that.

991
01:03:00.341 --> 01:03:03.640
I ride a motorcycle look,
as opposed to me who looks like some do.

992
01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:07.120
She goes to take a safety course and I'm just thinking this guy went down,

993
01:03:07.330 --> 01:03:10.420
this guy's an EMT talking about people's hearts coming out of their chest.

994
01:03:10.421 --> 01:03:15.200
I'm just like,
what?
This is fucking stupid,
you know?
So,

995
01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:16.723
uh,

996
01:03:16.930 --> 01:03:17.690
<v 2>yeah,</v>

997
01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:19.990
<v 5>ion.
I don't know where I'm at.
I think I'm just gonna maybe just</v>

998
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.920
right on dirt is what I'll do.
He can't,

999
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.640
you can't fucking ride a bike out here in la.
It's,
I,
you know what it is.

1000
01:03:27.641 --> 01:03:31.540
I'm old enough to know it's fucking stupid.
So a,
I think I'm going to,

1001
01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:32.440
if I'm going to do it,

1002
01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:36.310
I just get like a dirt bike and I'd put it in the back of my truck,

1003
01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:39.910
drive out of the city and all the people texting,

1004
01:03:39.911 --> 01:03:42.190
get to where the trailer is and then just ride around on dirt.

1005
01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:44.840
Now I know all you consume to be like actually mage and feet,

1006
01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:47.860
GLD jumping off road people,
no pa you can judge.
You need to,

1007
01:03:47.861 --> 01:03:51.700
I know I just stand this risk with everything,
but uh,

1008
01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:52.700
<v 2>yeah.</v>

1009
01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:53.533
<v 5>You know,
I dunno.</v>

1010
01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:59.050
I think it's a good thing that I waited till I was 45 to learn how to ride a

1011
01:03:59.051 --> 01:04:04.051
motorcycle because if I was thinking if I was 21 and I would just,

1012
01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:09.090
I wouldn't give a shit ass not going to happen to me.

1013
01:04:09.091 --> 01:04:12.450
That's not going to happen to me.
Like you get older and by the time you're,

1014
01:04:12.451 --> 01:04:16.140
my age,
shit has happened to you or some close friends.
So you kind of like,
yeah.

1015
01:04:16.141 --> 01:04:17.100
You know,
that could happen to me.

1016
01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:22.160
Kind of like my heart in my chest on this side of my rib cage.
Uh,

1017
01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:23.010
but I gotta tell you though,

1018
01:04:23.011 --> 01:04:27.970
I definitely got the bug and it's the most fucking fun.

1019
01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:32.600
I even by the second day,
I was actually getting frustrated

1020
01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:36.870
because I was thinking like,
I just want to take this out on the street.

1021
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:39.720
I'm sick of speeding up and slowing down.

1022
01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.870
I just want to drive this fucking thing.
And uh,

1023
01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:44.710
<v 2>okay.</v>

1024
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:45.543
<v 5>I Dunno.</v>

1025
01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:46.360
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1026
01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:49.030
<v 5>Don't worry,
I'm not going to go out and do that.
I'm not gonna do that dumb shit.</v>

1027
01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:52.960
This is exactly what a lot of people do when they,

1028
01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:55.390
when they finally get to where they want to be in life,

1029
01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:58.380
which is where I feel I am.
You know,
selling tickets is a comic.

1030
01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:02.620
Get some acting gigs every once in awhile.
You know,
you got a little free time.

1031
01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:06.730
What do you do?
You pull a John Denver,
you go out and get a pilot's license,

1032
01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:10.860
you know,
you fly some experimental aircraft and next thing you know the,

1033
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:15.250
the news today,
singer songwriter.
All right.

1034
01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:18.610
So that's definitely the back of my head.
But,
um,

1035
01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:20.790
<v 6>I don't know.</v>

1036
01:05:20.790 --> 01:05:23.100
<v 5>I don't think knee is going to let me get one anyways.
To be honest with you,</v>

1037
01:05:23.101 --> 01:05:26.580
that's probably a good thing.
But you know what she did when she was saying no,

1038
01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:30.690
she did the classic thing like why do you want to fuck like you know,

1039
01:05:31.050 --> 01:05:35.660
have all these toys but is it with guys and have you know,
you,
you have your,

1040
01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.560
and like what do I have?
I go,
I get my truck.
She goes,
you get your guitars.

1041
01:05:38.650 --> 01:05:42.930
And it's like,
you're upset with me cause I'm enjoying life.
And she's like,
no,

1042
01:05:43.590 --> 01:05:46.500
you know,
I think she just doesn't want me to get,

1043
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:50.040
I'm so she tried to do that stupid argument that the motorcycle was this

1044
01:05:50.041 --> 01:05:53.290
extension.
Like it's like your Dick,
like you,

1045
01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:56.640
you guys like kids between their legs and they have ride this thing down the

1046
01:05:56.900 --> 01:06:00.000
street.
It's just like,
I dunno what the fuck that is about.

1047
01:06:01.330 --> 01:06:02.980
When I was riding for the last two days,

1048
01:06:03.010 --> 01:06:07.120
at no point was I thinking about my deck other than thinking like I hope I don't

1049
01:06:07.121 --> 01:06:09.280
fall off and uh,

1050
01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:12.430
when I'm going fast enough that I get road rash on my deck.

1051
01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:14.990
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1052
01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:17.540
<v 5>That would be the only thing.
Other than that,
you know what,
I wish,</v>

1053
01:06:17.541 --> 01:06:22.100
I wish she took the class with me.
You know,
that's what I was actually thinking.

1054
01:06:22.101 --> 01:06:24.860
It'd be great if she took the fucking class with me and she would just see how

1055
01:06:24.861 --> 01:06:26.780
much fun it is.
It's fun.

1056
01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:28.220
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1057
01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:32.540
<v 5>You know,
I don't know.
Fucking know.
So,
uh,
I got the bug now.</v>

1058
01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:35.980
I got the bug and I was looking at motorcycles all last night.

1059
01:06:36.070 --> 01:06:37.670
So I was telling her,
I said,
look,
all I want to do,

1060
01:06:37.671 --> 01:06:40.550
I'm just going to get like the Honda rebel.
It's a fucking two 50.

1061
01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:44.000
It's exactly what I should get when I start out.
If I get something else,

1062
01:06:44.001 --> 01:06:47.840
I'll kill myself.
And she starts,
you know,
looking up those stupid Ducati's,

1063
01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:51.530
which were cool about up until six months ago and now every douchebag out there

1064
01:06:51.531 --> 01:06:55.340
has them.
Like,
everybody seems to have one of those fucking things.
So,

1065
01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.233
<v 6>you know,
I don't know.</v>

1066
01:06:58.310 --> 01:07:01.020
<v 5>I looked at the new Harley's and I don't like them.
I think they're ugly.</v>

1067
01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:03.780
They kind of lost their way.
They lose.
They used to look meaner.

1068
01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:07.020
So I'm just going to get,
if I'm going to get one,

1069
01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.990
I'm either going to get a dirt bike or I'm going to get this little fucking two

1070
01:07:09.991 --> 01:07:13.170
50.
I think this speedometer only goes up to like 70 or 80.

1071
01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:15.533
<v 6>Um,</v>

1072
01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:18.140
<v 5>I dunno.
Tell me,
what do you,
what do you guys think?
And this is,</v>

1073
01:07:18.141 --> 01:07:23.120
and this is going to be one of those extreme,
uh,
conversations.

1074
01:07:23.121 --> 01:07:25.520
And believe me,
I've heard all the things get a motorcycle.

1075
01:07:25.521 --> 01:07:29.060
You might as well buy the coffin to go with it.
It's not a helmet,

1076
01:07:29.061 --> 01:07:31.280
it's a brain bucket.
I've heard all of that shit.

1077
01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:35.590
<v 6>Um,
I dunno,</v>

1078
01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:38.790
<v 5>just a,
it does seem like a lot of fun,</v>

1079
01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:40.853
<v 6>right?</v>

1080
01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:42.920
<v 5>You know,
if I,
if I get one,</v>

1081
01:07:42.921 --> 01:07:45.860
I'm going to be one of those douchebags who gets like a little two 50 and I'll

1082
01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:49.760
have like all the gear on and be dressed like all Samuelson.

1083
01:07:49.761 --> 01:07:54.761
If he ever rode a motorcycle flight completely over protected fucking robocop

1084
01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.830
suit on and I just ride around my neighborhood.
Never,

1085
01:07:57.890 --> 01:08:01.620
never get out of second gear.
Um,
anyway,

1086
01:08:01.621 --> 01:08:04.340
so that's what the fuck I did with my week.
But you know,

1087
01:08:04.341 --> 01:08:05.180
it's good to know though,

1088
01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:09.140
if I ever get chased by a bunch of people with hatchets down the street and I

1089
01:08:09.450 --> 01:08:12.980
happen upon a fucking motorcycle and there's a little key there provided it's

1090
01:08:12.981 --> 01:08:16.040
not an old one with the throttles,
the other side

1091
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:18.980
<v 8>or the shifter or whatever the fuck it is.
A I'll be able to,</v>

1092
01:08:18.981 --> 01:08:21.290
I'll be able to escape,
you know.

1093
01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.630
<v 4>All right,
fuck.
I'm talking about</v>

1094
01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:34.340
[inaudible] this bitch on market square,

1095
01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:39.520
she's standing in her underwear looking down from a hotel room and that ball

1096
01:08:41.121 --> 01:08:45.770
will be coming soon.
Hell yes.

1097
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:50.890
You got to pull it on app part injury as he was to go cry with a welcome alone

1098
01:08:51.530 --> 01:08:52.790
and him the last number.

1099
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:13.100
<v 3>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

1100
01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:14.670
<v 8>hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.</v>

1101
01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:18.260
It is the Monday morning podcast for a Monday,

1102
01:09:18.261 --> 01:09:23.210
October 5th,
2009.
How the hell are you?
Well that's good.

1103
01:09:23.750 --> 01:09:26.960
I'm actually fighting off disease this week.

1104
01:09:26.961 --> 01:09:31.961
I'm back here on the east coast and everybody is getting sick and uh,

1105
01:09:31.971 --> 01:09:35.960
I did a smart thing.
I actually fucking came home and I felt myself getting sick.

1106
01:09:35.961 --> 01:09:39.860
I took some vitamins and I just slept for like fucking 10 hours.

1107
01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:45.710
Um,
hence the podcast is a little bit late.
I apologize as always,
but um,

1108
01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.930
yeah man,
I had a great weekend.

1109
01:09:47.931 --> 01:09:52.220
I was out at this [inaudible] stress factory in New Jersey and I'm starting to

1110
01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:56.870
feel it,
man.
I'm starting to get on top of my game.
Um,
regular listeners,
you know,

1111
01:09:56.871 --> 01:09:59.330
I'm getting ready to do another special and um,

1112
01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:01.490
I've really put my time and with this one,

1113
01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:06.230
I did Sweden than I did Boston than I did Philly than I did Dallas.

1114
01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:09.860
And now I just did New Brunswick,
New Jersey five weeks in a row.

1115
01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:14.600
Now I had one week off between Sweden and uh,
and Boston.
And,
uh,

1116
01:10:14.601 --> 01:10:18.980
I gotta tell you,
man,
there's no substitute for that.
There really isn't.

1117
01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:21.710
I don't give a fuck.
You have to go out on the road.

1118
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:27.070
You got to do this shows you gotta do six shows a weekend and you really have to

1119
01:10:27.291 --> 01:10:30.680
be like,
I'm really working on this one,
making sure the set order is right.

1120
01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:35.420
And uh,
you know,
cause that's,
that's how you gotta do it.

1121
01:10:36.170 --> 01:10:40.400
You want to have a memorable,
you don't just want to,
you know,

1122
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:44.840
that's the worst fucking thing you can do,
I think in any,
any part of your life.

1123
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:48.650
Work your ass off on something and then just get your reaction of like,
hey,

1124
01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:52.940
it was good.
I mean,
he went up there,
there was a microphone,

1125
01:10:52.941 --> 01:10:56.390
he was talking into it.
You could understand what he was saying.

1126
01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:03.020
Um,
he seemed to be having a good time.
What was he talking about?
Yeah,
I,

1127
01:11:03.021 --> 01:11:05.900
you know,
I,
I can't,
you know,
that's the thing I can't really remember,

1128
01:11:06.650 --> 01:11:08.300
but it was definitely English.

1129
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:13.040
I know that because at no point I wasn't not comprehending what he was saying.

1130
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:17.790
So I'm whatever,
I'm putting a little bit of pressure on myself.
I just,
you know,

1131
01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:21.250
the fuck you've got to keep trying to top yourself and a,

1132
01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:24.420
when you have a limited amount of skills that eventually,
you know,

1133
01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:28.830
I don't know,
it's a weird thing to try and turn to beat yourself.

1134
01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:30.960
How do you fake out yourself?
You know,

1135
01:11:31.930 --> 01:11:36.340
am I making any goddamn sense right now or is this fucking theraflu still,
uh,

1136
01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:39.630
kicking in here?
I'm actually fighting this shit off duty.
You want to talk?

1137
01:11:39.631 --> 01:11:42.600
I do this overrated underrated thing here on the podcast.
You know,

1138
01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:44.610
you want to talk a underrated,

1139
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.030
underrated taking vitamins every goddamn day,

1140
01:11:48.031 --> 01:11:51.300
which is what I've been doing lately.
You know,
I take a,

1141
01:11:51.301 --> 01:11:55.410
I take a men's multivitamin.
I don't even know what it is.

1142
01:11:55.411 --> 01:12:00.411
I just know it's a brown with little black freckles of shit on it.

1143
01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:01.770
I have no idea what it is.

1144
01:12:01.771 --> 01:12:05.970
I've been taking that his vitamin B supplement so I don't get Alzheimer's cause

1145
01:12:05.971 --> 01:12:09.920
evidently,
uh,
I took a physical and they were telling me,
you know,

1146
01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:12.210
I'm not even gonna say that cause I'm trying to get health insurance right now.

1147
01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:14.160
That's the preexisting condition.

1148
01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:19.340
Now we brought that up.
Well maybe it's the all timers.

1149
01:12:19.341 --> 01:12:20.570
Maybe that's why you don't remember it.

1150
01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:23.880
<v 6>MMM.
[inaudible]</v>

1151
01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:26.270
<v 8>yeah,
that's the how kind of health insurance I have right now.</v>

1152
01:12:26.271 --> 01:12:27.730
And I want to get some other health insurance.

1153
01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:31.070
The health insurance I have right now basically covers everything except what I

1154
01:12:31.071 --> 01:12:34.340
go,
you know,
to the dentist for,
you know,

1155
01:12:35.210 --> 01:12:38.890
I want to get a fucking cleaning and they didn't cover it.
A cleaning.

1156
01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:42.200
I mean that's ground zero.
And they're saying because the lady used that,

1157
01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:44.000
that electronic pick,

1158
01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:48.950
which a lot of them use just because they are lazy,
not that Lazy.
They,
they,

1159
01:12:48.951 --> 01:12:52.550
you know,
you know,
back in the old days where they used to just use the scraper,

1160
01:12:53.330 --> 01:12:57.590
then the,
the,
the manual scraper for your teeth.
Now they just use the,
uh,

1161
01:12:57.591 --> 01:13:00.800
the other one.
I mean I hadn't gone in in a little bit.

1162
01:13:00.801 --> 01:13:03.260
So the first time I went in I understood that she used it,

1163
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:08.060
but now I've been going in there like every fucking four months,
you know,

1164
01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:12.050
four months.
You don't need to use that electronic one.
You fucking lazy.

1165
01:13:12.051 --> 01:13:14.060
But for some reason my health insurance,
oh we only,

1166
01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:18.950
we only just cover if they just use with use it with their hands.
Yeah.

1167
01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:22.850
By the way,
you owe us another 350 bucks for this quarter.

1168
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:27.140
I'll go fuck yourselves.
Um,
so anyways,
um,

1169
01:13:27.141 --> 01:13:32.000
I am on tour like a maniac right now.
Um,
now I've got maniac,

1170
01:13:32.001 --> 01:13:33.290
like somebody is getting ready to do a special.

1171
01:13:33.291 --> 01:13:38.291
So I am actually in New York City right now sitting in my old apartment and uh,

1172
01:13:40.130 --> 01:13:45.130
it's bringing back memories of when I used to fucking live here and I would get

1173
01:13:46.161 --> 01:13:50.380
sheared faced and bang a Ho whore.

1174
01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:52.673
<v 6>Um,
[inaudible]</v>

1175
01:13:53.130 --> 01:13:57.180
<v 8>I like this place.
I'm going to try and keep it,
you know,</v>

1176
01:13:57.990 --> 01:14:01.110
this is my just in case I get divorced place someday,
you know,

1177
01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:05.130
cause I'll go out and I'll buy a house and God knows my girl will get that,

1178
01:14:05.190 --> 01:14:06.023
you know,

1179
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:11.590
and then fill our kids up with her version of who I am,

1180
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:12.800
you know?

1181
01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:16.870
Then I come by on Saturdays to pick them up and then they got that look on their

1182
01:14:16.871 --> 01:14:19.580
face.
You know,
like they just had some horrific story told.

1183
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.830
Wow Man,
I'm really in a bad mood right now.
Just not even a bad mood.

1184
01:14:24.831 --> 01:14:26.120
I'm just fucking negative.
You know what?

1185
01:14:26.121 --> 01:14:28.840
Why don't we try and turn this around by me giving you guys,
I'll,

1186
01:14:28.850 --> 01:14:31.700
I'll do a little ass build hill build here

1187
01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:36.350
or you know what?
Fuck that.
Why don't I hype what I have coming up this weekend?

1188
01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:41.000
I have,
I'm going to be at the Improv in a,
I think it's homestead,

1189
01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:45.470
Pennsylvania,
right outside of Pittsburgh.
It's called the,
the,
the stacks,

1190
01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:48.010
I believe it's that mall right at right up,
you know,

1191
01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:50.990
right over the bridge that goes over the river.
Get Out.

1192
01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:56.060
It's basically one of those things.
It's classic America right now.

1193
01:14:56.090 --> 01:14:57.050
It's basically,

1194
01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:02.560
it's a place where Americans used to have union jobs and they made steel for

1195
01:15:02.721 --> 01:15:07.721
fucking American cars in American buildings and now it's a mall and you go in

1196
01:15:09.321 --> 01:15:13.910
there and you buy shit that was made from people in other countries probably by

1197
01:15:13.911 --> 01:15:17.810
their children for one 90th of what they were paying in American.

1198
01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:22.130
But as a tribute to those Americans,
they used to have jobs.
They kept it,

1199
01:15:22.131 --> 01:15:26.630
they kept the smokestacks from the old steel factory,
steel mill factory.

1200
01:15:26.631 --> 01:15:28.490
Actually the last time I was fucking there,

1201
01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:31.990
I actually kind of researched that area cause I was kind of fascinated by it.

1202
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:34.350
And I found out that there was some big,

1203
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.000
big battle between the workers and they called in police and the,

1204
01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:45.970
and some militia to beat down these Americans who wanted to get a fair wage and

1205
01:15:46.011 --> 01:15:47.630
people got their head split open.

1206
01:15:47.631 --> 01:15:52.190
They fucking died right there on those riverbanks,
you know,

1207
01:15:52.191 --> 01:15:55.250
so people could make money and I don't know what happened.
My generation,

1208
01:15:55.251 --> 01:15:58.430
we just sat around eating double cheeseburgers and an all fucking left.

1209
01:15:59.330 --> 01:16:04.130
But anyways,
I'll be down there telling my jokes.
Hey and look who's back.

1210
01:16:04.850 --> 01:16:09.470
Look who's back.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Joe to Rosa,
young Joe to Rosa and Joe,

1211
01:16:09.471 --> 01:16:12.380
you know I'm gonna love about Joe.
Is Joe's actually going to come in,

1212
01:16:12.381 --> 01:16:16.660
he's going to join the podcast and at no point is he ever going to address that.

1213
01:16:16.890 --> 01:16:17.211
Actually,

1214
01:16:17.211 --> 01:16:21.660
I already did this podcast for 45 minutes before I realized that I didn't have

1215
01:16:21.661 --> 01:16:26.100
any batteries in my recorder and he's gonna sit down like a goddamn pro.

1216
01:16:27.690 --> 01:16:29.520
Listen,
this is the deal.
People always ask me,

1217
01:16:29.521 --> 01:16:31.290
you know when the hell you ever gonna have a guest.

1218
01:16:31.291 --> 01:16:33.210
Every once in a while you should switch it up.

1219
01:16:33.211 --> 01:16:37.080
You should get a guest like out a guest,
a disgruntled,

1220
01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:40.980
I already did this for free for 45 minutes.
Joe,
let me tell you something,
man,

1221
01:16:40.981 --> 01:16:45.981
you was so funny this past hour on this podcast that didn't get recorded.

1222
01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:50.400
Thank you.
And I have belief in you that there's a lot more funny in that.
Well,

1223
01:16:52.290 --> 01:16:57.120
Joe was actually a,
if you're new to the podcast,
I'm,
Joe is a,

1224
01:16:57.121 --> 01:17:00.090
this is the worst joke because I've already done this and it's fucking Monday.

1225
01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:04.740
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
All right Joe.
Ah,
still worse.

1226
01:17:04.741 --> 01:17:06.420
We gave that guy great advice.
And now,

1227
01:17:06.421 --> 01:17:08.750
right now we're going to have to read it again and pretend like we already

1228
01:17:08.751 --> 01:17:12.980
didn't do it or we'll,
it'll be fine.
We'll get through it.
We'll get through it.

1229
01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:15.520
I do it.
I'll tell you an inspirational story,
Joe,

1230
01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:17.430
so we can get through this the second time.

1231
01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:21.870
Brian Johnson of ACDC fame.
All right.

1232
01:17:21.871 --> 01:17:25.350
One time told his story about Phil Rudd,
that drummer,
they have band.

1233
01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:30.180
And he said basically they had some unbelievable take of some song and for some

1234
01:17:30.181 --> 01:17:31.890
reason they ran out of tape right in the mid,

1235
01:17:31.891 --> 01:17:34.050
right in the middle of the greatest part of the song ever.

1236
01:17:34.051 --> 01:17:37.530
And it had been built to like this emotional apex,
you know,

1237
01:17:37.890 --> 01:17:41.850
so the guy goes in the guide,
the fucking guy behind the,
uh,

1238
01:17:42.150 --> 01:17:45.540
the mixing board is all devastated.
He's apologetic and he's like,

1239
01:17:45.541 --> 01:17:48.540
I can't believe in somehow,
whatever.
They have to somehow get,

1240
01:17:48.690 --> 01:17:53.520
they lost Phil Rudd Shit.
Right?
All right.
And the guy's like,
oh my God,

1241
01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:56.190
we're never gonna get it today.
I fucked up.
I'm so sorry.

1242
01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:59.520
And then Phil Rev was just like,
just play the tape again,
mate.

1243
01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:03.990
I'm going to jump right in.
And he goes,
there's no way you can do it.
He goes,

1244
01:18:03.991 --> 01:18:08.850
just roll the fucking tape.
And they roll it to it and he jumps in seamlessly.

1245
01:18:08.970 --> 01:18:13.200
Like he went back in time and he fucking totally nails the take.

1246
01:18:13.410 --> 01:18:16.890
He plays it even fucking better than they did the first time they hit.

1247
01:18:16.891 --> 01:18:19.410
They stop the thing and the fucking guy behind the board,

1248
01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:21.120
he's just completely flabbergasted because,

1249
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:24.020
cause that was unblind never seen anybody do anything like that.
You're,

1250
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:25.650
you're fucking unbelievable.

1251
01:18:25.890 --> 01:18:28.020
And fell was sitting there with that cigarette dangling,

1252
01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:30.720
dangling from his lips and he just goes,
I know

1253
01:18:35.290 --> 01:18:37.810
Brian Johnson tells it better,
but that's your inspirational story there,
Joe.

1254
01:18:38.290 --> 01:18:40.210
So anyways,
Joe de Rosa,
me and Joe do this.

1255
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:45.250
There's wonderful radio show that used to be on XM.
Used to be on XM Sirius.

1256
01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:48.460
Yeah,
sometimes it is,
but you know what?
I don't know.

1257
01:18:48.461 --> 01:18:52.030
There was a merger and just like you guys out there going through this tough

1258
01:18:52.031 --> 01:18:55.330
economy,
I guess we were the odd man out there was a merger.

1259
01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:58.990
They took our money away.
They left us with nothing.

1260
01:18:59.110 --> 01:19:00.040
You know what they really did?

1261
01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:04.000
And we just decided we would tired of waiting nine months for a fucking $35

1262
01:19:04.001 --> 01:19:08.190
check.
Isn't that what basically I'll be honest here.
Oddly enough we,
we,

1263
01:19:08.191 --> 01:19:12.160
we see more disappointed than XM does.
Yeah.
About the show head.

1264
01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:17.340
We keep reading the trade magazines waiting for that XMC or Sirius XM exome is

1265
01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.430
really called the say what happened where,
whatever.

1266
01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:25.580
Do your show saying that their stock plummeted another two fucking is it points

1267
01:19:26.501 --> 01:19:31.020
a dollars.
We don't know what the points,
let's go with points.
Anyways,

1268
01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:34.780
the name of the show we did was called uninformed.
Uh,
no reading,
no research,

1269
01:19:34.781 --> 01:19:37.500
just strong opinions.
And if you haven't picked it up yet,
a,

1270
01:19:37.501 --> 01:19:40.720
me and Joe were a couple of fucking morons and uh,

1271
01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:43.440
no point should you ever really listen to anything that we say.

1272
01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:45.700
You know what you want,
why do we do,
you know,

1273
01:19:45.701 --> 01:19:48.760
we really do our show for other than the Hora sells out so we can make more

1274
01:19:48.761 --> 01:19:53.050
money and not have to go on the road shaking hands of people who have fevers

1275
01:19:53.051 --> 01:19:56.650
that are then going to pass it on to you as you get to wash your hands and eat a

1276
01:19:56.651 --> 01:20:00.340
fucking order of Mozzarella sticks between the first and second show like I did.

1277
01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:05.830
Um,
who do,
who else do we do it for?
You should,
you know who is what?

1278
01:20:05.831 --> 01:20:09.390
We do it for the fuck.
Sorry,
I'm,
I have no train of thought.
We fucking,

1279
01:20:09.391 --> 01:20:11.180
we do it for you,
for you.

1280
01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:15.660
If my 15 fucking listeners so you guys can feel better about your lives to be

1281
01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:19.890
like price.
Yeah.
No,
not even advice.
Just when you hear a fucking stupid we are,

1282
01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:21.330
you can actually in the like,

1283
01:20:21.331 --> 01:20:24.870
well these guys actually have some sort of fast radio show.
You know?

1284
01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:28.800
I can make it too.
Yeah,
I agree.
It's good.

1285
01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:31.890
It makes people feel like they can achieve out there.
Yeah,
they may.

1286
01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:35.010
It makes people feel like they can get to our level because you certainly can.

1287
01:20:35.790 --> 01:20:40.160
This is an attainable level in life.
Absolutely.
We are not,
well,

1288
01:20:40.161 --> 01:20:42.090
I mean I'm speaking for myself,
you know,

1289
01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:46.140
but you too can be on the internet making no money whatsoever and not have a

1290
01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:48.240
boss.
There's something freeing about it.
Joe.
Joe,

1291
01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:52.160
I'm telling you all we need is a windmill and our own garden in the back and

1292
01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:54.390
what?
We'll be fucking good.
We'll just go veggie.

1293
01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:58.800
What would you plant in the garden bill?
A couple cherry tomatoes.
Tomatoes.

1294
01:20:58.801 --> 01:21:01.020
Let me tell you something.
[inaudible] button.

1295
01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:03.960
Do you know how bad I want to buy a fucking house so I can have a garden?

1296
01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:06.840
I love having gardens.
I want to,
I want to have a garden and be,

1297
01:21:06.841 --> 01:21:09.140
that guy was slowly loses his mind out there.

1298
01:21:09.190 --> 01:21:13.040
Talking to the plants because he's breathing into pesticides.
You know?

1299
01:21:13.050 --> 01:21:15.660
That's why I want to be just,
Oh look at that.
Zucchini

1300
01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:21.870
shaped like a girl I used to know,
but
my uh,

1301
01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:25.440
my dad had,
uh,
had an astounding garden when I was growing up.

1302
01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:28.440
I think that that's one of the coolest things ever to be able to walk into your

1303
01:21:28.441 --> 01:21:33.120
backyard.
Okay.
Like,
and have your own food supply.

1304
01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:35.280
I think there's something really like,

1305
01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:37.950
I think that we've kind of got everybody living in a culdesac.

1306
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:41.550
I really think that,
you know what I would love to do,
you know,

1307
01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:44.910
you would get whacked by the fucking powers that be,

1308
01:21:44.911 --> 01:21:48.270
but if you could just somehow teach people how to build windmills and if they

1309
01:21:48.271 --> 01:21:51.210
somehow just couldn't stop it,
you know,

1310
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:55.830
the same way like fucking that,
that auto auto tron,
what the fuck?

1311
01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:57.900
What kind of music is that took over?
You know,

1312
01:21:57.901 --> 01:22:02.040
that music Jay-Z's ran auto tune auto tune the same way that that just took over

1313
01:22:02.190 --> 01:22:04.530
and the government couldn't do anything about it.
Like what if,

1314
01:22:04.531 --> 01:22:07.830
what if people just started windmills?
You can build a windmill.

1315
01:22:07.831 --> 01:22:12.660
That's not illegal.
Now you can't,
sure you can and you can't.
Why?
Because,

1316
01:22:13.290 --> 01:22:16.980
um,
general electric is worried that you're not going to make one that's safe.

1317
01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:20.130
So they still need to go out there and inspect it to make sure.
No,

1318
01:22:20.131 --> 01:22:23.130
they did a whole fucking thing out in California where they,
once again,

1319
01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:25.800
they squeezed out the little guy and this is what they're doing,
Joe,

1320
01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:30.920
as we move into a greener ways,
as we're moving into group,

1321
01:22:30.930 --> 01:22:34.050
the reason why it's taking so fucking long for us to move into greener things is

1322
01:22:34.230 --> 01:22:34.920
because first of all,

1323
01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:37.800
there's still a lot more money to be made with the old things.

1324
01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:39.990
And then also the guy,
the the fucking,

1325
01:22:39.991 --> 01:22:43.230
there will be blood guys gotta make sure that they're still in control of it,

1326
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:46.680
you know,
that's my fucking solution to the Middle East.

1327
01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:48.720
You want to beat those cock suckers over there.

1328
01:22:48.910 --> 01:22:52.310
Just fucking make cars run on fruit loops or water or whatever the fuck we can

1329
01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:55.830
over here and people can do stand mayor came up with something on a long island.

1330
01:22:55.831 --> 01:22:57.960
How to make you make it run on water.
Okay.

1331
01:22:58.170 --> 01:23:01.170
How do these fucking terrorists get their money?
As far as I know,

1332
01:23:01.171 --> 01:23:02.730
Joe and I don't know a lot.

1333
01:23:02.910 --> 01:23:07.910
I believe that the money that we spend on all their fucking oil goes to the,

1334
01:23:08.130 --> 01:23:10.870
the they,
they had a rab over there.
They had the,
the,
the,

1335
01:23:10.871 --> 01:23:15.040
the fucking Shah or whatever the fuck is called and then he sits there and acts

1336
01:23:15.041 --> 01:23:20.041
like he's down with America while he subtly is sending money off to the Hamas

1337
01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:23.990
and the al Qaeda and all that.
So we stopped fucking using that.

1338
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.180
That God damn energy,
they'd go bankrupt over there.
You ain't got no money.

1339
01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:31.120
Joe Yank got no boosts.
You ain't got no Bougie.
Ain't got no guns.

1340
01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:34.570
What does that for a,
we ain't got no booze,

1341
01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:39.780
but we had kind of ones that from Kelly's heroes or circular telly Savalas or is

1342
01:23:39.791 --> 01:23:43.510
it from dirty dozen?
That was telly Savalas yelling at fucking Don Rickles.

1343
01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:45.670
You never saw Kelly's heroes.
Oh,

1344
01:23:45.671 --> 01:23:49.180
Kelly's heroes is a fucking great movie and it's hilarious because it doesn't

1345
01:23:49.181 --> 01:23:53.140
make sense because it's about world war two,

1346
01:23:53.141 --> 01:23:55.450
but it has the hippy Vietnam vibe.

1347
01:23:55.900 --> 01:24:00.380
It's right during that time with the directors took over in Hollywood like,

1348
01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:04.240
fucker,
we're going to do it our way yet.
Did you know up until like that,

1349
01:24:04.241 --> 01:24:08.530
like for the longest time that the director's job was basically only to make

1350
01:24:08.531 --> 01:24:13.531
sure that the actors were on their mark and that everything was in frame?

1351
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:17.500
I don't even think they were responsible to make sure about the lines.
No,

1352
01:24:17.501 --> 01:24:21.460
there was the studios operated like factories dude.
Yeah.
And the second you said,

1353
01:24:21.461 --> 01:24:25.780
and that's a wrap.
You left and the studio took the picture and they cut it up.

1354
01:24:26.170 --> 01:24:29.110
It's amazing.
Right?
That's why guys like Billy Wilder,

1355
01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:33.510
we're so renowned in the,
uh,
cause he did that in the 50s right?
Yeah.

1356
01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:37.930
He was being a real director in the 50s you know what I mean?
W it so basic.

1357
01:24:37.931 --> 01:24:39.610
What happens.
So with the Kelly's heroes thing,

1358
01:24:39.611 --> 01:24:43.990
by then what you had was you had that young generation that was taking over and

1359
01:24:43.991 --> 01:24:48.790
they will making a World War II movie and they had Kiefer Sutherland played this

1360
01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:54.010
southern,
sorry,
Donald Sutherland was playing this hippie a this sorta,
you know,

1361
01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:56.230
I don't know.
They had like their own like uh,

1362
01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:59.140
they had their own way of doing things,
man.
But it was funny.

1363
01:24:59.141 --> 01:25:01.720
It was before hippies became like played out and annoying.

1364
01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:05.170
You know who's like head guy?
Gavin Macleod,
isn't it?

1365
01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:08.890
Who's the head guy that Clint Eastwood,
Clint Eastwood Dude,

1366
01:25:08.891 --> 01:25:13.600
they got all the guys,
guys,
guys,
Clint Eastwood,
Telly Savalas,
Don Rickles,

1367
01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:16.870
Donald Sutherland.
Uh,

1368
01:25:18.250 --> 01:25:21.220
I think that guy who played angel on the Rockford files is in it.

1369
01:25:21.250 --> 01:25:25.900
I can't remember.
Gavin Macleod who used to be on May.
Hey,

1370
01:25:25.901 --> 01:25:29.190
they may,
he used to play Mary Tyler Moore from the love boat right here.

1371
01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.600
He's from Mary Tyler Moore,
the love boat.
That was that I'm saying.

1372
01:25:31.601 --> 01:25:35.680
He's the captain of the love boat and that was his cash grab.
He's like,
I'm old.

1373
01:25:35.890 --> 01:25:39.250
I can't believe I keep getting work.
But that little fucking mustaches,

1374
01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.600
little parents shorts being all tanned up,

1375
01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:47.620
little white shorts to the greatest exit and non flame out from drugs ever was

1376
01:25:48.941 --> 01:25:53.530
the guy who played Gofer on the love boat.
Dude,
you're on a show.

1377
01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:54.880
It's called the love boat.

1378
01:25:55.090 --> 01:25:59.680
Your character's name is gopher and you're wearing shorts like you're on a

1379
01:25:59.681 --> 01:26:03.040
cruise ship with those white socks yanked up to your fucking knees like you're

1380
01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:06.740
the ABA.
Right.
Okay.
Your career is over.
Okay.

1381
01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:08.780
You're going to take all anybody else,

1382
01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:13.250
any less of a fucking man would have taken all that money.
Okay?

1383
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:17.120
You would have found Donny most and you would've sent it up.
You fucking knows.

1384
01:26:17.121 --> 01:26:18.740
I shouldn't have set him.
He didn't do that.
Drugs,

1385
01:26:18.741 --> 01:26:21.600
whatever you find out Lawrence McCutchen or whatever name is.

1386
01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:23.350
What's that NZ fill with Kenzie fit?
Yeah.

1387
01:26:24.890 --> 01:26:27.500
Lawrence McCutchin is the old running back from fucking the Baltimore Colts.

1388
01:26:29.690 --> 01:26:31.040
But anyways,
that's what you would do.

1389
01:26:31.130 --> 01:26:35.640
He had the fucking wherewithal to be like,
I'm go for,

1390
01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:38.840
I'm on the love boat.
This is it.
What else do I want to do?
I'm into politics.

1391
01:26:38.841 --> 01:26:42.620
He went on.
He became a fucking state senator.
Which one was go for the black guy.

1392
01:26:44.090 --> 01:26:48.290
No,
that was Isaac Hayes.
I know it wasn't.
It was Isaac Curtis.

1393
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:53.270
That's another fight.
Isaac Curtis was a fucking wide receiver for the boy.
No,

1394
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:58.360
no,
no,
no.
You know who the fuck that was?
Oh,

1395
01:26:58.470 --> 01:27:00.830
you man.
You know what's funny about which were when the were,
I got a great,

1396
01:27:00.890 --> 01:27:05.720
which one was go for the hold on,
go for was the guy with the glasses.

1397
01:27:06.250 --> 01:27:09.710
Now the doctor who got all the pussy for no fucking reason.
That made no sense.

1398
01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:12.890
He had him.
Then you had Gavin Macleod.
Then you had,

1399
01:27:13.190 --> 01:27:17.780
you had the bartender who did the double point.
That was the black,
you know,

1400
01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:22.460
like a half the def jam had shots of the late eighties I'm getting confused.

1403
01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:34.380
Oh yeah,

Here to play.
[inaudible] he was probably on that fucking show.

1404
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:37.730
The point is,
there was a guy on that show.
He was a series regular.

1405
01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:42.650
His name was gopher to dark hair.
Yes.
Okay,
I remember.
Now let's,

1406
01:27:42.651 --> 01:27:45.590
let's go through.
Let's go through some sitcoms.

Squealer was that kid on fucking saved by the bell screech.

1412
01:28:08.691 --> 01:28:13.550
Screech squealing.
I'm still dumbfounded that I,

1413
01:28:13.610 --> 01:28:17.680
when you said Lawrence,
what did you call as McCutchen cause it's so good.

1414
01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:19.970
I knew it was Rickettsii.
That's so close.

1415
01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:24.830
Know it was like some sort of pig Latin.
No,

They're all done.

1416
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:31.220
Potsy Potts and done Ralph mouth done.
Every actor in Hollywood,

1417
01:28:34.490 --> 01:28:38.870
Fonzie even Fonzie's done.
This is the thing squigy squigy Outta here.

1418
01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:42.950
Out of there.
This is a thing as as a fucking,
as an actor,

1419
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:48.070
you have to instinctively know that if your character does not have a first and

1420
01:28:48.681 --> 01:28:51.980
a fucking last name,
it's already been doing this.
Please.

1421
01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:54.170
It's already going to be,
yeah,
absolutely.

1422
01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:57.320
Joe Will Mount this as much as we can and it's still actually recording.
Dude,

1423
01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:01.130
if you don't have like a real fuck and a name that you could walk out in public

1424
01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:03.840
with Alex p Keaton.
Okay.
He kept going.

1425
01:29:03.841 --> 01:29:07.170
He just had the unfortunate of getting sick and he was even sick and he was able

1426
01:29:07.171 --> 01:29:09.360
to do a western way.
Spin City.

1427
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:15.510
They're both about the same shit,
dude.
I watch sports.
I don't watch that.

1428
01:29:15.570 --> 01:29:17.500
The West Wing is about the White House.

1429
01:29:18.030 --> 01:29:22.380
Spin City was about him worker for a governor.
It's politics.
You just be happy.

1430
01:29:22.381 --> 01:29:26.460
I didn't say Benson again,
like no,
there you go.
Benton.

1431
01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:30.600
There's one God.

1432
01:29:30.601 --> 01:29:33.870

1433
01:29:33.871 --> 01:29:35.940

1434
01:29:35.941 --> 01:29:39.210
I'm talking about to get out of here.
Bence is not a bad name.
I,
somebody came in.

1435
01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:42.690
If a guy said,
my name is Benson,
but you're saying a one name character gone.

1436
01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:45.960
Dude.
I'm more talking about like you.
Your name is fucking zippy.

1437
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:50.460
Big Ragu gone.
See you later.
The Big Red Goop gone.

1438
01:29:51.490 --> 01:29:56.310
Uh,
uh,
who was the guy,
uh,
that ae on family ties?

1439
01:29:56.340 --> 01:30:01.170
Nick.
Nick.
His name wasn't Moose.
No,
it was nick.
His name was nick on the show.

1440
01:30:01.290 --> 01:30:05.530
His Moose Moose from that fucking show where those dick kids show,

1441
01:30:05.570 --> 01:30:10.170
they would step out of the locker television.
Yeah.
That was moose.
But hey to her.

1442
01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:13.890
Hey Jerry.
Yeah.
Moose.
She didn't even look like a moose.
Yeah,

1443
01:30:13.891 --> 01:30:16.470
it was just such a mean nickname.
It really wasn't [inaudible].
Yeah,

1444
01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:19.140
I love that show.
That that was a great shoe.
They used to torture kids.

1445
01:30:19.141 --> 01:30:22.920
Remember they did the firing squad.
They'd shoot the kids and shit.

1446
01:30:22.921 --> 01:30:27.000
That was a great show.
Red Now.
Yeah.
They did these to do a sketch.

1447
01:30:27.001 --> 01:30:31.260
It was on Nickelodeon and they used to do a sketch where they had that one guy

1448
01:30:31.261 --> 01:30:35.430
that played all the grownups on the show.
He was the one actor,
and he would fish.

1449
01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:38.310
He did like,
he would do like a Nazi character.

1450
01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:40.600
He was like any last words.

1451
01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:44.460
And the kid would say something and he'd make a one-liner and they'd shoot the

1452
01:30:44.461 --> 01:30:46.350
kid.
And then they,

1453
01:30:46.351 --> 01:30:50.010
he did another character called barf where he ran a restaurant and he was

1454
01:30:50.011 --> 01:30:50.730
disgusting.

1455
01:30:50.730 --> 01:30:54.270
He would always pick his nose and the kids eat and there would be like,
you know,

1456
01:30:54.271 --> 01:30:57.940
they would go,
uh,
they'd say something like,
you know,
you know,

1457
01:30:57.950 --> 01:31:01.110
I saw a dead squirrel in the street when I was on my way in here.

1458
01:31:01.111 --> 01:31:05.220
And then barf would pop up and you go,
uh,
what do you think should in the Burger?

1459
01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:09.240
That was his catchphrase and he was putting nasty shit.
So needless to say,

1460
01:31:09.241 --> 01:31:12.080
he never worked again.
What was his character's name?
He,

1461
01:31:12.190 --> 01:31:16.380
he was the guy that played all the male grown up care.
He played everybody.

1462
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.900
<v 5>I was in the,
when I was working in Denver,
um,
I'm doing,
I,</v>

1463
01:31:21.901 --> 01:31:26.870
I made a reference to family ties and at the end of the show,

1464
01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:29.780
this guy comes up to me,
tad it out,

1465
01:31:29.930 --> 01:31:34.730
tattoos all over him and he's fucking twitching a little bit.
And he goes,
Hey,
uh,

1466
01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:38.630
and his buddy comes up going,
hey,
you like family ties,
right?
He's like,
yeah,

1467
01:31:38.631 --> 01:31:40.490
this kid was one of the guys on it.
And I'm looking at him,

1468
01:31:40.491 --> 01:31:42.680
he's in like in his twenties.
And I'm like,
who the fuck was he?

1469
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:47.770
He played the little kid.
Why was he twitching?
Ah,
he said you

1470
01:31:47.770 --> 01:31:51.100
<v 8>probably saw me on TV getting arrested for drugs and drinking and driving.</v>

1471
01:31:51.101 --> 01:31:56.101
I've been sober for six months and and so his buddy who's hanging out with them

1472
01:31:57.161 --> 01:31:58.930
went to take,
you know,
wanted a picture with,

1473
01:31:59.290 --> 01:32:03.220
so we go to take a picture and that the former child star there is holding the

1474
01:32:03.690 --> 01:32:07.000
camera's hands are shaking and the kid with me goes,
uh,
look,

1475
01:32:07.001 --> 01:32:09.820
look at his handshake and look at his hand shaking and it really fucking pissed

1476
01:32:09.821 --> 01:32:10.960
me off and I want to be like,
you know what to do.

1477
01:32:10.961 --> 01:32:15.220
This kid's just hanging out with you because your fucking you right now.

1478
01:32:15.221 --> 01:32:16.960
Like he shouldn't be saying that.
If that's a true friend,

1479
01:32:16.961 --> 01:32:19.840
who the fuck would be saying that this kid is trying to be sober and he's making

1480
01:32:19.841 --> 01:32:22.960
fun of your fucking hands twitching and he's just a total cunt and he's just

1481
01:32:22.961 --> 01:32:26.160
trying to get a picture with me cause I've been on,
I love the eighties yeah,

1482
01:32:26.250 --> 01:32:30.970
he's just this fucking pathetic level star fucker.
He's like half a star fucker.

1483
01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.300
Yeah.
I just remember that stuck out.

1484
01:32:34.301 --> 01:32:38.110
It really annoyed me and I felt bad for that kid.
You could just,
you know,

1485
01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:42.010
if you know something,
do you know why I take some of those stuff?

1486
01:32:42.011 --> 01:32:47.011
Those the child star kids flameout is because what kind of a fucking kid wants

1487
01:32:47.441 --> 01:32:49.330

1509
01:34:13.031 --> 01:34:15.310

but something happened to the skulls of the kids on that show,

1521
01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:55.250
which show that home improvement.
Well,
nothing happened to skull.

1522
01:34:55.610 --> 01:34:57.710
They look like they were in fun house mirrors by the end of it,

1523
01:34:57.711 --> 01:35:00.890
they were going through puberty and like did they have fucking foreheads with

about like you get those kids is their puppies.

1526
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:14.540

but you know,

1527
01:35:14.541 --> 01:35:16.910
you can have an ugly dog.
And that's what I'm saying.

1528
01:35:16.911 --> 01:35:20.960
A lot of those kids were ugly dogs.
Yeah.
They kind of turned like,
yeah,

1529
01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:25.190
like I think at least two of the three kids on home improvement were on Roids

1530
01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:29.000
[inaudible] and Terry Thomas is still a pretty decent looking kid.
He was,

1531
01:35:29.050 --> 01:35:33.980
he had the pianist,
he looked like he had that composer hair.

1532
01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:38.140
He looked like he was in bugs bunny,
like he was gonna Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,

1533
01:35:38.141 --> 01:35:39.590
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

1534
01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:45.200
Like I can't get tails on go.
You should always be wearing tales,
you know?

1535
01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:47.030
You know what's actually tapping into right now?

1536
01:35:47.031 --> 01:35:49.340
Joe Is my fucking memory problem.
Like I,

1537
01:35:49.341 --> 01:35:52.640
I can't remember people's names and I can't remember the names of places.

1538
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:55.500
Like there's a breakfast place.
Me and Neil love out now,

1539
01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:57.770
the west coast and they have like these big,

1540
01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:01.040
huge biggest pancakes you ever saw in your life.

1541
01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:04.120
Biggest French toast and always putting like whipped cream and all this shit and

1542
01:36:04.130 --> 01:36:08.090
it's fucking Riddick.
It's mayhap right,
but you eat it,
huh?

1543
01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:10.460
Here's your always against eating shit like that.
Yeah,

1544
01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:13.000
but there's their French toast dude is ridiculous.
I know.

1545
01:36:13.010 --> 01:36:14.060
I don't do like the whip bite.

1546
01:36:14.061 --> 01:36:19.061
I just see people going by and they got like a whole stick of butter on it and

1547
01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:20.630
we bend that 200 times.

1548
01:36:20.631 --> 01:36:24.620
I can't remember the fucking name of the place you remember right now?
No.

1549
01:36:24.621 --> 01:36:26.360
I finally remembered it's called the griddle,

1550
01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:29.660
but for the longest time I was calling,
I was calling it our pancake circus.

1551
01:36:32.330 --> 01:36:34.520
I liked the griddle.
I'd been there.
Oh,
I do this.
What?

1552
01:36:34.521 --> 01:36:37.790
I'm trying to explain you why I say the composer because what I can,

1553
01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:39.410
I remember certain details.

1554
01:36:39.411 --> 01:36:43.070
I remember he had that long fucking Beethoven haircut.

1555
01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:48.050
So then it becomes that.
That's really fun.

1556
01:36:48.051 --> 01:36:51.860
And then what it does is then I throw it out there and then you go,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1557
01:36:51.970 --> 01:36:55.760
And then you say the name and I kind of am able to joke my way through the fact

1558
01:36:55.761 --> 01:36:59.060
that I can't remember shit.
I'm with you.
I'm with you pal.
Yeah.

1559
01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:02.000
All right there buddy.
I want to help you get through this.
Okay.

1560
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:05.920
We get through this bill.
I just realized I am fucking star Dude.
I know.

1561
01:37:05.921 --> 01:37:09.110
I feel like I'm going to pass out,
no offense,
but how much longer?

1562
01:37:09.111 --> 01:37:11.180
How much longer do I have to do free shit?
Well,
it's free,

1563
01:37:11.181 --> 01:37:14.600
so technically I can fucking cut it off whenever I can,
whenever I want to.

1564
01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:17.660
Why don't we want Joe when?
When are we actually going to be able to start?

1565
01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:20.210
Me and Joe de Rosa,
as you've noticed,

1566
01:37:20.420 --> 01:37:24.680
have just a tremendous chemistry when we get on the microphones and shit.

1567
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:28.040
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
On the one and two,

1568
01:37:29.610 --> 01:37:33.340
yeah.
That's where we do that podcast sign.
So listen,
so we're,

1569
01:37:33.341 --> 01:37:35.030
we're going to start doing these on a show.

1570
01:37:35.031 --> 01:37:38.960
Why can't we upload these fucking things onto the internet?
Look,
here's the deal.

1571
01:37:38.961 --> 01:37:42.350
We had this show called uninformed and then we started to do it as a podcast and

1572
01:37:42.351 --> 01:37:46.100
we're going to sell it for a buck.
An episode on the web.
I mean on the iTunes.

1573
01:37:46.650 --> 01:37:49.400
Yeah,
because we're actually can,
I can't get the guidance things to upload.

1574
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:50.780
Let me,
let me,
let me jump in here.

1575
01:37:50.930 --> 01:37:53.900
And the reason why we're charging a dollar and episode people is because we're

1576
01:37:53.901 --> 01:37:56.130
actually going to have guests.
We're going to have interviews,

1577
01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:59.570
we're going to be doing things.
I mean,
it's a fucking radio show and I know you,

1578
01:37:59.590 --> 01:38:01.920
people on the Internet don't like to pay for Shit.

1579
01:38:01.921 --> 01:38:05.820
It's a dollar an episode for the love of God.
You know?
It was that,

1580
01:38:05.890 --> 01:38:07.390
was that the fucking worst way ever to try.

1581
01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:11.100
I love how just nowadays as an artist,
you have to justify that,

1582
01:38:11.490 --> 01:38:15.810
that you know that your time is valuable.
Even if we don't have guests,

1583
01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:18.570
which we will have episodes where we don't,
you know,

1584
01:38:18.571 --> 01:38:21.870
we used to get paid to do the show.
It's work to do the show.
We have to,

1585
01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:23.400
we have to book gigs on the road.

1586
01:38:23.450 --> 01:38:26.640
You want to go to that bar and I want to find that guy who came up with that

1587
01:38:26.641 --> 01:38:30.930
cheeseburger and talked to him and just talk to him up just about food in

1588
01:38:30.931 --> 01:38:34.530
general.
There's a government agent try to take that guy out right now.
He isn't.

1589
01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:37.320
Probably works for him.
Look Joe,
your weight,

1590
01:38:37.321 --> 01:38:40.190
we talked about that cheeseburger in the last one.
I don't think you got it on.

1591
01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:45.240
Did I not talk about it in this one?
I didn't.
No,
I can't remember.
All right,

1592
01:38:45.241 --> 01:38:49.140
this is,
this is,
this is a fucking,
okay.
Just to fucking go back.

1593
01:38:49.141 --> 01:38:54.000
I talked about that fried butter a week ago and how like there's just insane

1594
01:38:54.001 --> 01:38:58.410
levels of like why,
okay.
I was in,

1595
01:38:58.411 --> 01:39:00.590
I was watching the Patriots game yesterday.
Joe Shit,

1596
01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:04.340
I know you're a big sports fan.
You know that they one bill the other day,

1597
01:39:04.350 --> 01:39:07.290
one buddy that we got lucky against the ravens again,

1598
01:39:07.291 --> 01:39:10.320
the ravens have beaten us the last two times we played them and somehow,

1599
01:39:10.321 --> 01:39:14.360
I don't know what happens.
They fucking,
they make a bonehead play.
They played,

1600
01:39:14.430 --> 01:39:18.210
they pull it out of pocket.
I would say that someone,
yeah,
patriots,
they could,

1601
01:39:18.211 --> 01:39:20.280
they pull it out of the pocket.
I'll tell you.

1602
01:39:20.281 --> 01:39:23.730
No one can talk sports like Joe Joe.
Why did the Patriots beat the Ravens?

1603
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:25.920
Cause Their GI bill.
Overall,

1604
01:39:25.921 --> 01:39:28.750
I just think they're a better team and when they're put under the gun they

1605
01:39:28.751 --> 01:39:29.584
deliver.

1606
01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:35.040
You could actually get away with that on a,
on a sports talk show.

1607
01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:37.560
It's another one.
You have to incorporate it.
This is another thing.

1608
01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:39.750
If somebody asks you what's wrong with the Patriots,

1609
01:39:39.751 --> 01:39:41.820
all you've got to start as this way.
I got to tell you,

1610
01:39:41.821 --> 01:39:45.260
if I'm the Patriots right now,
I gotta be thinking and then just,

1611
01:39:45.450 --> 01:39:46.260
you don't have that.

1612
01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:48.660
All you got to do is just throw anything in there and you'll be fine.

1613
01:39:49.290 --> 01:39:51.540
I'll tell you two things at two things.
I've been right about.

1614
01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:54.360
Two things that I called this season.
Joe was,

1615
01:39:54.361 --> 01:39:58.320
everyone was fucking jumping all over Sanchez,
the jets quarterback,
you know him?

1616
01:39:58.321 --> 01:40:01.490
Yeah.
Well Sanchez,
there's heat on that guy for no reason.
And uh,
you know,

1617
01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:04.530
I think he's a good player.
I mean,
he deserves a little leeway.

1618
01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:07.590
I like how you just said two things that,
no,

1619
01:40:07.591 --> 01:40:08.990
I said at the beginning of the season,
I mean the,

1620
01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:11.400
they called the guy a star after he beat the Texans.
I mean,

1621
01:40:11.401 --> 01:40:14.520
he's going to be a star.
It's not a star yet.
And I called it with my buddy.

1622
01:40:14.521 --> 01:40:17.640
I said,
dude,
he is gonna have that horrific pick six.

1623
01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:22.230
I'm a fucking rookie and he had it yesterday and I also called Matt Castle when

1624
01:40:22.231 --> 01:40:23.970
they send them over to Kansas City and everyone's like,

1625
01:40:23.971 --> 01:40:25.360
how the fuck are the Patriots?
Get rid of my,

1626
01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:28.050
said he was driving a Ferrari last season.

1627
01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:31.950
That's all he had to do was keep it on the fucking road and he went 11 and five

1628
01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:33.510
right now you're going to Kansas City.

1629
01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:35.780
All of a sudden you're not driving a Ferrari anymore.
No,

1630
01:40:35.950 --> 01:40:39.360
you don't even drive in a z 28 now you've got to Camaro rally sport.

1631
01:40:39.361 --> 01:40:42.510
That's what you got with the v six and you chicks driving it.

1632
01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:47.370
What I like about Matt Castles,
Matt is real players player and,
all right,
let's,

1633
01:40:47.371 --> 01:40:49.140
let's end it.
Let's do a new segment.

1634
01:40:49.370 --> 01:40:52.620
We're just sports [inaudible] talk with Chodo Rosa.

1635
01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:56.250
We'll just do fake sports talk for as long as I can.
I'll just,
okay,
but you,

1636
01:40:56.251 --> 01:41:00.130
you talk real sports and I'll,
I'll just fake through it.
I think we got it.
Joe.

1637
01:41:00.190 --> 01:41:03.430
I think me and the listeners understood the premise while you were doing it,

1638
01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:09.610
Joe,
what made Tony Doors set the running back that he was
Tony Door's set.

1639
01:41:09.611 --> 01:41:12.130
You know,
you know,
he had the legs of a champion.

1640
01:41:14.430 --> 01:41:16.960
He's just the guy who could run no matter what he could run.

1641
01:41:16.961 --> 01:41:19.480
And that's the most important thing when a running back is that they run.

1642
01:41:19.481 --> 01:41:21.420
These guys are out here talking about his style Gel.

1643
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:23.080
Talk about his style isn't running back.

1644
01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:26.860
Like who would you compare him to his style.
Look,
you know,
when running backs,

1645
01:41:26.861 --> 01:41:28.090
I'm looking for a Mike Quick,

1646
01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:29.773
<v 2>uh,</v>

1647
01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:35.530
<v 8>I'm looking for a guy that drills and runs that guy head down,
shoulders up.</v>

1648
01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:38.350
He knew how to plow through it and that's what you need.

1649
01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:40.060
Delivery to the end zone.

1650
01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:42.790
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1651
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:45.690
<v 8>You know,
it's amazing is how you will almost fucking almost,</v>

1652
01:41:47.490 --> 01:41:50.490
you're saying it's fucked up enough where people would still be looking at each

1653
01:41:50.491 --> 01:41:52.200
other like,
dude,
this guy doesn't watch sports.

1654
01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:54.330
But then you write as you think that,
then you're like,
oh,

1655
01:41:54.331 --> 01:41:57.930
maybe he does head down.
That makes sense.
Shoulders up.

1656
01:41:57.960 --> 01:41:59.610
How do you have [inaudible] head down in your,

1657
01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:03.900
how do you have your own shoulders up?
All right.
Yeah,
let's,

1658
01:42:03.901 --> 01:42:06.590
let's get back to the sandwich.
So before this whole thing goes off the rail.

1659
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:09.320
So I'm sitting at this fucking Bar,
right?
Cause that's what I do.

1660
01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:11.490
Do I drink during the day?
Let's say Latino.
Yeah.

1661
01:42:11.690 --> 01:42:14.330
I don't have anything to live for.
It's all about killing the silence.

1662
01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:17.690
The road is,
I will say it's just waiting for the next meal.

1663
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:19.820
Just waiting for the next meal.
For the next meal.

1664
01:42:19.850 --> 01:42:23.000
Please share the clank of the silverware.
That's all you want to do.

1665
01:42:24.290 --> 01:42:26.570
Joe Killed The loneliness.
All right,
so let's plow ahead here.

1666
01:42:26.571 --> 01:42:27.860
So I'm sitting at this bar,
right?

1667
01:42:27.861 --> 01:42:30.950
And I'm watching the game with this guy and this guy calls the bartender ordered

1668
01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:34.280
over to order some food and he goes,
yeah,
listen,
I want to order you.
Sure.

1669
01:42:34.281 --> 01:42:38.780
I didn't tell it on this one.
I'm not positive,
but I'm pretty sure tell it again.

1670
01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:42.590
Yeah.
Gives a shit.
That's a great,
yeah.
Cause we were talking about,

1671
01:42:42.910 --> 01:42:45.540
remember it led us on,
did a KFC shit and everything.
We didn't,

1672
01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:47.210
we didn't talk about that shit.
All right,
so anyways,

1673
01:42:47.211 --> 01:42:50.130
so the guy calls the bartender over and he goes,
yeah.
I goes,
yeah,
listen,

1674
01:42:50.670 --> 01:42:54.480
I want to order a custom burger.
And I'm like,
who the fuck does that?

1675
01:42:54.481 --> 01:42:55.890
Who Fuck or is a customer?
Well,

1676
01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:59.310
evidently this guy had this burger at this bar in New Jersey.

1677
01:42:59.311 --> 01:43:02.730
It's called a duck buster.
D U C K.
Buster.

1678
01:43:02.731 --> 01:43:05.520
I gotta give these guys credit because they really went above and beyond.

1679
01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:09.030
So evidently this dude ate it and he loved it so much.

1680
01:43:09.031 --> 01:43:12.000
He goes to this bar and he goes to order some listening to him order and the guy

1681
01:43:12.001 --> 01:43:15.210
goes,
all right,
what do you want?
He goes,
all right,
this is what I want you to do.

1682
01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:19.110
It's like that Jack Nicholson thing.
I want you to hold it between your knees.

1683
01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:21.300
It's like that fucking thing.
He basically goes,

1684
01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:26.540
I want you to make two grilled cheese sandwiches with tomato and bacon in them.

1685
01:43:27.330 --> 01:43:30.620
He goes to grow yet two grilled cheese sandwiches with tomato and Bacon.

1686
01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.490
And then I want you to you to use those two grilled cheese sandwiches as the

1687
01:43:35.491 --> 01:43:40.230
bread for the cheeseburger.
So the two sandwiches where the Bun?

1688
01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:43.360
Yeah.
And then he see you were totally blown away the first time,

1689
01:43:43.470 --> 01:43:46.460
but you already heard it so it's just gets through the no,
it was taken.

1690
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.070
Then he had another fucking,

1691
01:43:48.071 --> 01:43:51.860
then he had like a half pound of beef in there with cheese on of that.

1692
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:56.960
And I will say it again.
That sounds amazing.
And if I could get it right now,

1693
01:43:56.961 --> 01:43:57.794
I'd go get it.

1694
01:43:59.030 --> 01:44:04.030
The problem is we're getting at the problem is the product costs him $20 because

1695
01:44:04.230 --> 01:44:07.280
you know,
yeah,
that's like two,
two words of a grill.
This is what,

1696
01:44:07.281 --> 01:44:11.600
you know what Yo,
I would eat that.
I really gel.
Yeah.

1697
01:44:12.100 --> 01:44:15.500
Like I didn't fucking know that I would eat it.
You know what?

1698
01:44:15.570 --> 01:44:18.680
One time I was sitting here shooting the shit with Joe and I didn't realize

1699
01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:23.000
until he got to his second donut that he was actually just sitting across from

1700
01:44:23.001 --> 01:44:27.740
me eating a bag of donuts,
donuts.
It was like two in the afternoon.
Joe.

1701
01:44:27.741 --> 01:44:32.741
What I've seen you on many occasions eat pain cakes with chocolate chips and

1702
01:44:33.381 --> 01:44:37.130
shit and no,
you haven't banana bananas.
That's good for you,

1703
01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:41.020
but that's for do pancakes.
You know worse the God damn doughnut dude,
it's fresh.

1704
01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:42.950
Not at her Joe,

1705
01:44:43.730 --> 01:44:47.570
but I don't have the knowledge to fucking actually back up that.

1706
01:44:47.571 --> 01:44:51.500
I know I'm right.
Pancakes are not as bad as donuts.
Donuts.

1707
01:44:51.501 --> 01:44:54.530
You're trying to get fat.
You're trying to get,
you take a stack of pancakes.

1708
01:44:54.531 --> 01:44:56.630
You put butter and syrup on them.
You think that's that?

1709
01:44:56.660 --> 01:45:01.070
Any that a stack of [inaudible] though.
It's fucking pure sugar.

1710
01:45:01.370 --> 01:45:06.350
Having an orgy with butter.
What's it a pancake?
Pure.
It's not pure sugar.

1711
01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:10.210
Doughnuts are better there than nut Joe.
Let me tell you somebody not,

1712
01:45:10.450 --> 01:45:13.430
but don't you don't.
You don't.
Don't you?
Fuck you.
Don't know.

1713
01:45:13.431 --> 01:45:16.790
You don't how to make one.
Joe,
you've,
you've made a donut bill.

1714
01:45:16.791 --> 01:45:21.380
It's better that you DSI.
It's sugar coagulating with butter.

1715
01:45:21.381 --> 01:45:24.010
That's all it is.
Bill,
you're wrong.
I am not wrong.

1716
01:45:24.110 --> 01:45:27.050
You're making this up right John,
I'm gonna kick you off this fucking show.

1717
01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:31.670
I got wrong on my own podcast.
Rip and Tonitto but it's,
it's bread.
Dude.
I know.

1718
01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:34.080
What is your content?
It's not as bad as a pancake though.

1719
01:45:34.610 --> 01:45:37.880
[inaudible] not healthy,
but it's not as bad as case stacks.
Y'All.
First of all,

1720
01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:43.370
shout out one doughnut.
2:00 PM.
It's the same thing.
Fucking face.
You're wrong,

1721
01:45:43.670 --> 01:45:46.670
Joe.
First of all,
a fucking does nothing.

1722
01:45:47.330 --> 01:45:51.690
Don't you don't disrespect pancakes.
No,
I don't ever.

1723
01:45:51.890 --> 01:45:55.700
I'm going to tell you I have a fucking Pankey.
You know pancakes like pancakes.

1724
01:45:55.701 --> 01:45:58.490
I like that buddy of yours who you don't want anybody to talk shit about.

1725
01:45:58.491 --> 01:46:01.160
But you know this slightly retarded.
That's what pancakes are from me.

1726
01:46:01.161 --> 01:46:03.980
That's how I used to fucking,
no,
you don't understand the rules.

1727
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:06.220
You have to go to your little fucking pitch.
No,
that's not it.

1728
01:46:06.510 --> 01:46:09.410
That's how they used to make money on the road when I was on the road and I

1729
01:46:09.411 --> 01:46:14.180
wasn't making shit and I'm out there by my fucking self not talking to anybody.

1730
01:46:14.181 --> 01:46:16.430
Back to fly.
Even at a fucking cell phone,
Joe,

1731
01:46:16.610 --> 01:46:19.160
a lot of people didn't have cell phones in the late nineties I was one of them.

1732
01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:22.430
Okay.
And I fucking why be out there in the middle of Goddamn nowhere?

1733
01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.640
No actually by then I got a cell phone but I'd been so in the middle of nowhere.

1734
01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:28.880
It was like on that roaming thing and this is how I would make money cause I

1735
01:46:28.881 --> 01:46:30.320
wasn't making any fucking money,

1736
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:33.980
is what I would do is I would either go to Denny's or I would go to the IHUB and

1737
01:46:33.981 --> 01:46:38.690
I would get their large stack of five and dude it is not sugar.

1738
01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:40.340
It's like fucking cement.

1739
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:44.810
And you would just pour that in and it would mold to the shape of your stomach

1740
01:46:44.930 --> 01:46:47.300
and it would sit there and dude,
you eat that at fucking eight,

1741
01:46:47.301 --> 01:46:52.301
nine in the morning and then go do a nooner and then drive to Colorado schools

1742
01:46:53.410 --> 01:46:58.350
or the mines or some fucking Rhinelander Wisconsin fucking Gig.

1743
01:46:58.470 --> 01:47:00.900
And you would not be hungry for 12 hours.

1744
01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:03.670
And that way I was able to skip meals and,
and I,

1745
01:47:03.671 --> 01:47:07.020
and I could cut down on my food costs.
Okay.

1746
01:47:07.050 --> 01:47:10.650
You tell me you eat a sack of fucking donuts in the morning and you can go 12

1747
01:47:10.651 --> 01:47:12.450
hours without eating.
You can't.
First of all,

1748
01:47:12.451 --> 01:47:16.110
you'd pass out behind the fucking wheel because of all that sugar.
And you know,

1749
01:47:16.111 --> 01:47:20.970
that's fucking true.
Joe,
I want you to retract your statements about pancakes.

1750
01:47:21.930 --> 01:47:24.630
I will not tell you.
We'll deal with the ramifications of this Joe,

1751
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:29.040
because I have podcast listeners and they are very vocal and they email.

1752
01:47:29.670 --> 01:47:34.030
I,
uh,
it's not as bad as a fucking doughnut.
This is where you're,

1753
01:47:34.290 --> 01:47:35.310
you're not listening to what I'm saying.

1754
01:47:35.550 --> 01:47:40.550
I'm saying a statue of NOI makes is bad as one donut and let's say in a pile of

1755
01:47:41.611 --> 01:47:43.920
donuts is equal to a pile of pinkish.
Okay,
wait a minute.

1756
01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:48.570
We need a stack of pancakes.
No,
that's as bad as eating one doughnut.
I disagree.

1757
01:47:48.630 --> 01:47:51.420
Let's look it up on the Goddamn Internet round.
Look,
Joe,
cause kids,

1758
01:47:51.580 --> 01:47:54.270
what you're doing is you're equating quality,
uh,

1759
01:47:54.300 --> 01:47:58.930
calories to being equally bad.
Okay?
Look,
Joe,

1760
01:47:59.430 --> 01:48:03.000
I can eat fish shot you.
I did Joe.
I can eat.

1761
01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:08.120
I can eat fucking 400 calories of apples and you can eat 400 calories of donuts.

1762
01:48:08.701 --> 01:48:12.870
What the fuck is worse built?
Pancakes are not full stop.

1763
01:48:12.970 --> 01:48:14.430
You're going to shit yourself,
Joe.

1764
01:48:14.730 --> 01:48:17.340
There's nothing about pancakes that are good for you at all.
All right,

1765
01:48:17.341 --> 01:48:18.174
shit they got,

1766
01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:21.690
did they ever put fucking bananas or any sort of fruit on the side?

1767
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:25.230
When you get a donut,
they don't.
You put fruit to pay fluid.

1768
01:48:25.290 --> 01:48:28.410
They fill out a delicious,
delicious fruit.

1769
01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:31.620
Do you know what that time to make the donuts guide Jesus into him.

1770
01:48:31.621 --> 01:48:32.920
That's what the fucking fill out is.

1771
01:48:33.290 --> 01:48:35.880
Whatever is every once in a while I'd like to be a first grader bill.

1772
01:48:35.881 --> 01:48:38.550
I like a little donut here and there.
You know there's nothing wrong with it.

1773
01:48:38.551 --> 01:48:41.190
I think a lot of hate saying it like you're like a finger in your ass.

1774
01:48:41.570 --> 01:48:44.730
I like that too.
All right,
let's move on here.
Okay.

1775
01:48:46.590 --> 01:48:48.900
All right.
Let's go to the advice thing.
We have to actually do some stuff.

1776
01:48:48.901 --> 01:48:52.420
We've got 40 minutes here,
Joe,
and we got,
we got to read this one again,
Joel,

1777
01:48:52.570 --> 01:48:54.780
like it's the,
it's the first time we want to want to move beyond.

1778
01:48:54.810 --> 01:48:56.130
I have to do this because this guy wants to,

1779
01:48:56.131 --> 01:48:58.470
let's do this and then and then we got to eat something.
Dude,

1780
01:48:58.471 --> 01:48:59.780
I'm going to pass the fuck out.
You know?

1781
01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:02.880
Why don't you just go shave your legs and get it done with you.

1782
01:49:02.881 --> 01:49:05.890
Fucking don't even pussy.
All right.

1783
01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:10.500
You wonder.
This is the answer.
We'll give them them a little taste of uninformed.

1784
01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:13.620
Just imagine if we were talking about global warming and it was,

1785
01:49:13.621 --> 01:49:17.370
sounded this ignorant.
That is the uninformed show that's worth a fucking dollar,

1786
01:49:17.371 --> 01:49:21.940
isn't it?
It is.
God Damn Jesus hard.
It's hard to shine this.

1787
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:25.050
Never Watch the Beatles.
They used to get chased down the street by their fans.

1788
01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:29.380
Now it's gone full circle.
We're chasing fans,
pleading with them to,

1789
01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:32.200
to give us a fucking measly dollar for our art.

1790
01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:35.820
I like how [inaudible] I'm actually acting like they refuse to do it without

1791
01:49:35.821 --> 01:49:40.020
them even saying it.
I'm okay bill.
First off,
I'm a huge fan.
I love the podcast.

1792
01:49:40.021 --> 01:49:42.180
I have a bit of a dilemma.
I'm 35 years old.

1793
01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:47.010
I have a 30 year old sister and I'm very protective of her.
She has a,

1794
01:49:47.530 --> 01:49:50.650
that I used to be very tight with.
Um,

1795
01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:53.890
a few weeks ago we were coming back back from the cubs game,

1796
01:49:53.891 --> 01:49:57.880
even though the cock suckers last,
the three of us,
we had a blast at that game,

1797
01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:01.840
but we were all kind of lit.
How many fucking nights have started this way?

1798
01:50:01.841 --> 01:50:04.630
Everybody's having a good time,
but you get a little drunk,
Joe.
Yeah.

1799
01:50:05.020 --> 01:50:09.310
Well let's try a nice,
nice fucking game.
Those fucking gets fucking fucking game.

1800
01:50:09.380 --> 01:50:10.090
All right.

1801
01:50:10.090 --> 01:50:13.540
We're all kind of lit and on the way back I was sitting in the back seat of his

1802
01:50:13.541 --> 01:50:15.970
car while he was driving.
Um,

1803
01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:19.630
I was doing that flick the ear thing and he was starting to get pissed.

1804
01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:23.410
So he's flicking this kid in the back of his ear as he's trying to drunk drive

1805
01:50:23.411 --> 01:50:25.690
down the street after their home team lost.
Okay?

1806
01:50:25.810 --> 01:50:30.010
That's how this story is beginning.
He goes,
I should've quit,
but I was buzzed.

1807
01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:31.600
Long story short,

1808
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:36.640
we were at a light and I flicked him and then this cunt sucker,

1809
01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:39.910
he invented a curse word.
This cunt sucker punched me in the face,

1810
01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:44.800
knocked my tooth loose and I had to pull it out later.
All right.
First of all,

1811
01:50:44.890 --> 01:50:46.240
how hard did he flick them in the,

1812
01:50:46.241 --> 01:50:49.060
that's one of those things where you would try and to flick the year and then

1813
01:50:49.061 --> 01:50:53.320
you caught the whole fucking ear in his ear was probably ringing.
So anyways,

1814
01:50:53.410 --> 01:50:55.960
he had to pull his tooth out later.
So he says,
after he cracked me,

1815
01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:59.560
I got out of the car and tried to pull him through his window in the middle of

1816
01:50:59.561 --> 01:51:03.310
traffic.
Um,
he locked the doors and rolled up his window.

1817
01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:07.690
My sister was started going nuts on me to get back in the car.
I didn't,

1818
01:51:07.930 --> 01:51:11.020
I don't claim to be a hard ass,
but I got to get my do.

1819
01:51:11.170 --> 01:51:13.360
I'm fucking losing sleep over this shit.

1820
01:51:13.570 --> 01:51:18.550
How do I explain to my sis that this shit has to be done without sounding like a

1821
01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:21.910
caveman?
He's been ducking me,
sent to census.
Shit happen.

1822
01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:25.030
He's got to catch a beating and uh,
he will,

1823
01:51:25.090 --> 01:51:29.260
I just need to explain to my sis why this shit had to be done.

1824
01:51:29.261 --> 01:51:30.650
So basically his quote,
his,

1825
01:51:30.651 --> 01:51:35.140
his question is he stating that because even though he's flicking this kid in

1826
01:51:35.141 --> 01:51:39.730
the year,
the dude knocked his tooth out.
Okay.
He did it in front of his sister.

1827
01:51:39.731 --> 01:51:40.151
He's like,

1828
01:51:40.151 --> 01:51:45.151
this kid has to catch a beating is just some guy on guy guys understand this

1829
01:51:45.911 --> 01:51:50.410
shit.
How do I explain it to my sister?
So she doesn't think she can move beyond.

1830
01:51:50.411 --> 01:51:53.560
You're beating the shit out of my boyfriend.
Well,
I'm going to say this dude,

1831
01:51:53.561 --> 01:51:56.980
you're fucking,
we actually talked about,

1832
01:51:56.981 --> 01:51:58.650
why don't we just get catched cut to the church.

1833
01:51:58.690 --> 01:52:02.500
You're five years older that your youngest sister,
you're protective of her.

1834
01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:03.513
You know,

1835
01:52:03.850 --> 01:52:07.360
you don't like the fact you wanted her to remain a virgin her entire fucking

1836
01:52:07.361 --> 01:52:10.200
life.
But you knew in the back of your head that eventually a guy was going to be

1837
01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:12.400
coming along.
And as Nice as this guy is,

1838
01:52:12.490 --> 01:52:15.370
and even though you get along with them in the back of your head,

1839
01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:18.970
you can't get past the fact that this guy's fucking your sister.

1840
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:22.750
You know he's fucking your sister and there's nothing you can do about it.

1841
01:52:22.751 --> 01:52:24.760
So every once in a while when you get drunk,

1842
01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:30.010
that fucking hatred comes out in you and you start to be a little bit of a cunt

1843
01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:34.240
and you took it a little too far.
He was drunk.
You know,
Joe,

1844
01:52:34.241 --> 01:52:36.700
is there anything more annoying than somebody whacking you in the back of the

1845
01:52:36.701 --> 01:52:41.110
head is you're driving.
Okay.
He lost his shit.
He blasted you in the face.

1846
01:52:41.260 --> 01:52:44.950
You F you fucking,
you deserve to do exactly.

1847
01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:47.210
What would you do if he was doing it to you?
Yeah,

1848
01:52:47.211 --> 01:52:51.920
you'd clock him in his fucking face and you deal with it.
That losing your tooth,

1849
01:52:52.190 --> 01:52:54.950
his payment for becoming an adult.
That's what that is.

1850
01:52:55.100 --> 01:52:57.680
You're not losing sleep because you want to get this guy back.

1851
01:52:57.681 --> 01:53:00.830
You're losing sleep because you know you act like a fucking asshole and you got

1852
01:53:01.390 --> 01:53:04.520
JC on go easy.
You got you.
Got You.
But it's it just because this is,

1853
01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:06.440
cause I also understand dude,
if some,

1854
01:53:06.441 --> 01:53:09.140
if I was looking somebody in the year and I lost my fucking Tutu,

1855
01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:12.180
I would want to kill the guy.
Don't put your hands on somebody now.

1856
01:53:12.610 --> 01:53:15.380
You don't put your hands on somebody,
man.
You just don't do that.

1857
01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:18.260
You put your hands with somebody,
you get what you deserve.
That's it.

1858
01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:22.490
You don't touch.
All right,
show.
What if for some reason you were doing something,

1859
01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:24.830
you will flicking me in the back or whatever.
I don't know what the fuck.

1860
01:53:24.831 --> 01:53:28.550
And I turn around and I punched you in the face.
This guy gave mornings.
Tell him,

1861
01:53:28.551 --> 01:53:32.510
stop.
If you should stop doing it,
dude,
I would've stopped.
All right Joe.
Well,

1862
01:53:32.511 --> 01:53:34.610
let's see.
Let's,
let's do something here.
Okay,

1863
01:53:34.611 --> 01:53:36.260
I'm just being deviled at devil's advocate.

1864
01:53:36.410 --> 01:53:41.060
What would you rather have somebody flick your ears 17 times or lose a tooth?

1865
01:53:43.010 --> 01:53:47.360
Be Honest.
Be Honest.
Of course.
Flick my ear of corn,
right?
So what happened was,

1866
01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:49.280
what was this kid supposed to do?

1867
01:53:49.281 --> 01:53:51.740
They'll turn around and try to flick his ear back.
No,
he did.

1868
01:53:51.741 --> 01:53:56.690
He did the right thing.
You go stop the kids not stopping.
He clocks him.
Finally,

1869
01:53:56.780 --> 01:54:00.020
Dude.
So what does he do?
So what?
What does he do?
What is,
what is his,

1870
01:54:00.140 --> 01:54:03.460
how does nothing?
He actually got mad.
This guy can't sleep,
Joe.
He goes,

1871
01:54:03.461 --> 01:54:06.860
you gotta help him.
I'll tell you,
I'll tell you how you get sleep again.
Grow Up.

1872
01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:10.310
Be a man.
Go to the guy.
Why did I invite you on this?

1873
01:54:10.311 --> 01:54:13.520
Go to the guy because you agree with it.
You know what?
No,

1874
01:54:13.521 --> 01:54:17.600
not on a business thing,
Joe,
you know,
you know what?
You're a guest on this show.

1875
01:54:17.601 --> 01:54:18.980
I know my listeners look at this guy.

1876
01:54:18.981 --> 01:54:21.470
This guy's trying to justify beating the shit out of it.
Let me tell you,

1877
01:54:21.590 --> 01:54:22.610
this is what you got to do,
Dude.

1878
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:26.420
This is how you got to get them back in a silly way.
I hate to say this,

1879
01:54:26.421 --> 01:54:28.670
but what you're doing here,
dude,

1880
01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:31.790
is you're going to beat the shit out of that guy.
Okay?

1881
01:54:31.820 --> 01:54:36.820
And it's going to get ugly because you already feel like you have to do as much

1882
01:54:37.341 --> 01:54:40.970
damn equal damage.
Who's what?
You have to knock a fucking tooth of his out.

1883
01:54:41.210 --> 01:54:42.900
And not only that,
you're,

1884
01:54:43.070 --> 01:54:47.150
you're laying there awake stewing about this shit.
It's going to get,

1885
01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:48.230
it's going to be brutal.

1886
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:52.040
You're going to beat the shit out of him and she's going to be screaming like

1887
01:54:52.041 --> 01:54:57.020
Sharon Stone in fucking casino when James Woods is getting the shit kicked out

1888
01:54:57.060 --> 01:54:57.893
of him.
It's,
it's,
you know,

1889
01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:02.150
it's gonna fuck up the holidays for years and if she ends up marrying,

1890
01:55:02.151 --> 01:55:06.110
this guy is going to be questions about whether you're going to be invited to

1891
01:55:06.111 --> 01:55:07.160
the,
to the,
to the wedding.

1892
01:55:07.190 --> 01:55:12.050
I totally understand why you're envisioning giving this guy an uppercut where

1893
01:55:12.051 --> 01:55:16.790
all of his teeth climbing together and they just crack like in a fucking
cartoon.

1894
01:55:17.090 --> 01:55:21.590
You are not wrong for wanting to do that,
but you can't,
you cannot do that.

1895
01:55:21.591 --> 01:55:23.300
So,
um,

1896
01:55:24.050 --> 01:55:26.900
you gotta you gotta think of some sort of practical joke.

1897
01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:31.400
Like you got to say like,
look,
you gotta be a man and be like,
look,

1898
01:55:31.401 --> 01:55:32.270
I got out of line,

1899
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:35.330
you knocked my tooth out and then this is what you could just to psychological

1900
01:55:35.331 --> 01:55:38.420
torture.
Just say,
I'm not going to beat the shit out of you,
but no,

1901
01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:39.920
I am going to get you back.

1902
01:55:39.950 --> 01:55:44.190
So the years you're going to take off of his life while he's waiting you to do

1903
01:55:44.191 --> 01:55:48.360
whatever the fuck you're going to do and don't damage his property.

1904
01:55:48.810 --> 01:55:51.330
I'm trying to think of something like,
I saw a guy in the Internet,

1905
01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:55.110
I saw a guy on the internet.
What I'm,
it's bad advice.
I'm telling you,
dude.
Well,

1906
01:55:55.111 --> 01:55:57.840
first of all,
this is all bad advice.
They shouldn't take any of our advice.

1907
01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:02.670
[inaudible] what he should do is demand thing to do here is go up to the guy and

1908
01:56:02.671 --> 01:56:06.540
go,
look,
dude,
I'm a little person.
And you say it like you're missing a tooth.

1909
01:56:06.541 --> 01:56:09.780
And I have a speech impediment to say it that way.
Look,
dude,

1910
01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:14.700
I,
man,
I lost my tooth,
but I was looking in the ear.

1911
01:56:16.410 --> 01:56:19.230
Look for Bari.
We're both thinking,
I'm sorry because dude,

1912
01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:21.170
you got to understand too.
The guy driving,

1913
01:56:21.210 --> 01:56:23.490
he sheds at the beginning of the letter,
they were all drunk.

1914
01:56:23.550 --> 01:56:25.080
This guy's drunk drive.

1915
01:56:25.081 --> 01:56:28.320
He's trying to kick and this guy's flicking him in the fucking head.

1916
01:56:28.321 --> 01:56:31.050
That's annoying enough.
You know what,
y'all,
I got to go with this.
You're right.

1917
01:56:31.051 --> 01:56:31.884
You know what,
dude?

1918
01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:35.460
You're being an asshole and you lost a tooth and you fucking embarrassed.

1919
01:56:35.730 --> 01:56:37.590
You got to look inward.
You're right,
Joe.
You know what?

1920
01:56:37.591 --> 01:56:40.560
You're right and fucking right.
He's keys.
Got It.
He's got to like,
dude,

1921
01:56:40.810 --> 01:56:43.650
you know you got to,
you're not learning the lesson here.

1922
01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:46.700
You're not learning the lesson.
What you're doing is you,
you're,
you're,
you're,

1923
01:56:46.701 --> 01:56:48.670
you're escalating.
You're absolutely right.
But listen,
I,

1924
01:56:48.671 --> 01:56:49.980
I gotta tell this because people say,
you know,

1925
01:56:50.090 --> 01:56:52.290
you've got to watch out when you give advice because you've got to know that

1926
01:56:52.291 --> 01:56:55.710
we're both a couple of fucking morons.
You know neither one of us has any,

1927
01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:57.570
we have no business giving out advice,

1928
01:56:57.870 --> 01:57:00.840
but you guys don't have the money during this economy to actually go to someone

1929
01:57:00.841 --> 01:57:03.840
who is smart.
So I understand why you're asking me this,

1930
01:57:04.230 --> 01:57:07.890
but don't take my advice ever on this podcast.
All right,

1931
01:57:07.891 --> 01:57:10.230
this is how I do it and I'm doing this for free.

1932
01:57:10.231 --> 01:57:12.940
What are you gonna assume me for?
Huh?
My fucking mixer.

1933
01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:16.960
You're not mentioning names,
you don't mention names.

1934
01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:19.250
So there's anonymity here and you're,
you're,

1935
01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:22.150
what you're telling the guy to do is nothing.
This is great.
Joe.
First of all,

1936
01:57:22.340 --> 01:57:23.470
do you understand what just happened here?

1937
01:57:23.650 --> 01:57:27.160
We went from being complete non psychologists,
non therapist,

1938
01:57:27.161 --> 01:57:32.161
non fucking educated people here giving advice to then now Joe seamlessly.

1939
01:57:33.821 --> 01:57:36.880
You went from that to then giving me legal advice.

1940
01:57:38.450 --> 01:57:42.520
Do you realize you just did that?
Nope,
of course you did.
That's right.

1941
01:57:42.580 --> 01:57:44.350
I just talk.
I say what?
I need this right,

1942
01:57:44.351 --> 01:57:46.450
and you'd deliver it with confidence and people believe it.
You know?

1943
01:57:46.451 --> 01:57:48.790
I realize what this advice,
people don't even want advice.

1944
01:57:48.791 --> 01:57:52.150
You know what they want.
They want to be encouraged,
but yes.
You know why Joe?

1945
01:57:52.270 --> 01:57:55.780
Because they're surrounded by a bunch of fucking cons.
I'm telling you,

1946
01:57:55.930 --> 01:57:58.810
it's not the al Qaeda,
it's not global warming.

1947
01:57:58.810 --> 01:58:01.720
It's the overwhelming amount of constant.
I tell you that.
I can't,

1948
01:58:01.721 --> 01:58:04.810
I can't tell this story.
I can't tell it,
but,
and I brought it up.

1949
01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:07.900
I gotta to change the city.
I got to change.
Okay.

1950
01:58:08.140 --> 01:58:12.920
Let's say this happened fucking nine and a half weeks ago now.

1951
01:58:13.130 --> 01:58:15.910
That's she.
I got you.
I'll blog,

1952
01:58:15.911 --> 01:58:18.310
but it's not fair to bring up a story and leave these fucking people hanging

1953
01:58:18.340 --> 01:58:20.680
here.
I'll just,
I'll give you the gist of it.
I'm fucking,

1954
01:58:20.681 --> 01:58:23.500
I got into a political debate with somebody.
Okay.

1955
01:58:23.770 --> 01:58:28.330
Who clearly I,
I,
I do,
you know,

1956
01:58:28.331 --> 01:58:30.490
I don't mind debating with people and I can be swayed.
Look,

1957
01:58:30.491 --> 01:58:32.950
I got swayed in that fucking argument.
Made a great guy,
Dan Point.

1958
01:58:32.951 --> 01:58:36.430
I was a moron and you know,
sometimes I stick to my guns with the pancake thing.

1959
01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:41.050
You know,
I'm not a perfect person Joe.
Is that the beginning?

1960
01:58:41.110 --> 01:58:45.850
An awful song.
I'm not a perfect person.

1961
01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:50.330
Yeah.
So why don't you just stop that in itself.
There are,

1962
01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:51.670
that's just one of those sides.

1963
01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:53.740
Just makes you want to punch every girl in the bar in the face.

1964
01:58:53.890 --> 01:58:58.060
Cause they all start singing it.
Sometimes I stick to my guns.

1965
01:59:00.190 --> 01:59:02.380
I didn't want you sing it,
but wait a minute,
this is what happened.

1966
01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:06.100
Somebody we got in this political debate and this person was making

1967
01:59:08.510 --> 01:59:11.110
moronic points just like I was,
but I was,

1968
01:59:11.170 --> 01:59:16.170
but I was delivering my moronic points in a car like in a courtesy way and a

1969
01:59:16.751 --> 01:59:19.660
respectful way.
Right.
I'd be like,
you know,
we're talking about,
you know,

1970
01:59:19.940 --> 01:59:22.990
Iraq kind of fucked he,
I go,
the only successful,
you know,

1971
01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:26.350
occupation I've ever seen has been this country and it's because we weren't

1972
01:59:26.351 --> 01:59:30.710
leaving and we committed genocide.
So how do,

1973
01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:33.690
how do you win over there?
I don't,
I don't get it.
Did we just,
you know,

1974
01:59:33.730 --> 01:59:36.880
guys who just getting picked off over there and it's pissing me off.
Right.

1975
01:59:37.090 --> 01:59:41.170
So she would make points on how we could win over there and then she,
and when,

1976
01:59:41.171 --> 01:59:45.430
after she was done making her points,
you go,
uh,
Duh.
Right?

1977
01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:50.860
Do you realize the arrogant level of that?
Like I do.
She's acting like,

1978
01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:56.040
for some reason the fucking super genius generals of our own fucking army of

1979
01:59:56.411 --> 01:59:59.200
this country.
They can't seem how to fucking finish yet,

1980
01:59:59.230 --> 02:00:01.900
but this girl knows how to do it in the middle of nowhere,

1981
02:00:02.050 --> 02:00:06.610
having never fought a war and to,
she kept sticking her head out,
gone a Duh.
Yeah,

1982
02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:11.110
she's doing,
she's doing the,
uh,
you know,
the,
the couch coach.
Yeah.
No,

1983
02:00:11.111 --> 02:00:15.130
she wasn't eating with this guy.
And let's see,
this is somebody who clearly,

1984
02:00:15.340 --> 02:00:18.670
you know,
you can tell somebody they reek of not traveling,

1985
02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:23.320
that fucking their worldview from their culdesac is fucking,
you know,

1986
02:00:23.321 --> 02:00:26.200
and if they and will gives a shit mean I'm acting like I'm a fucking genius.

1987
02:00:26.201 --> 02:00:27.190
I'm not,
but,

1988
02:00:28.030 --> 02:00:31.180
but at least I have the presence of mind to know that I'm a fucking moron,

1989
02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:32.051
so I will,

1990
02:00:32.051 --> 02:00:35.800
you know who I was arguing with that pancake shit I knew in the back of the head

1991
02:00:35.801 --> 02:00:38.650
I was probably wrong on stuff,
which is why I made it funny.

1992
02:00:39.190 --> 02:00:43.540
I would never be like,
Joe,
there's no sprinkles on pancakes.

1993
02:00:43.630 --> 02:00:45.440
A duh stick.
Do you know what?

1994
02:00:46.140 --> 02:00:49.360
Are you able to punch me in the face and I'd lose a tooth.
Right.

1995
02:00:49.390 --> 02:00:52.210
Look at me and saying false.
And that's our out.
That's how out for that.

1996
02:00:52.211 --> 02:00:54.340
That's how it happens though.
Don't you do that?

1997
02:00:54.730 --> 02:00:57.740
Don't you mock how I just got out of that?
No,
I was show you Daniel.
Oh,

1998
02:00:57.770 --> 02:01:00.250
you didn't know I was saying.
There you go.

1999
02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:04.590
I'll say did to get a sandwich of starving joke.
Wait,

2000
02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:08.020
where did you get your basketball shorts?
I don't know.
Somebody gave them to me.

2001
02:01:08.170 --> 02:01:11.050
I know you don't play this.
I don't like how shiny they are.

2002
02:01:11.230 --> 02:01:14.440
Like you were an all star one year,
like your gym.
Like I'm,
I don't like them.

2003
02:01:14.441 --> 02:01:16.900
I just put them on because I don't care if I shit them up while I'm doing the

2004
02:01:16.901 --> 02:01:21.790
laundry.
Doing the with the laundry.
All right,
listen,

2005
02:01:21.850 --> 02:01:24.790
that's a,
there you go.
There's our first,
our first fucking guest ever.

2006
02:01:25.510 --> 02:01:29.500
Joe De Rosa and Joe de Rosa and classic spirit of our wonderful radio show.

2007
02:01:29.501 --> 02:01:34.501
The uninformed show has now informed me that there is no difference between

2008
02:01:35.771 --> 02:01:40.160
pancakes and donuts.
He gave me legal advice,

2009
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:47.150
anonymity.
We talked sports today.
Thanks for having me on,
man.
It's fun.

2010
02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:48.540
Okay,
well I tell you,

2011
02:01:48.541 --> 02:01:51.530
I really enjoy doing shows with you and I really hope that people,

2012
02:01:51.531 --> 02:01:55.250
when we finally get these fucking episodes up,
which I will let you know on the,

2013
02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:57.110
uh,
on the,
on the podcast here,

2014
02:01:57.230 --> 02:02:00.170
cause this thing I just do is a goof or whatever as opposed to the uninformed

2015
02:02:00.171 --> 02:02:04.220
thing,
which is so fucking serious.
Um,
I'll let you know when it's up cause uh,

2016
02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:07.550
we really,
seriously,
man,
that's something that,
you know,
as much as my stand up,

2017
02:02:07.551 --> 02:02:10.250
I want to build that radio show because I got to met man.

2018
02:02:10.250 --> 02:02:13.760
I think it's just as good as anything else that's out there and God got,
dammit.

2019
02:02:13.761 --> 02:02:16.520
It's worth a dollar to take a risk.
And if like usual,

2020
02:02:16.550 --> 02:02:18.410
I don't have any information of when it's going to be up,

2021
02:02:18.411 --> 02:02:19.580
but hopefully by next week,
Joe,

2022
02:02:19.581 --> 02:02:23.930
can you find some fucking tech nerve train up there?
I'm trying.
Trying a dude.

2023
02:02:24.020 --> 02:02:28.340
That's not what your outfit says.
You're off.
That says I quit.
All right,

2024
02:02:28.341 --> 02:02:30.350
let's go get some pancakes.
You'll get a doughnut.
All right.

2025
02:02:30.351 --> 02:02:33.880
Thanks for listening to the uninformed.
I mean,
not on a form.
I'm sorry to the,

2026
02:02:34.090 --> 02:02:36.710
to the Monday morning podcast.
Why saw your cute face?

2027
02:02:37.100 --> 02:02:40.010
I thought that's what we were doing.
You guys all have a good week.
Hey,

2028
02:02:40.011 --> 02:02:43.520
I'm going to be at the,
uh,
the Improv in Pittsburgh this weekend.

2029
02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:45.340
I'm at the top of my game.
Motherfuckers,

2030
02:02:45.470 --> 02:02:47.960
I've been on the road for the last five weeks.
Okay.

2031
02:02:48.110 --> 02:02:53.110
So you fucking strap in and put on your comedy hats and take that wet whistle

2032
02:02:53.961 --> 02:02:57.440
between your fucking toes.
Cause I'm bringing the comedy.
What am I hyping

2033
02:02:59.630 --> 02:03:02.990
Joe?
This is my podcast.
You're selfish cunt.
All right.

2034
02:03:03.110 --> 02:03:03.943
When are you going to be there?

2035
02:03:04.940 --> 02:03:09.800
The weekend of October 23rd on the 23rd and 24th I'll be recording my CD at the

2036
02:03:09.801 --> 02:03:13.730
stress factory for comedy central records.
Stress Factor,
New Brunswick,

2037
02:03:13.731 --> 02:03:17.910
New Jersey.
Please come out please.
23rd 24th of October.
And I'll tell you this,

2038
02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:23.030
Joe.
I will argue they have the best Mozzarella sticks of any comedy club.
Dude,

2039
02:03:23.031 --> 02:03:24.510
it's the perfect combination where the,

2040
02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:28.730
where the outer layer is nice and crunchy.
And you know,
I hate the ones that,

2041
02:03:28.810 --> 02:03:29.461
it's just all mush.

2042
02:03:29.461 --> 02:03:32.630
It's just like you're eating like garlic bread that somebody dropped in a fry

2043
02:03:32.631 --> 02:03:37.390
later.
So even if you don't like Joe's act,
you can sit there now.

2044
02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:41.360
Go check them out.
I,

Joe Rose's a funny motherfucker.
