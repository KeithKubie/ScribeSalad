1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.890
Is your wife disciplined?

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.710
How do you navigate a potential mismatch between you two?
What about when family,

3
00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:12.540
non disciplined costs you unexpected time and energy taking from your goals?

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.800
Family nondisciplinary what?
Like my family's not being disciplined,

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.780
not on board or whatever.
They're not on board with the program.
My wife is,

6
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.080
she runs a tight ship and as disciplined in a little bit of a different way than

7
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:31.260
me.
Uh,
then she's not the same as me.

8
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.640
And if that were to cause some kind of a conflict between us,

9
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.510
well then that's my fault for not communicating with her and allowing her to

10
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:48.810
understand my perspective and understanding her perspective.

11
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.000
So for instance,
what are,
what's the situation,
right?
Oh,

12
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.690
my wife wants me,
you know,
she wants to spend time with me in the morning,

13
00:00:57.691 --> 00:01:01.470
whatever.
Right?
What did you wake up early and work out before she's awake?

14
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.030
You're working out.
It's not her fault.
It's not her fault.
It's my fault.

15
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.520
Well,
what about when,
oh,
I really want to eat dinner with you at night.
Okay,
cool.

16
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.610
I'll eat dinner with you and I'll stay up later at night.

17
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:19.080
So that I can get my work done and that's fine.
You go to bed,
that's not,

18
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.530
that's not,
that's not my responsibility.
That's not your responsibility.

19
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.640
That's my responsibility.

20
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.290
It's not your responsibility to mold your life around my whole life.
Right.

21
00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:33.120
That's not,
that's,
that's not the way it is.
And by the way,

22
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.330
when the family is doing something that is taken away,

23
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:44.580
what did he say?
My energy taken away my energy and taking away my time.

24
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.600
Then I fixed that problem and when I say that I fixed the problem,

25
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.550
I don't mean I fix them do,

26
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.000
I don't mean that I impose my discipline on them.

27
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.890
I'm,
it might involve some adjustments or some attempts to get adjustments,

28
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.930
but I'm not,
be this really simple.

29
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.980
I don't blame my family when things don't go right.

30
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.500
I couldn't work out today because my kid was sick.

31
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.770
My daughter spilled the milk and I was like,
Hey,
this is the same.

32
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:24.000
This is just about ownership.

33
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.960
Like if you just want to blame your family when you're weak or you make a

34
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:31.020
mistake or you didn't organize or you didn't explain to people correctly,

35
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.930
then that's the way it is.
I can say this to your family is not you.

36
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.890
Your family is not you.

37
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.850
They aren't on your program.

38
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.400
That's not there.
That's not their deal.
Hey,
if they're on it,
great.
That's cool.

39
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.790
My family is not all on my program.

40
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.250
That's not the way it works in impose.
Oh,
that's fun.

41
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.730
There wasn't,
where's that gets you?
You,
Oh,
you want to,

42
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:06.790
you want to impose your program on everyone in your family.

43
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.210
What are they going to do?
What?
It's the same thing that happens with any team.

44
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.920
If you start imposing your strict discipline on them,

45
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.380
cool.
You can get them to do what you want them to do at that moment.

46
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.410
Guess what they do?
As soon as they get the opportunity to rebel against you,

47
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.570
they rebel.
You get a mutiny.

48
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.750
You get a kid that's rebellious beyond the norm that's doing thing that's

49
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:30.430
actually gonna going to really reject you.

50
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.470
So you got to,
you've don't blame your family.

51
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.740
Fix the problem.
Do you know who you have control over?
You?

52
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.290
You don't have control.
You don't have control over your nine year old kid.

53
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:43.840
You might think you do,
but you don't.
You've got to make,

54
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.050
you don't have control over your wife to just make her,
you know,

55
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.630
get in the game.
Oh,
you want to,
you want to stay on the program,

56
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.810
you want to cook,
uh,
whatever.

57
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.860
14 chicken breasts on a Sunday night.
So you've got two a day during the week,

58
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.790
honey,
make it happen.
No honey,
no.
Make that happen.

59
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.470
If you are a good leader and you explain what your goals are and you get her on

60
00:04:10.471 --> 00:04:13.000
board with the program,
then yeah,

61
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.870
guess what she's doing on Sunday night helping you cook some chicken breasts for

62
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:20.830
the week.
Yeah,
but this is just like anything else,
man.

63
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.900
This is just like any other leadership situation.

64
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.800
You want to blame the team when something's going wrong that's not going to get

65
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:29.950
you a solution.
You need to take ownership of the problem.

66
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.440
You need to get the problem solved.
And when I say get the problem solved you,

67
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.200
this doesn't mean impose your will on the team.

68
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.770
That means you need to lead the team and there's a big difference.

69
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.200
So
get some,
yeah.

70
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.240
Yeah.
And by the way,
the better,
just like anything else,

71
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.410
just like Hackworth,

72
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.970
the better relationship that you build with your wife and with your kids,

73
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.670
guess what?
The more flexibility you have,

74
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.970
the more the leeway they give you.

75
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.650
The worst relationship you build with your wife and kids,

76
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.190
the less flexible and the less leeway and the less chicken breasts you're going

77
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:16.540
to have cook for you.
It's true.
They're not in the game with you.
Yeah.

78
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.730
So build a relationship.
I know that might sound like like,
oh,

79
00:05:20.731 --> 00:05:24.250
well we're married so we have relationships.
Not necessarily true.
Yeah.

80
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.430
Build a relationship.
Make them understand where you're coming from.

81
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:30.940
Make them understand what the strategic goals are.
Yeah.
Make them understand.

82
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.530
Just like in a leadership situation,

83
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.860
make sure they understand how the strategic goals that you're trying to achieve

84
00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:36.461
for yourself.

85
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:40.030
We'll then come all the way back down and impact them in a positive way.

86
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.520
Because by the way,
if you're doing things strategically that are gonna help you,

87
00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:45.610
that are going to screw over the rest of the team,
or in this case family,

88
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.480
guess what?

89
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.360
You're not going to get support for those goals because they're not helping out

90
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:53.950
the team.
If you're doing it for yourself and yourself only that's problematic.

91
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.550
Yeah.
So if you're,
hey,
I want to work out,

92
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.060
I want to get,
you know,
I want to work out,
I want to train Jujitsu every day.

93
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.260
Okay,
well how do I benefit from that?
Yeah,
honey,
how does,
yeah.
Okay,

94
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:09.830
well let me tell you how.
Here's my plan.
In six years,
I,
you know,

95
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:11.810
I'm a purple belt right now it's six years.

96
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.240
I'm going to get my black belt and when I get my black belt,

97
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.100
we're going to open a school and when I open a school,

98
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.350
guess what we're going to do all day?
We're going to teach Jujitsu,

99
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:19.850
we're going to hang out at our gym.
We're going to have a good time.

100
00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:22.550
That's the strategic goal.
I need you in the game with me right now.

101
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.380
That's totally different than war trued.
Yup.
I'm a man.
Yeah.

102
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.660
They'll keep me,
keep me from this.
Well,
yeah,
in that,

103
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.350
depending on who you are,
obviously,
but I would even say that's,

104
00:06:35.351 --> 00:06:36.680
even speaking from my own experience,

105
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.700
that's even over saying it really,

106
00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:44.320
like let's say take Jujitsu or working out or whatever.
Yeah.
You know,
like to,

107
00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:47.580
you know,
to do that.
But I get,
I get the example for sure.
No,

108
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.350
you're gonna say something much more simple,
easier way more bay and just say,

109
00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:54.890
Hey,
this,
this,
this part of my life.
Even if it's new,
it's a new,

110
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:58.430
I know our family's chaotic.
You need my help with the kids and be like,
but hey,

111
00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:01.670
this,
this is sort of,
this means a lot to me and it makes me feel good.
Makes me,

112
00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:05.240
you know,
a happy person or whatever.
It can mean you can,
we make this work,

113
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.440
you know,
Ken,
can we do,
what do you want from me?

114
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.430
You know how you like this other thing.
Sure.
Yeah.

115
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.010
I want to support you doing that.
Here's where I need support,
right?
Yes.

116
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.710
Thing puts a smile on my face.
Yeah.
You want me smiling around here?
That's what,

117
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:19.311
and people,

118
00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:23.270
I'm sure someone's going to bring up the fact that there were times when I was

119
00:07:23.271 --> 00:07:27.320
in the ames and I would come home from work at seven 30 at night.

120
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.360
I'd pick up my gym bag,
a dropoff,
my my work bag,
and I just walked.
I'd go,
Oh,

121
00:07:32.361 --> 00:07:33.440
hang on,
I'm going to train.

122
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.690
And there was a few times where she did not want me to go train tears in her

123
00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:42.680
eyes.
You got to be kidding me.
You've been gone all week.

124
00:07:42.681 --> 00:07:43.610
You've been gone for two weeks.

125
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.280
You come home at seven 30 and you're going to go train instead of eating dinner

126
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:47.770
with us.
I was like,
Yep,

127
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.520
that the reason I bring that up,
because I know someone's gonna break up.

128
00:07:52.521 --> 00:07:55.010
That's not good leadership.
That's not me being cool.

129
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:59.270
That's not me building the relationship.
That's me moving in the other direction.

130
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:04.220
Yeah.
So that's not what I'm saying to do,
but if you come home,
hey look,

131
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.230
here's the deal.
Here's what's going on.
Here's why I,
you know what I've got,

132
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.970
I come home from work.
I got a lot of stuff on my brain.

133
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.800
I'm in a bad mood when I come home and I don't want to be in a bad mood around,

134
00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:17.570
you don't want to be a bad mood around the kids.

135
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.580
I'm going to go train for an hour.

136
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:24.170
When I come back I'm going to have a smile on my face.
Watch
what?

137
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.960
Boom.
And man like and,
and that's actually my wife eventually told me like,

138
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:34.040
oh,
when you don't train,
you're not nice to be around.

139
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.080
Not that I was intentionally [inaudible] no,
but you just have the,
uh,
you don't,

140
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.190
you don't have that release that that is a real thing for sure.

141
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:47.300
I mean it's manageable.
Everyone's different I think,
obviously,
but I wouldn't,

142
00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:51.380
you can even say something even more sick cause that's a hard one to,

143
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:56.360
to sell sometimes to some people to be like,
hey,
all be happier,
you know?
Yeah.

144
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.380
Then they'll be like,
mm,
well or except for that all be happier.
Mains,

145
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:05.030
we'll be happier.
Yeah.
And you've got to,
you're right though,
you got a bar,

146
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.380
you've got to give and take.
Right.
You've got to say,
okay,
what do you,

147
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:10.290
what can I do for you?
Exactly.
Right.
That's,
that's what it is.
Be like,
Hey,

148
00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:14.280
this means a lot to me.
You know,
to,
and usually,
you know,

149
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.410
in a relationship like that,

150
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.710
they care if something means something to your husband and wife or whatever.

151
00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:22.800
Like that's not nothing.
That's something,
you know,
look,
if you,
if the,

152
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:26.010
if you're a husband and you say this did you use,
it means a lot to me.

153
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:30.150
Therefore you need to sacrifice your whole thing to accommodate it.

154
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.780
You can't do that.
But it's not nothing.
So you should say,
hey,

155
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.810
as a leader you can't have the team sacrifice everything thing.

156
00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:42.570
Yeah,
exactly.
I do a good job on this mission.
I'm going to get promoted,

157
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.900
you know,
or hey,
if we do a good job with this product,

158
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:47.670
I'm going to make more money.

159
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.680
It's more from my bottom line profitability for our shareholders.
No one cares.

160
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.050
The front line doesn't care about profitability for the shareholders unless they

161
00:09:55.051 --> 00:09:56.650
understand how it relates back to them.
Yeah.

162
00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.970
So family doesn't care about you train in Jujitsu unless they realize how it's

163
00:09:59.971 --> 00:10:03.870
going to come back to you.
So what you do is you tell her like,
hey,

164
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:07.500
just can we make this work and actually whatever,

165
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.560
however this gets in the way of us,
you know,
like whatever.

166
00:10:10.561 --> 00:10:15.150
Like I want to just in general make that up to some way,
you know,
like what can,

167
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.160
what can I do for you?
Like I said,
or,

168
00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:19.530
or what do you want to do something or I could list,

169
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.960
let's do this so we can both kind of have something fun.

170
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.900
Come with me if you want,
but hey,
I don't,
don't,

171
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:27.270
don't just automatically expect your wife to love Jujitsu like you love to do

172
00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.100
too.
Unfortunately,
unfortunately.
Goes for everyone almost.

173
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:35.340
It's possible.
Very possible.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I'm saying,
you know,

174
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.810
if like how you're saying like make it make,
you got to accommodate it,
you know,

175
00:10:39.811 --> 00:10:42.930
straight.
If you're doing like a workout,
let's say,
and it's your thing,
right?

176
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.290
Like to look,
don't work out and you know,
and that's my thing.
Whatever.

177
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.140
Jujitsu I think is a different one because working out is like,

178
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.520
you can kind of do that whenever.
Yeah.
But Jujitsu is like,

179
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:57.960
if you don't be,
you got to go train with some people.
Yeah.
You know?
So yeah man,

180
00:10:57.961 --> 00:11:02.340
if,
and constant communication too by the way,
like you know,

181
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:06.450
cause after a while it's like,
oh you're going to use it again.
They're like done.

182
00:11:06.451 --> 00:11:09.120
Or the kids kind of need help with the homework and I'm swamped with this other

183
00:11:09.121 --> 00:11:10.740
family stuff,
you know,
kind of thing.

184
00:11:10.741 --> 00:11:13.380
But if you're constantly communicating and then she'll tell you,
hey,

185
00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:16.710
do you mind not going on this day because of this?
And you're like,
okay,

186
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.030
me going on this specific day,

187
00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:21.030
is that more important than the help that they need with the homework,
you know?

188
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.660
And you can accurately kind of navigate your way through your,

189
00:11:23.661 --> 00:11:25.680
your new situation,
you know?
But yeah,

190
00:11:25.681 --> 00:11:28.680
you gotta keep talking on that one because some people they think,
oh,
I can go,

191
00:11:28.681 --> 00:11:30.850
do you get to know?
And I don't have to say nothing.
I'm on.

192
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.940
I'm just rolling out under every circle.
You know?

193
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.750
It doesn't work like that sometimes.
Don't,
don't be like me in that sense.

194
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:41.490
Don't be like Taco.
You probably,
my wife was very understanding.
Yeah,

195
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.820
so that's great.
Yeah.
Yeah.
My wife probably would have murdered me,

196
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:49.350
rightfully so,
like killed me like as a crime.
