RETO MEIER: All the
great speed improvements

00:00:01.833 --> 00:00:03.350
of Android 2.0
and everything you

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.840
need to be able to take full
advantage of the Android N

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.480
Developer Preview, plus a bunch
of bug fixes and stability

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.450
improvements.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.740
I'm Reto Meier, it's
Android Tool Time time,

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.296
and this is Android Studio 2.1.

00:00:14.296 --> 00:00:15.700
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.880
Installing the
Android N Preview SDK

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.110
requires Android Studio 2.1.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.030
As well as N-specific
bug fixes, it also

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.730
supports the N Developer
Preview emulator, system images.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.360
It also allows you to
use the new Jack compiler

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.980
but note that Jack doesn't
currently support Instant Run.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.480
Jack does support many
Java 8 language features

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.590
such as lambda expressions.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.960
Our lambda implementation
uses anonymous classes,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.780
making their use
backwards compatible.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.790
If you target
Android N, Jack also

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.110
supports default and
static interface methods,

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.549
repeatable annotations,
and method references,

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:50.215
though they are not
backward compatible.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.090
Android Studio 2.1
includes speed improvements

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.520
to Instant Run, making
it significantly faster.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.370
For instance, to reduce
compilation time,

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.470
the incremental Java
[INAUDIBLE] feature is now

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.190
enabled by default. If you've
allocated enough memory

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.320
to the Gradle Daemon, we also
enabled dexing in process

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.070
by default, which performs
dexing within the build process

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.680
rather than a separate,
external VM process.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.960
Aside from these features,
Android Studio 2.1

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.120
also includes a number of
bug fixes and stability

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.672
improvements, especially
for users with the Android N

00:01:20.672 --> 00:01:22.030
Preview SDK installed.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.880
FEMALE SPEAKER: You know, the
last time Android Studio did

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.170
a point update with
mainly bug fixes,

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.372
it was right before
a major release.

00:01:29.372 --> 00:01:30.080
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.150
Yeah, I guess you're right.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.441
FEMALE SPEAKER: And right
before a pretty big developer

00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:35.530
conference and isn't
Google I/O coming up?

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.730
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:36.230
May 18.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.687
May 18.

00:01:37.687 --> 00:01:39.020
It's just a coincidence, though.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.454
I wouldn't read
too much into it.

00:01:40.454 --> 00:01:41.620
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sure, right.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.980
So can we look in the box?

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.314
RETO MEIER: I'd really
prefer it if you didn't.

00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:49.550
Upgrade to Android Studio 2.1
to play with the new Android N

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.487
Developer Preview,
get faster Instant Run

00:01:51.487 --> 00:01:53.820
and take advantage of a bunch
of bug fixes and stability

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.930
improvements.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.150
This is Android Studio 2.1, and
this is Android Tool Time time.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.300
