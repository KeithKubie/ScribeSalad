00:00:00.184 --> 00:00:01.141
- [David] Hello Kim.

00:00:01.141 --> 00:00:02.202
- [Kim] Hey David.

00:00:02.202 --> 00:00:05.734
- [David] So let's talk about
the Lost Colony at Roanoke.

00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:06.754
- [Kim] So this is something

00:00:06.754 --> 00:00:08.386
I've been learning a lot about lately,

00:00:08.386 --> 00:00:11.255
and I think is really interesting.

00:00:11.255 --> 00:00:12.920
You know, we often think about this

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.683
just in terms of the spookiness of,

00:00:15.683 --> 00:00:17.501
there's this colony and it disappeared,

00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:19.878
and we still don't know
what happened to it.

00:00:19.878 --> 00:00:21.985
But actually, I think it has a lot to say

00:00:21.985 --> 00:00:26.021
about the process of
colonization in the New World,

00:00:26.021 --> 00:00:28.833
and the many political, and weather,

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:32.719
and economic factors that
went into making a colony

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:34.702
successful or not successful.

00:00:34.702 --> 00:00:36.371
- [David] So set this up for me.

00:00:36.371 --> 00:00:40.656
What is going on during the
period of this early settlement

00:00:40.656 --> 00:00:42.312
of what they called Virginia,

00:00:42.312 --> 00:00:45.311
but actually turned out to be, where Kim?

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:46.228
- [Kim] North Carolina.

00:00:46.228 --> 00:00:49.418
So this on the outer
banks, and it's today,

00:00:49.418 --> 00:00:50.546
it's still Roanoke Island,

00:00:50.546 --> 00:00:54.138
but one of these sort of barrier islands

00:00:54.138 --> 00:00:56.272
off the coast of North Carolina.

00:00:56.272 --> 00:00:58.542
- [David] So, a great place to put a ship?

00:00:58.542 --> 00:01:00.952
- [Kim] Actually, what they call this area

00:01:00.952 --> 00:01:03.520
is the Graveyard of the Atlantic.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.076
- [David] So I'm hearing not so much.

00:01:05.076 --> 00:01:06.469
- [Kim] Right, so this is an area

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:08.896
where there are a lot of shoals,

00:01:08.896 --> 00:01:10.514
lots of ships run aground there.

00:01:10.514 --> 00:01:13.350
If you ever go to one of the
museums on the outer banks,

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.857
you can see this incredibly
long listing of all of the ships

00:01:17.857 --> 00:01:20.275
that sank off the coast of North Carolina.

00:01:20.275 --> 00:01:22.349
It is a very difficult place to sail.

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:24.389
- [David] What year is
it when we first see,

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:27.028
when we see the first
colonization attempt at Roanoke?

00:01:27.028 --> 00:01:28.006
The first expedition.

00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:30.971
- [Kim] Right, this all
starts in the late 1570s

00:01:30.971 --> 00:01:32.817
with a man named Humphrey Gilbert,

00:01:32.817 --> 00:01:35.071
and Gilbert is convinced--

00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:35.904
- [David] Is this him?

00:01:35.904 --> 00:01:37.824
- [Kim] This is actually
Sir Walter Raleigh.

00:01:37.824 --> 00:01:39.038
- [David] Oh, he is cute.

00:01:39.038 --> 00:01:42.386
- [Kim] Yes, Gilbert's
half-brother as it turns out.

00:01:42.386 --> 00:01:45.375
So Sir Walter Raleigh's half-brother,

00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:48.309
Humphrey Gilbert, thinks
that it might be possible

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:49.892
to make your way to

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.842
the Indies and fabulous riches.

00:01:54.842 --> 00:01:57.014
Make that line a little bit bigger.

00:01:57.014 --> 00:01:59.771
By going on top of North America.

00:01:59.771 --> 00:02:02.152
So he thinks there's a waterway here.

00:02:02.152 --> 00:02:05.014
So he convinces Queen Elizabeth,

00:02:05.014 --> 00:02:07.743
then on the throne of England,

00:02:07.743 --> 00:02:10.460
to give him a charter to

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.043
try to plant a colony somewhere

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.730
on this side of North America.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.500
- [David] So they're looking
for the Northwest Passage,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.333
is what they're looking for.

00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:21.432
- [Kim] They're looking
for the Northwest Passage.

00:02:21.432 --> 00:02:23.116
They're hoping that they can find gold,

00:02:23.116 --> 00:02:26.130
and what they want to do
more than anything else

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.871
is just mess up Spain's
chances in the New World.

00:02:28.871 --> 00:02:32.135
Because Spain, starting
with Christopher Columbus,

00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:35.327
has been the leading old
world power in the New World.

00:02:35.327 --> 00:02:37.862
They are just like, trucking
back the gold and silver,

00:02:37.862 --> 00:02:40.850
and most of what England has
done up until this point,

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.552
is find Spanish ships that are coming back

00:02:44.552 --> 00:02:47.385
from Mexico, from the West Indies,

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.751
and put what are called
privateers, which is a nice word

00:02:51.751 --> 00:02:55.226
that the English used to
mean pirate, to steal things.

00:02:55.226 --> 00:02:56.244
- [David] State-sanctioned piracy.

00:02:56.244 --> 00:02:57.817
- [Kim] State-sanctioned piracy.

00:02:57.817 --> 00:02:59.870
- [David] So like, Shakespeare is like

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.500
a young man at this time, right?

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.333
- [Kim] Yes.

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:04.698
- [David] Like that is the
period of Elizabethan England

00:03:04.698 --> 00:03:05.856
that we're looking at right now.

00:03:05.856 --> 00:03:07.393
- [Kim] Yeah, it's kind of, in some ways,

00:03:07.393 --> 00:03:09.345
a golden age, but when you think about

00:03:09.345 --> 00:03:10.906
how well the English are doing

00:03:10.906 --> 00:03:12.537
when it comes to colonization,

00:03:12.537 --> 00:03:15.481
it is not a golden age,
they are way behind.

00:03:15.481 --> 00:03:19.047
So they're hoping maybe they
can find a northwest passage

00:03:19.047 --> 00:03:23.255
to get all of the goodies
over here in India,

00:03:23.255 --> 00:03:25.492
and the spice islands.

00:03:25.492 --> 00:03:27.717
They're hoping that maybe they could

00:03:27.717 --> 00:03:29.956
find some good minerals in this area,

00:03:29.956 --> 00:03:31.537
get some gold of their own.

00:03:31.537 --> 00:03:34.079
But at the very least,
they'd like a nice port

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.929
from which their ships could go out

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:37.978
and steal more stuff from Spanish ships.

00:03:37.978 --> 00:03:39.408
- [David] (laughs) Sure.

00:03:39.408 --> 00:03:41.490
- [Kim] Yeah, this is a
good, this is their plan.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.568
- [David] So this is kind
of, if you'll permit me,

00:03:43.568 --> 00:03:46.364
this feel analogous to the
space race during the Cold War.

00:03:46.364 --> 00:03:47.894
- [Kim] Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:50.706
- [David] So Spain is
this economic superpower

00:03:50.706 --> 00:03:52.370
that seems to have a one, you know,

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.431
have a leg up on England.

00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:58.659
Just like how the Soviet
Union launched Sputnik first.

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.547
Got a satellite into orbit above Earth,

00:04:01.547 --> 00:04:03.424
and that spurred the
United States to be like,

00:04:03.424 --> 00:04:04.933
"No, we're gonna have a moon shot!"

00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:06.262
- [Kim] Yeah, and it kinda turns out

00:04:06.262 --> 00:04:08.609
the same way in some aspects,

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:13.282
because as we know, we're
sitting here in California,

00:04:13.282 --> 00:04:14.947
we're speaking English,

00:04:14.947 --> 00:04:17.587
because eventually England is going to win

00:04:17.587 --> 00:04:20.518
its way to dominance
in this entire region.

00:04:20.518 --> 00:04:23.571
But originally, Spain gets
off to the fastest start,

00:04:23.571 --> 00:04:26.320
and England is just desperate to catch up.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.445
So unfortunately, Sir
Humphrey Gilbert dies.

00:04:30.445 --> 00:04:31.278
He is lost at sea.

00:04:31.278 --> 00:04:34.112
- [David] So not this guy
here with Queen Elizabeth.

00:04:34.112 --> 00:04:38.940
- [Kim] Right, then his
half-brother, Sir Walter Raleigh,

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.329
which he spelled with
no I, so we'll do that,

00:04:43.329 --> 00:04:45.207
but today the city that's named after him,

00:04:45.207 --> 00:04:46.603
we still spell with an I.

00:04:46.603 --> 00:04:49.438
He picked up his half-brother's contract,

00:04:49.438 --> 00:04:52.082
which said he had to get
a colony in the New World

00:04:52.082 --> 00:04:54.354
within six years of 1578.

00:04:54.354 --> 00:04:58.661
So he is under the gun to try
to get something happening

00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:02.828
on the coast of North America
by 1584 at the latest.

00:05:05.775 --> 00:05:08.025
So he picks up his friends,

00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:11.943
and decides to put together,
what I kind of term

00:05:11.943 --> 00:05:14.972
as like the Ocean's Eleven
of the actual ocean.

00:05:14.972 --> 00:05:15.930
- [David] (laughs) Okay.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.097
- [Kim] He finds some ship
captains, and soldiers.

00:05:23.898 --> 00:05:25.764
- [David] A demolition's
expert, a contortionist.

00:05:25.764 --> 00:05:27.534
(Kim laughs)
A con man.

00:05:27.534 --> 00:05:29.481
- [Kim] Similar, this is like the,

00:05:29.481 --> 00:05:31.648
the 1500s version of this.

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:36.569
He gets an artist, who
we'll talk a lot more about.

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:37.610
- [David] That's John White?

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:38.443
- [Kim] That's John White.

00:05:38.443 --> 00:05:43.006
He gets cartographers, he gets
what he considers his A-team,

00:05:43.006 --> 00:05:45.232
to go out and explore this coast.

00:05:45.232 --> 00:05:47.361
Pick up where his half-brother left off.

00:05:47.361 --> 00:05:49.405
The only problem was that

00:05:49.405 --> 00:05:53.572
Sir Walter Ralegh and Queen
Elizabeth were sweethearts.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.216
And she forbid him from going
on this dangerous journey.

00:06:02.216 --> 00:06:05.078
After all, his brother had
also died on this journey.

00:06:05.078 --> 00:06:09.188
So she loved him too
much, said "You can't go."

00:06:09.188 --> 00:06:10.588
But his friends went.

00:06:10.588 --> 00:06:12.281
So this is their first journey,

00:06:12.281 --> 00:06:14.822
and they go to North Carolina.

00:06:14.822 --> 00:06:16.204
They called it Virginia,

00:06:16.204 --> 00:06:19.678
because this whole area they
named after Queen Elizabeth.

00:06:19.678 --> 00:06:20.511
- [David] The Virgin Queen.

00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:22.517
- [Kim] The Virgin Queen,
and a lot of the things

00:06:22.517 --> 00:06:24.371
in this time period are
kinda named after her,

00:06:24.371 --> 00:06:25.712
because all of these fellows

00:06:25.712 --> 00:06:27.652
were trying to capture her heart.

00:06:27.652 --> 00:06:31.122
So they go, and what's
really interesting about this

00:06:31.122 --> 00:06:33.577
is that John White, this artist,

00:06:33.577 --> 00:06:37.453
shows us so much about
what this area was like.

00:06:37.453 --> 00:06:38.760
And I want to show you

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.146
some of the paintings that
he made in this time period.

00:06:42.146 --> 00:06:43.515
- [David] So who were the native people

00:06:43.515 --> 00:06:46.226
that this expedition encountered?

00:06:46.226 --> 00:06:47.669
- [Kim] So they end up

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:50.505
on the barrier islands of North Carolina,

00:06:50.505 --> 00:06:52.578
and this is where the colonists

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:56.572
will eventually settle
here, Roanoke Island.

00:06:56.572 --> 00:06:59.157
The major Native American
groups in this area

00:06:59.157 --> 00:07:01.240
were Algonquian-speaking.

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:03.872
So they are

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.547
kinda in the middle of what
we call the east coast today.

00:07:11.567 --> 00:07:13.418
- [David] So this is a tidewater people.

00:07:13.418 --> 00:07:14.933
- [Kim] They're a tidewater people.

00:07:14.933 --> 00:07:17.071
You can see that they live in long houses,

00:07:17.071 --> 00:07:18.740
like other Algonquian peoples,

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.902
and these are primarily the Secotan people

00:07:21.902 --> 00:07:23.902
and the Croatoan people.

00:07:25.728 --> 00:07:27.243
Initially the English people

00:07:27.243 --> 00:07:28.686
get along with them pretty well.

00:07:28.686 --> 00:07:32.519
They exchange skins, and
food, lots of things.

00:07:33.462 --> 00:07:37.540
The English come back, thinking
this is a pretty good deal.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.180
- [David] So John White and company,

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.623
John White and Sir Walter Ralegh's Eleven,

00:07:41.623 --> 00:07:43.660
or however many, right, return to England.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:44.612
- [Kim] Right, and they say,

00:07:44.612 --> 00:07:46.709
"This is a great place for us to settle."

00:07:46.709 --> 00:07:49.857
So then they send a second
expedition from England.

00:07:49.857 --> 00:07:52.191
This time with just soldiers.

00:07:52.191 --> 00:07:53.820
It's very similar to how Jamestown

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.974
is going to work out a little bit later,

00:07:55.974 --> 00:08:00.141
which is to say they send
sailors, they send soldiers,

00:08:01.717 --> 00:08:04.494
and they send people
who might, for example,

00:08:04.494 --> 00:08:07.380
be good at finding gold, so artisans.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.668
And they're hoping to
kinda get rich quick.

00:08:09.668 --> 00:08:12.506
They think maybe there
are mountains nearby

00:08:12.506 --> 00:08:15.574
that might have gold or gems in them,

00:08:15.574 --> 00:08:18.106
or perhaps, they're always
asking that native people,

00:08:18.106 --> 00:08:19.384
"Do you have anything shiny?

00:08:19.384 --> 00:08:21.391
"Have you heard of anything
that's shiny nearby?"

00:08:21.391 --> 00:08:22.738
Because they want to make their investors

00:08:22.738 --> 00:08:25.688
back in England happy
by making a big profit.

00:08:25.688 --> 00:08:26.966
- [David] So this is like halfway between

00:08:26.966 --> 00:08:29.326
a forward operating
base and a trading post.

00:08:29.326 --> 00:08:30.159
- [Kim] Exactly.

00:08:30.159 --> 00:08:30.992
- [David] Okay.

00:08:30.992 --> 00:08:32.502
- [Kim] So they're not thinking
about long-term settlement,

00:08:32.502 --> 00:08:34.838
but they're left there over the winter

00:08:34.838 --> 00:08:36.559
with the Secotan people,

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:38.968
and this is just a bunch of rowdy soldiers

00:08:38.968 --> 00:08:41.945
who thought they were gonna
get rich quick, and they don't,

00:08:41.945 --> 00:08:44.203
because there is no
gold in North Carolina,

00:08:44.203 --> 00:08:45.849
not like there is in the south,

00:08:45.849 --> 00:08:47.848
that the Spanish do so well with.

00:08:47.848 --> 00:08:51.034
And they quickly come to grief
with the Native Americans.

00:08:51.034 --> 00:08:53.617
They steal a lot of their food.

00:08:54.717 --> 00:08:55.550
- [David] Who steals whose food?

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:59.663
- [Kim] The English steal
the food of the Secotans,

00:08:59.663 --> 00:09:03.372
and they end up getting into a brawl

00:09:03.372 --> 00:09:07.118
over the possible theft of a silver cup.

00:09:07.118 --> 00:09:09.611
- [David] (laughs) Really?

00:09:09.611 --> 00:09:11.479
- [Kim] Yeah, they think
the Native Americans

00:09:11.479 --> 00:09:13.219
have stolen a silver cup from them.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:16.160
They demand it back, the
Native Americans say,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.636
"We don't know what you're talking about."

00:09:17.636 --> 00:09:19.699
And then the English
kill a bunch of people.

00:09:19.699 --> 00:09:20.532
- [David] Oh my gosh.

00:09:20.532 --> 00:09:23.801
- [Kim] So relations that
were going pretty well,

00:09:23.801 --> 00:09:26.336
went pretty badly over, what I think,

00:09:26.336 --> 00:09:28.349
is kind of a minor incident.

00:09:28.349 --> 00:09:31.247
But by the time that the uh,

00:09:31.247 --> 00:09:33.398
supplies show up,

00:09:33.398 --> 00:09:35.586
because the English are
sending supply ships

00:09:35.586 --> 00:09:37.102
on a regular basis,

00:09:37.102 --> 00:09:39.634
Sir Francis Drake, of piracy fame,

00:09:39.634 --> 00:09:43.132
shows up with supplies, and
a bunch of these 100 men

00:09:43.132 --> 00:09:45.176
just get back on the
ship and sail to England.

00:09:45.176 --> 00:09:46.252
- [David] So wait, before we go back

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:47.948
to England with these men,

00:09:47.948 --> 00:09:50.463
what contributed to this
disproportionate response,

00:09:50.463 --> 00:09:53.210
of like killing a bunch of
people over a single silver cup?

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:57.334
- [Kim] I think a lot of it
was that many of these men,

00:09:57.334 --> 00:09:59.163
now and on later expeditions,

00:09:59.163 --> 00:10:02.381
are English veterans
of the war in Ireland.

00:10:02.381 --> 00:10:05.931
So there is an Irish rebellion
against English rule there,

00:10:05.931 --> 00:10:09.540
and the English take a very
brutal stance toward the Irish.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.070
They just burned their villages,

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.224
they decapitate Irish people

00:10:14.224 --> 00:10:16.659
and line their heads along sidewalks,

00:10:16.659 --> 00:10:17.997
I'm not making this up.

00:10:17.997 --> 00:10:18.830
- [David] Good lord.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.813
- [Kim] So, they're veterans

00:10:20.813 --> 00:10:24.063
of this really brutal Irish repression.

00:10:25.065 --> 00:10:28.636
And this is something
that I think you see a lot

00:10:28.636 --> 00:10:31.196
with English people when they first

00:10:31.196 --> 00:10:33.154
are meeting Native Americans,

00:10:33.154 --> 00:10:35.298
they treat them like
they treated the Irish,

00:10:35.298 --> 00:10:36.693
which is to say, very badly.

00:10:36.693 --> 00:10:39.462
They treat them as savages
who are different religion,

00:10:39.462 --> 00:10:41.410
who need to be subject to the English,

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.405
and need to be taught early on

00:10:43.405 --> 00:10:45.712
that they need to obey the English.

00:10:45.712 --> 00:10:47.578
- [David] So what
happened after that, Kim?

00:10:47.578 --> 00:10:49.203
- [Kim] We'll get to
that in the next video.
