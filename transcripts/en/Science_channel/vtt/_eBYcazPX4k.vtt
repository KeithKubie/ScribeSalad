00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:04.000
♪♪

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.067
YOU'VE HEARD OF A DRONE.

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:06.934
THAT'S ACTUALLY
THE COLLOQUIAL NAME

00:00:06.934 --> 00:00:09.167
FOR AN UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE.

00:00:09.167 --> 00:00:12.000
THE LATEST IN DRONE TECHNOLOGY
IS AN OCTOCOPTER.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.634
IT IS THIS HUGE BADASS
FLYING SPIDER THING

00:00:15.634 --> 00:00:18.167
WITH EIGHT PROPELLERS
AND IT IS QUICK

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:19.901
AND IT HAS THESE STATE-
OF-THE-ART FLIGHT CONTROLS

00:00:19.901 --> 00:00:21.501
AND IT IS SO FUN TO FLY.

00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:23.334
Narrator: THE PRECISE
ENGINEERING OF THE ARMS

00:00:23.334 --> 00:00:25.133
CAN BE SEEN IN OUR TEST LAB.

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:28.033
EACH ARM IS DESIGNED
WITH AN EIGHT-DEGREE INVERSION,

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:30.501
MEANING, INSTEAD
OF BEING HORIZONTALLY LEVEL,

00:00:30.501 --> 00:00:32.767
IT'S SET AT A SLIGHT
VERTICAL ANGLE,

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:34.400
AND THERE'S A GOOD REASON
FOR THIS.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.834
IF THE ARMS WERE
COMPLETELY HORIZONTAL

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:37.634
AND PROPELLERS
POINTED STRAIGHT DOWN,

00:00:37.634 --> 00:00:40.234
YOU'D GET UNSTABLE
FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS.

00:00:40.234 --> 00:00:42.367
BUT BECAUSE THE AIR
IS PUSHED SLIGHTLY OUT,

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:45.968
THE PRESSURE PUSHES THE DRONE
IN ON ITSELF, KEEPING IT STABLE.

00:00:45.968 --> 00:00:47.267
AT THE END OF EACH ARM,

00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:49.267
THERE IS A FIVE-INCH,
HIGH-STRENGTH,

00:00:49.267 --> 00:00:51.467
HIGH-PERFORMANCE
PLASTIC PROPELLER,

00:00:51.467 --> 00:00:54.501
AND THESE ARE WHAT
GIVES THE DRONE ITS LIFT.

00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:56.834
THESE DRONES DEFINITELY
HAVE PERSONALITIES.

00:00:56.834 --> 00:00:58.868
YOU SEE THE DRONE,
YOU'RE LIKE,

00:00:58.868 --> 00:01:00.100
"WHAT IS IT THINKING?"

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.534
IF YOU WANT THE DRONE
TO ROTATE,

00:01:01.534 --> 00:01:03.400
YOU INCREASE THE POWER
TO THE PROPELLERS

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.868
ROTATING IN ONE DIRECTION

00:01:04.868 --> 00:01:07.534
AND DECREASE THE POWER
TO THE OTHERS.

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:09.167
WHAT'S REALLY COOL
IS THAT EACH ARM

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:11.434
HAS ITS OWN MOTOR BUILT
INTO THE PROPELLER,

00:01:11.434 --> 00:01:14.067
SO IF ONE OF THEM FAILS,
IT CAN STILL CONTINUE TO FLY.

00:01:14.067 --> 00:01:17.300
THOSE MOTORS EACH HAVE
A LIFT POWER OF 10 POUNDS,

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.834
MEANING THAT THE ENTIRE
DRONE CAN LIFT

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:22.934
25 ADDITIONAL POUNDS,
IN ADDITION TO ITS OWN WEIGHT.

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:24.767
THE LANDING GEAR
ON YOUR OCTOCOPTER

00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:27.734
IS 18 INCHES LONG
AND IT'S ALSO RETRACTABLE,

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:30.300
JUST LIKE THE LANDING GEAR
ON A COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.567
AND WHEN IT LANDS,
IT'S SO FUNNY.

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:32.968
IT PUTS OUT THESE LITTLE LEGS

00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:38.234
AND THEN IT, LIKE, POLITELY
JUST, LIKE, PLIéS ON THE GROUND.

00:01:38.234 --> 00:01:40.801
THE CORE OF A DRONE
IS THE FLIGHT CONTROLLER.

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:42.634
THIS IS THE BRAINS
OF THE OPERATION.

00:01:42.634 --> 00:01:44.634
Narrator: THE FLIGHT CONTROLLER
IS A CIRCUIT BOARD

00:01:44.634 --> 00:01:46.534
THAT MEASURES GPS POSITION,

00:01:46.534 --> 00:01:49.400
ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS,
AND WIND SPEED.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.734
THESE DRONES HAVE INCREDIBLY
SENSITIVE FLIGHT CONTROLLERS

00:01:52.734 --> 00:01:54.767
THAT CAN HELP COMPENSATE
FOR THINGS THEY MIGHT ENCOUNTER.

00:01:54.767 --> 00:01:57.701
SAY A GUST OF WIND BLOWS
TOO HARD ON THE RIGHT SIDE,

00:01:57.701 --> 00:01:59.367
IT'LL COMPENSATE
AND KEEP IT STEADY.

00:01:59.367 --> 00:02:01.601
SAY ONE OF THE PROPELLERS
GOES OUT,

00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:03.601
IT CAN COMPENSATE
AND STILL KEEP IT IN THE AIR.

00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:06.167
YOU CAN ALSO PLAN A FLIGHT PATH
SO THAT IT'S LITERALLY GONNA

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:08.667
FOLLOW YOUR INSTRUCTIONS
AND USE THAT GPS,

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:10.767
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE
OUT WHERE TO GO. YOU KNOW,

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:12.968
YOU CAN HAVE, LITERALLY,
A DRONE FOLLOW YOU LIKE A PET.

00:02:12.968 --> 00:02:15.801
SO YOU CAN ESSENTIALLY BE
ON YOUR MOUNTAIN BIKE,

00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:17.100
FLYING AROUND THE MOUNTAINS,

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.968
DOING COOL STUFF,
LOOKING LIKE A BADASS.

00:02:18.968 --> 00:02:20.434
AND THEN THE DRONE'S
JUST FOLLOWING YOU,

00:02:20.434 --> 00:02:22.100
TAKING VIDEO THE WHOLE TIME.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.300
IT'S RAD.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.400
THE FLIGHT CONTROLLER
ALSO INCLUDES AN IMU,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.434
OR INERTIA MANAGEMENT UNIT,

00:02:27.434 --> 00:02:31.167
AND THAT INCLUDES A GYROSCOPE
AND 12 OTHER SENSORS

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:34.968
THAT HELP KEEP
THAT DRONE STABLE AND LEVEL.
