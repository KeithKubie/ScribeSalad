00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.340
Some of you guys know I grew up in Canada and while I lived there, I had a scout leader who taught me how to karate chop rocks in half with your bare hands.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.160
And today that's exactly what I'm going to show you how to do.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.620
Now to get started, you're going to have to find a rock, something like this, you know, anywhere between a quarter of an inch to a half an inch in diameter

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.500
and somewhere around 8 inches long.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.340
That's going to be most useful and if you're in a mountainous area that has granite, don't use granite.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.040
You'll probably break your hand.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.700
So, just walk down to a local river or a dried up river bed and scour around until you find something that you think might work.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.040
If you're just getting started, a rock of that thickness might be good.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.660
You can see, it's really strong, it's not super thick.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.220
That's going to be perfect for beginners.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.760
Maybe a little bit longer though.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.420
Now, when you're ready to get chopping, you want to find a very stable platform to hold it for you like this

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.440
and just wind up, and power straight thr-

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.260
No! I'm just joking.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.840
We're not going to do that.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.200
That's going to bust your bones up.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.160
There's a much better way to do that and that's by using a big rock surface like this one over here.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.960
Now, the secret to chopping your rock.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.980
You want to grab it with your pinky finger

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.340
and hold this end about half an inch above another hard surface like another rock.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.160
And when you hit it, don't just hit it and let it smack like that.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.820
You want to power all the way through it.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.880
You want to think through the rock and pretend you're going to smash right through.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.140
See? No broken bones.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.460
So check it out.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.880
Just with one clean slice, I broke this rock in half.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.740
It actually shattered into 2 pieces on the end.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.880
My hand actually doesn't feel too bad.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.760
It's a little bit numb and tingly but, considering we just broke a half inch rock in half, it doesn't feel bad at all.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.760
Okay, so that one worked pretty well we're going to take it up to maybe 3/4 of an inch.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.380
And the trick is, you want to hit it with this meaty part of your hand.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.060
Another little I was taught to do was to was to tuck my pinky finger up, just like that.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.940
It kind of flexes that and give you a little bit of oomph.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.940
And you want to stay away from hitting the bones at all. That's going to kill. So we're going right for this meaty part here.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.240
And the trick is in your mind.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.320
You want to power right through it when you hit that rock.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.700
You want to go all the way through.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.540
You can't stop. There can't be any hesitation.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.780
You have to be fully committed.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.800
Now, if I hit this like this right now, it's not going to work because that's flat on the rock.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.060
What you need to do is tilt your hand so it lift's it up about half an inch and then it's good to smash.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.140
Judo chop!

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.080
Ow! I flinched.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.340
I flinched.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.420
That one I hit right on the bone.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.120
I was concentrating to much on my awesome powers judo chop and I totally missed it.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.380
So, that is killing me.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.920
That is not what you want to do, folks.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.220
Okay. I'm trying that again but, this time I'm actually going to concentrate on what I'm doing.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.800
Let's see if we can get any better results.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.980
Yeah!

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.020
Man! That was a clean cut.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.020
Grant's brother: That was a nice cut.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.260
Yeah. I was a little bit worried about that second because it was quite a bit shorter.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.920
I wasn't sure if it was just going to go but, man. That just worked perfectly.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.740
Grant's brother: I'm surprised it broke.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.380
And you know what? My hand isn't much worse for wear.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.400
So, that time, I hit it with the meaty part of my hand.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.800
I did tuck my pinky finger up like that just to flex the meat a little bit.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.260
Stay away form this bone. That's what's going to hurt a lot.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.620
So, there you go guys. Now you know how to break rocks in half with your freaking hands!

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.520
Now, a couple of years ago, I had a friend named Darren Dike for a channel called, "Beyond Slow Motion" filming me doing this experiment in my house.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.320
If you watch my fingers the moment my palm touches the rock, look at the way flop all over the place

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.580
and I promise, this isn't nearly as painful as it looks.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.180
But, you can also see how the rock sheers right down the middle and divides in half.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.800
How incredible is that?

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.540
Now, I do have to suggest that if you're going to try this if have to be mentally committed.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.960
If you're only going to go half way, your hand is going to be extremely sore.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.600
Now, this is a cool trick.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.540
Take your girlfriend down to the lake, grab a rock, and karate chop it in half with your hand.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.220
How much more manly can you get than that?

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.300
Well thank you for joining me for this experiment.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.060
You guys, go have a lot of fun and I'll see you in the next video. Talk to you then.
