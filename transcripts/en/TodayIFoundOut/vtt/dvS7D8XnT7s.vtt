00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:16.090
Originally, of course, nobody knew what caused
the various forms of tuberculosis, and they

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.789
certainly didn’t understand it was caused
by what would eventually be called tubercle

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.310
bacillus (usually the offending microbes are
specifically Mycobacterium tuberculosis).

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.320
The word “tuberculosis” was coined by
Johann Lukas Schönle in 1839, from the Latin

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.840
“tuberculum,” meaning “small, swelling
bump or pimple.”

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.690
However, it wouldn’t be until 1882 when
Dr. Robert Koch discovered the tubercle bacillus,

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.010
for which he won a Nobel Prize in 1905, that
the name “tuberculosis” began being exclusively

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.120
used to refer to the disease formerly popularly
known as consumption.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.580
The microbes that cause the disease have been
around for at least 15,000-20,000 years with

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.670
known human deaths being caused by the bacteria
dating back at least as far as 5,000 years

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.000
ago, so the current name is an extremely recent
moniker relative to how long the disease has

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
been around.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.300
The much older name originally came from the
ancient Greeks who called the disease something

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.740
meaning “consumption,” “phthisis,”
specifically referring to pulmonary tuberculosis,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.290
with the earliest references to this being
in 460 BC.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.840
The “father of Western medicine,” Hippocrates,
estimated that phthisis was the most widespread

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.490
disease of his age.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.780
He further told his students that they shouldn’t
attempt to treat patients in the last stages

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.020
of phthisis, as they were sure to die and
it would ruin his protégés’ reputation

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.530
as healers if they made a practice of attempting
to heal such individuals.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.980
Tuberculosis wasn’t just found across the
pond either, but it is known to have been

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.200
present in the Americas as early as 100 AD.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.470
So why was “phthisis” aka “consumption”
chosen for the name?

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.850
It was because the disease seemed to consume
the individual, with their weight drastically

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.690
dropping as the disease progressed.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.159
Heroin was originally marketed by the drug
company Bayer as a safe, non-addicting treatment

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:23.810
for tuberculosis, among other things.
