00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.390
FIRST MALE VOICE &gt;&gt; Okay. We are here with
our YouTube Europe team--

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.390
SECOND MALE VOICE &gt;&gt; Hey!

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.620
FIRST MALE VOICE &gt;&gt; That's Ed, Neuer, Jeff
and Arvin. Ed, tell us a bit about-ah-about

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.620
what's goin' on here.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.360
ED &gt;&gt; This is, as described by one proponent
of YouTube, it's been a slaber-hit of Davos.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.570
This is-ah-the Davos question, which-ah-has
been a fantastic innovation between the world

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.480
economic forum and YouTube. Um-we have put
the Davos question-what is one thing that

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.680
countries, companies or individuals can do
to change the world in 2009-out to the general

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.380
public, out to the YouTube community. We've
got some great responses and we've played

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:43.300
these to-ah-to world leaders here. And not
only that [PANNING AROUND THE ROOM], got them

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.989
all to respond to-ah-or as many as we can-to
make them post their own responses to the

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:48.989
Davos question.
So the guys here have worked-worked incredibly

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.290
hard-ah-pulling people in, pulling leaders
in and it really has been just great--

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.560
JEFF &gt;&gt; We wrestled them to the ground, tied
them up--

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.380
FIRST MALE VOICE &gt;&gt; Jeff, how does it work?
Okay, tell me how this whole thing works.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.960
JEFF &gt;&gt; How this all works is we sit there
and stare at people's chest to see their tag

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.560
because we don't necessarily recognize their
face. [CLOSEUP OF JEFF'S NAMETAG]

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.019
ED [HOLDING JEFF'S NAMETAG] &gt;&gt; That's Jeff-that's
Jeff ten years ago. Look, he had hair. [LAUGHTER]

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.019
FIRST MALE VOICE &gt;&gt; Oh. Wow, kinda--

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:07.250
NEUER &gt;&gt; Jeff's extreme charm and wit attracts
a lot of people. [BACKGROUND VOICES, JEFF

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.340
HOLDS UP HIS NAMETAG.]

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.750
FIRST MALE VOICE &gt;&gt; So you were essentially
saying you approach people. Is that what you

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.750
were saying?

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.000
JEFF &gt;&gt; It's a nice way of putting it. And
when you go out there and you look there and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.740
you sit there and say, "Oh, my goodness, who
could that be? That is Bono." And then you

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.751
wrestle him to the ground--

00:01:19.751 --> 00:01:21.270
ARVIN &gt;&gt; ...which isn't very far away.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.320
JEFF &gt;&gt; --and then you bring him a part and
then you hit play on the recorder and say-you

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.770
say, "Answer the g------ question." And then
he does.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.030
FIRST MALE VOICE &gt;&gt; Arvin, what's the-ah-hit
so far? Who's your-who's your favorite person

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.030
who's answered the Davos question?

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.470
ARVIN &gt;&gt; My favorite person, personal favorite
was Shimon Peres for one reason. Because he

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.920
sat in front of the computer-ah-he said, "Hello,
YouTube," and then he expected the computer

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.360
to ask him a question. So he did that, and
then Ed had to ask him the question. That's

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.360
my personal favorite.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.119
JEFF &gt;&gt; He had to disguise his voice to make
it sound like the computer. [BACKGROUND LAUGHTER]

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.720
He pulled that whole, like-ah-2001 Space Odyssey
voice on there.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.770
ED &gt;&gt; But, okay. In all seriousness though,
and we have Peres' posting. And then-ah-Ahmed

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.491
Mussa has responded directly to Shimon Peres
on YouTube. This is--

00:02:06.491 --> 00:02:07.920
FIRST MALE VOICE &gt;&gt; Can you tell me first
who Ahmed Mussa is

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.920
?

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.910
ED &gt;&gt; He's the head of the-ah-
Arab League of Nations, is that right?

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:11.910
JEFF &gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.170
ED &gt;&gt; And-ah-he-ah-I mean to get that sort
of interaction between world leaders and in

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.670
a bit of a window into the YouTube community
has just been amazing. So there've been some

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.720
truly prominent people here who have been
exposed to YouTube for the first time and-ah-they'll

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.510
be using it again. So it's been a huge hit
and we hope that the YouTube community out

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.390
there has-has appreciated the response of
the world leaders, the most influential people

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.450
in the world, who are listening to you guys.
So it's amazing.
