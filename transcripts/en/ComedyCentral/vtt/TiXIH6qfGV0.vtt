00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:06.573
- [Dave] Is this the place?

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:07.774
- Yeah.

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:10.143 align:start size:84% position:16%
- What's it say on
your map, dirty alley?

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:11.444
- Yeah.

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.113
- Where is this guy?

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.489
- You have the goods?

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.024
- Oh, yeah.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.525
You got the money?

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:26.926
- Is a check okay?

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:30.130 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Oh, definitely.
- Certainly.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.964
- Give.

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:34.868
Mm, my little kinder.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:38.038
You are Heino's future.

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:40.774
- [Dave] Oh, is it all there?

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:42.308
- Yeah, $57.

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:44.711
- Let's go, let's go cash it.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:45.712
- Not tonight.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:46.713
It's not open tonight.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:47.647
- Tomorrow?

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:48.848
- Bright and early.

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:49.682 align:start size:84% position:16%
- (Singing) Chicky,
chicky, chicky

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:51.117
bump, bump, bump, bump.

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:53.853
- (upbeat music)

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.501
- They don't cash German checks,

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:10.570
they don't fit into the slot.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.404
- Heino!

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.607
- [Chris] This check
is worthless, now.

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:15.875
- We've gotta find
that crazy German

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:16.910
and get our baby back.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.211
- I know where his mother lives.

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:19.846
- Old lady Heino?

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:20.680
Where?

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.416
- (Upbeat music)

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.502
- What are you doing?

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:44.337
- There's no one here.

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:47.474
- (Laughter)

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:48.341
- Did she see me?

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:49.742
Did she see me?

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:52.479 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I don't even
know who that was.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.647
That was someone else's mother.

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:55.582
Where's Heino?

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:57.083
- (German music)

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:59.352 align:start size:84% position:16%
- C'mon, c'mon
Kinder. All aboard.

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:00.653
Das train.

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:02.489
Hoo, hoo.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:03.890
Choo, choo!

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.028 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You know, he's probably
grinding that baby

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:10.563
up into schnitzel, right now,

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:13.133 align:start size:94% position:6%
and feeding it to Dirk
Nowitzki, for all we know.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.100
- Dave.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.934
- What?

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:16.769
- It's the semifinals.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.705
- Oh no, we gotta
go get this guy.

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:21.040
- This is a nine star show!

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.443
- What are we doing out here?

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:24.844
Let's go!

00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:28.081 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Host] Okay, let's introduce
our first contestant.

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:29.516
- It's a pleasure to be here.

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:32.719
- I feel like a lion.
A lion in the jungle.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:33.887
About to pounce!

00:02:33.887 --> 00:02:35.388
- These guys are great.

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:37.123
- You're looking
at me all wrong.

00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:38.925
Do it again and I'll
stab you in the face

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:40.460
with a soldering iron.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.763
- Whoever wins is gonna go
on to the finals. (laughs)

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:47.133
Wait til I introduce you,
wait til I introduce you.

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:48.668
Ladies and gentlemen, Roy!

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:51.237
Hi, I'm not gay.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:52.605
I'm an alligator.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.140
- You sure this
isn't the finals?

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.309
- I've been looking for...

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:59.112 align:start size:88% position:13%
The bastards who brought
me to this party.

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:01.714
- Earlier this morning,
I was just taking a leak,

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:02.949
holding my winky.

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:03.783
Thank you.

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:07.420
- Hang Gangbang Wang, everybody.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.322
Boy, he gave us something
to think about, right?

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:12.192 align:start position:0%
I don't know how, how we're
gonna make any kind of decision.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:15.662
Luckily, I don't have
to do that. (laughs)

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:19.732
I can't believe this is
the semifinals. I mean...

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:21.734
- Heino!
- Heino!

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:23.670
- [Heino] Pour the beer.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.605
We are all good kinder.

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:28.942
Drink your beer.

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:29.776
Prost.

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:37.417
(burps)

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:39.819
Sausage?

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.455 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Are you sure this
is the way to Germany?

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:44.290 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, we gotta go
through Poland, first;

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.558
but this is the way.

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:47.160
- I've never thought
it'd look like this.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.629
- It looks a lot like
the American west.

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:50.630
- Oh, right.

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:58.438
- Heino!
- Heino!

00:03:58.438 --> 00:03:59.272
- Get in.

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:03.476
- Baby!
- Baby!

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:06.713 align:start size:81% position:19%
- [Dave] I thought
you'd be dead.

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:08.615
- [Chris] Yeah, me too.

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:17.557
Thanks for watching the episode.

00:04:17.557 --> 00:04:19.025
We've hidden a secret button,

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:22.061
it's on our favorite
weirdo walking moment.

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:23.463
- Hi

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:25.732
- That's the moment. Bye
