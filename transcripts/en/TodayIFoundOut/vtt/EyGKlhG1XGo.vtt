00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.240
Growing on tall shrubs with dense foliage,
the small, red, mildly sweet berries known

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.110
as miracle fruit seemingly magically can turn
sour flavors sweet.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.720
The plant that produces the berries, Synsepalum
Dulcificum, is native to West Africa, where

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.360
the fruit was traditionally used to sweeten
palm wine and make soured cornbread more palatable.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.080
Growing best in acidic soil in tropical zones,
the coffee-sized berries were introduced to

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.489
Europeans by the explorer Chevalier des Marchais.

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.190
So how does it work?

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.620
The exact mechanisms here aren’t fully understood,
but, in a nutshell, the fruit gets its sweetening

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.109
properties from miraculin, a glycoprotein
in the berry that binds to sweet receptors

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:51.149
on the tongue.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.040
As to how the miraculin then makes sour things
taste sweet, it appears to relate to the pH

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.980
of the miraculin (which is neutral) and sour
foods (which are acidic).

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.570
More specifically, when the miraculin binds
to the sweet receptors in the tongue, it is

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.640
mostly inert until it comes in contact with
acidic substances.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.131
When that happens, the miraculin changes structure
slightly, with the result being the sweet

00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:16.430
receptors it is bound to become activated.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.410
Because miraculin binds so strongly to the
sweet receptors on the tongue, the berry does

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.940
not have to be eaten with the sour food, and
the sweetening effect may last as much as

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.680
30-60 minutes after chewing the berries.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.390
The duration of the effect depends on factors
including the concentration of the miraculin,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.120
how long it was in contact with the tongue
and the concentration of the acid in the otherwise

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.460
sour food.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.770
Not a subtle effect, the perceived sweetness
produced by the miracle fruit can be remarkable

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.800
– equivalent to up to a 17% sucrose solution.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.820
For reference here, the equivalent sucrose
solution for typical soft drinks is only about

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.820
10%.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.530
The effect is things like Tabasco sauce reportedly
changing flavor to that of doughnut glaze,

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.470
among a myriad of other weird taste alterations.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.470
To date, the miracle fruit has yet to be developed
into a commercially-viable non-caloric sugar

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.539
substitute in the United States, although
an attempt was made in the 1970s.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.020
However, the day before the product was to
launch under the brand name Miralin, the FDA

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.440
suddenly switched from original plans to classify
it as generally recognized as safe (GRAS)

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.010
to classifying it as a food additive (which
meant years of further testing to be deemed

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.010
safe).

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.640
This was a highly controversial move given
that the berries had been regularly eaten

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.300
for centuries in Africa without apparent ill
effect.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.989
The project backers lacked the funding to
conduct the years of testing needed and Miralin

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.329
ultimately folded.

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:43.959
However, because of the circumstances of the
FDA’s decision-making process, it was suggested

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.719
that the sugar industry flexed its political
muscles to sabotage the project.

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.730
As such, using the Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA), Miralin ultimately requested documents

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.879
related to the FDA’s processing of their
product.

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.310
Fanning the conspiracy theory flames, when
the files were produced, most of the documents

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.099
were inexplicably completely blacked out,
and there was no mention anywhere of why the

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:11.480
FDA suddenly chose to switch from a GRAS classification
to classifying the substance as a food additive.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.220
Whatever the case, the berry has been classified
as a harmless additive in Japan, where researches

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.790
are fiddling with it using recombinant technology.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.879
For instance, using genetic modification,
they have managed to produce lettuce that

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:29.450
expresses miraculin equivalent to one miracle
berry with just two grams of lettuce leaves.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.170
In 2009, an oncologist at Miami’s Mount
Sinai Medical Center also filed an investigational

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.680
new drug application with the United States
Food and Drug Administration (USDA) for the

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.709
use of the miracle fruit with chemotherapy
patients.

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.040
From anecdotal evidence, the oncologist had
discovered that some patients found it helped

00:03:46.040 --> 00:04:00.719
counteract the metallic taste byproduct 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.699
of chemotherapy.
