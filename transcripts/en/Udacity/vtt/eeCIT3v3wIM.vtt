00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.910
My name is Bill Durham. I'm Bing Professor in

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.080
Human Biology, in human biology and anthropology at Stanford University.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.710
&gt;&gt; Well, we're really happy you're joining us, especially to talk about a

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.770
very important concept. Now, we've just

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.680
been learning about lactose intolerance, and about

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.580
the idea that as all infants, we had the ability as mammals to

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.420
digest these lactose containing products. And as

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.280
we get older, our lactase expression diminishes.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.350
But in some people, the lactase gene sort of stays

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.780
on, and we continue to make lactase. And so I guess

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.060
we'll start out by asking, why, in human evolution, would

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.270
something like this happen? How could something like this even happen?

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.350
&gt;&gt; Well from a pan-mammalian background, where the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.790
lactase activity peaks around birth and then tails

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.360
off quickly into the weaning period and into

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.630
adulthood, we assume, we know that that's pan-mammalian.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.840
Even your house cat is lactose malabsorbed, a malabsorber

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.880
or lactose intolerant. At least every house cat that's

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.920
been tested is, even though people will give milk

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.200
to their house cats. And we don't know is

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.080
whether the people have found the threshold, or the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.390
cat's found the threshold, to avoid diearaha and other

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.950
consequences. What's interesting, then, is from that background of

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.960
a peak, some human populations show persistant lactase activity into

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.310
adulthood, while the majority continue to decline.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.230
So it's that, minority of lactose-tolerant adults

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.030
that are really fascinating. it's a wonderful

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.770
question. Because here's a case where you have

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.050
an intraspecific polymorphism. You have the existence

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.570
in, if the ongoing persistence of a genetic

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.470
difference between human populations, with regard to

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.070
some relatively simple trait. And a trait that

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.000
has to be relatively recent in human history.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.540
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.390
&gt;&gt; There were no sources of milk prior to dairy animals.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.390
&gt;&gt;

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.520
[LAUGH].

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.600
&gt;&gt; So, what we have here is, I mean,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.870
of the mother's milk, there were no mammalian sources of

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.500
milk for human populations before agriculture. So, we assume

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.510
that the panamalian background, means that at the dawn of

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.840
history, human populations were all lactose intolerant. And that

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.850
there would be at best, a mutationly low frequency of

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.330
individuals that varied on that characteristic. And because it was

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.000
a very low variation and there was no milk available,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.340
we would have no way of knowing how much

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.990
there was or how often it recurred and so on.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.680
But what we have then, in the meantime, is

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.280
this great invention called agriculture. The domestication of plants and

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.810
animals at the service of the human food supply.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.480
We have every reason to believe that, the main animals

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.260
that are used for milk today were originally domesticated for

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.210
meat. They were valued first for meat, and that milk

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.780
was, as the expression goes, was part of

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.580
a secondary products revolution where they realize you

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.532
could use more then the meat from these

00:02:47.532 --> 00:02:51.640
animals. Goat, sheep, you know, cattle and so on.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.960
And so they already probably had them in

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.380
close association with human communities. They were probably already

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.790
harvesting the meat regularly. They probably had mastered,

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.374
over winter, water supply, hearding activities, and that sort

00:03:04.374 --> 00:03:09.580
of thing. And then suddenly there's evidence for using the,

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.420
the milk product of these animals. some of the earliest evidence comes from

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.530
Sahara rock paintings that are dated to 4,500 B.P., that show,

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.640
in fact, bringing the calf up near the

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.860
female, the adult female, and a human being underneath.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.830
Now we infer that the human being underneath

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.460
is doing this. What else is a human being

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.445
doing under a cow?

00:03:30.445 --> 00:03:32.040
[LAUGH]

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.480
and the question really is what was the added value of drinking fresh milk?

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.520
It's complicated on the one hand, because

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.590
you had the meat value of these animals

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.960
you domesticated. So, it seems unlikely that

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.650
it would be just the protein or food

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.300
supply. Yet, that was important to our

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.260
argument. The question, and it's also complicated because,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.840
there are ways to get some food value from milk without drinking it fresh. You

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:09.430
can all societies that I know of, have ways of processing fresh milk into low

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.760
lactose forms. Sour milk is a low lactose form. All the things like yogurt and

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.740
kefir, drinks that are widely known in some

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.800
places, and most cheeses, break down the lactose

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:27.350
externally using lactobacillus bacteria, using a separation of curds and whey.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.240
Lactose is water soluble, it drains off with the whey, and the

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.890
curds are free of lactose. So most cheeses have very little

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.420
lactose concentration, something like yogurt is

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.050
full of lactobacillus, that's already digesting.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.460
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.930
&gt;&gt; The lactose for human consumption. So here's the real challenge. In a world

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.980
where most populations have ways to process milk

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.200
and to get everything that's in the milk.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.040
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:01.860
&gt;&gt; Why would some populations still evolve this persistent lactase activity?

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.610
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.430
&gt;&gt; Because there are external sources of

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.490
lactase, why does it have, what, what was

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.540
the advantage of producing it internally to the

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.940
human organism? The leading argument of the day

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.900
is that calcium, that the advantage of drinking fresh milk, is the

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.410
advantage of an additional calcium supply especially in areas where there is,

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.960
a calcium deficiency caused either by inadequate calcium in the

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.740
diet. Well, that's not too likely if you're drinking milk.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.970
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.050
&gt;&gt; but a vitamin D scarcity. And then

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.500
people say, well, what's the advantage? Milk is obviously

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.560
rich in calcium but what's the advantage of having

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.770
why, why can't you again just eat the yogurt?

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:43.290
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.120
&gt;&gt; And why can't you again just eat the milk product, the cheese,

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.280
which is going to have the calcium in it? Except for the water soluble calcium

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.200
which you might lose some of. What's

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.320
interesting with some research what's called the lactose

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.560
effect. If you feed human infants from birth,

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.710
in a compare, a controlled comparison, cow's milk

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:05.220
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.210
&gt;&gt; from birth, or mother's milk, versus soy milk, you see, beginning in a

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.990
matter of, of a few days, you see a big differential in the amount of

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.230
bone absorbed calcium, in other words, the calcification of bone

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.890
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.280
&gt;&gt; Is enhanced, you can, this is

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.210
controlling for the amount of calcium, you take

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.950
soymilk, and you supplement the calcium in it, so that it matches the cows milk.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.290
They have the same calcium, and the

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.730
presence of the lactose enhances the absorption of

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.880
the calcium according to this, these data. it's

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.070
a magnificent curve and it, what it shows

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.210
is that the ability to drink fresh milk

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.920
has the advantage of making the calcium that's

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.790
there in equal proportion in the two milks.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.310
It makes it more available to the infants

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.500
who can absorb, who can digest the lactose.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.406
So what's particularly interesting about that is it's

00:06:58.406 --> 00:07:02.680
saying that a lactase persistence compensates for the

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.250
vitamin D deficiency that's built into the solar

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.530
radiation pattern on the surface of our Earth. So

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.800
that milk, like epidermal demelanization, they follow similar curves.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.701
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:07:14.701 --> 00:07:18.130
&gt;&gt; And that you get the persistent lactase

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:23.700
activity. And the lactose tolerance at high latitudes.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.690
&gt;&gt; Right. And just to sort of reword what you say here to make

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:31.216
sure you know we're clear on this, in the case for skin pigmentation,

00:07:31.216 --> 00:07:34.470
as you've sort of alluded to, the idea

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.030
is as human migration moved away from the equator

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:38.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.560
&gt;&gt; to higher and I guess we should also say lower latitudes

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:41.980
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.530
&gt;&gt; They had less sunlight and so they

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.380
&gt;&gt; Well, you can say higher latitudes north and south.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.320
&gt;&gt; Sure higher latitudes north and south. They lost pigmentation in the

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.850
skin, because they needed to let more sunlight in for vitamin D.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.010
&gt;&gt; There was selection for the entrance of more sunlight.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.080
It wasn't that they recognized the need.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.360
&gt;&gt; Sure. Good, yes. Exactly

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.140
&gt;&gt; The same with milk, it wasn't that

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.340
we were sitting around here, wow, hoping and wishing

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.060
we could have another source of calcium. What's

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.000
happening is that those that happened to have this

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.722
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:08:10.722 --> 00:08:16.750
&gt;&gt; Out-reproduced by, you can even test whether it's a 3%, a 2%, a 5%. How

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.520
much does the difference have to be in

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.270
the long run, in terms of differential survival and

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.300
reproduction, in order for this to work out in

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.047
the time frame that we have from 4,500 years B.P.,

00:08:28.047 --> 00:08:30.560
or whatever. And I'm one of those who thinks

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.296
that it's actually a pretty small advantage. A pretty small

00:08:33.296 --> 00:08:36.582
advantage, but persistent generation after generation, and no fail,

00:08:36.582 --> 00:08:40.201
it's there. If you have the lactose mechanism for absorbing

00:08:40.201 --> 00:08:43.486
calcium and making strong bones, less likely to have

00:08:43.486 --> 00:08:47.355
rickets, less likely to have Harrison Sulcus, less likely to

00:08:47.355 --> 00:08:50.421
have broken bones in young adulthood and

00:08:50.421 --> 00:08:53.640
all those things. You'll have that rigid calcification

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.900
of bone, which you can see starting

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.000
right out in infancy with the lactose affect.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.030
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:05.032
&gt;&gt; Of course,

00:09:05.032 --> 00:09:12.848
thank you.
