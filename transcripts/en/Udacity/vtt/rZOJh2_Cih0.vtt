00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.530
We followed Anthony as he developed
skills from front end to back

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.670
end programming.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.480
He's also explored
mobile programming and

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.260
data analysis through
building Project Compass.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.510
Your next step is to analyze Project
Compass web app that Anthony's created

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.990
and identify which type of
programmer would build each feature.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.054
This activity is meant to help you
evaluate your next step as a programmer.

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:23.126
Do you want to build out
front end features or

00:00:23.126 --> 00:00:25.340
dive into back end architecture?

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.760
Would you want to create mobile
applications or analyze data?

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.610
After completing this activity
you'll be choosing the path that

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.900
most interests you.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.960
Remember, you can always dive into
different areas of programming, but for

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.480
now let's figure out your next step.
