Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.500
And since it's very creation, the internet has opened the doors for so many possibilities.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.720
Jobs, entertainment, forums, the social media, the internet has no doubt changed the world.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.640
Yet, out of all these possibilities, there is one undeniable fact that will always remain the same.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.180
The internet is full of pricks.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.480
Complainers, trolls, people who live to force their opinion onto your opinion

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.740
whether they have any idea what they're talking about or not,

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.020
they're pretty pathetic.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.800
And they show no sign of going away any time soon.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.920
And there's just so many of these goddamn idiots that it's hard to properly deal with them

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.360
in the best way possible.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.920
Why insult these brainless dimwits, when we would be proud to insult them for you.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.000
Channel Awesome and Blip proudly present: "eSults".

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.880
Video responses for when you just don't have time to deal with these mental three year olds.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.180
We have video responses for whiners

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.180
Whiner: "That Capwin guy, he doesn't play as Goku."

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.620

Whiner: "And you know what *continues to whine unintelligibly."

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.080
NC: "Understanding you. Umm, here's someone who better speaks your language."

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.120

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.080
Whiner: "Hey!"

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.040
Responses for ramblers who just need more attention.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.540
Rambler: "You're so stupid. I bet you don't even know what puberty is."
Rachel: "Yeah..."

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.800
Rambler: "Have you hit puberty yet? Idiot!"
Rachel: "You don't say! You are so smart."

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.680
Rambler: "Screw everyone!"
Rachel: "God, you're better than me."

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.020
Rachel: "Please, tell me more."

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.340
Everything you need when you just don't have the energy to listen to any more insecure morons.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.840
