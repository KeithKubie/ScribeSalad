it's getting better that's that's the

it's getting better that's that's the
 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:09.340
it's getting better that's that's the
good news that the gradients in the

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:09.350
good news that the gradients in the
 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.699
good news that the gradients in the
right direction it is in the at 5050 or

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:12.709
right direction it is in the at 5050 or
 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:17.040
right direction it is in the at 5050 or
it isn't yet really represented

capacity of our planet I think

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850
capacity of our planet I think
 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.750
capacity of our planet I think
engineering is probably the least

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760
 
 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.840
 
represented with a female population and

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850
represented with a female population and
 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.369
represented with a female population and
I'm not quite sure why that is because

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379
I'm not quite sure why that is because
 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.709
I'm not quite sure why that is because
engineering problems are phenomenally

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719
engineering problems are phenomenally
 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.020
engineering problems are phenomenally
interesting and challenging and it's a

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030
interesting and challenging and it's a
 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.340
interesting and challenging and it's a
creative profession so I think it's a

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350
creative profession so I think it's a
 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.279
creative profession so I think it's a
shame if women ran the world different

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289
shame if women ran the world different
 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.189
shame if women ran the world different
things would be engineered and invented

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199
things would be engineered and invented
 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.860
things would be engineered and invented
different perspectives and I think it's

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870
different perspectives and I think it's
 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.389
different perspectives and I think it's
a shame that we don't take more

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399
a shame that we don't take more
 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.969
a shame that we don't take more
advantage of them but I'd say set it's

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979
advantage of them but I'd say set it's
 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.070
advantage of them but I'd say set it's
getting better and it has to get better

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080
getting better and it has to get better
 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.200

the women got change that
 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.520
the women got change that
of course it's it's much easier to be

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530
of course it's it's much easier to be
 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.470
of course it's it's much easier to be
creative in terms of jobs and making

need to be creative I mean women hold up

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000
need to be creative I mean women hold up

challenges had a nuclear physics course
 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.870
challenges had a nuclear physics course
where I was asked to leave the room the

where I was asked to leave the room the
 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.630
where I was asked to leave the room the
day that they discussed health hazards

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640

mysteries
 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.610
mysteries
I mean where we're actually trying to be

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620
I mean where we're actually trying to be
 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.480
I mean where we're actually trying to be
the first person to understand something

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490
the first person to understand something

the first person to understand something
other people may have worked on it

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100
other people may have worked on it
 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.160
other people may have worked on it
but there are problems that don't yet

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170
but there are problems that don't yet
 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.040
but there are problems that don't yet
have answers and we could be the first

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050
have answers and we could be the first
 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.970
have answers and we could be the first
ones to figure something out
