00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.329
Most pornography is as accurate to human sexual
experience as blockbuster superhero films

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:25.949
are to reality.

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.609
Pornography is adult entertainment, it's sex
theater; but it's not going to inherently

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:31.609
hurt you.

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.980
Religious groups harangue the public about
the dangers of porn on the body and mind,

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.730
but the evidence doesn't pan out.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.600
A new study in the journal Sexual Medicine
explored the watching of visual sexual stimuli,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.020
or VSS and its connection to erectile dysfunction.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.690
Common sense might say that men who watch
a lot of porn might have trouble getting it

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.589
up in the presence of a real person because
their expectations don't match reality, but

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.750
this research found precisely the opposite!

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.860
Instead of inhibiting arousal, men who watched
porn got MORE erections!

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.500
And that result was maintained with as much
as 25 HOURS of porn-watching a week; which

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.070
is more than three hours a day.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.080
So wait, if porn watching hoists the mainmast,
for lads, what about for lassies?

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.009
Firstly, which will come as NO SURPRISE to
some of you, women DO watch porn.

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.610
Though Pew Research only found 8 percent of
women in 2013 reported viewing porn -- up

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.700
from only 2 percent in 2010 -- PornHub's insights
team says, 23 percent of their viewers were

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.510
female; and a Dutch study in the Journal of
Sexual Medicine reported a massive 45 percent!

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.440
And according to that study pornography doesn't
increase sexual aggression or sexually transmitted

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.430
diseases -- lines touted by many pornographic
pugilists.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.850
When adjusted for age and personality, men
who watched porn didn't see a change in the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.510
number of sexual partners, though women did,
but only by point-three percent.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:02.610
As an added bonus; in a study of 400 heterosexual
pornographic videos, women and men were found

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.150
to be equally represented as initiators of
sex, and in positions of power.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.549
Plus, PornHub's Insights point out that both
men and women search for similar terms when

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:16.530
on their website, though usually at different
rates, and women were 80 to 100 percent more

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.470
likely to search for "rough sex" and terms
related to female-centric oral sex.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.090
While negatively-skewed surveys about the
QUOTE "discovery of partners' sexual behaviors"

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.190
are often connected to feelings of jealousy,
anxiety and betrayal; A 2013 study in the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.660
Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy found partners
who were honest with each other about their

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.120
pornographic habits had lower levels of distress,
and higher levels of relationship satisfaction!

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.310
Perhaps if the partners hadn't hidden their
preferences, it wouldn't have been as shocking?According

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.950
to the JSMT study, mutual enjoyment of pornography
increased happiness for couples as well; and

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.120
dishonesty about habits increased distrust
and dissatisfaction.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.820
In the end, while porn can have negative effects
personally and relationally; some studies

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.460
on pornography are done on those already seeking
treatment for sexual deviance or dysfunction,

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.150
and others are simply not representative of
the actual populationâ€¦

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.610
On top of that, many studies focus on heterosexual
couples, or specifically men.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.600
Obviously, we need more study of women, and
non-traditional couples, relationships and

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.600
so on.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.190
It's crazy to think we humans don't really
know much about how we humans are getting

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.190
it on.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.720
This is still a private behavior, and it's
very difficult to openly study.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.630
But overall, visual sexual stimuli seem to
be a benefit to men and women who are open

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.550
and honest about their sexuality; how not
strange at all does that sound??

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.810
How do you feel about this?

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.790
Would you be upset if your partner was watching
porn without you?

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:55.670
What 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.960
about together?
