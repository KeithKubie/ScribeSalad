[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.640
ERIC M. RUIZ: Tom,
welcome to Google.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.770
TOM BILYEU: Thanks
for having me, man.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:09.700
I'm excited to be here.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.325
ERIC M. RUIZ: Yeah,
it is our pleasure.

00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:13.170
So as I mentioned
before we got going,

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.244
we're very big fans
here of Quest Nutrition.

00:00:15.244 --> 00:00:15.910
TOM BILYEU: Yes.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:16.270
ERIC M. RUIZ: Yes.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.110
TOM BILYEU: It's exciting.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.100
ERIC M. RUIZ: S'mores is
the flavor of the day.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.130
And I can't wait for Thursday,
which is cookies-and-cream.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.171
TOM BILYEU: There you go.

00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:24.202
All right, those are
two heavy hitters, man.

00:00:24.202 --> 00:00:25.160
Respect on the choices.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.700
ERIC M. RUIZ: Yes, well,
thank your facilities.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.810
So Tom, you have a wonderful
story, a very fascinating

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.320
resume, if I do say so.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.550
So let's start from there.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.190
You majored in film at USC.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.910
TOM BILYEU: Yes.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.470
ERIC M. RUIZ: Then you
went into technology.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.636
TOM BILYEU: Right, obviously

00:00:39.636 --> 00:00:42.612
ERIC M. RUIZ: Obviously-- and
then you went into nutrition.

00:00:42.612 --> 00:00:47.740
Can you walk us through
that road that you took?

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.270
TOM BILYEU: Yeah,
there were a lot

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.080
of changes that
happened in my life that

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.360
made those things happen.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.020
So in film school--

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.260
USC Film School is,
statistically speaking, harder

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.980
to get into than Harvard Law.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.220
And I managed to
get into USC Film.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.100
I was thinking, hey, I'm
the business over here.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.750
Like, I'm just
going to crush it.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.640
And the first year, I did.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.180
And I did very, very well.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.560
And that set me up, in
my final year at USC,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.910
to be able to do a thesis film.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.760
And only four people
in the entire class

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.297
get to do a thesis film.

00:01:19.297 --> 00:01:20.630
And I was chosen as one of them.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.811
So I went from no
one thinking I'm

00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:24.560
going to be able to
get into film school--

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.560
the career counselors
at USC literally told

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.190
me to stop taking film classes.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.898
They're like, you're
not going to get in.

00:01:29.898 --> 00:01:31.300
We see this happen all the time.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.841
People think they're
going to get in.

00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:33.550
They don't.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.789
And so I said, look, I'm
going to take somebody out

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.330
from the admissions committee
and just pin them down and say,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.340
what do I need to do to get in?

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.970
So I did that.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.095
I took one of the guys out.

00:01:42.095 --> 00:01:44.200
And I said--

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.502
I got a 990 on my SATs,
and I took it twice.

00:01:46.502 --> 00:01:47.960
And I'm saying that
here in Google.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.920
So I know you guys got some real
SAT scores, which I did not.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.456
And so the counselors are
looking at my SAT scores

00:01:55.456 --> 00:01:57.080
and saying, this
isn't going to happen.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.884
I'm sitting down
with one of the guys

00:01:58.884 --> 00:02:00.050
in the admissions committee.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.820
I said, look, those
are my SAT scores.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.680
What do I need to do to get in?

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.570
And he said, look, we accept
people at two phases--

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.560
one, as an incoming freshmen,
and then your SAT scores matter

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.900
a lot, and then as
an incoming junior.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.790
And your SAT scores
don't matter at all,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.590
because they're meant to
just tell me how well you're

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.640
going to do in school.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.870
But by then, you'll have
had two years here at USC.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.330
I'll just look at your grades.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.130
So I'm a freshman at this time.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.600
So he said, look, if you get
grades that are good enough,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.890
I'm not even going to
look at your SAT scores.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.180
So I took that as,
that's my mission.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.780
So I went and locked myself
in a dorm room for two years.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.380
I didn't date.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.010
I didn't party.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.150
I didn't drink, do drugs--

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.290
nothing.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.240
I worked and I studied.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.410
And that was it.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.510
And so I end up getting
into film school.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.150
So get into film school--
then I do well in film school,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.450
get the senior thesis film.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.450
And I think, this is it.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.970
I'm on lock.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.830
I'm going to crush this
senior thesis film.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.580
I'm going to get out.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.750
I'm going to have the
three-picture deal.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.870
I'm going to go
take over Hollywood.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.130
It's going to be amazing.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.840
I'm going to be rich and
famous by the time I'm 26.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.410
And that's--

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.630
ERIC M. RUIZ: The dream.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.760
TOM BILYEU: --that, right?

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.230
It's all coming true.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:07.250
And then I failed so miserably
on my senior thesis film,

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.130
so publicly and
so embarrassingly,

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.730
that it absolutely
destroyed my sense of self.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.970
And so, as I'm
crashing and burning--

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.550
because it's pretty
dog-eat-dog in the film

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.760
industry in Los Angeles in
that little microcosm of film

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.390
school.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.820
And so people are laughing
about how poorly the film went

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.730
and all that stuff.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.230
And so I--

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.370
ERIC M. RUIZ: So
that's how you failed?

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.410
In regards to the reception
the film received?

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.910
TOM BILYEU: Yeah,
it really was bad.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.500
There's just no two
ways about that.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.050
Even if people had been like,
oh, Tom you tried so hard,

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.230
it just was a bad film.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.800
It was so bad, in fact, that
I stole the master film.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.990
So it can never
be watched again.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.750
I want to be really clear about
how truly bad this one was.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.810
And so, in that
moment, I realized--

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.480
and it's funny how
often people push back.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.010
What I realized was, I did not
have talent as a filmmaker.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.640
And that's such a deeply
uncomfortable thing for people

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.840
to say or to hear.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.180
And it was for me at
the time for sure.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.920
And it's not for me now, at all.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.800
Because now I don't worry
about innate talent.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.020
I only worry about
a growth mindset--

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.220
being able to get
good at something.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.160
And so-- [COUGHS] excuse me.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.800
I'm dealing with a cough here
if I had understood at that time

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.300
that I could get
better, it wouldn't

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.320
have created the panic.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.903
But I didn't think
I could get better.

00:04:28.903 --> 00:04:30.950
So that was the first movement.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.380
Then, once I leave film
school, I'm totally lost.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.080
I realize I'm a talentless hack.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.566
I don't know what I'm going
to do with my life anymore.

00:04:45.566 --> 00:04:48.680
I decide that the
only path for me

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.830
is going to be to become
the king of remedial jobs.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.600
And I wanted to feel
good about myself.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.690
And so I was going
into positions

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.790
where I'd be
interviewing, where I

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.160
knew I'd be smarter than
the person interviewing me.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.860
And the likelihood of me getting
the job was virtually 100%.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.200
And so that was where I was.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.120
And I was selling games retail.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.430
And this is after
getting a degree

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.570
and having tens of thousands of
dollars in student loan debt.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.984
I'm working in these
really dead-end jobs,

00:05:19.984 --> 00:05:21.650
just trying to make
ends meet and trying

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.160
to figure out what I'm
going to do with my life.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.720
ERIC M. RUIZ: So you
purposely aimed lower.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.870
TOM BILYEU: I, literally,
purposely aimed lower.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.160
And it was an ego-boost.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.270
And it was great.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.660
And then luckily,
somebody offered me a job

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.337
teaching at a film school.

00:05:35.337 --> 00:05:37.170
And I thought, OK, well,
those that can, do.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.900
And those that can't, teach.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.750
So this is perfect.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.510
And I start teaching.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.950
And I realized, whoa.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.710
I'm embarrassing myself
in front of the class.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.300
Oddly enough, I
actually don't know

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.040
enough to be teaching this.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.230
So I'm going I have
to go home at night

00:05:54.230 --> 00:06:00.160
and learn enough in the
lesson to be able to come

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.690
in the next day and teach.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.440
But then, as I start doing that,
I actually start improving.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.984
And so I start
thinking, well, can I

00:06:10.984 --> 00:06:12.400
help them make
their films better?

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.170
And if I can, can I
make my own better?

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.190
ERIC M. RUIZ: Mm-hm, so at this
point, you're-- what?-- like,

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.410
two years removed from school?

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.180
What time frame are
we looking from USC?

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.590
TOM BILYEU: Yeah, so at exactly
that, about two years out.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.770
ERIC M. RUIZ: Mm-hm.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.000
And so you're teaching.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.580
You're touching up
on your own career,

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.720
I suppose, as a filmmaker.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.690
And then how did
that lead into--

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.870
oh, wait!-- nutrition.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.780
TOM BILYEU: So now
we have to cross

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.270
the chasm between
considering myself

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.960
the king of remedial
jobs, then realizing

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.680
that I can help these people
make their films better

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.590
and, by the transitive
property, I should be

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.330
able to make my films better.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.050
So that is the beginning of me
really thinking about a growth

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.730
mindset which, up
until that point,

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.560
I had never had
a growth mindset.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.140
And Carol Dweck had not yet
written her seminal book

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.000
"Growth Mindset" on the topic.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.090
So--

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.370
ERIC M. RUIZ: And can
you explain a little bit

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.078
about the differences
between that growth

00:07:08.078 --> 00:07:09.740
mindset and the fixed mindset?

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.948
TOM BILYEU: Yeah, definitely.

00:07:10.948 --> 00:07:13.300
So somebody that
has a fixed mindset

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:18.280
believes that their talent and
intelligence are fixed traits,

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.641
that whatever you're
born with, that's it.

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:23.390
That's as good as
you're ever going to be.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.060
And so, hey, make
the most of it.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.740
Somebody that has
a growth mindset

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.770
realizes that that's just
your starting off point.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.920
And while we may not
all be equal from where

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.680
our starting off point
is, the human animal

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.800
is, literally, designed from the
ground up to be able to adapt.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.240
And so it begins to
be a question of, how

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.740
much are you willing to adapt?

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.110
What price are you willing to
pay to get great at something?

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.300
And so teaching--

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.595
I'm determined to survive
this interview here.

00:07:55.595 --> 00:07:56.970
Teaching was the
first thing that

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.730
really began to give me that
sense that, OK, wait a second.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:01.997
I could put time into this.

00:08:01.997 --> 00:08:02.580
I could learn.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:03.121
I could grow.

00:08:03.121 --> 00:08:05.190
I could get better.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.860
And while I'm teaching,
these two guys come in

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.530
and they see me teaching.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.800
And they were very
successful entrepreneurs.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.110
And ironically, they
were bodybuilders.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.420
Now, as a kid growing
up, I promised myself

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.630
two things-- so growing up in
Tacoma, a slightly chubby kid

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:24.224
in a morbidly obese
family that teetered

00:08:24.224 --> 00:08:26.640
between blue collar and white
collar, I'd promised myself,

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.110
one day, I'll be rich.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.570
And one day, I'll
have six-pack abs.

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.490
And so these two guys walk in.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:33.150
They're rich.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.679
And they have six-pack abs.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.960
And they were like, hey,
you're pretty bright.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.030
We're about to
start this company.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.500
We need a copywriter.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.707
Why don't you come be
a copywriter for us?

00:08:43.707 --> 00:08:45.540
But don't think of
yourself as a copywriter.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.081
Understand that you
can have any role

00:08:47.081 --> 00:08:48.342
that you want in this company.

00:08:48.342 --> 00:08:50.550
You just have to become the
right person for the job.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.175
And so I was just
young enough and just

00:08:52.175 --> 00:08:54.720
hungry enough to really
transform my life

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.240
and make something of it
that I leapt at the chance.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.750
I left my teaching position.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.580
I went out, started
working with them.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.160
And through that
process of building

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.820
that company-- and this is a
very long story that I think

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.380
is powerful and interesting.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.530
But I'll spare you, so that we
can cover some other topics.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.650
But it ends with me having
an emotional crisis--

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:20.140
and two really.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.080
The first emotional
crisis is I'm

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.840
arguing for things
that I know are worse

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.670
for the company, which
means that they're

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:32.470
less likely to make me rich,
but because they were my idea.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:34.420
So I'm fighting tooth
and nail for an idea

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.100
that I know is
wrong-- that I know

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.975
will move the company
backwards-- that I have

00:09:37.975 --> 00:09:39.550
a voice in my head
screaming, you

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.010
know this isn't going to work!

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:44.590
But I so want to be right--

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.380
I so needed to be right,
that I keep pushing.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.280
And I keep arguing.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.630
And then finally, one day--

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.820
because my partners are
much smarter than I am.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.010
And I'll define
intellect as the ability

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.180
to process raw data rapidly.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.430
So they could just process
raw data very fast.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.590
They could think through the
situation faster than I could.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:05.616
Because of that, I was always
feeling badly about myself,

00:10:05.616 --> 00:10:07.240
because I just couldn't
out-think them.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.580
And because, at that point,
I had a fixed mindset

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:13.840
and I valued myself in being
right, good, smart, worthy--

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.317
all permanent states-of-being.

00:10:15.317 --> 00:10:17.650
Because someone with a fixed
mindset believes everything

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.600
is a permanent state-of-being.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.420
So I needed to
win this argument.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:29.160
And ironically, I end up winning
the argument to my detriment

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.050
and realize, OK, now what?

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:33.330
And I have this
moment of crisis.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.000
I always tell people,
what I really want in life

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.260
is to be rich.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.020
But I'm acting as if
what I really want

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.690
is to just feel
good about myself

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.322
on a neuro-chemical level.

00:10:44.322 --> 00:10:46.530
ERIC M. RUIZ: So in a way,
you fighting for this idea

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:49.230
that you knew was wrong was
your way of asserting control

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.550
over the situation?

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.850
TOM BILYEU: It was my
way of being right.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.220
And because I valued
that and my self-esteem

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.250
was built around being
smart and being right,

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.290
if I was around people
who were smarter

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:05.760
than me and I was always wrong,
then I had no self-esteem.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.170
And so I literally then
end up asking myself

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.550
that very question,
which is, just

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.860
be honest about what you want.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.560
If what you want is to
feel good about yourself,

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.430
then you need to leave
this environment.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.430
Because you don't feel
good around these people.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.510
They're smarter than you.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.580
They've got more
good ideas than you.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.622
So leave.

00:11:24.622 --> 00:11:26.580
But if, on the other
hand, what you really want

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.454
is your goal-- you
actually want to get rich,

00:11:28.454 --> 00:11:30.750
which was my
obsession at the time,

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.850
then you've got to
figure out another way

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:34.530
to think about your self-esteem.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:38.050
And that's what I did.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:39.940
So in that moment,
I realized, I needed

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.000
to switch what I built my
self-esteem around to something

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.666
that is anti-fragile.

00:11:44.666 --> 00:11:47.040
Now, at the time, I didn't
have the words "anti-fragile."

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.600
If you guys have read Nassim
Taleb's book by that name,

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.540
then you know what he means--

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.790
something that is resilient
or strong or tough.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.040
They're still all defined
by their breaking point.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.540
But something
that's anti-fragile

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.230
actually gets stronger
the more you attack it.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.310
And so I was trying
to think of, what

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.620
is something that's going
to make me feel better

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.190
about myself?

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.910
The more I realize I'm wrong--
the more I realize that

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.369
I'm stupid, not the smartest
person, had the worst idea,

00:12:12.369 --> 00:12:14.410
that I'm not yet good
enough-- all those things--

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.590
how do I make that not a
liability but my very strength?

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.440
The very thing
that's driving me?

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.580
And that became flipping what
I built my self-esteem around

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.340
to building it around
identifying the right answer

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.620
faster than anyone
else, always being

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.120
willing to admit
when I was wrong,

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.310
and actually taking
pride in that.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.550
So that, in a business meeting,
if 30 seconds before I'd

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:39.004
been arguing tooth and nail
about an idea-- it's mine!

00:12:39.004 --> 00:12:39.670
I believe in it!

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:40.970
I'm going after it!--

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.630
and then somebody
says something and I

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:49.380
realize they're right then, on
a dime I would stop and say,

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.980
you've got the right answer.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.550
And then I would become the
energy behind that idea.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:57.010
And that was the
first real crisis.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.120
ERIC M. RUIZ: Of
re-adjusting your expectation

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.350
around your self-esteem
and your values.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.000
TOM BILYEU: 100%-- and as
soon as I made that switch,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.010
I started moving up in the
company very, very quickly.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:10.980
So now, flash
forward a few years.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.950
I become an owner in the
company through sweat equity.

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.560
The company is
worth-- at the height,

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.520
I think it was valued
at, like, $22 million.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.850
So on paper, I'm a
multimillionaire.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:25.110
My salary is higher than
it's ever been in my life.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.860
And now, I'm
completely miserable.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.610
And I'm like, I'm
living the cliche

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.080
of "money can't buy happiness."

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.580
And I'm like, this is a joke.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.190
This was so predictable
and so easy to see coming.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.950
How have I actually gotten
caught in this trap?

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:42.300
And I begin to realize that
I wasn't pursuing things

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.560
that gave me more energy.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.510
I was pursuing something
that was taking

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.100
more energy than it was giving.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:51.610
I wasn't pursuing something
that I was passionate about.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.710
And what I didn't yet
understand about money

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:56.410
is that money is, in
and of itself, inert.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:00.700
Nobody, save for maybe Scrooge
McDuck and possibly Warren

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.360
Buffett, would actually get off
on swimming in their own money.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.680
So it's not the money.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.110
When you talked to Warren
Buffett, part of what drives

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.540
him is, it's a scorecard.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.290
He gets off on the scorecard.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:16.180
But if you don't, if that's not
your thing-- and it's not mine.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.500
So I'm building this business.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.550
I'm learning all these skills.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:19.180
I'm coming in.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.290
I'm working my ass off.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:21.560
I'm working seven days a week.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.560
I'm not taking days off.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.160
I'm damaging my
relationship at home.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.930
And all for what?

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.260
Money.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.930
Now, the vast majority of
my wealth, at the time,

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.130
was tied up in the
equity of the company.

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.580
Which basically
means, you have none.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.290
So most people don't
even understand

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:39.380
the difference between
paper money and liquid cash.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.180
Paper money is not interesting.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.102
They'll write about
it in Forbes magazine.

00:14:43.102 --> 00:14:44.810
And kids will come up
to me freaking out,

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.987
because they know my
net worth is crazy high.

00:14:46.987 --> 00:14:49.070
And I'm like, the only
thing you should care about

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:50.540
is, how much money
do I have where

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.060
I can go now manifest
something in the real world?

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.130
Build a business, buy
something-- whatever.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:56.860
And that's a totally
different game.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:04.980
So at that moment, I'm
thinking, this is total misery.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.190
I want to wake up
every day and enjoy

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:10.230
my life, to have
more energy being

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.670
given to me than taken away.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.510
And in that moment, I
realize, the game I'm playing

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:16.650
isn't money.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:18.000
It's not success.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.682
It's brain chemistry.

00:15:19.682 --> 00:15:22.140
And if the game that I'm playing
is brain chemistry-- which

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.450
I'll say another
way-- deep and lasting

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.370
fulfillment-- the thing that,
as a human, makes us feel good.

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:29.280
The thing that we're
all secret deep down--

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.821
no matter what you
tell people you're

00:15:30.821 --> 00:15:33.000
chasing, the thing
you're actually chasing

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.170
is fulfillment.

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:36.442
You want to feel good
about who you are.

00:15:36.442 --> 00:15:38.400
You want to feel good
about your contributions.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.310
You want to feel good
about meaning and purpose

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:42.730
in your life.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.820
So those are the
things, ultimately,

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:45.780
the people are chasing.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.510
They think that money is
going to give that to them.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:49.410
And they're wrong.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:51.493
And that's how they keep
getting caught off-guard.

00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:54.090
Now, the reason that
money is this trap--

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.890
that everyone can
tell you is a trap--

00:15:55.890 --> 00:16:00.420
and yet it will still capture
you, is because money is real.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.237
And it's really powerful.

00:16:02.237 --> 00:16:04.320
And the things that money
lets you do in your life

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.700
is almost unimaginable
until you have money.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.350
And I see now, what
I'm doing, finally

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:15.660
now having real liquid
assets that are significant--

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.887
guys, think for one
second right now.

00:16:17.887 --> 00:16:20.220
Imagine, closing your eyes
and thinking about that thing

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.800
you most want, the thing
you want to build--

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:22.630
it's something beautiful.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.546
It's something you want
to leave for humanity.

00:16:24.546 --> 00:16:28.260
I will just assume it isn't
dumb shit, like a car.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.661
It's really something.

00:16:29.661 --> 00:16:31.410
It's something you
want to build and give.

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:32.040
And it's going to be--

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.039
I don't think in legacy.

00:16:33.039 --> 00:16:34.252
But I get the sentiment.

00:16:34.252 --> 00:16:35.460
It's going to be your legacy.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.293
It's going to be that
thing that outlast you

00:16:37.293 --> 00:16:40.590
or helps other people or
offers jobs or builds something

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.727
that we all want.

00:16:42.727 --> 00:16:44.810
The only thing stopping
you from doing it-- you're

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:45.830
going to say it's time.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.120
But it's not time.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.505
It's money.

00:16:48.505 --> 00:16:49.880
And that's how
money gets people.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.780
Because once you know what
you want to build with it,

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.850
then it's really powerful.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:01.220
But if you're chasing money in
and of itself, you'll burn out.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:01.896
I promise.

00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:03.770
You won't enjoy your
life, because you're not

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.940
thinking about that
end result. So anyway,

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:11.050
at the height of all that--

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.510
making money, wealthy on
paper, totally miserable--

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.430
I go into my partners.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.290
And I say, here's
your equity back.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:20.380
So literally, me essentially
sliding $2 million

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.579
back across the table.

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:24.010
Thank you, I'm quitting.

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:25.130
I can't do this anymore.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.740
I'm not willing to
keep chasing money.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:27.849
I want to feel alive.

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:30.456
That was the statement
I kept saying.

00:17:30.456 --> 00:17:31.330
I want to feel alive.

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:34.957
I want to go do
something that brings me

00:17:34.957 --> 00:17:36.040
that sense of fulfillment.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.251
And this isn't it.

00:17:37.251 --> 00:17:39.250
And they said, look, come
out to dinner with us.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:40.740
They were taken aback--

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:41.365
very surprised.

00:17:41.365 --> 00:17:41.770
And--

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.530
ERIC M. RUIZ: You just
give them back $2 million.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.446
TOM BILYEU: Gave them
back $2 million in quit.

00:17:45.446 --> 00:17:47.200
And it was like,
this is good-bye.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.660
And so it was super abrupt.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.350
They said, come out
to dinner with us.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:52.070
And I go out.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.960
And they said, we could
do this without you,

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.550
but we don't want to.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:58.280
And that phrase changed
the course of my life.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.040
Because what it allowed me to do
was connect to something other

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.099
than the money.

00:18:02.099 --> 00:18:03.890
And so, for the first
time-- by that point,

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:07.460
we were six or seven years into
the company of, literally, just

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.350
around the clock--
around the clock.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:10.820
To give you an idea
of how hardcore

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.550
I was and how I had worked
my way into equity, starting

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.770
as a copywriter--

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:19.340
I rented an apartment
that I timed,

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.915
so I could make sure that, if
my business partners-- which

00:18:21.915 --> 00:18:24.290
remember, at that time, I was
just a copywriter-- if they

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:27.290
were to ever call me, at 2:00
in the morning on a Saturday,

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:29.640
that I would be to their
house in less than 10 minutes.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.820
So I timed-- my wife would
find an apartment she liked.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.850
And then we would drive,
first to one partner,

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:36.500
then back, then to
the other partner,

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.990
and see if both of them were
less than seven minutes--

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.000
was what I was aiming for.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.800
And that was how we
picked our apartment.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.600
So that's how die-hard I was.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.770
Now, they had made the same
offer to everybody, basically,

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:49.580
in the company.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.040
They would say, we don't
look for employees.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.052
We settle for employees.

00:18:53.052 --> 00:18:54.635
But we're always
looking for partners.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:58.900
And so I had really
taken them up on that.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.660
And that's how all-in I was.

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.700
So now, after doing
that for so many years

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.550
and realizing it didn't bring me
the fulfillment that I wanted,

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.110
my wife having to pull
me aside and saying,

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:09.485
you're damaging
our relationship,

00:19:09.485 --> 00:19:12.120
because you work so
much, my response

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.560
wasn't, I want
balance in my life,

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.640
because I don't
believe in balance.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.470
And if you guys have
ever see my content,

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.600
you'll never hear me preach
about balance or patience--

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.141
none of that.

00:19:19.141 --> 00:19:22.610
Because I have none of it.

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.510
What I'm talking about
is, one, understand

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:27.190
that passion is a process.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:29.980
So there's no passion
lurking within you right now.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.449
There are areas of interest.

00:19:31.449 --> 00:19:33.490
Your job is to experience
a whole bunch of stuff,

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:34.720
find those areas of interest.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.082
ERIC M. RUIZ: Mm-hm, and
then build them out, right?

00:19:37.082 --> 00:19:39.290
TOM BILYEU: Correct, and I
can talk about that later.

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:43.040
But just to finish the story
of how I end up in nutrition--

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.400
so when they say, we
could do this without you,

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.560
but we don't want
to, I realized, whoa.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.846
I needed that, to
connect to you as people.

00:19:51.846 --> 00:19:53.470
We talked a lot about
this brotherhood.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:54.345
We had a brotherhood.

00:19:54.345 --> 00:19:56.890
And that brotherhood, I
realized, over the years,

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:59.399
had become incredibly
valuable to me.

00:19:59.399 --> 00:20:00.940
And it was a huge
part of what helped

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.400
me change as a human
being-- was being connected

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.410
to other people who
thought like I thought,

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:08.350
who would do something as
crazy as get an apartment

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:10.570
and time it and all that,
because they had a goal

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.320
and they were working
towards their goals.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.300
And we just talked
the same language.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.720
And so hearing that
again, I was like, OK.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.650
I can get behind that.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.382
But if we're going
to work together,

00:20:21.382 --> 00:20:22.840
there's just a few
things that have

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.070
to be true from my perspective.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.880
Maybe it's not the same for you.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.830
But for me, here is what
it would have to be.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.380
It would have to be a company
predicated on value-creation.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.660
It would have to be something
that we're passionate about.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.160
We'd have to be
building community.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.841
And we would need to be really
ourselves-- who we truly are,

00:20:35.841 --> 00:20:37.840
which was all a reaction
to what we'd been doing

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:38.929
in the technology company.

00:20:38.929 --> 00:20:40.720
Which was all-- by the
way, I can't believe

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.620
I'm giving this talk in Google.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.230
I was earning Google AdWords.

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:45.770
Like, that was my life.

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.230
And so there was no--

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:50.840
I wasn't communicating
with another human being.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.364
I was in the bidding
system and all of that

00:20:53.364 --> 00:20:54.780
and what are my
competitors doing?

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.770
And how does that
impact my bidding?

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:58.570
And this was, like, in-- what?--

00:20:58.570 --> 00:20:59.710
2005?

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:01.000
2006?

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.260
And so I didn't have a sense
of connection to the consumer.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.100
And so I really wanted
to connect with them.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.070
I wanted to build a community.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.640
And so by the time we end
up launching the company--

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.950
this is now 2009, 2010--

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:16.600
Facebook is coming along.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.370
Everybody is starting
to think about,

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:20.404
as individuals,
how do we connect?

00:21:20.404 --> 00:21:21.820
And then I started
thinking about,

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:27.940
how do we connect as the
company to the consumer?

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.370
And thinking-- really,
what social media is

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.080
is just a megaphone.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.072
And it's going to give
people the opportunity

00:21:34.072 --> 00:21:35.530
to say something
about your company

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.655
within minutes of an
interaction with your company,

00:21:37.655 --> 00:21:38.860
to a global audience.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.350
And so I was like, if you guys
can get excited about that--

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.900
and I'm quoting Kevin Kelly's
"1,000 True Fans," and all

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:44.480
that.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.960
Because in my desperation,
I'd been reading about stuff,

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.430
just trying to figure out,
what's another way to do this?

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:52.556
And so they said, we
actually feel the same.

00:21:52.556 --> 00:21:54.430
We want to do something
that's passion-based,

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.650
predicated on value, allow
us to build community.

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:57.740
They loved it all.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.760
And so, for three very
different reasons,

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.040
we ended up on nutrition.

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.390
I grew up in a
morbidly obese family.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.870
So for me, it was, I needed
to have a mission that

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:10.600
was so big and so compelling
that it gave me energy,

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.540
that I could show up every day
and fight for people that I

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.380
could think about.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.255
And there's an awesome
quote often attributed

00:22:16.255 --> 00:22:19.600
to Mother Teresa that says,
Nobody will act for the many.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.137
But people will act for the one.

00:22:21.137 --> 00:22:23.470
So if there's someone you can
picture, someone you know,

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.050
someone you love, you'll
go to battle for them.

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:28.660
So I knew, I'll show
up everyday and fight

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:29.770
for my mom and my sister.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:33.370
And I know that they're going
to die too early if we can't

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:36.250
figure out how to solve
this problem of making food

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.400
that people want
to eat taste good.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.500
And so that became the
mission of the company--

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.110
was to end metabolic
disease and to do it

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:47.680
by making food that people
can choose based on taste.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.779
And it happens to
be good for them.

00:22:49.779 --> 00:22:51.820
ERIC M. RUIZ: Interesting--
and so this process--

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.290
and you've finished
school-- you--

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:54.020
copywriter.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:55.900
You've grown through the ranks.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.400
And now, it's pivoted
into a nutrition company.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.120
So then how do we go from
nutrition to Impact Theory?

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.140
TOM BILYEU: Yes-- yeah--

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.990
ERIC M. RUIZ: Which is about
storytelling and empowerment.

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:09.220
TOM BILYEU: Yes, so if you know
the classic hero's journey,

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.180
then this is--

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:13.510
at the end of Joseph Campbell's
classic "Hero's Journey,"

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.520
the part that isn't
often talked about

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.090
is the hero returns home to
bring the message to others.

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:21.319
So whatever that
journey just taught him,

00:23:21.319 --> 00:23:23.110
he's going to come back
now, and he's going

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.401
to help other people with that.

00:23:24.401 --> 00:23:26.770
And while I don't
consider myself a teacher,

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:30.050
returning to film is very
much me returning home.

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:30.925
It's where I started.

00:23:30.925 --> 00:23:31.940
It's my first love.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.960
It's my deepest passion.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.660
And it is all of those
things, because of its ability

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:38.570
to impact people.

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:41.830
So the irony is, I wasn't
trying to return to film.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.530
What I was trying to do is
pull people out of the matrix.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:48.400
So I think, in movies-- they've
always just spoken to me,

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.020
maybe more than most.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:54.070
And the movie "The Matrix"
came out March 31, 1999.

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:57.370
It just had its
19-year anniversary.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:59.620
And I remember
going to a preview

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:00.820
screening of that movie.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.037
Because I'm a comic nerd.

00:24:02.037 --> 00:24:03.370
And I was at a comic convention.

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:04.990
They were handing out tickets.

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:11.170
And when they're walking in to
the opening scene, basically--

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:14.740
and the agents show up and
the cop goes, don't worry,

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:18.280
we can handle one little girl,
and agent Smith goes, no,

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.010
Lieutenant, your men
are already dead,

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:23.140
and then they cut to Trinity--

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:25.990
she jumps into
the air-- freezes.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:27.910
In that theater
that I saw that in,

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:30.910
everyone screamed in unison
and started clapping.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:33.340
Now, I had never experienced
something like that

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.600
ever in a movie before.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.817
The spontaneous eruption
of the entire audience

00:24:37.817 --> 00:24:39.400
in the middle of
something that wasn't

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.127
like a scream or a yell--
it was, like, celebratory.

00:24:42.127 --> 00:24:43.960
They couldn't believe
what they were seeing.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.834
And then, ultimately,
as the movie plays out,

00:24:45.834 --> 00:24:47.290
it's a movie about belief.

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:49.012
And it was coming
at a time in my life

00:24:49.012 --> 00:24:50.470
where the only
thing I believed was

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:52.761
that I was a talentless hack
and that I had no idea how

00:24:52.761 --> 00:24:54.190
to make my life come true.

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.520
So seeing this
metaphor for belief--

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.950
and that what Neo
really has to figure out

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:01.840
is that he's the
one and that, first,

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.166
for him to finally come to
believe in himself enough

00:25:04.166 --> 00:25:06.790
that he is the one, someone else
and tell him he's not the one.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:08.860
And so he's got to go
on that whole journey.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:10.318
And he's got to
try the impossible.

00:25:10.318 --> 00:25:12.190
And he's got to be
willing to face failure.

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:14.620
And the fact that it works
is because nobody was ever,

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.749
before him, willing
to face the failure.

00:25:16.749 --> 00:25:18.790
And so because he's willing
to face the failure--

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:20.980
and if you remember
the movie-- he fails.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:21.910
He dies.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:24.710
But it's only in
remembering-- wait a second,

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.580
these are just rules, and
I can break the rules--

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.710
that he then comes
back and realizes,

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:31.356
once he understands
the rules, once he

00:25:31.356 --> 00:25:32.980
believes in himself
enough, then he can

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.188
do all this incredible stuff.

00:25:34.188 --> 00:25:37.010
And I don't think we
actually live in the matrix.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.800
And if we do, I don't think
that it really matters.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.269
But as a metaphor, I think
it's the perfect metaphor

00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:43.310
for the human experience.

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:46.060
Because what you
believe about yourself

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:50.020
will entirely dictate what
you do with your life.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:51.970
Now, let that hang in the air.

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:54.950
Now, as that's hanging in the
air, let me tell you a story.

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:56.440
I started big
brothering when I was

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.530
18-years-old for a kid
in the inner cities-- one

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:01.300
kid named Richaun Jackson.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.190
Richaun-- I didn't
know this at the time.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:04.780
But he was in an
abusive household.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.850
He'd been adopted.

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.049
And his mother was just brutal.

00:26:09.049 --> 00:26:10.840
And he always wanted
to spend time with me.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.804
And so at first, it
was just supposed

00:26:12.804 --> 00:26:13.970
to be an eight-week program.

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:15.730
I was going to go in and
help him with his homework.

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:17.104
At six weeks, they
tell you, hey,

00:26:17.104 --> 00:26:18.827
make sure you warn
them that you're only

00:26:18.827 --> 00:26:19.910
coming for two more weeks.

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:20.290
I warn him.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:22.870
He goes nuclear, unlike anything
I've ever seen in my life--

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.630
freaking out, crying,
fighting with other kids--

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:26.920
just like a whirling dervish.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.950
It was pure insanity.

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:30.040
I finally get him over.

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.300
And I said, is this
because I said I'm only

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.383
coming for two more weeks?

00:26:32.383 --> 00:26:33.012
He says, yes.

00:26:33.012 --> 00:26:33.970
I say, all right, look.

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:35.890
I'll make you a promise.

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:37.930
If you'll settle down
and do your homework--

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:40.039
because he was always
hard to wrangle--

00:26:40.039 --> 00:26:41.830
if you'll settle down
and do your homework,

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:45.450
as long as I live in Los
Angeles, I'll tutor you, deal?

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:46.090
Deal.

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:48.621
That ends up being an 8 1/2
year relationship that sees me

00:26:48.621 --> 00:26:49.120
helping.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.770
I become the
guardian of the court

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:55.090
when he gets taken away from
his abusive adoptive mother.

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:58.200
And I remember thinking,
this kid's amazing.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.920
Like, he's so interesting.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.650
And he's so
interested and just--

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:05.020
it's just, he's amazing.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.650
But he once said
to me the phrase,

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:11.000
I already been had that.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.280
And I said to him, you
already been had that?

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:13.680
And he was like, yeah.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.679
I already been had that.

00:27:14.679 --> 00:27:17.999
And I was like, you
already been had that?

00:27:17.999 --> 00:27:19.790
And in that moment, I
realized, he actually

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:21.354
thought that's how you said it.

00:27:21.354 --> 00:27:23.520
And so he goes, well, that's
how my teacher says it.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.362
And I was like, oh my god!

00:27:25.362 --> 00:27:26.070
And so here I am.

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:27.080
I'm 19-years-old.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.360
And this crashing
realization hits me

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.070
that, because of
where he's born,

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:32.889
his options have
just been limited.

00:27:32.889 --> 00:27:35.180
Then, if you ask him what he
wants to do with his life,

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:36.780
his dreams are small.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.020
He's got no big dreams.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.310
So I'm like, wow-- strike 2.

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.890
And then, of course, data
now has come out just

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:44.750
in treasure troves
about how much

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.657
your zip code is going to
determine your future success.

00:27:47.657 --> 00:27:48.490
But I was living it.

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:50.450
I was seeing it
happen before my eyes.

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.330
And then-- flash forward.

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:55.107
In Quest, manufacturing--
in manufacturing,

00:27:55.107 --> 00:27:56.690
you're in inner
cities, because that's

00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:00.500
where the zoning happens
so that you can actually

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:05.570
get the kind of square
footage that you need.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:07.940
And so now I've
got 1,000 employees

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:10.580
that all grew up like
Richaun and 1,000 people

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:11.330
with small dreams.

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:13.779
And I started, in the
interviewing process--

00:28:13.779 --> 00:28:16.070
because in the beginning,
everyone interviewed with me.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:20.060
Whether you were the
chief sales officer

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:22.550
or you were the janitor,
you interviewed with me.

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:24.770
And so I saw thousands.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:28.840
I've probably
interviewed-- oh, man--

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.200
probably close to 3,000 people
at this point, which is crazy.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.470
And every one of them, I would
ask the magic genie question.

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:36.790
A magic genie's about show up.

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:39.040
They're going to grant you
one wish and one wish only.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.836
You can't wish for something
for somebody else--

00:28:42.836 --> 00:28:45.460
to cure cancer or bring somebody
back from the dead-- whatever.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:46.418
It's got to be for you.

00:28:46.418 --> 00:28:48.100
What do you wish for?

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:52.120
Every single person--
every single person

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.040
said the same thing.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.581
Any guesses what they said?

00:28:56.581 --> 00:28:58.450
AUDIENCE: Limitless wishes.

00:28:58.450 --> 00:28:59.380
TOM BILYEU: That would
have been so smart.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:00.880
I did tell him they couldn't
wish for more wishes,

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.050
so I didn't get that one.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:04.050
They never would have
thought to do that though.

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:06.490
So not a single
person ever said that.

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:08.680
First, they said a job.

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.572
Fair enough, right?

00:29:09.572 --> 00:29:10.780
You're here for an interview.

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:12.010
You think that's
what I want to hear.

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:13.343
You think it's a trick question.

00:29:13.343 --> 00:29:15.940
So then I would say, I
get why you said that.

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.600
That's not really
what you want, is it?

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.900
No-- hahahaha-- it's not.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.280
OK, what do you really want?

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:21.880
Money.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.050
OK, fantastic.

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:25.090
How much money?

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:28.780
I never got any
answer other than one.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:31.040
And the answer was $1
million every time--

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:31.540
over--

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:33.498
ERIC M. RUIZ: And they
could wish for anything.

00:29:33.498 --> 00:29:36.040
TOM BILYEU: Anything--
over and over and over.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.680
You could ask for $1 trillion.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.480
And you ask for $1 million?

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.837
And it actually
started to scare me.

00:29:43.837 --> 00:29:45.170
Now, that's a really long story.

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:48.999
But you need to understand how
deeply that embedded itself.

00:29:48.999 --> 00:29:51.040
You've got Richaun and
me, feeling like I totally

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.860
failed to help him
avoid what I could see

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.310
was going to be his future.

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:57.280
And then you have
1,000 Richaun's.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.041
And now, I feel responsible
to help change their belief

00:30:01.041 --> 00:30:01.540
system.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.690
And I believe, if I can
change their belief system,

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:06.710
I can change the
course of their life.

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:08.410
And so we start in the
[INAUDIBLE] Quest University.

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:10.493
And I tell people, making
the protein bars is just

00:30:10.493 --> 00:30:11.196
your tuition.

00:30:11.196 --> 00:30:12.820
What you're really
here to do is figure

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:14.080
out what you want
to do with your life

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.621
and then get the skills that
you would need to go and further

00:30:16.621 --> 00:30:18.590
yourself down that path.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:22.840
And I realize, there's 25
things that I'd done to my mind

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.225
that, if they did
to their minds,

00:30:24.225 --> 00:30:25.850
they would truly have
a growth mindset.

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:28.600
So I write the Impact
Theory belief system out.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.510
It's the 25 things anyone
needs to believe and do,

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:35.200
in order to be able to manifest
their dreams-- to actually make

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.436
them come true.

00:30:36.436 --> 00:30:38.560
And then I started the
interview show and all that.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.630
And then, as I go
through this and realize

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:42.280
that the vast majority
of these people

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.380
do not respond to the message--

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.840
so think about how
many people really

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.240
respond when you just give
them the direct answer-- this

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.530
is how you do what I've done.

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:51.821
Most people, they don't listen.

00:30:51.821 --> 00:30:53.800
It's not entertaining
enough, right?

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.000
So they just ignore it.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.500
Like, I'll just
tell you, right now,

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:57.880
the secrets to the
universe-- anything

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.005
you've ever wanted to know.

00:30:59.005 --> 00:31:00.700
They've already been
written in a book.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.140
You literally don't
need anything else.

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:03.014
It's already written.

00:31:03.014 --> 00:31:05.800
If you were willing to
go out, read, research,

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.480
put in the work,
practice, test--

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.960
it's already all there.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.030
What people really
want is entertainment.

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:11.990
ERIC M. RUIZ: A story.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:15.032
TOM BILYEU: 100%-- so
I'm a big believer--

00:31:15.032 --> 00:31:16.240
don't try to change behavior.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.630
Try to leverage it.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:21.010
So if you said, Tom, you
have to change the world.

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:24.030
Would you rather leverage
people's reading behavior?

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:27.147
Or would you rather leverage
their viewing behavior?

00:31:27.147 --> 00:31:28.480
The answer to me is very simple.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.950
I'd rather control Netflix
than the Library of Congress,

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.290
if I want to make real change.

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:37.840
Because one is, on the surface,
just more entertaining.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.619
It's passive.

00:31:38.619 --> 00:31:39.910
You don't have to work as hard.

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:40.870
You don't have to flip pages.

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:42.579
You don't have to
face-- like, for me, I

00:31:42.579 --> 00:31:44.620
always had to face the
inadequacy of how slowly I

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:45.850
read.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:50.090
Whereas, movies-- it was a truly
emotive, emotional experience.

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:53.460
So when I started looking
at, OK, how do I really--

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:57.280
no bullshit!-- how do I change
the lives of these 1,000 people

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.580
or the hundreds of millions
of people that they represent?

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:03.340
How do I actually get them
to adopt a belief system?

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:04.509
The answer is narrative.

00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:05.800
ERIC M. RUIZ: Joseph Campbell--

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.490
TOM BILYEU: Joseph Campbell.

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:08.017
ERIC M. RUIZ: And
speaking of which,

00:32:08.017 --> 00:32:10.600
I love what you said about-- you
cannot change human behavior.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.641
You can only leverage it.

00:32:11.641 --> 00:32:13.300
It's written down right here.

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:16.055
And to go back to Campbell,
he said something that

00:32:16.055 --> 00:32:17.180
was super profound as well.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.888
He said, if you want
to change the world,

00:32:18.888 --> 00:32:20.240
you have to change the metaphor.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.198
And I think that's what
you guys are attempting

00:32:22.198 --> 00:32:25.690
to do with your structure, your
programs, and your interviews.

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:28.122
And to take this back
towards empowerment--

00:32:28.122 --> 00:32:29.830
and you and I discussed
this a little bit

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:31.180
before we got on stage.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.820
But I graduated in
2010, at the height

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.220
of the recession-- so a
very similar situation where

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.930
there are no jobs.

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:39.670
It's frustrating.

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:40.420
I'm angry.

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:40.930
I'm upset.

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:42.110
I can't rely on my
parents, because they're

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:43.810
in a worse situation than I am.

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:46.630
And you kind of descend
into this pit of hell

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:48.527
where you're angry,
you're frustrated--

00:32:48.527 --> 00:32:49.360
all of these things.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.120
And my question to you
is, I wonder, as well,

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.800
before you can take
the empowerment--

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.410
before you can own
up and say, actually,

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:58.150
I've got this or I can do this--

00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:00.460
if you have to go through
those trials and tribulations

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.667
before you can come back up.

00:33:01.667 --> 00:33:03.250
TOM BILYEU: I don't
think you have to.

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:05.830
But I think that
most people will need

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:08.080
that to be the thing that--

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.137
they find themselves
so profoundly unhappy

00:33:10.137 --> 00:33:12.220
that now they're moving
in the opposite direction.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:12.760
ERIC M. RUIZ: The rock bottom.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.830
TOM BILYEU: It's emotional
rock bottom-- exactly.

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:17.290
So it's not a
necessary component.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:19.600
I think there are people
that do it without it.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.650
But I think that, oftentimes,
the people that bounce back

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:25.150
the farthest in
the other direction

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:27.755
are the ones that hit hardest.

00:33:27.755 --> 00:33:29.380
ERIC M. RUIZ: And in
some of your shows

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.810
and our conversation, we've
talked about this idea

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:33.910
that it's all your fault.
And at first glance,

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:34.930
it sounds very mean.

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:37.060
Like, everything that
happens is your fault.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.400
But I think, behind it,
there's this nugget of wisdom

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.760
where, if you can train
yourself to keep things

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.950
within your realm of
control, you'll always

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:46.210
make the best of a situation.

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:48.668
I remember, when I was really
young and I fell off my bike,

00:33:48.668 --> 00:33:49.960
I wasn't wearing my knee pads.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.607
I was upset.

00:33:50.607 --> 00:33:51.190
And I was sad.

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:52.745
And my dad's first
reply was, well,

00:33:52.745 --> 00:33:54.370
who told you to ride
without knee pads?

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:56.860
Like, you were in control
of that situation.

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.507
And it sucks, at
first, to hear that.

00:33:58.507 --> 00:34:00.090
But in the long run,
it sort of builds

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:02.560
this resilience
and this capacity

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.700
to keep things within
your realm of control.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:08.440
Now, to bring this
back to a question,

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.810
Dr. Jordan Pearson would
argue that, when something

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:14.560
goes wrong, you start by
looking externally and seeing,

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.840
like, OK, what was I
actually responsible for?

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.252
And what happened outside
of my domain of control?

00:34:19.252 --> 00:34:20.710
Whereas I think,
perhaps, you and I

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:23.130
would agree that maybe it
should start internally.

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:25.329
OK, how was I
responsible for this?

00:34:25.329 --> 00:34:27.370
Was there anything I could
have done differently?

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:31.190
And only then look
outwards-- would you agree?

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:35.860
TOM BILYEU: Yeah, I think that
the reality is that I don't

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:37.270
care about what the reality is.

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:38.389
That's the truth.

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:41.320
And this is where I think
people get really hung up

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:47.139
with my message is, you're
not experiencing life

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:49.000
as it actually is.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.690
You're experiencing life through
three pounds of mush that is

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:55.770
a tri-layer brain
that is, first,

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:57.310
trying to keep you alive--

00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:59.800
so your most base
instincts in what

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.180
they call the lizard brain.

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:02.980
Then you've got the
mammalian brain layered

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:06.160
on top that's designed to give
you the emotions that you need

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.470
to move in a specific direction
with a lot of authority

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.690
and a lot of intent,
and then the thing that

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:12.700
makes you uniquely human,
the neocortex, which

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.580
allows you to
ignore, essentially,

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.290
those baser instincts.

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:22.600
But if you know something,
like, the deep limbic system--

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:26.660
when it's inflamed, it processes
data as being more negative.

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.034
So to give you an idea--

00:35:28.034 --> 00:35:29.950
and this is one of the
most fascinating things

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:31.210
about the brain.

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:34.520
As Shakespeare noted, there
is nothing good or bad,

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:36.362
but thinking makes it so.

00:35:36.362 --> 00:35:37.820
There's nothing
good or bad, right?

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:38.890
There is just stimulus.

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:40.240
And then there's a response.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:40.870
ERIC M. RUIZ: Things
happen, and then--

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:41.080
TOM BILYEU: Right.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:41.650
ERIC M. RUIZ: --we
give it a meaning.

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:43.180
TOM BILYEU: But
people think that it

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:44.890
is objectively a certain way.

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:47.590
So now, because they think it
is objectively a certain way,

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:50.050
they feel they are
supposed to react,

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:51.820
based on those emotions
that are getting

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:54.220
kicked up in their mind.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.020
What I'm saying
is, absolutely not.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.640
Those emotions
may not serve you.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.550
They're certainly not aimed at
moving you towards your goal

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:03.190
their job is to keep you
alive, plain and simple.

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:06.412
So that's not necessarily very
helpful in a modern context.

00:36:06.412 --> 00:36:08.620
So if you want to always be
moving towards your goal,

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:09.700
you want to be
optimized, you got

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.620
to learn to get control
of your emotions.

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:13.703
You've got to learn to
understand to tell yourself

00:36:13.703 --> 00:36:16.180
a narrative that isn't
predicated on necessarily

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.730
identifying what is objectively
true, because I don't think

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:20.410
that we experience
the world that way.

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:24.400
It's identifying, what's going
to work to get me to my goal?

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.890
And that, to me--

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:28.411
my whole thing is, goal first.

00:36:28.411 --> 00:36:30.160
Everything else works
backwards from that.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.618
ERIC M. RUIZ: Mm-hm,
like, starting

00:36:31.618 --> 00:36:33.540
from the grand strategy.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.290
Identifying it and
then building the steps

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:37.060
backwards-- to reverse
engineer it, essentially.

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:37.893
TOM BILYEU: Correct.

00:36:37.893 --> 00:36:41.080
So the reason I say
everything is my fault

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.217
and that I use those words
is, it's a litmus test.

00:36:43.217 --> 00:36:45.550
If you're still having an
emotional reaction to the word

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:47.680
"fault" and you feel
compelled to argue with me,

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.110
because you think that
I'm victim shaming--

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:52.750
it just tells me
immediately where

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:54.250
you are in your own journey.

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:56.200
Like, if you're
going to waste time

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.810
getting lost on the words you
don't like, instead of going,

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:02.050
is there a part of this
message that's usable for me,

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:04.380
yes or no?

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:06.640
Then it's a filtering mechanism.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.890
People that haven't gotten
past that first layer--

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:11.410
they first have to address
that, whether or not

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:12.952
they want to be
goal-oriented or not.

00:37:12.952 --> 00:37:14.243
ERIC M. RUIZ: Yeah, definitely.

00:37:14.243 --> 00:37:16.510
And like, I speak with
the college students

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:18.620
through tours or
intern programs.

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:22.450
And the thing that I really
try to convey to them

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:25.865
is, look, whatever happens,
there can be some good from it

00:37:25.865 --> 00:37:27.490
or some benefit
derived from it, if you

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:29.885
choose to look for that angle.

00:37:29.885 --> 00:37:32.024
I'm always reminded of
the stoic story of--

00:37:32.024 --> 00:37:33.940
I forget the philosopher's
name at the moment.

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:35.800
But he was involved
in a shipwreck.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.799
And his friends immediately
went to console him,

00:37:37.799 --> 00:37:39.070
to say, oh, what a shame.

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:40.986
We're so sorry that you
lost all these things.

00:37:40.986 --> 00:37:44.380
And his reply was,
essentially, lost?

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:45.070
I'm free now.

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:47.530
I'm not held down by
all of my possessions.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:49.630
This is fantastic news.

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:54.310
And so I think that that's
where a lot of our peers

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:57.460
get lost in-- is the
lack of realization

00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:59.960
that anything has a benefit,
if you can look at it that way.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.834
TOM BILYEU: And I'll
give you something else.

00:38:01.834 --> 00:38:03.610
And this is something
that I'm working on.

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:06.030
And so bear with me as
I stumble through this.

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:08.800
This is one of the most
important things for anybody

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.410
to realize.

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:16.330
And anybody that goes to that--
the world is working against

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:19.144
me-- like, that's
their default answer--

00:38:19.144 --> 00:38:20.560
what they have not
yet figured out

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.740
is that skills have utility--

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.451
skills have utility.

00:38:25.451 --> 00:38:26.950
There's something
in the way that we

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:30.460
educate that leads people
to believe that skills are

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:33.369
this temporary thing that's
merely meant to help you pass

00:38:33.369 --> 00:38:35.910
the test, to get the grade, to
get moved onto the next thing.

00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:38.020
And we've lost an
understanding--

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:39.700
certainly outside
of engineering--

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:40.720
that skill has utility.

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.220
And what I mean by
that is I believe

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.020
the very purpose of
life, the whole reason

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:46.580
that we're all here, is
to-- close your eyes.

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:50.470
Imagine a world, the world that
you want to become reality.

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:51.370
Open your eyes.

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:52.990
Go acquire the
skills you will need

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:54.310
to actually build that world.

00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:55.930
ERIC M. RUIZ: Mm-hm, embark
on your hero's journey.

00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:56.680
TOM BILYEU: Right.

00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:01.240
And it's, acquiring those
skills no longer is a metaphor.

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.890
You're actually getting skills
that allow you to do things.

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:06.346
And so people understand
skills in that context

00:39:06.346 --> 00:39:08.470
when they are an engineer,
because they know, well,

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:10.012
if I know this
programming language,

00:39:10.012 --> 00:39:11.470
then I can actually
write code that

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:13.210
can be executed in this way.

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:16.312
An architect-- if I learn
engineering principles,

00:39:16.312 --> 00:39:18.520
I can build buildings that
aren't going to fall down.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:19.660
They understand that.

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.460
But once you get
into the humanities,

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.580
people no longer think about,
oh, skills have utility.

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:26.410
Like, they actually
do something.

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:29.260
Like, if I'm a teacher,
I should really probably

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:31.261
learn about the developmental
cycle of children.

00:39:31.261 --> 00:39:31.760
Why?

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.070
Because I need to control them.

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:36.190
If I can get them quiet, paying
attention, in an optimal state

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:39.340
for information, then I can
make them better students.

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.416
That's the utility.

00:39:40.416 --> 00:39:42.040
Because of the things
that I'm learning

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.080
about how to get them to be
quiet and where I want them

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.150
and all that, I can get
them in their seats.

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.190
I can get them paying
attention, prime them.

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:49.773
Like, maybe what I
have to learn about

00:39:49.773 --> 00:39:53.230
is the correlation between
exercise and cognitive

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:54.580
optimization-- whatever it is.

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:56.164
But learning those skills--

00:39:56.164 --> 00:39:57.580
if you get really
good at that, it

00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:59.230
means your students
will walk out

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.600
of your classroom
better prepared,

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.050
better grades, more
knowledge, go on to do better.

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:08.540
Like, they found in the
Stanford marshmallow test,

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:13.050
the single most correlated
factor of success

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:15.510
is the ability to
delay gratification.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.010
Well, now, imagine
you're a teacher

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:19.740
and you learn to teach kids
how to delay gratification.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.570
That may be the single
most important thing

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:22.920
those kids will ever learn.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.660
And because you
learned that skill,

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.746
now that skill has
massive utility.

00:40:26.746 --> 00:40:28.620
But people don't approach
the world that way.

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.828
They're always looking for,
what's the broken system?

00:40:30.828 --> 00:40:32.700
And I'm saying,
forget about that.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:34.500
Figure out how to fix a system.

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:35.574
That-- fine.

00:40:35.574 --> 00:40:36.990
But don't waste
your energy trying

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:38.698
to figure out what's
broken in the system

00:40:38.698 --> 00:40:40.930
until you know how
to fix a system.

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:41.970
But most people don't.

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:43.980
They want to learn
how to squawk.

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:46.227
They want to go, I
know it's broken.

00:40:46.227 --> 00:40:48.060
Anybody can give you
that really cool speech

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.190
about how the current
education system was designed

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:51.450
to create factory workers.

00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:52.710
OK, we all know it.

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:54.150
But is anybody
fixing the system?

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.720
No.

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.886
And it's not going to get
fixed until somebody goes,

00:40:56.886 --> 00:41:00.300
I have to learn the very
nature of fixing systems.

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:02.850
That's the skill
I have to acquire.

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:06.450
And I know what its utility is
and then the expected outcome

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:07.540
in the real world.

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:10.410
So when I hear people
where their reaction is

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:14.310
to bitch about a problem--
like, you and I were talking.

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:16.590
You being Hispanic is
working against you.

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:18.180
Jason, you being an
African-American,

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.644
it's working against you.

00:41:19.644 --> 00:41:21.060
You're going to
have to go uphill.

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:22.210
But now what?

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:24.210
You going to sit and
complain about it?

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:25.710
Because it won't help you.

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:27.240
So if you have a goal--

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:30.240
it's like, it does suck that
women have to work harder

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.850
to get to the same place that,
as a white male in America,

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:33.760
I have to get to.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.140
But if it is true, if we're all
going to accept that it's true,

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:40.140
we can all sit there and go, we
need to focus on the systems--

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:40.650
fair enough.

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:42.360
And I'm glad that
some people do that.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.110
The other option,
though, is to say, well,

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:46.116
I completely control me.

00:41:46.116 --> 00:41:48.240
And the one thing I will
tell any human being alive

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:52.440
right now-- there is
always room for the best.

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:56.820
And once you're able, through
your skills that have utility,

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.360
to move somebody else
closer to their goal,

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.860
you will become a hot
commodity, no matter what--

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:04.790
no matter what!

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:06.080
Think about the scientists.

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.032
What were the scientists
after World War II?

00:42:08.032 --> 00:42:09.740
Right before they were
scientists for us,

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:11.000
they were Nazis.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.105
But we were way happy
to let go of that,

00:42:13.105 --> 00:42:14.105
because they had crazy--

00:42:14.105 --> 00:42:14.360
ERIC M. RUIZ: Yeah, yeah.

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.151
TOM BILYEU: --skills
that we needed, right?

00:42:16.151 --> 00:42:19.407
So really what it comes down
to is, what are your skills?

00:42:19.407 --> 00:42:21.740
If you've got skills that can
be used to build something

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.840
beautiful, to do something
wonderful to the world,

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.700
to help people move
towards their goals,

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:28.587
that will excite the masses,
because they want that thing

00:42:28.587 --> 00:42:30.920
that you're going to create--
that it's going to improve

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.065
people's lives--

00:42:33.065 --> 00:42:35.190
but only thing that mattered
in all of that was you

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:36.720
got really good at something.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.910
And somewhere along
the way, we lost

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:40.590
that the punch line
is, no matter what

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:42.840
you do to the system, you--

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:48.360
you, as an individual-- need to
get extraordinary at something.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.310
And so my encouragement
to people is,

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:52.050
go get extraordinary.

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:54.570
Don't worry about whether
the system is broken or not.

00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:56.420
We built Quest, a
$1 billion company,

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.980
in less than five years, coming
out of the Great Recession.

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:03.611
So what was it?

00:43:03.611 --> 00:43:05.860
More millionaires were created
in the Great Depression

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.880
than any other time in history?

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.385
It just comes down
to somebody goes--

00:43:11.385 --> 00:43:13.260
honestly, this is how
I react-- the system is

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:14.380
too big and complicated.

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:17.799
I'm too afraid to try to get
caught up in fixing that.

00:43:17.799 --> 00:43:18.840
I'm too big of a chicken.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.560
There, I just said it.

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.520
I'm too big of a chicken
to deal with that.

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.830
But I can deal with myself.

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:25.230
I can go get extraordinary.

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:26.256
So focus on that.

00:43:26.256 --> 00:43:27.130
Go get extraordinary.

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:29.040
Go become the best of--

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.360
whatever it is you want to be.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.250
But go become the best of it.

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:34.140
And see how the
world opens to you.

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:35.140
ERIC M. RUIZ: I love it.

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:35.620
I love it.

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.161
And also, it gets
much more difficult

00:43:37.161 --> 00:43:39.480
and, I would argue, noble
to work on yourself,

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:41.640
as opposed to bitching
or complaining

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.980
about an esoteric system,
which is very loosely defined,

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:45.563
depending on who
you're speaking with.

00:43:45.563 --> 00:43:47.620
And I think that's
where we're at.

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:49.261
And that's how I
think we can empower

00:43:49.261 --> 00:43:51.510
individuals to become the
best versions of themselves.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:53.330
Because then, in
doing that, they

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:55.180
help their communities,
their cities

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:56.910
and, hopefully, the world.

00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:58.140
TOM BILYEU: Totally agree.

00:43:58.140 --> 00:43:58.320
ERIC M. RUIZ: Awesome.

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.000
Tom, we have a lot
more to talk about.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.510
And unfortunately, we're
very limited on time.

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:03.676
So I want to open up to
questions from the audience.

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:06.951
Mr.--

00:44:06.951 --> 00:44:09.256
AUDIENCE: Actually, this
question is to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:09.256 --> 00:44:10.797
ERIC M. RUIZ: Here,
you want the mic?

00:44:10.797 --> 00:44:11.615
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:44:11.615 --> 00:44:12.010
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:12.843
ERIC M. RUIZ: Boom--

00:44:12.843 --> 00:44:13.590
look at that.

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:14.460
AUDIENCE: Check,
check-- all right.

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:14.700
Perfect.

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:16.170
ERIC M. RUIZ: My Derek
Carr impersonation--

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:18.180
AUDIENCE: So this question
actually just popped

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:21.730
into my head while you were
talking, because I totally--

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:24.190
as fanboy-ish as it sounds,
I'm just put it out there.

00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:27.050
I 1,000% agree with
everything you've said.

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:29.370
And then, I thought
about, when you said,

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:31.420
just go be extraordinary.

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:34.620
And I'm curious to
myself, because I'd also

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:37.380
agree with the idea that human
beings can be extraordinary

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.390
at, literally,
anything and all things

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:41.320
that we haven't
even thought of yet.

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:44.310
So when you set out on your
quest to become extraordinary,

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:46.710
and when you set on your
quest to become extraordinary,

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:50.490
was it just, let me become
extraordinary in general?

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:52.350
Or did you actually
focus on, I'm

00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:54.210
going to become
extraordinary at this.

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:56.850
And final question-- what
do you consider yourself

00:44:56.850 --> 00:44:59.067
to be extraordinary at?

00:44:59.067 --> 00:45:00.900
TOM BILYEU: Awesome--
so I don't think there

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:02.760
is "extraordinary in general."

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:05.730
And my biggest lament--

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:09.360
my biggest heartbreak-- is
that every entrepreneur,

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:13.420
to a person without exception,
will come to me and say, OK.

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:14.850
I've got this vision.

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:15.840
I've got my mission.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.710
It's crystal clear-- my
business plan-- ready to rock.

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:21.900
And as you begin to push
and poke, you'll realize,

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.700
they have no clarity whatsoever.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.840
And the best analogy
is someone will--

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:28.290
and this is how the
entrepreneurs approach me.

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:29.730
I want to win a gold medal.

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:31.140
And they think
the fact that they

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.370
want to win a gold
medal is clarity, man--

00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:34.590
that they've got it unlocked.

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:35.850
And I'm like, awesome.

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:37.230
In the Olympics?

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:38.250
Yes, in the Olympics?

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:39.150
OK, cool.

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:41.030
Summer or winter games?

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.550
Summer.

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:43.060
OK, fantastic.

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:43.980
Tennis?

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:44.580
No.

00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:45.190
Swimming?

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.690
Yes.

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:47.250
OK, great.

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:48.300
The medley?

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:49.650
The backstroke?

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:53.490
Until you get down to the very
specific event in which you

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:57.600
want to win that gold medal,
you don't know how to train.

00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:59.770
Then that's where
it becomes an issue.

00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:02.520
So somebody wants to be
extraordinary in general--

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:03.720
how do you train?

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:04.920
What does that mean?

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.290
So I need to know exactly,
what do you want to do?

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:11.430
So for me, the thing that I
want-- and I won't say that I'm

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:13.080
yet extraordinary in anything.

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:14.790
And that's a very stoic stance.

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:16.224
And hopefully,
everybody takes it.

00:46:16.224 --> 00:46:17.640
Like, the more you
learn, the more

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.790
you realize you have to learn.

00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:25.770
So the thing that I'm committed
to becoming extraordinary at

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:28.610
is telling stories
that change people

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:31.420
at the belief system level.

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:34.500
So that's my goal, where
I'm just entertaining them.

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:36.840
They don't know that
anything else is happening.

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:40.680
But that a generation or two
generations from now, nobody

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.457
would think to tell their
kids anything other than,

00:46:43.457 --> 00:46:44.790
everything is your fault, Timmy.

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:46.452
Come on, you know better.

00:46:46.452 --> 00:46:47.910
At the end of the
day, your life is

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:49.200
a reflection of your choices.

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.140
And they won't even remember
that it was Jiminy Cricket

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:55.560
style character that told
Pinocchio that in a movie

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:56.460
that I made.

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:58.060
They just have the
words to repeat.

00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:59.140
It's that belief system.

00:46:59.140 --> 00:46:59.930
It's baked in.

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:02.336
It's part of the
cultural subconscious.

00:47:02.336 --> 00:47:03.460
We're all talking about it.

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:05.250
We all respond to
each other that way.

00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:09.090
So that when somebody is, woe
is me, we don't feed into that.

00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:11.190
When somebody is saying,
oh, the system is broken,

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:12.480
we immediately go, rad.

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:13.600
What do we do about it?

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:14.430
How do we fix it?

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:17.100
What skill do we
need to go repair it?

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:20.006
But that's not the public
discourse right now.

00:47:20.006 --> 00:47:22.380
The public discourse right
now is, you're victim shaming.

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:23.280
No, I'm not.

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.990
I don't want them
to be a victim.

00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:26.820
You're going to be
victimized in your life.

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.300
Of this, I promise you.

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:31.140
But you decide whether or
not you're a victim, which

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:33.700
is a state-of-being.

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:37.800
So all of those things right
now are hotly contested.

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.380
What I want to do,
through entertainment,

00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:43.170
is just make it
patently obvious how

00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:44.910
we should all be
thinking and acting

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:46.912
to make our dreams come true.

00:47:46.912 --> 00:47:48.870
So that's the thing I
want to be extraordinary.

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:51.910
And then, I think there was
one more part to that question.

00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:55.135
AUDIENCE: So the
question is loaded.

00:47:55.135 --> 00:47:56.010
Well, actually, know.

00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:58.055
You answered both, because
it's a two-part question.

00:47:58.055 --> 00:47:58.390
TOM BILYEU: Perfect.

00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:00.480
AUDIENCE: What did you set
out to be extraordinary at?

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.438
What do you consider
yourself extraordinary at?

00:48:02.438 --> 00:48:05.940
And then what are your
comments on seeking

00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:07.800
to be extraordinary in general.

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:10.810
TOM BILYEU: When I think about,
what is the meaning of life?--

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:13.350
I really believe,
nature made a choice

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:14.910
with every creature it creates.

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:17.250
And it, essentially, is a
bifurcated path-- number

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:20.010
one is, I'm going to preload
you with all the algorithms.

00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:23.330
We call them intuition
or your instincts.

00:48:23.330 --> 00:48:24.930
And so you come with instincts.

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:27.810
And like, a horse foal, when
it comes out, it can walk.

00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:28.440
It can run.

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:28.980
It can jump.

00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:30.060
It can feed.

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:32.430
A human baby, on the other
hand, when it's born,

00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:33.810
is a lump of flesh.

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:35.226
It poos in its own diapers.

00:48:35.226 --> 00:48:36.600
You could lay it
next to a bottle

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.310
and it would still
starve to death.

00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:39.840
We are completely dependent.

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:41.520
Because what we want
to do is actually

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:45.360
finish the maturing of
the brain on the outside,

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:48.780
in the stimulus to which
we need to become adapted.

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:52.800
So the reason that humans
have become the ultimate apex

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.560
predator, unlike anything
this world has ever

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.930
seen before ever, is
our ability to adapt.

00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:01.680
Now, if you believe
that adaptation

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:04.260
is the absolute core
of what makes us great,

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:06.990
it is our defining
characteristic,

00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:08.490
then it becomes a
question of, well,

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:10.350
how does nature
make sure that we

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:11.610
do what nature wants us to do?

00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:13.650
So if nature wants
us to adapt, it's

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:15.300
going to make it pleasurable.

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:17.910
So when you think about
what humans really want,

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:21.690
I think it's a deep and
lasting sense of fulfillment.

00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:23.850
It's the happiness that lasts.

00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:27.480
It's the non-transient, "bowl
of ice cream style" happiness.

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.490
And it's the, I
just saved somebody

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:31.020
from a burning building.

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:34.460
It's the, I have helped
these children's lives.

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:35.910
They're going to
go and be better.

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:37.050
It's things like
that that make you

00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:39.045
feel good about who you
are as a human being

00:49:39.045 --> 00:49:40.542
and what your contributions are.

00:49:40.542 --> 00:49:42.000
That actually comes
from suffering.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.210
It comes from working hard.

00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:45.390
It comes from putting in
that effort, because that's

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:47.700
what you have to do to adapt.

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.110
You adapt to a stressor.

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:50.430
You adapt to pain.

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:51.960
You adapt to difficulty.

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:54.960
You get stronger under
heavier and heavier weight.

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.340
That's how it works.

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:59.250
That's just the call
and answer of nature.

00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:04.230
So that process is
intensely pleasurable,

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:05.700
in the sense of fulfillment.

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:07.500
So going out and
doing the hard things

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:08.880
to see how much
of your potential

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.890
you can actuate--
pursuing greatness

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:13.080
in a very specific
direction-- is,

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:16.570
I believe, the only thing
that will make people happy.

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:20.310
So when I look at depression,
anxiety, all on the rise,

00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:21.926
all rampant--
people feeling lost,

00:50:21.926 --> 00:50:24.300
not knowing what they want to
do, where they want to be--

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:27.210
the answer is, decide
you're going to be

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:28.890
extraordinary at something.

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:30.870
Because it gives you more
energy than it takes.

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:31.760
And there's a whole process.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.093
I'm not going to go into it now.

00:50:33.093 --> 00:50:35.250
But get that thing in your life.

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:37.890
And then go after it with
everything you have--

00:50:37.890 --> 00:50:40.500
with total disregard
for balance--

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.600
that you pour yourself
into it, in a way.

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:45.030
You give yourself over to it.

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:47.490
And I think we have
one more bifurcation.

00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:51.210
You've got the family, which
provides a similar sense

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:52.830
of deep fulfillment.

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:55.080
And I think that's a
perfectly valid choice.

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:57.420
And if you don't hear
the incongruous nature

00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:00.540
with what I'm saying, I'm
not saying it very well.

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.510
But those are the two paths
that I see humans go on.

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:05.197
People that are
parents, they really--

00:51:05.197 --> 00:51:07.530
the kid was born-- changed
my life perspective-- totally

00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:08.030
done, right?

00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:10.920
Like, you know the
talk and how it feels.

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:14.190
And then on this side, you've
got an equal lack of balance--

00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:16.350
all in-- totally
committed-- do or die.

00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:19.140
I would give myself over to
this thing that I'm building.

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:20.192
And that's where I'm at.

00:51:20.192 --> 00:51:21.400
I've chosen not to have kids.

00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:22.780
It's not the path I'm on.

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:24.670
But I've given myself
over in a similar way.

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:28.647
And I get a similar sense
of deep fulfillment.

00:51:28.647 --> 00:51:29.480
ERIC M. RUIZ: Great.

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:30.170
AUDIENCE: Great, thank you.

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:31.295
TOM BILYEU: Yeah, for sure.

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:40.180
AUDIENCE: In terms of
adopting this growth mindset

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:43.020
or just developing
yourself as an individual,

00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:48.330
how big of a role would you say
is managing your relationships?

00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:51.010
And how important is it
that people around you

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:54.060
adopt, more or less, the same
mindset or support this mindset

00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:55.710
that you're adopting?

00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:58.230
TOM BILYEU: So you're now
poking me in my soft underbelly.

00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:01.800
Which I appreciate you
asking the hard questions.

00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:06.000
As a CEO, it is
ridiculously important

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.176
to make sure that your
team is on this page,

00:52:08.176 --> 00:52:10.050
that they are totally
bought in, that they're

00:52:10.050 --> 00:52:12.270
thinking the same way
and acting the same way.

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:16.410
Otherwise, your culture begins
to fragment and get toxic.

00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:18.910
As a person just
out in the world,

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:21.644
it's amazing to surround
yourself with other people that

00:52:21.644 --> 00:52:22.310
think like that.

00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:24.150
Because they're going
to reinforce it in you.

00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:26.441
And that's such a beautiful
thing to have in your life.

00:52:26.441 --> 00:52:29.100
And they're going to push you
and escalate you to be better.

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:33.420
But also, as an individual, no
one should be able to stop you.

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:37.530
And so whether you're working
in a toxic environment or not

00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:39.420
and everybody else
acts like a dumb ass--

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:41.950
like, when people come to me
and they write in and say,

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:43.450
hey, I'm working
in an environment--

00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:44.410
because I'm a huge believer.

00:52:44.410 --> 00:52:46.743
If you guys have read Ray
Dalio's "Principles," read it.

00:52:46.743 --> 00:52:47.942
It's incredible.

00:52:47.942 --> 00:52:49.650
But every time I
recommend it to somebody

00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:51.275
that works in a
company where I imagine

00:52:51.275 --> 00:52:53.740
the culture, for one person
to change, would be so hard,

00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:55.175
I do have little pangs of guilt.

00:52:55.175 --> 00:52:56.050
But here's the truth.

00:52:56.050 --> 00:52:59.220
You could put me in any
organization in the world.

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:02.820
And the strategy that I would
adopt, if I wanted to move up

00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:04.800
and I wanted to
change the culture,

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.990
would be to become
useful to other people

00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:08.880
with no need to get the credit.

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:12.724
Because secretly, I
know, deep down inside,

00:53:12.724 --> 00:53:15.390
when people steal from you, they
know they're stealing from you.

00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:16.931
Not that they're
going to feel guilt.

00:53:16.931 --> 00:53:20.130
I don't need them to feel guilt.
I want them to be terrified

00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:22.075
of losing proximity to me.

00:53:22.075 --> 00:53:23.700
Which now, all the
sudden, means people

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.220
begin to orbit around me,
because I'm helping their life.

00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:28.770
Then, all the sudden,
it's just, oh,

00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:31.020
why is everybody
orbiting around him?

00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:32.430
They're always turning to him.

00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:34.740
And you ever notice,
everybody knows.

00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:38.820
If I took whoever is
running a meeting,

00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:40.650
suddenly, there'll
be a second person

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:42.990
that all eyes will
start going to.

00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:46.170
And that person is the
unofficial leader of the group.

00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:48.424
And I would immediately,
as fast as I could--

00:53:48.424 --> 00:53:51.090
by giving value to other people,
by not caring about getting any

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:54.150
credit for my own ideas, but
pumping out ideas at a more

00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:56.640
rapid pace, by
being extraordinary,

00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:59.400
by making sure that I'm better
than this at everyone else,

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.770
by being more prepared,
by putting in more work--

00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:02.730
all of that--

00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:05.580
that people would begin
to rotate around me.

00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:07.830
It's a longer strategy.

00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:11.430
But in that situation, now
you've got a lot of cloud

00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:12.070
with people.

00:54:12.070 --> 00:54:14.646
And so when you say, I don't
do that, I don't steal ideas,

00:54:14.646 --> 00:54:16.020
all the sudden,
then people would

00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:18.350
start to feel guilty about
stealing ideas from you.

00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:20.100
You start to see a
shift slowly over time.

00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:22.560
So I won't over-answer your
question, which I've already

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:23.850
gotten real dangerous to.

00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:24.630
I'll stop there.

00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:26.340
But I'm really,
really fascinated

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:28.980
about antagonistic
group dynamics

00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:32.310
and how to change them by
being the unchangeable,

00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:34.500
of just, like, having
a true north about what

00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:36.660
your ethics are and just
always being true to it.

00:54:43.232 --> 00:54:44.690
AUDIENCE: So I was
wondering if you

00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:49.070
could talk a little bit
about clarifying your goals

00:54:49.070 --> 00:54:51.200
and what you're chasing,
and how much of that

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.337
is just choosing something
and committing to it

00:54:53.337 --> 00:54:54.920
and going after it,
and how much of it

00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:57.025
is really a process of
figuring out what you want

00:54:57.025 --> 00:55:00.170
and chipping away at that
and getting very clear on it

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:01.740
through some internal process.

00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:03.240
TOM BILYEU: Here's
the amazing part.

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:05.720
You've actually already
answered the questions.

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:07.880
And most people only get 1/2.

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:10.190
So it really is both
of what you just said.

00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:13.760
You need to do the work,
first, of being like,

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:16.070
what do I really want?

00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:17.815
And so now, I'll walk
through the process

00:55:17.815 --> 00:55:19.190
that I alluded to
a couple times.

00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:20.970
So passion is not a
lightning rod moment.

00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:22.970
It is not something that's
hiding inside of you.

00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:24.140
It is a process.

00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:27.020
You're an architect,
not an archeologist.

00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:28.700
So what you're going
to do is you're

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:30.860
going to go experience
a whole lot of stuff.

00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:33.080
And Kevin Kelly, the
founder of Wired magazine,

00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:36.800
talks about not
prematurely optimizing.

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:38.760
And I think that
that's so important.

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:40.820
So in life, if you
don't have a passion,

00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:42.680
you want to go experience
a lot of things,

00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:45.279
with almost total disregard
for what that might be.

00:55:45.279 --> 00:55:47.570
When you encounter something
that you find interesting,

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:49.472
engage with it more.

00:55:49.472 --> 00:55:50.930
As you engage with
it, see, is this

00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:52.390
turning into a real fascination?

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:54.056
If it's turning into
a real fascination,

00:55:54.056 --> 00:55:55.920
then ask yourself a
very simple question.

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:59.900
Do I want to become the
greatest in the world at this?

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:01.220
And if the answer is, yes--

00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:03.710
if the thought of that
fills you with excitement--

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:06.140
winning that gold medal
or designing that thing

00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:07.810
or whatever-- you
think, oh my god!

00:56:07.810 --> 00:56:08.930
That would be amazing!

00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:10.370
And the thought of actually
putting in that work's

00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:11.300
kind of cool--

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:13.340
like, I want to
develop that skill set,

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:15.860
now you're going to go down
the path of gaining mastery.

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:19.580
And I'm stealing
this from a guy named

00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:23.570
Cal Newport in a book called
"So Good They Can't Ignore You."

00:56:23.570 --> 00:56:26.600
And I think that
passion is like love.

00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:28.610
I don't believe that
there is one-sided love.

00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:30.230
I think that's infatuation.

00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:32.114
Love is where you're
in a real relationship.

00:56:32.114 --> 00:56:33.030
There's give and take.

00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:33.946
There's vulnerability.

00:56:33.946 --> 00:56:36.380
There's all the things
that make real love

00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:39.470
this beautiful interplay of
two brains that are actually

00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:42.390
in sync, as in, you can
see it in an fMRI scanner.

00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:44.000
It's really crazy.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.230
That's love.

00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:47.720
Infatuation is the
stage before that.

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:51.070
So you don't know if you
have a passion for something

00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:52.570
until you're gaining
mastery, you're

00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:55.670
sincerely pursuing becoming
the best in the world at that.

00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:57.160
And those skills have utility.

00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:59.300
And as you put that
utility to the test,

00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:01.190
in service of something
bigger than yourself,

00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:03.350
helping other people,
you will get energy

00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:05.120
from that, as a social
creature, knowing,

00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:06.454
I've worked my ass off for this.

00:57:06.454 --> 00:57:07.536
Greeks have a name for it.

00:57:07.536 --> 00:57:08.450
It's called "techne."

00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:10.400
I've work my ass off
for this set of skills.

00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:11.960
And it actually
helps other people.

00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.043
And it makes me feel good.

00:57:13.043 --> 00:57:14.180
And I'm contributing.

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:16.332
And so that thing, where
I show up every day

00:57:16.332 --> 00:57:18.290
and, technically, I'm at
work, but I'm actually

00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:20.331
building something that's
helping people and that

00:57:20.331 --> 00:57:21.500
makes me feel really good--

00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:23.880
one, it's hard and I'm
pushing myself and I love it

00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:24.950
and it's interesting.

00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:27.530
And then, on the other
hand, it actually helps--

00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:29.360
and it's that dope interplay.

00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:31.300
Now, where people get stuck is--

00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:35.960
we were just talking about this
before we started the talk--

00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:38.160
most people are
standing in that room.

00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:41.090
They've got 1,000 things
they're interested in.

00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:43.616
They can't bring themselves to
shut any one of those doors.

00:57:43.616 --> 00:57:45.740
And because they don't shut
any one of those doors,

00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:48.410
they never walk through
the one remaining door.

00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:52.430
And so I always tell people,
your job is to shut doors.

00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:54.320
Literally, the
word "decide" means

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:57.200
to close, break it up, in Latin.

00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:58.340
Or to cut-- excuse me.

00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:00.720
It means to cut--
cut something out.

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:04.314
So you're cutting out
the 999 other options

00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:05.480
and going with just the one.

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:07.521
And if you have to do it
at random and just shut,

00:58:07.521 --> 00:58:10.280
blindly, 999 doors, fine.

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:11.290
Go through that one.

00:58:11.290 --> 00:58:13.176
See, is it a fascination or not?

00:58:13.176 --> 00:58:14.300
And if it's not, come back.

00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:16.920
Open a new one and move.

00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:20.710
The only thing that's really
going to ruin you as a person

00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:22.050
is indecision.

00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:24.170
It's the only thing
you should fear.

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:25.610
ERIC M. RUIZ: Well, guys,
thank you so much for joining.

00:58:25.610 --> 00:58:26.840
Tom, thank you for coming by.

00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:27.320
TOM BILYEU: Thanks
for having me.

00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:27.700
It was great.

00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:28.510
ERIC M. RUIZ: It was a
pleasure and a privilege.

00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:29.390
Yeah, thank you.

00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:30.348
TOM BILYEU: Absolutely.

00:58:30.348 --> 00:58:32.440
