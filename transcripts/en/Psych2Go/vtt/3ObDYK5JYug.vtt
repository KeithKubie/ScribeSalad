00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.460
[Intro]

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.900
Anyone who has attemped to foray into the great wide word of dating

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.040
knows that, when it comes to flirting,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.060
cheesy pickup lines just don't cut it.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.320
Attracting a partner can be tricky,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.840
and there are many pitfalls one can fall into.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.860
But when it comes down do it,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:36.040
flirting is just an evolutionary tactic to acquire a mate for reproduction.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.620
With this in mind,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.380
here's a list of 10 psychologically proven flirting strategies

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.180
that actually work!

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.200
Number 10: Eye Contact.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.500
Eye contact is key when it comes to desmonstrating your attraction to another person.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.080
When we make eye contact with a prospective partner,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.800
we are actually searching for evidence of their attraction to us

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.120
through the psychological response of pupil dilation.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.220
This is also why staring into one another's eyes can often feels so intimate.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.920
Therefore, one of the best ways to let someone know you're interested in them

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.380
is to gave into their big brown, blue or green eyes.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.620
Number 9: Wear red.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.540
Not only is red an eye catching color that flatters many different skin tones,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.340
red is also a symbol of lust and sexuality.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.760
with studies showing that, when both men and women wear red,

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.140
they appear more attractive to the opposite sex.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.540
This may be due to social expectations.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.120
However, psychologist Adam Pasteur suggests

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.620
that our attraction to red may be a hangover from humans evolutionary past,

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.800
as animals, such as female baboons,

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.960
display patches of bright red skin to indicate that they are ready to mate.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.020
Number Eight: Be funny!

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.940
Humor is actually a huge factor in the search of a potential mate.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.320
University of New Mexico psychologist professor Jeffrey Miller

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.500
suggests that being funny is one of key ways we decide how attractive a partner is.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.500
This is because, to be truly funny,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.880
someone must be able to think quickly and be creative,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.440
skills that are extremely necessary for survival.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.980
To be humorous is to be smart,

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.400
so telling a joke could just result in you getting that date you wanted.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.620
Number Seven: play hard to get.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.900
Studies show that when we're unsure of how much someone likes us,

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.840
we actually like them more than when we're told they like us a lot.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.340
This could be due to the fact that playing hard to get

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.100
make someone seem more desirable and sometimes even out of our league.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.060
When someone seems too needy, we're likely to believe we can do better,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.140
so it may be better to act aloof.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.420
Number Six: are you a woman? Smile!

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.760
Not only it does a smile exhibit a sense of humor and a caring nature,

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.000
but it also displays a good health.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.060
Research from the University of British Columbia

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.960
suggests men find smilling women more attractive than prideful,

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.300
possibly because of its association with submission

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.580
and maternal urges.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.200
Number Five: are you a man? Brood.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.000
The stereotype is true!

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.740
In the same study from the University of British Columbia,

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.300
researchers found that women rated smilling men

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.680
as the least attractive compared with prideful and shameful looking men.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.920
Therefore, acting like a "bad boy" may win you a mate,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.820
regardless of whether you're actually bad or not.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.640
Number Four: mirror body language.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.020
55% of attraction communication is made through body language,

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.740
and one of the most subtle,

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.560
yet most effective methods of flirting with someone is to mirror their actions.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.760
This is because we unconsciously copy those we're attracted to

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.120
as a sign we're interested in what they're saying.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.620
Mirroring someone demonstrates that we have good communication skills

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.060
but also that we're invested in their thoughts and feelings.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.500
This is also a way of knowing whether someone is interested in you.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.060
If they copy your mirroring,

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.480
they may just reciprocate your feelings.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.860
Number Three: Be a smooth talker.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.460
Pitch and tone actually have a lot more to do with flirting than one may think.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.020
Research from MIT suggests that men are more attracted to women that

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.680
vary their tone at which they speak.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.980
Women whose voices went up and down in frequency

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.640
received more romantic interest from men than those who speak with a flatter tone.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.840
The same study also found that women were more attracted to men who

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.200
interjected when they were speaking with phrases

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.520
such as "I see", "Okay", and "Yup".

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.220
This not only suggests dominance but also understanding.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.900
Number Two: Confidence is key.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.720
A study by Doctor Monica Moore of Webster University

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.460
found that, when observing real-life person in bars and shoppings malls,

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.720
it was not the most physically appealing people

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.820
that were most often approached for flirtation.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.280
Instead, those who signal their confidence through

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.280
basic flirting techniques, such as smiling, were more likely to attract others.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.940
And, Number One: Touch them.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.480
Most research has demonstrated that

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.280
touching a person can increase their compliance to complete a wide variety of requests,

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.400
and this may extend to the world of flirtation!

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:23.240
Dr. Moore found that when a young male confederate in a nightclub asked young women to dance with him,

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.720
his request was most likely to be followed if

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.180
he touched a woman's forearm for one to two seconds.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.960
This could be because tactile contact is associated with dominance.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.680
Later, when the women were asked to complete a survey about their experience,

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.480
a high score of dominance was associated with the tactile contact!

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.100
And that's our list.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.660
Hopefully this can help you in the dating world.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.880
