00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.420
So last question, we knew the slope and
we knew the y intercept, and

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.200
we got the equation of the line.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.450
Let's try going the other way.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.150
I want to know what's the slope

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.870
of the line described by the equation Y
equals 3x- 7 and to your answer here.
