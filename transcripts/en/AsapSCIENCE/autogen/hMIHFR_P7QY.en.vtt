00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.040
 Poop 

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.620
 Most of us will not think about where they will go after washing. 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.160
 But if I tell you what is very convenient 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.520
 May be going back to your house 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.140
 In case you didn't notice it? 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.800
 Unfamiliar for those 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.360
 Once your food has been chewed and swallowed, it is chemically broken down, 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.280
 After the useful nutrients are absorbed by your body, 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.140
 The rest is elegantly discarded as waste 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.140
 These wastes 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.140
 Mix with a mixture of urine, rain, shower, wash basin 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.140
 And other family waters to the local 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.140
 Sewer system, surprisingly 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.140
 Mainly contains water and relative 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.140
 Small stool, like a big old 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.140
 Bowl of soup with very few vegetables 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.140
 Passing a few miles 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.140
 After the potential tube, the soup reaches 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.140
 Sewage treatment plant, and preliminary screening 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.140
 Separated from degreasing 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.140
 Things like sand, gravel and pebbles. 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.380
 More importantly, this is a mobile phone that says you are not careful. 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.440
 Was caught with a condom? And other things that you think are thrown into the toilet is a good idea. 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.080
 By the way, this is not a good idea. 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.300
 For every piece of rubbish or item you throw the toilet down 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.180
 The more likely it is blocked in the system, it will be removed 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.900
 And have to use the hand.. 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.140
 No one wants this. 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.140
 Pebbles and grit, on the other hand, are 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.580
 Drying, cleaning, recycling like building 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.640
 May help create 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.460
 Your ivory throne. 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.620
 Then the remaining stool mixture is allowed to stand 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.900
 In a huge water river. 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.960
 And benefit from the fundamental nature of both sides 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.960
 Oils and greases such as non-polar substances, 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.740
 Not mixed with water, 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.740
 It is easier to skim them. 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.740
 However, you really shouldnâ€™t 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.740
 It has nothing to lose because it may block the pipeline 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.740
 And overwhelming complex systems. 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.740
 Now there is some silt and the rest. 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.980
 A stinky liquid that looks like chocolate milk. 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.880
 Well, chocolate milk! 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.040
 This is how it tastes like millions of bacteria 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.880
 This is a set of loose and feasting 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.340
 mixture. They are really eating pathogens 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.600
 Liquid 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.600
 Most of these bacteria are aerobic, 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600
 This means they need oxygen to work, 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.860
 Just like humans, 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.860
 So the river is full of oxygen. 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.720
 Then the water is sterilized and 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.860
 Put it back in the environment. 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.560
 On the other hand, excess sludge, 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.560
 Mainly containing solid waste, 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.560
 After final processing with another group 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.560
 Bacteria. These bacteria produce 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.560
 Various by-products, including methane 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.560
 Gas, which is used again for power 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.560
 Sewage treatment plant. 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.340
 So your poop increases the power of the plants, they 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.000
 Handle your poop. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 After eating everything, the bacteria died 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.020
 And build some that are called biosolids. 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.700
 After all said that, 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.000
 The rest, nutrient-rich feces and biosolids 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 Can be used to make compost 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Rich in dry land, or used as fertilizer, 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.220
 This ultimately helps to increase vegetation. 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.220
 Vegetation, this vegetation uses its way 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.220
 Came to your home and eventually 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.320
 To your mouth. 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.320
 Start the cycle of feces again, 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.340
 Come back from the beginning 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.000
