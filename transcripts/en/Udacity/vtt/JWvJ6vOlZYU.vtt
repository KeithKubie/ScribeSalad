00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.120
Welcome back. We have good news and bad news.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.560
The bad news first is that this is the last

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.730
lesson in the course. The good news though this is

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.050
going to be the most awesome lesson in the course.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.940
&gt;&gt; So to recap what we've learned so far.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.400
&gt;&gt; In lesson one we talked about what

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.410
is UX and the difference between UI and UX.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.510
&gt;&gt; In lesson two we talked the user centered

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.600
design process and got into personas and use cases.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.820
&gt;&gt; In lesson three, we talked about the mobile

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.800
user and talked about different mobile user constraints. Yeah and lesson four

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.430
we are going to talk about not about constraints but about the capabilities

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.020
that are unlocked by mobile and the amazing things that you can do

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.090
on Android to blow your users minds and create amazing five star applications.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.990
&gt;&gt; So Nazmul, everybody wants to know.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.600
&gt;&gt; How do we get closer to making five star apps. That's a good

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.760
question. First, we're going to understand the

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.890
amazing capabilities that Android platform has to offer.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.540
Then, we're going to imagine how to use these capabilities

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.600
to create some really kick ass features for your apps

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.240
and through all this we're going to learn that context

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.030
is what helps us deliver five star applications to our users.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.220
&gt;&gt; So, Nazmul what do you mean by context? So context

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.590
is all about a user and what they're doing in a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.410
physical environment when they're interacting

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.400
with your application. Now, before we

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.540
get to the details of what context is made up of.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.920
You're probably a web and desktop developer, so

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.100
let's talk about the difference between the Android

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.540
platform and web and desktop. There's some fundamental

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.520
similarities between web/desktop and mobile machines. I mean after

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.420
all, they actually collect data from input sources

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.280
they process that information and they produce output.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.040
So what are some of the inputs do

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.250
you think that are similar between web/desk and Android?

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.660
&gt;&gt; Well they both have keyboards and you can enter information that way.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.610
&gt;&gt; And they also

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.860
both have pointing devices.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.780
&gt;&gt; And they both have a network connection. Yeah they're a

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.960
lot of similarity of input sources but the power of Android

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.450
truly lies in the input sources or sensors that are available

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.500
in Android that are simply not available on web and desktop.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.493
&gt;&gt; Exactly. One simple example is GPS. So can you name all the other

00:02:01.493 --> 00:02:03.428
input sources that are available on Android

00:02:03.428 --> 00:02:05.322
that are not available on web and desktop?

00:02:05.322 --> 00:02:07.269
