00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.150
even the people who we

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160
even the people who we
 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.130
even the people who we
think of as being problematic in a way

doctors who were at that point over
 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.640
doctors who were at that point over
diagnosing schizophrenia and

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650

african-american men I found so I mean

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680
african-american men I found so I mean

the drug ads I would say are and I
 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.230
the drug ads I would say are and I
invite people to look at the images

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240
invite people to look at the images
 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.150

they're there in the book they're

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160
they're there in the book they're
 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.130
they're there in the book they're
expressed I mean I don't know what the

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140
expressed I mean I don't know what the
 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.330

people were thinking at the time but

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340
people were thinking at the time but
 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.610
people were thinking at the time but
they were just problematically racist

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620
they were just problematically racist
 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.380
they were just problematically racist
and I think it's hard not to look at

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390
and I think it's hard not to look at
 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.740
and I think it's hard not to look at
those ads and see that anything else and

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750
those ads and see that anything else and
 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.440
those ads and see that anything else and
but in general I think that many of the

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450
but in general I think that many of the
 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.510
but in general I think that many of the
doctors and the sources that I look at

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520
doctors and the sources that I look at
 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.130

they were using the new state-of-the-art
diagnostic criteria that were coming

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310
diagnostic criteria that were coming
 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.650
diagnostic criteria that were coming
from their profession and I found

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660
from their profession and I found
 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.530
from their profession and I found
relatively few examples of people

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540
relatively few examples of people
 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.150
relatively few examples of people
actually trying to hurt people what they

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160
actually trying to hurt people what they
 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.350
actually trying to hurt people what they
were saying was oh here's a new

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360

definition of illness that we can apply
 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.100
definition of illness that we can apply
to people and I think a lot of the

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110
to people and I think a lot of the
 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.560
to people and I think a lot of the
changes were happening as you suggest at

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570
changes were happening as you suggest at
 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.430

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.130
of cultural unconscious in a way that
was shifting have we thought about these

was shifting have we thought about these
 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.530
was shifting have we thought about these
people so you know a few examples from

the census listed the majority of
patients in the hospital as being

especially patients with schizophrenia
were not particularly violent so they

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800
were not particularly violent so they
 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.770
were not particularly violent so they
would take these people out on field

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:58.780
would take these people out on field
 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.700

system and ended up diagnosed with
schizophrenia and locked into

schizophrenia and locked into
 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.660
schizophrenia and locked into
psychiatric wards and so it was a very

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:37.670
psychiatric wards and so it was a very
 

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.130
psychiatric wards and so it was a very
complicated question for me how did

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:39.140
complicated question for me how did
 

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.860
complicated question for me how did

schizophrenia was it because of some
inherent illness was it because of their

don't often think about that in the

don't often think about that in the
 

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.090
don't often think about that in the
United States but I think part of why

so as that happens you see the evolution

so as that happens you see the evolution
 

00:16:38.529 --> 00:16:40.440

people who suffer from it and at the
 

00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:10.299
people who suffer from it and at the

in very important ways and so I think

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:16.070
in very important ways and so I think
 

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:19.000

it's true for all illness but it's

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.360
it's true for all illness but it's
 

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.850
it's true for all illness but it's
certainly true for psychiatric illness

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.540
well again I think that we're we're

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:55.550
well again I think that we're we're
 

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.920
well again I think that we're we're
making a mistake if we don't see that

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:56.930
making a mistake if we don't see that

illness like that you're going to you're
 

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:13.630
illness like that you're going to you're
going to miss the boat even if you are a

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:13.640
going to miss the boat even if you are a
 

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:17.230
going to miss the boat even if you are a
great scientist um so I don't think it's

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:17.240
great scientist um so I don't think it's
 

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.030
great scientist um so I don't think it's
the case that it's just psychiatric

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:19.040
the case that it's just psychiatric
 

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.920
the case that it's just psychiatric
disorders but we know from history that

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:20.930
disorders but we know from history that
 

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:24.640
disorders but we know from history that
when we get the ultimate you know cure

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:24.650
when we get the ultimate you know cure
 

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.530
when we get the ultimate you know cure
for a particular illness or nail it down

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:26.540
for a particular illness or nail it down
 

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.600
for a particular illness or nail it down
it stops being a psychiatric illness and

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:28.610
it stops being a psychiatric illness and
 

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.180
it stops being a psychiatric illness and
then it's taken up by internal medicine

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:31.190
then it's taken up by internal medicine
 

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.340
then it's taken up by internal medicine
or you know we know oh it was just an

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:33.350
or you know we know oh it was just an
 

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:35.680
or you know we know oh it was just an
iron imbalance or it was a vitamin

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:35.690
iron imbalance or it was a vitamin
 

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:37.120
iron imbalance or it was a vitamin
deficiency or something like that that

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:37.130
deficiency or something like that that
 

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:38.860
deficiency or something like that that
in a way it's taken away from psychiatry

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:38.870
in a way it's taken away from psychiatry
 

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:42.310
in a way it's taken away from psychiatry
and taken taken to medicine but but I

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320
and taken taken to medicine but but I
 

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.250
and taken taken to medicine but but I
think that's a you know if you look at

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:45.260
think that's a you know if you look at
 

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.830
think that's a you know if you look at
diagnostic rates and treatment rates in

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840
diagnostic rates and treatment rates in
 

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.650
diagnostic rates and treatment rates in
psychiatric disorders it's even with all

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:50.660
psychiatric disorders it's even with all
 

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.130
psychiatric disorders it's even with all
the controversy about SSRIs right now

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:53.140
the controversy about SSRIs right now
 

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:57.550
the controversy about SSRIs right now
the improvement rates are reasonably

00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:57.560
the improvement rates are reasonably
 

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.440
the improvement rates are reasonably
good compared to other medical

00:21:59.440 --> 00:21:59.450
good compared to other medical
 

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:01.330
good compared to other medical
specialties and so I think it's it's

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:01.340
specialties and so I think it's it's
 

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.450
specialties and so I think it's it's
always going to be a negotiation about

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:03.460
always going to be a negotiation about
 

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.710
always going to be a negotiation about
what's the best way to understand

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:05.720
what's the best way to understand
 

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.540
what's the best way to understand
psychiatric illness but of course the

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:07.550
psychiatric illness but of course the
 

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:09.670
psychiatric illness but of course the
flip side of that is that there is this

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:09.680
flip side of that is that there is this
 

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.760
flip side of that is that there is this
aura of it's something we don't know in

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:12.770
aura of it's something we don't know in
 

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.350
aura of it's something we don't know in
a certain kind of way and so psychiatry

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:14.360
a certain kind of way and so psychiatry
 

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.790
a certain kind of way and so psychiatry
is always kind of fighting against that

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:15.800
is always kind of fighting against that
 

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.160
is always kind of fighting against that
and probably that's why we had a move

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:18.170
and probably that's why we had a move
 

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.010
and probably that's why we had a move
toward saying things are solely

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:21.020
toward saying things are solely
 

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.600
toward saying things are solely
biological in a certain kind of way is

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:22.610
biological in a certain kind of way is
 

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:24.730
biological in a certain kind of way is
to you know rightly move toward a more

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:24.740
to you know rightly move toward a more
 

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:30.280
to you know rightly move toward a more
scientific basis

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:30.290
 

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:32.410
terrific well I mean it's it's there are

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:32.420
terrific well I mean it's it's there are
 

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.330
terrific well I mean it's it's there are
really exciting things happening in

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:34.340
really exciting things happening in
 

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.640
really exciting things happening in
genetics and neurobiology right now and

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:36.650
genetics and neurobiology right now and
 

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:39.240
genetics and neurobiology right now and
really looking at the ways in which

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:39.250
really looking at the ways in which
 

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:42.760
really looking at the ways in which
difference not just illnesses but social

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:42.770
difference not just illnesses but social
 

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:44.620
difference not just illnesses but social
conditions and social pressures can

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:44.630
conditions and social pressures can
 

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.760
conditions and social pressures can
actually lead to actual brain changes

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:47.770
actually lead to actual brain changes
 

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.200
actually lead to actual brain changes
you know there was a lot of promise in

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:50.210
you know there was a lot of promise in
 

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:51.700
you know there was a lot of promise in
the development of pharmaceuticals

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:51.710
the development of pharmaceuticals
 

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:54.430
the development of pharmaceuticals
particularly with the advent of newer

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:54.440
particularly with the advent of newer
 

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:58.170
particularly with the advent of newer
generation of anti psychotics and anti

00:22:58.170 --> 00:22:58.180
generation of anti psychotics and anti
 

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.790
generation of anti psychotics and anti
depressants and we know from history

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:00.800
depressants and we know from history
 

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.370
depressants and we know from history
that there's a kind of natural

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:02.380
that there's a kind of natural
 

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.750
that there's a kind of natural
trajectory of the way that these on't

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:04.760
trajectory of the way that these on't
 

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.960
trajectory of the way that these on't
that these medications come out and and

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:07.970
that these medications come out and and
 

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.420
that these medications come out and and
are accepted so initially we say these

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:10.430
are accepted so initially we say these
 

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.780
are accepted so initially we say these
are cures for everything under the Sun

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:12.790
are cures for everything under the Sun
 

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.670
are cures for everything under the Sun
and there's this dramatic rise and then

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:15.680
and there's this dramatic rise and then
 

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.870
and there's this dramatic rise and then
we say wait a minute these don't work

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880
we say wait a minute these don't work
 

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.640
we say wait a minute these don't work
for anything which i think is happening

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:18.650
for anything which i think is happening
 

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:21.280
for anything which i think is happening
with the SSRI antidepressants right now

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:21.290
with the SSRI antidepressants right now
 

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:22.570
with the SSRI antidepressants right now
and then we kind of figure out a

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:22.580
and then we kind of figure out a
 

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:24.730
and then we kind of figure out a
moderated use of well they're good for

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:24.740
moderated use of well they're good for
 

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.590
moderated use of well they're good for
some conditions and not for others and

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:26.600
some conditions and not for others and
 

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.510
some conditions and not for others and
so again as I say I think that there's a

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:28.520
so again as I say I think that there's a
 

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.600
so again as I say I think that there's a
a give-and-take that's part of the

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:31.610
a give-and-take that's part of the
 

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.790
a give-and-take that's part of the
process and part of it is based in

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:33.800
process and part of it is based in
 

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.460
process and part of it is based in
science but I also think you know the

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:36.470
science but I also think you know the
 

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.470
science but I also think you know the
1990s were often called the decade of

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480
1990s were often called the decade of
 

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.140
1990s were often called the decade of
the brain and psychiatry where we didn't

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:41.150
