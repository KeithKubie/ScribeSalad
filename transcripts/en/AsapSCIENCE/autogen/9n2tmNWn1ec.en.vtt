00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.740
 The optimist will see this cup half full, while the pessimist will confirm it is half empty. 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.360
 Of course, others will note that it is full of atoms 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.530
 That water, air and others will remind you that 99.99% of the atoms are empty space 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:22.380
 Making the cup ... often empty! But seriously, science can explain 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.580
 Your emotional perspective and your outlook on life? 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.970
 It turned out that it was not under your control. Research has shown that those who have long allele (a contrasting genetic dye qualities) 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.340
 In serotonin-specific genes, they are more prone to focus on the positive side of life 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.000
 As someone who enjoys ice cream - compared to those with short alleles 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.040
 The more inclined to focus on the downside of life - as someone who has been robbed 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.430
 The difference in oxytocin receptor gene can affect your perspective, individuals with two copies of guanine 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.850
 They were observed to be more positive with higher self confidence, while those 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.130
 Who have two copies of adenine are less positive. So people seem to be genetically affected 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.670
 For pessimism. 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.329
 Interestingly, positives are less likely to be hypnotized in hospital after coronary bypass surgery 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:09.810
 Achieve higher academic achievements, and even better economic and social conditions 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.540
 But not all of them are good, they exaggerate their abilities and are at risk. 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.400
 Pessimists, on the other hand, have a more realistic perspective of the world and are more cautious when they plan 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.880
 The future has been living longer. In a historical study spanning 20 years it was found that 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.260
 Pessimists use a cautious approach to their health and financial resources, avoiding dangerous behavior 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.170
 Such as smoking and excessive drinking, in the end they are finally laughing - on the positive - 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.710
 But we are statistically positive, known as "positive bias" 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.909
 Located in about 80% of the population, we tend to exaggerate the probability 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.420
 Positive events in the future, and underestimated the likelihood of adverse events. 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.220
 For example, despite the high rate of divorce for nearly 40% of most newlyweds 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.060
 They estimate the probability of being separated 0%. Possibly you imagine your future 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.880
 - Often - better than your current situation. And above all, we usually imagine ourselves 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.310
 Smarter, more social, and more honest than others. 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.489
 When we look at the brain, in fact we see that the left part shows a greater activity 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.120
 When you imagine positive things, while during bad events the activity of the right half rises 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.000
 But at a lower rate, this indicates that the brain chooses to ignore 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.540
 The negative information is filtered and focuses on the positive. 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.319
 Our view is, whether you are genetically engineered to see the cup half full 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.690
 Or half empty - to tell the water and drink only if you allow! 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.690
 This actually reminds us of the famous saying "Giving better than taking" 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.660
 But is this scientifically true? We have answered this in AsapTHOUGHT 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.410
 With special gifts where you can click the link here or in the description box 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.000
 To inspect them. Special thanks for audible for their support of this episode

 And give you free audio books on audible.com/asap this week we would like to nominate you 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.670
 This book 'The Wright Brothers' is a wonderful story about the two brothers 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.560
 Note the world how to fly - while staying positive during all the challenges you face! 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.879
