that I use and this really is the
 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.299
that I use and this really is the
decoder bench I call it because that

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309
decoder bench I call it because that
 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.910

out yes does it say what it's a language
 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.600
out yes does it say what it's a language
that needs to be decoded but basically

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610
 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.950
you actually heard that from the potato
