on GPS we're right here.

and show the doctor.

are back in high school,

not to make money.

you did a lot of travelling,

here, you have textiles,
leather goods, some taxidermy.

a value in everything.

What's this?

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.770
"3rd Dimension Skims."

like skateboarding.

the tide to go out,

you got that thin
layer of water,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.470
you chuck it across the sand,
and jump on there.

How old do you think that is?

60s, 70s.

and the font, you know,

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.570
even with this splatter here,
it's interesting.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.030
I mean, there's a little bit
of peeling with the veneer here,

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.670

FRANK: A little at the top.

a great wall hanger.

looks like a matching pair here.
