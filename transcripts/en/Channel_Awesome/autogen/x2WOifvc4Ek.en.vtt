00:12:19.329 --> 00:12:19.339
train him to be a clubber and then they
 

00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:20.889
train him to be a clubber and then they
had their own fight at the end the

00:12:20.889 --> 00:12:20.899
had their own fight at the end the
 

00:12:20.899 --> 00:12:22.329
had their own fight at the end the

a better character angle to take on him
 

00:12:29.779 --> 00:12:31.659
a better character angle to take on him
because he had been escalating since the

because he had been escalating since the
 

00:12:31.669 --> 00:12:33.909
because he had been escalating since the
first movie and just cutting him off

00:12:33.909 --> 00:12:33.919
first movie and just cutting him off
 

00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:36.639
first movie and just cutting him off
before I think he really had more chance
