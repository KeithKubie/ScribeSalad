00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.940
Hello Internet. It's Q&amp;A time.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.040
First question: "Are memes the future of society?"

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.920
I think you meant this as a joke, but the answer is yes.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.360
The internet, for memes, is the perfect petri dish, gladiatorial theater, and mutation chamber...

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.080
growing, selecting, and randomizing the memest memes to meme in our minds.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.360
Society has always been a war of memes, but before it was fought with sticks and stones.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.700
The internet, however, has arms-raced that fight to trench warfare of meme-driven brains in many areas.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.560
They've not yet captured all fields of thought, but I fear the meme trenches will only expand.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.740
In a previous Q&amp;A, I was asked what topic I've changed my mind on...

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.920
...and the unmitigated benefits of the Internet sure is one of those things.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.660
"Rate from top to bottom: pancakes, waffles, french toast."

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.160
If you know you're at a great restaurant, then the ordering hierarchy is:...

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.640
...french toast before waffles before pancakes.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.120
If you're at a restaurant of unknown quality, the hierarchy reverses.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.100
Pancakes are more reliably consistent and thus can't reach the repulsive troughs or sublime peaks of French Toast.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.580
“What makes you unique compared to the 7 billion people on Earth?”

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.840
In a world of billions, no one is unique.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.820
“If you could have a companion animal like "The Golden Compass" what would you have?”

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.940
A chimpanzee daemon: maximize utility while minimizing inconvenience.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.720
“What common life advice do you disagree with?”

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.000
"Do what you love" and her sister meme: "Follow your passion".

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.580
The word 'passion' here is a disgusting perversion of language if, you know, words mean things.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.640
And yes, there are people who are 'passionate' (gross) about their work, but guess what?

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.880
Those kinds of people don't need advice.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.820
They're going to do whatever they're uh 'passionate' about anyway.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.360
So this advice is useless to who are its exemplars,…

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.260
…while being anti-useful to everyone else,...

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.040
...making most people feel bad about their lives and their work by setting an impossibly high bar.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.520
In life, rather than expecting to find a burning passion inside yourself that you somehow don't know about already (because it doesn't exist)...

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.580
...it's better and more useful to think of life like fishing -- some spots are beautiful (to you) ...

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.100
...and in some spots your skills will catch fish, others not.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.240
But you can't know where you'd like to spend time until you go there ...

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.620
and you can't know how many fish you can catch there until you try.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.920
The younger you are, the more time you can spend sailing to different spots…

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.900
and then the older you are the more time you get to spend in places you know you like,...

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.300
…refining your abilities to catch fish there.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.340
"Did you have a point in life that turned you around productivity wise?

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.700
If so what changed, and what contributed to that change?"

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.440
Yes, there was a time and an event.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.140
I drifted through school without learning how to be organized because, …

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.840
…despite what schools tell you about preparing you for the real world, …

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.260
…they're mostly a babysitting service obsessed with an endless game of Trivial Pursuit.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.220
When school dumped me into the real world I had no idea how to adult, …

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.880
…and needed to figure it out fast.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.340
The single thing that changed me the most was keeping a paper notebook in my pocket…

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.800
… and writing down my thoughts and simply looking back at that notebook on a regular basis.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.060
That loop booted me into a real human.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.660
It's so simple, but it comes down to increasing communication between …

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.980
…the past, present, and future you.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.980
That's how you direct change in yourself over time.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.040
"What motivates you to do anything productive when everything is meaningless anyway?"

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.160
This 'if we all die what's the point' meme is a bad one for brains.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.080
Like, it's true that in the long run we are all naught but dust, forgotten. Forever.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.180
But your present experiences are real and they're all you'll ever have.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.560
A sunset doesn't need meaning to be enjoyed, the enjoyment is the meaning.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.000
Using productivity to build a life you want to live is intrinsically meaningful, …

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.220
…despite Abyss swallowing us all in the end.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.080
If you're not in a good place, there's lots of small stuff you can do to start turning that around…

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.120
Watch this, do the opposite.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.600
“What would you do if you became immortal?”

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.840
I'd live a really long time.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.680
“On a D&amp;D alignment chart, where would you place yourself?”

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.080
Oh, D&amp;D alignment charts, so fun because of the endless disagreements over…

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.520
… what the words ‘lawful, chaotic, good, evil, and neutral’ mean.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.660
You think it's obvious, but so does the guy you're arguing with.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.340
People might think I’m over here, but I might view myself as over here,…

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.120
or depending on how much you want to want to D&amp;D rules lawyer the word 'chaos', …

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.480
…maybe even over here.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.040
But the question ultimately presupposes the lie that people are consistent selves.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.020
And in reality our selves are situational and everyone is everything for a time or under the right circumstances.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.180
But that's no fun: it's easier and memesier to put people on a 2D grid!

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.040
And I've yet to see a D&amp;D alignment chart for YouTube.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.640
Who among Tubers is our lawful good, and who is our chaotic evil?

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.040
On the reddit, I look forward to seeing your 2D D&amp;D interpretations of the multi-faceted people on this site.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.620
“You are allowed to change the name of the 7th planet on our solar system what would you call it?”

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.860
King George, of course! I’m still serious about this meme. #7thPlanetKingGeorge

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.160
“If you could remove a single trait/characteristic from human beings as a species what would it be and why?”

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.760
Human tribalism... is a double-edged sword.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.120
There were 14,000 questions submitted to this Q&amp;A on my the reddit, …

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.760
…and it's astounding to see how many are really asking: "Are you part of my tribe or not?".

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.620
And it's disappointing to see how badly people react when the answer is 'no' --

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.760
even on the most trivial of things.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.020
However tribalism is how we develop teamwork and teamwork is how we build civilizations.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.720
But tribes are so often motivated by the totem they construct of the other tribe to yell at.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.180
So if tribalism and the teamwork it creates could still exist …

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.020
…when removing the tendency to build totems to burn in effigy, I'd do that.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.680
“Can you wear a hat for the rest of the video?”

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.640
Uh-OK

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.620
"What's your opinion on whether Balrogs have wings?"

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.100
Ahh, the great Balrog debate of 2000 lives on.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.980
There's a good reason my Balrog is drawn the way it is.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.560
The line from Fellowship reads: 
[Gandalf's] enemy halted again, facing him, and the shadow about [The Balrog] reached out like two vast wings.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.920
Unambiguous: a shadow that’s ‘like wings’ isn’t wings. They're metaphorical wings.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.200
Yet not two paragraphs later Tolkien writes:

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.040
" [The Balrog] drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread from wall to wall. "

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.680
Unambiguous: wings.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.240
Or maybe not?

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.060
Are these wings the metaphorical wings from but 12 sentences earlier?

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:02.040
Well now this has become an argument about how big the room is that these real or metaphorical wings much stretch across.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:08.200
Asking "Did the Balrog have wings?" The books have the same answer as: "Hey, where did the Orcs come from?"

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.800
"dd/mm/yy or mm/dd/yy?"

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.680
yyyy-mm-dd

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.100
"What are your thoughts on your thoughts?"

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.200
Who knows where thoughts come from, they just appear.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.060
"Is the glass half full or half empty?"

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.580
Why must judgment be passed? The glass is this full.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.800
"How would you rule the world?"

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.420
With compassion. And an IRON FIST.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.240
"AM I FIRST ?????? "

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.880
No: you were exactly 10,044th.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.780
"What have you read recently? Any recommendations?"

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.420
I'm glad you asked, Never Not Act, for today's sponsor is Audible,...

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:39.060
…, who likes it when I recommend books and will give you a free audiobook with a 30-day trial at audible.com/grey

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.700
Related to that earlier question, I did recently read "Tribe" by Sebastian Junger...

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.820
…and it really changed my perception on the experiences soldiers have in war,…

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.000
… and how people act during disaster and just in general…

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.100
… how groups survive when there’s outside stresses acting on them.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.880
It's a thoughtful book and it’s also nice and short, which is a big advantage.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.480
So I liked Tribe.  I recommend it.  And if you want to give it a try, you can do so with Audible.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.900
They have an unmatched library of audiobooks and original audio shows you can listen to.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.960
Audiobooks have added a lot to my life and Audible is where I get my audiobooks from.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.660
So you should give them a try and go get your free audiobook …

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.000
…maybe it’s Tribe, maybe it’s something else you want to listen to…

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.980
...with a 30-day trial at audible.com/grey

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.580
