00:00:08.896 --> 00:00:10.006
&gt;&gt;George: I strongly believe

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:14.306
that education is the
single most important job

00:00:14.396 --> 00:00:16.726
that the human race has.

00:00:16.806 --> 00:00:20.756
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We're actually out to
reform the public school system.

00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:23.276
&gt;&gt;Student: You know, we're not
stupid, we have a lot of drive in us.

00:00:23.706 --> 00:00:25.476
We could do anything
we put our minds to.

00:00:25.476 --> 00:00:29.546
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You know, it hits you, as
a teacher you're like, "Oh my god.

00:00:29.656 --> 00:00:33.406
Something that I designed made
this kid feel like a hero."

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:34.876
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Jeffrey?

00:00:35.046 --> 00:00:36.756
&gt;&gt;Student: Are we going
to have enough room

00:00:36.896 --> 00:00:39.366
for the whole webpage
just on that one line?

00:00:39.526 --> 00:00:41.306
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You'll be surprised,
it just goes right down.

00:00:42.336 --> 00:00:42.536
&gt;&gt;Student: Water.

00:00:42.536 --> 00:00:43.106
&gt;&gt;Student: And the water...

00:00:43.586 --> 00:00:47.026
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Imagine if kids from
the beginning could be learning

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.816
through developing their interests
through things that they're in love

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:53.776
with or that they cared
about, you know, just imagine.

00:01:01.216 --> 00:01:05.926
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We would place the
dome right here for instance.

00:01:05.996 --> 00:01:09.326
&gt;&gt;Narrator: These sophomore geometry
students in Seattle have a problem,

00:01:09.456 --> 00:01:11.706
and they're excited about solving it.

00:01:11.886 --> 00:01:13.656
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The problem that they have

00:01:13.716 --> 00:01:18.186
to solve is how do you design
a state-of-the-art high school

00:01:18.186 --> 00:01:21.766
in the year 2050 on
a particular site.

00:01:21.996 --> 00:01:23.836
Students are in teams
of three to four,

00:01:23.836 --> 00:01:27.146
and they're in a design competition
for a contract to build it.

00:01:27.146 --> 00:01:28.786
&gt;&gt;Student: It's the fire-eliminator.

00:01:29.376 --> 00:01:32.746
This is a vacuum, there's
water inside it.

00:01:33.046 --> 00:01:34.336
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In Lackawanna,
Pennsylvania,

00:01:34.336 --> 00:01:38.336
these fifth graders are designing
a tool to put out fires in space.

00:01:38.516 --> 00:01:41.636
&gt;&gt;Student: If you turn it on
high, it sucks up the fire balls.

00:01:41.636 --> 00:01:45.686
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In Hawaii, high school
students are building electric cars

00:01:45.736 --> 00:01:47.066
and racing them.

00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:51.976
These students have something in
common: they are energized, focused,

00:01:52.136 --> 00:01:56.726
and challenged, determined
to do their best.

00:01:57.496 --> 00:01:59.476
They are collaborating in hands-on,

00:01:59.696 --> 00:02:04.506
real-world projects studying
everything from robots to worms,

00:02:05.086 --> 00:02:08.386
learning lessons they'll never
forget and having fun in the process.

00:02:08.606 --> 00:02:12.326
&gt;&gt;Student: We did an
experiment on dead worms.

00:02:13.506 --> 00:02:17.386
We smelled them and
they didn't smell good.

00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:19.886
&gt;&gt;Marco: We have a camera now that
you guys can go out and shoot.

00:02:20.276 --> 00:02:22.756
&gt;&gt;Marco: If I look back
at my own education,

00:02:23.216 --> 00:02:24.946
I remember the projects I made.

00:02:24.946 --> 00:02:27.416
I remember the hand I
made in kindergarten.

00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:29.726
I remember the volcano
I made in third grade

00:02:30.046 --> 00:02:31.086
because they were projects.

00:02:31.086 --> 00:02:32.516
They were things that
had an end to them.

00:02:32.796 --> 00:02:34.526
Something tangible,
something that I can say

00:02:34.526 --> 00:02:36.836
to my mom, "Mommy, look what it is.

00:02:36.836 --> 00:02:38.006
Look mom, look what I did."

00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:42.186
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So that's not
absolutely set in stone.

00:02:43.256 --> 00:02:45.856
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Twice a year, students
work with their teachers to come

00:02:45.856 --> 00:02:49.026
up with a question or area of
inquiry that they will pursue

00:02:49.026 --> 00:02:50.396
for the next several months.

00:02:50.766 --> 00:02:54.346
They integrate math, science, and
English studies, and with the help

00:02:54.346 --> 00:02:57.446
of local artists, express
themselves in art work,

00:02:57.926 --> 00:03:01.976
dance, video, drama, and music.

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:05.776
&gt;&gt;Student: [Sings]

00:03:06.276 --> 00:03:07.526
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The process
of deep inquiry

00:03:07.526 --> 00:03:11.816
into a single subject is the same
whether it's seventh graders studying

00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:12.416
the war..

00:03:12.556 --> 00:03:16.726
&gt;&gt;Student: Well I realized this, you
look at this picture, you feel sorry

00:03:16.726 --> 00:03:19.696
for the soldiers and that kind of
makes you want to support the war.

00:03:19.696 --> 00:03:23.056
But then if you look at this picture,
you feel sorry for the Iraqis,

00:03:23.056 --> 00:03:26.226
and that makes you think
that the war isn't necessary.

00:03:26.626 --> 00:03:28.996
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ...or first-graders
focusing on frogs.

00:03:29.106 --> 00:03:32.936
&gt;&gt;Student: That little green
dot is called a spiracle.

00:03:33.726 --> 00:03:35.366
&gt;&gt;Teacher: If you study
something really deeply,

00:03:35.366 --> 00:03:36.936
you become very invested in it.

00:03:36.936 --> 00:03:39.536
So what you're seeing, even with
the frogs in the first grade,

00:03:39.606 --> 00:03:41.126
is tremendous investment.

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:44.016
Kids really, really care about frogs.

00:03:44.606 --> 00:03:47.166
It wouldn't have been as deep if they
would have studied frogs for two days

00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:48.156
and lizards for two days.

00:03:48.936 --> 00:03:53.106
&gt;&gt;Students: It's just a frog that
we made that sticks out its tongue.

00:03:53.776 --> 00:03:59.216
Not many people -- a lot of people
wanted a tongue, but they didn't have

00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:03.566
to get a tongue, but I did.

00:04:04.226 --> 00:04:07.406
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Gulfport, Mississippi's
Harrison Central High School hasn't

00:04:07.406 --> 00:04:10.496
changed much since it
was founded in 1957.

00:04:11.366 --> 00:04:15.946
But over the past several years,
there's been a quiet revolution going

00:04:15.946 --> 00:04:18.666
on that has transformed
Harrison's curriculum.

00:04:19.146 --> 00:04:20.756
In almost every classroom,

00:04:20.936 --> 00:04:24.976
cutting-edge technology tools are
facilitating a new way of learning.

00:04:25.466 --> 00:04:27.246
&gt;&gt;Student: There in the guild
today, what could be said

00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:29.776
about national politics is A,

00:04:30.276 --> 00:04:33.166
the Republican party held
the majority of voters, B..

00:04:33.366 --> 00:04:37.196
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Now history lessons
are as exciting as game shows.

00:04:37.276 --> 00:04:39.496
&gt;&gt;Student: What is your final answer?

00:04:39.496 --> 00:04:42.886
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Digital cameras help
reveal the principles of physics.

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:44.386
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Are we collecting?

00:04:45.016 --> 00:04:46.856
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Probes
and laptops are used

00:04:46.856 --> 00:04:49.456
in real-world scientific
explorations.

00:04:50.536 --> 00:04:54.036
They even use technology to
improve their nationally-ranked

00:04:54.036 --> 00:04:55.056
cheerleading squad.

00:04:55.546 --> 00:04:57.326
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We tried to come up
with a conditioning program,

00:04:57.326 --> 00:04:59.236
and we used the computers
and the probes

00:04:59.676 --> 00:05:02.956
to tell us what the heart rate
was before they exercised,

00:05:02.956 --> 00:05:05.346
and then what it was afterwards,
and also the respiration.

00:05:05.636 --> 00:05:06.546
&gt;&gt;Student: Life without this stuff,

00:05:06.776 --> 00:05:09.696
we'd have no idea how
much things have changed,

00:05:10.096 --> 00:05:11.616
and where we started
and where we're at now.

00:05:11.816 --> 00:05:14.836
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Data from the cheerleader
workouts is given to students

00:05:14.836 --> 00:05:17.176
in an Algebra Two class for analysis.

00:05:17.626 --> 00:05:20.106
&gt;&gt;Student: We used a thing
called linear regression

00:05:20.846 --> 00:05:23.586
to get basically the
average increase or decrease.

00:05:23.786 --> 00:05:25.786
&gt;&gt;Karen: So you want to
put your GPS's up this way.

00:05:26.236 --> 00:05:30.826
Those six numbers, those numbers you
see there are satellites circling

00:05:30.826 --> 00:05:31.196
the earth.

00:05:31.636 --> 00:05:35.366
&gt;&gt;Karen: They feel very comfortable
with any of the technology nowadays.

00:05:35.636 --> 00:05:37.676
They follow their instructions
very well

00:05:37.926 --> 00:05:39.126
because they're serious about it.

00:05:39.246 --> 00:05:40.566
&gt;&gt;Karen: You see that
word "position"?

00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:43.956
Tap on the "position"
and look for "status."

00:05:44.406 --> 00:05:45.936
&gt;&gt;Karen: It's not a field
trip, when we go out there,

00:05:45.936 --> 00:05:48.856
the kids know that we're doing real
science, and they're much more alert.

00:05:48.976 --> 00:05:52.436
But if it was just a field
trip, they wouldn't be there

00:05:52.436 --> 00:05:54.126
because what does it really mean?

00:05:54.126 --> 00:05:57.066
&gt;&gt;Karen: So if we know where
Horney toads are, we want you to go

00:05:57.066 --> 00:06:00.026
to that site and we want you
to write down that latitude

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.586
and longitude on your paper, okay?

00:06:05.586 --> 00:06:08.156
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To engage their
students at the end of the year,

00:06:08.456 --> 00:06:12.536
the eighth grade teachers came up
with a project focusing on cars.

00:06:13.476 --> 00:06:14.886
&gt;&gt;Student: Oh a car, look at it.

00:06:15.456 --> 00:06:18.776
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Like most Landry
projects, the car unit was featured

00:06:18.776 --> 00:06:20.386
across the eighth grade curriculum.

00:06:21.406 --> 00:06:25.006
In science class, students
made balloon-propelled cars

00:06:25.006 --> 00:06:29.446
out of recycled materials, and
road tested their various designs.

00:06:29.686 --> 00:06:32.846
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Try to write some
different selling points.

00:06:33.046 --> 00:06:36.196
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In Language Arts,
students wrote car commercials,

00:06:36.196 --> 00:06:39.516
and in math, they calculated
loan payments.

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.066
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The six percent

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:44.086
of whatever you get
for item number seven.

00:06:44.156 --> 00:06:45.876
&gt;&gt;Student: So multiply six percent...

00:06:45.876 --> 00:06:46.396
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Times that.

00:06:47.136 --> 00:06:51.066
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They also use the web
to plan trips and find information

00:06:51.066 --> 00:06:54.196
on fuel economy, and
environmental impacts.

00:06:54.386 --> 00:06:56.426
&gt;&gt;Linda: I've had kids come
back to me and tell me,

00:06:56.426 --> 00:06:57.886
"Do you remember that
project we did?"

00:06:58.416 --> 00:07:00.246
They have never, ever
come back to me and said,

00:07:00.246 --> 00:07:01.676
"Do you remember that test we did?"

00:07:02.466 --> 00:07:04.736
So I think that's the impact.

00:07:04.736 --> 00:07:07.376
If the kids remember,
test scores will go up,

00:07:07.466 --> 00:07:08.686
and our tests always have.

00:07:09.076 --> 00:07:11.176
&gt;&gt;Teacher: To the outside
classroom, so..

00:07:11.516 --> 00:07:14.356
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While students must draw
on their knowledge of everything

00:07:14.356 --> 00:07:17.026
from math and English, to
the aesthetics of design,

00:07:17.316 --> 00:07:20.036
they also learn an
invaluable lesson in teamwork.

00:07:20.036 --> 00:07:20.856
&gt;&gt;Joe: We can see how
many we can fit.

00:07:20.856 --> 00:07:21.766
We can see how many we can fit.

00:07:21.766 --> 00:07:22.746
&gt;&gt;Student: I'm thinking because..

00:07:22.746 --> 00:07:24.646
&gt;&gt;Joe: When we finally
started on the site model,

00:07:24.646 --> 00:07:27.336
there was constant little squabbling
about, "Oh, this should go there."

00:07:27.886 --> 00:07:29.276
&gt;&gt;Student: Just the
bottom row itself,

00:07:29.276 --> 00:07:30.476
just holds twelve hundred
people, right?

00:07:30.476 --> 00:07:32.476
&gt;&gt;Joe: No, no, no, this entire
thing holds twelve hundred people.

00:07:32.476 --> 00:07:33.636
&gt;&gt;Student: Oh, the entire school.

00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:36.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: They're faced with
this really complex problem

00:07:37.226 --> 00:07:41.306
that has certain constraints, and
they have to figure out how to begin

00:07:41.306 --> 00:07:44.336
to make the decisions, and
move the process forward.

00:07:44.336 --> 00:07:46.716
And how do you do that
decision-making within a group?

00:07:47.096 --> 00:07:50.616
These are the things that are really
maybe the most powerful learnings

00:07:51.156 --> 00:07:51.896
that come from it.

00:07:51.896 --> 00:07:57.496
The real life problem-solving
communication, collaboration skills.

00:07:57.606 --> 00:07:59.966
&gt;&gt;Joe: I did learn how
to work with people

00:08:00.026 --> 00:08:04.606
that didn't think the way I did, and
thought non-linear, didn't believe

00:08:04.606 --> 00:08:05.896
in deadlines sort of thing.

00:08:05.896 --> 00:08:08.546
They really think out of the
box, which is not like me.

00:08:08.756 --> 00:08:10.066
I'm a completely in
the box kind of person.

00:08:10.566 --> 00:08:11.746
You've got to make sure
you work together good.

00:08:11.746 --> 00:08:14.166
&gt;&gt;Student: Why not have
the whole site's wall open?

00:08:14.166 --> 00:08:16.566
Be glass, facing the water.

00:08:16.566 --> 00:08:20.876
&gt;&gt;Howard: People may
be good test-takers,

00:08:20.876 --> 00:08:24.446
but once you leave the world
of testing, you have to think

00:08:24.446 --> 00:08:27.066
for yourself because the
world doesn't come organized

00:08:27.066 --> 00:08:30.056
in four choices with the fourth
one being "none of the above."

00:08:30.556 --> 00:08:33.376
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For schools that are
challenging the high stakes testing

00:08:33.376 --> 00:08:37.396
movement, the goal is to put less
emphasis on cramming, drills,

00:08:37.396 --> 00:08:40.966
and test-taking strategies,
and focus on in-depth learning.

00:08:40.966 --> 00:08:42.666
&gt;&gt;Anne: I'm all for high standards,

00:08:42.836 --> 00:08:44.516
I don't know of anybody
who's for low standards.

00:08:44.986 --> 00:08:46.266
The question is do we get

00:08:46.266 --> 00:08:50.306
at what we're saying we want
using the test to drive this?

00:08:50.526 --> 00:08:51.876
That's the real crux of it.

00:08:51.876 --> 00:08:52.956
And I would argue that we don't.

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:56.526
&gt;&gt;Teacher: R's represent that
these are his strength areas,

00:08:56.526 --> 00:08:59.956
and also any time you see
the shape of a triangle,

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:01.916
those also represent the strengths..

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:05.946
&gt;&gt;Pat: We're interested in
how students apply knowledge,

00:09:06.266 --> 00:09:08.686
and so students are required
through their high school

00:09:09.126 --> 00:09:11.386
to do major projects each semester.

00:09:11.506 --> 00:09:14.936
At the end of high school, they
should have eight major projects

00:09:15.006 --> 00:09:17.716
that they would have developed, that
all of this is to be put together

00:09:17.716 --> 00:09:23.096
on a multimedia portfolio to document
what it is they're capable of doing.

00:09:23.096 --> 00:09:25.726
&gt;&gt;Leili: We've been working with
the Egyptians because they had

00:09:25.726 --> 00:09:28.406
so many symbols and
hieroglyphics and..

00:09:28.556 --> 00:09:30.916
&gt;&gt;Leili: Compared to what sort of
my friends in other schools do,

00:09:30.916 --> 00:09:33.226
I think it's more interesting
over here because you really get

00:09:33.226 --> 00:09:37.226
to understand the thing more than
just memorize stuff for a test,

00:09:37.226 --> 00:09:38.596
and write it down and forget it.

00:09:38.596 --> 00:09:43.806
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Sarah Button is about
to tear her heart out in front

00:09:43.806 --> 00:09:46.916
of her fifth-graders at the
Patrick Daly school in Brooklyn.

00:09:46.916 --> 00:09:49.936
&gt;&gt;Sarah: And her sister came into
the room and said, "Are you going

00:09:49.936 --> 00:09:51.406
to wear those old rags to school?"

00:09:53.356 --> 00:09:56.886
&gt;&gt;Linda: We are talking about a whole
new vision of education that says

00:09:56.946 --> 00:10:00.636
that educating the heart is as
important as educating the mind.

00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:02.426
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Emotional intelligence,

00:10:02.426 --> 00:10:06.446
which refers to how you handle your
own feelings, how well you empathize

00:10:06.446 --> 00:10:10.556
and get along with other people
is just a key human skill,

00:10:10.616 --> 00:10:13.946
but it also turns out that
kids who are better able

00:10:14.186 --> 00:10:15.716
to manage their emotions,
for example,

00:10:15.716 --> 00:10:17.116
actually can pay attention better,

00:10:17.466 --> 00:10:20.366
can take in information
better, can remember better.

00:10:20.426 --> 00:10:21.976
In other words, it
helps you learn better.

00:10:22.776 --> 00:10:25.806
&gt;&gt;Student: When I first moved here
a year ago, no one really wanted

00:10:25.806 --> 00:10:28.836
to play with me, and all the
fifth graders called me names.

00:10:29.356 --> 00:10:30.886
&gt;&gt;Michael: What was it
doing to your heart?

00:10:31.276 --> 00:10:32.796
&gt;&gt;Student: It just made
me feel really bad.

00:10:32.796 --> 00:10:36.286
&gt;&gt;Michael: And what I try to
teach the kids is that we have

00:10:36.336 --> 00:10:40.696
to be more real about our emotions,
and back to the time of Macbeth,

00:10:41.086 --> 00:10:43.956
Shakespeare said, "Always
give sorrow words.

00:10:44.226 --> 00:10:45.996
Grief that doesn't speak whispers

00:10:45.996 --> 00:10:50.136
to the overfraught heart
and bids it to break."

00:10:50.136 --> 00:10:51.566
&gt;&gt;Student: My main
thing that's gotten me

00:10:51.616 --> 00:10:52.826
through all this is empathy.

00:10:53.436 --> 00:10:54.716
&gt;&gt;Tony: I believe that the social,

00:10:54.716 --> 00:10:58.056
emotional component is
clearly the most important part

00:10:58.106 --> 00:11:04.326
of a child's life, and I don't
know of any child who learns best

00:11:04.496 --> 00:11:06.766
when they don't feel
good about themselves.

00:11:07.086 --> 00:11:10.746
If we can create an
environment where we feel good,

00:11:10.746 --> 00:11:13.616
and care for each other,
everything else falls into place.

00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:16.156
&gt;&gt;Student: It shouldn't be a world
hate, it should be a world love.

00:11:16.376 --> 00:11:16.696
&gt;&gt;Michael: Yeah.

00:11:16.866 --> 00:11:20.396
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Speaking
of ionic compounds,

00:11:20.746 --> 00:11:27.076
we've got this cool card game that
you've seen before, but we're going

00:11:27.076 --> 00:11:28.176
to modify it a little bit.

00:11:28.176 --> 00:11:30.126
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While project
promised students are placed

00:11:30.126 --> 00:11:34.276
in classrooms just three weeks into
the program, they don't go it alone.

00:11:34.596 --> 00:11:37.686
They are constantly monitored
and supported by their peers.

00:11:38.236 --> 00:11:38.926
&gt;&gt;Teacher: How do you think it went?

00:11:39.476 --> 00:11:41.486
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I was really
excited about the students.

00:11:41.486 --> 00:11:42.716
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They're mentor teachers..

00:11:42.716 --> 00:11:44.676
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It worked well,
and it worked well for review.

00:11:44.676 --> 00:11:47.296
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ...and by one
of the program's directors.

00:11:47.296 --> 00:11:49.726
&gt;&gt;Director: Then you had
closure today and that was great.

00:11:49.726 --> 00:11:52.176
I think that's one of
the first times, Carrie.

00:11:52.176 --> 00:11:54.936
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I think the
most important issue

00:11:54.936 --> 00:11:58.346
in teacher preparation is
getting prospective teachers

00:11:58.446 --> 00:12:02.006
into real life classroom
settings early.

00:12:02.086 --> 00:12:06.796
And if you're working with a mentored
teacher, or an experienced teacher

00:12:06.796 --> 00:12:11.476
or college professor, that
interaction can be very effective

00:12:11.736 --> 00:12:13.566
in learning how to teach.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:16.146
&gt;&gt;Director: Your transition
from the food labels

00:12:16.246 --> 00:12:21.106
to the game was a little rough, so
just tie in what you're doing here

00:12:21.106 --> 00:12:22.616
and how it goes to there,
and that's really going

00:12:22.616 --> 00:12:25.416
to help them make the connection
about what they do instead

00:12:25.416 --> 00:12:27.586
of just having disjointed things.

00:12:27.976 --> 00:12:31.036
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I like the way that
you've taken that original card game,

00:12:31.036 --> 00:12:34.596
but then you did take it to another
level this time, so the students had

00:12:34.596 --> 00:12:35.566
to write down the formulas.

00:12:35.806 --> 00:12:37.126
They could challenge each other.

00:12:37.946 --> 00:12:38.666
I thought it was great

00:12:39.516 --> 00:12:42.616
[Singing].

00:12:43.116 --> 00:12:47.086
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Like most student
performances, this winter celebration

00:12:47.086 --> 00:12:49.566
at Susan B. Anthony
Elementary School in Sacramento,

00:12:49.566 --> 00:12:53.186
California gives parents a chance
to watch their youngsters shine.

00:12:55.276 --> 00:12:56.946
But this holiday concert
is different.

00:12:57.456 --> 00:13:01.276
The speeches and songs are translated
into Spanish and a Mung dialect,

00:13:01.636 --> 00:13:04.966
just two of the 21 languages
spoken by students at the school.

00:13:06.176 --> 00:13:09.316
A few years ago, this kind of
gathering seemed impossible

00:13:09.586 --> 00:13:10.876
because language barriers

00:13:10.876 --> 00:13:14.016
and cultural differences made
parents leery of any involvement

00:13:14.016 --> 00:13:16.766
with the school, and the
disconnect between the school

00:13:16.856 --> 00:13:18.976
and community led to other problems.

00:13:19.326 --> 00:13:23.046
&gt;&gt;Carol: When I first became
principal here at Susan B. Anthony,

00:13:23.046 --> 00:13:25.996
the year before we had a
tremendous number of suspensions,

00:13:26.866 --> 00:13:30.766
about 140 to be exact
out of 500 children.

00:13:31.016 --> 00:13:32.986
Our attendance was
not what it should be,

00:13:32.986 --> 00:13:36.166
and there were just not
the day-to-day connections

00:13:36.206 --> 00:13:39.306
with the community that we needed
for our students to achieve.

00:13:39.466 --> 00:13:40.276
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Good job.

00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:44.546
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Things began to change
in 1998 when a small group of parents

00:13:44.546 --> 00:13:46.646
and staff at Susan B.
Anthony got together

00:13:46.646 --> 00:13:50.306
with a non-profit community group
to start a home visit program.

00:13:51.856 --> 00:13:54.956
Teachers from the school
volunteered to visit the homes

00:13:54.956 --> 00:13:58.956
of their students twice a year to
solicit input from parents and report

00:13:58.956 --> 00:14:00.716
on their child's progress in class.

00:14:00.716 --> 00:14:04.726
&gt;&gt;Parent: I haven't seen
you in a long, long time.

00:14:04.726 --> 00:14:07.886
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It's not your usual
the teacher's stopping by.

00:14:08.956 --> 00:14:13.606
It's we're coming together
two by two, we'll visit you,

00:14:13.606 --> 00:14:16.466
we'll talk about what are
your goals for your child,

00:14:16.466 --> 00:14:18.506
and how can we get
your student there?

00:14:18.506 --> 00:14:21.896
&gt;&gt;Teacher: How long have you lived
in this area, in this community?

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:24.356
&gt;&gt;Leng: The kids are
doing much better.

00:14:24.696 --> 00:14:27.936
I mean if they're misbehaved, I say,
"I'm going to call your mom and dad."

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:31.506
And then they stop, so they change.

00:14:31.506 --> 00:14:34.606
And also it really enhances
their self-esteem too.

00:14:35.176 --> 00:14:38.186
It helps them feel good that
I actually care about them.

00:14:38.736 --> 00:14:41.366
I actually take the time to
go visit them in their home.

00:14:41.686 --> 00:14:41.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Very good.

00:14:42.106 --> 00:14:46.166
&gt;&gt;Carol: If you're getting a pin
or a medal, and your parents is

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:50.936
in the audience, please locate
their hand and bring them

00:14:50.936 --> 00:14:54.746
up because they are part
of your learning plan.

00:14:54.916 --> 00:14:57.156
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Carol Sharp
credits the home visit program

00:14:57.156 --> 00:15:01.016
for improving attendance and academic
performance, and creating a new level

00:15:01.016 --> 00:15:02.566
of trust of communication.

00:15:05.186 --> 00:15:08.016
&gt;&gt;Carol: I see students that
really believe in themselves.

00:15:09.206 --> 00:15:13.986
I see parents that call me with
questions on academics now.

00:15:14.216 --> 00:15:19.676
I also see a low suspension
rate, less vandalism,

00:15:20.376 --> 00:15:22.926
increased in achievement,
and attendance.

00:15:24.196 --> 00:15:28.976
So as I look at year-to-year,
it's gotten better and better.

00:15:29.326 --> 00:15:30.596
&gt;&gt;Carol: Congratulations, Angel.

00:15:32.186 --> 00:15:33.236
&gt;&gt;Voice: Well howdy, boys and girls.

00:15:33.236 --> 00:15:36.906
Welcome to the McCaw School of Mines.

00:15:38.126 --> 00:15:41.116
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Community volunteers
built and financed the School

00:15:41.116 --> 00:15:45.726
of Mines, and local architect, Bill
Snyder, volunteered to design it.

00:15:46.146 --> 00:15:49.816
&gt;&gt;William: So we went to Disneyland
and we went to the Indiana Jones ride

00:15:49.926 --> 00:15:53.556
where they created the illusion
of taking people down underground

00:15:53.556 --> 00:15:56.406
and into a cave situation.

00:15:56.406 --> 00:15:59.446
So we sort of figured
out with the resources

00:15:59.446 --> 00:16:02.496
that we had what we could
do, and it's kind of funny

00:16:02.496 --> 00:16:07.546
because the company that built the
Indiana Jones ride actually did the

00:16:07.546 --> 00:16:10.546
work here for us as well, and what
we did to get them to do that,

00:16:10.546 --> 00:16:13.686
we had several kids help us
write pleading letters to them

00:16:14.086 --> 00:16:17.196
and we took the model that we built
of this and we set it in their lobby

00:16:17.266 --> 00:16:19.226
for about a month before
they said, "Okay.

00:16:19.226 --> 00:16:19.926
We surrender.

00:16:19.926 --> 00:16:20.726
How can we help?"

00:16:22.596 --> 00:16:26.656
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Everybody thinks
we're just this Disneyland

00:16:26.656 --> 00:16:27.836
that people come to and leave.

00:16:28.116 --> 00:16:31.216
No, we have over one and a half
million people in the valley here,

00:16:31.386 --> 00:16:33.866
the community really is
involved in the school.

00:16:33.866 --> 00:16:38.716
The top CEOs come in to read to kids
in our school district, mentor kids,

00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:43.216
and be good role models so that
our kids feel they're valued

00:16:43.216 --> 00:16:44.106
in our community.

00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:46.376
&gt;&gt;Thomas: Now who helps you
with your homework at home?

00:16:47.296 --> 00:16:48.346
&gt;&gt;Student: My calculator.

00:16:48.766 --> 00:16:51.866
&gt;&gt;Thomas: Your calculator,
but does your mother help you?

00:16:52.376 --> 00:16:55.396
&gt;&gt;Thomas: The more smart kids we
have, the better our future will be.

00:16:55.646 --> 00:16:58.226
The more kids that are able to
take care of themselves and provide

00:16:58.226 --> 00:17:00.276
for themselves, the
better we're going to be.

00:17:00.796 --> 00:17:05.476
So I said anyone who does not
have a kid in the school, share.

00:17:05.676 --> 00:17:08.926
Just share what you have.

00:17:09.176 --> 00:17:12.096
&gt;&gt;Narrator: There is an
extraordinary community center

00:17:12.096 --> 00:17:13.466
in the heart of New York City.

00:17:14.106 --> 00:17:18.996
It offers a complete range of
medical services from dental

00:17:19.196 --> 00:17:24.896
and medical check-ups, to
mental health counseling.

00:17:25.516 --> 00:17:31.836
There are adult education classes,
and computer training courses,

00:17:32.286 --> 00:17:35.506
a basketball program,
and a bicycle shop.

00:17:36.046 --> 00:17:41.236
A dance company, and
a string ensemble.

00:17:41.626 --> 00:17:45.736
Those are just a few of the
activities offered afterschool

00:17:45.736 --> 00:17:50.686
at IS 218, a public intermediate
school designed from the beginning

00:17:50.866 --> 00:17:53.126
to meet the needs of
the entire community.

00:17:53.956 --> 00:17:56.686
&gt;&gt;Jane: When I first came to this
school, I noticed two things.

00:17:57.136 --> 00:17:59.126
I noticed that the
children seemed happy,

00:17:59.486 --> 00:18:02.276
and I noticed that there were
a lot of extra adults around,

00:18:02.626 --> 00:18:04.926
and I wanted to know
what was happening here,

00:18:04.926 --> 00:18:07.386
and how we could make it
happen in more places.

00:18:07.466 --> 00:18:09.126
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Do you want
to spell this one first?

00:18:09.676 --> 00:18:09.926
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay.

00:18:09.926 --> 00:18:13.996
&gt;&gt;Narrator: IS 218 is open six days
a week from seven in the morning

00:18:14.056 --> 00:18:16.346
to nine at night all year long.

00:18:17.216 --> 00:18:19.976
It's the product of a partnership
between the New York City Board

00:18:19.976 --> 00:18:23.976
of Education, and the Children's
Aid Society, which pays for

00:18:23.976 --> 00:18:26.446
and administers the
extracurricular programs.

00:18:26.446 --> 00:18:28.316
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So I think that's
comforting for the parents

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:32.526
to see what type of stuff we have.

00:18:32.526 --> 00:18:35.636
&gt;&gt;Jane: The needs are always greater
than the resources that we can bring

00:18:35.636 --> 00:18:37.296
to the table, even collectively.

00:18:37.636 --> 00:18:42.136
But I think that we have found that
if you have the word "Yes" written

00:18:42.136 --> 00:18:44.526
in your heart, you can make
almost anything happen.

00:18:44.526 --> 00:18:46.796
And I think that we're
living proof of that

00:18:47.176 --> 00:18:48.756
in our schools in New York City.

00:18:51.926 --> 00:18:53.206
&gt;&gt;Students: Hooray!

00:18:53.206 --> 00:18:54.000
