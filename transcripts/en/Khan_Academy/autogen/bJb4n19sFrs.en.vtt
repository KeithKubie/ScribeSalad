00:00:00.404 --> 00:00:02.981
 Today Nate has 100 bananas. 

00:00:02.981 --> 00:00:06.050
 He will eat two of them every day. 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.454
 Is the number of bananas left on Nate, 

00:00:10.454 --> 00:00:14.499
 the number of days that have passed? 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:16.030
 I recommend that you pause the video 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.741
 and think about it. 

00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:18.700
 Interestingly here, 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.976
 that it is not said the number of eaten bananas, 

00:00:20.976 --> 00:00:23.304
 but wonders if the number of bananas left on Nate, 

00:00:23.304 --> 00:00:26.244
 is directly proportional to the number of days that have passed. 

00:00:26.244 --> 00:00:27.777
 Let's draw a small tray here to think 

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:29.913
 on that a little more. 

00:00:29.913 --> 00:00:32.025
 Will do 

00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:34.416
 3 columns. 

00:00:35.926 --> 00:00:37.157
 In the first column 

00:00:37.157 --> 00:00:39.688
 will be the number of days that have passed. 

00:00:39.688 --> 00:00:43.449
 The number of days, 

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:47.479
 which have passed. 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:48.650
 Here we have 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.532
 the number of days that have passed. 

00:00:50.532 --> 00:00:51.553
 In the middle column 

00:00:51.553 --> 00:00:54.316
 I will write the number of bananas left on Nate. 

00:00:54.316 --> 00:00:57.428
 Remaining 

00:00:58.588 --> 00:01:01.881
 bananas. 

00:01:02.981 --> 00:01:05.044
 And here I will make a relationship between the two. 

00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:07.140
 To have a straightforward relationship, 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.267
 the relationship between the two must be constant. 

00:01:10.267 --> 00:01:12.260
 The remaining bananas. 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.072
 I will split the second column of the first one. 

00:01:16.072 --> 00:01:18.658
 The remaining bananas 

00:01:19.798 --> 00:01:24.013
 divided by 

00:01:24.013 --> 00:01:28.146
 the past days. 

00:01:28.146 --> 00:01:31.049
 Let's think a little about this. 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.531
 When it is one day, 

00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:36.621
 how many bananas will they have left? 

00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:39.245
 On the first day he will have eaten 2 bananas, 

00:01:39.245 --> 00:01:42.449
 so there will be 98 remaining bananas. 

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:44.748
 What is the attitude of the other bananas to the past days? 

00:01:44.748 --> 00:01:49.718
 Well this is 98 on 1, which will be 98. 

00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:50.715
 All right. 

00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:53.107
 When 2 days pass, 

00:01:53.107 --> 00:01:55.034
 how many bananas will they have left? 

00:01:55.034 --> 00:01:57.148
 He will eat two more bananas, 

00:01:57.148 --> 00:01:59.206
 there will be 96 

00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:00.444
 What is the attitude? 

00:02:00.444 --> 00:02:03.323
 It will be 96 to 2, 

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:07.387
 which is equal to 48. 

00:02:07.387 --> 00:02:09.500
 It is clear that this attitude is not a constant. 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.357
 It changed as we switched from one day to the next day. 

00:02:12.357 --> 00:02:14.074
 We have no constant attitude 

00:02:14.074 --> 00:02:15.956
 of the remaining bananas to the past days. 

00:02:15.956 --> 00:02:23.872
 This is not a disproportionate dependency. 

00:02:23.872 --> 00:02:25.521
 Things could have been different, 

00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:29.259
 if it had been said whether the number of bananas Nate had eaten, 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:32.852
 is directly proportional to the number of days that have passed? 

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:34.228
 Yes, of course, because 

00:02:34.228 --> 00:02:37.363
 if this is the number 

00:02:37.363 --> 00:02:39.313
 of the eaten bananas, 

00:02:39.313 --> 00:02:41.078
 then it will always be 2 in number 

00:02:41.078 --> 00:02:43.145
 of the days that have passed, so it will be 2 

00:02:43.145 --> 00:02:44.537
 and then it will be 4, 

00:02:44.537 --> 00:02:47.625
 and these relationships will always be 2. 

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:50.040
 But that's not what you are looking for. 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.362
 We want to compare the number of other bananas 

00:02:52.362 --> 00:02:54.545
 to the number of days passed.
