00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.110
AHHHH
haha just kidding

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.860
Hey everyone, Julia here for DNews

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.120
Losing a limb is never something to laugh
at.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.299
While humans can build awesome robotic arms,
other animals have their handy own way of

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.710
dealing with the problem.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.710
Like the moon jellyfish.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.910
If this ocean invertebrate loses a limb it
simply moves around the other remaining limbs.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.150
In a recent study published in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences found

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.189
that the jellyfish restore functionality in
a process the researchers call symmetrization.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.480
The jellyfish have to be perfectly symmetrical
in order to swim properly.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.120
If they can’t swim to find food or swim
away from a predator, well they’ll be swimming

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.120
with the fishes.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.190
Or… they’ll you know get eaten or something.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.660
The researchers found that the jellyfish pull
off this game of musical arms by using their

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.990
muscles to push apart the arms as widely as
possible.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.800
And the whole process is fast, like anywhere
from 12 hours to 4 days.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.830
While the moon jellyfish use symmetrization
to compensate for losing a limb or two, other

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.460
animals simply regrow their missing body parts.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.620
Most of us know that the starfish, excuse
me sea stars, can regrow their arms and in

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.480
some species, they can regrow entire bodies
out of limbs.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.880
But there’s tons of other animals out there
who can regrow limbs too.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.190
Like Salamanders, Zebrafish and even some
insects like cockroaches.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.910
But sometimes limbs aren’t always perfect
copies of the original.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.620
Like regrown tadpole tails are missing a few
nerves.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.800
But some animals go one step further, some
animals can perfectly regrow their heads.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.210
One small animal, Hydractinia, is a head above
the rest.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.560
Commonly called “snail fur” because it
grows on the shells of snails and crabs, this

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.479
tiny animal can regrow its entire head if
it gets bitten off by a hungry predator.

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.020
But they aren’t alone in this remarkable
ability.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.300
Planaria also have amazing abilities to regrow
themselves.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.130
Literally, they can reproduce asexually and
just make more copies of themselves.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.320
And these guys can also regrow their heads.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.540
But what’s weird is, in one study published
in the Journal of Experimental Biology, researchers

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.909
found that worms with regrown heads had the
same memories as before.

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:55.909
How?

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.640
Well the researchers aren’t so sure, but
think that maybe their memories get stored

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.440
in other cells in the body and then get imprinted
into the new brain when it grows.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.909
But what makes these animal’s powers of
regeneration so good?

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.340
In short, stem cells.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.750
Stem cells are undifferentiated cells which
have the ability to grow into any type of

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.999
cell or tissue.

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:16.640
All animals have these, I mean we grow body
parts from scratch as an embryo.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.700
But most mammals lose their pluripotent stem
cells, or stem cells that are general but

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.969
can grow into more specific cells later.

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:27.549
Some animals like Hydractinia and Planaria
use pluripotent stem cells to regenerate themselves.

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.010
Hydractinia keep their embryonic stem cells
for their whole lives.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.730
Whenever their heads get eaten up, stem cells
flood the neck area and start to build a new

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.730
head.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.090
But other animals have different cellular
mechanisms.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.689
In salamanders, their limbs regenerate from
adult tissue cells.

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:44.159
Basically the cells dedifferentiate and form
a mass called a blastema.

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.439
And from this structure, the cells differentiate
again and can regrow an arm or a leg.

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.780
This whole process can take anywhere from
a month to three months depending on how old

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.780
the animal is.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.980
But what’s interesting is that some researchers
like David M. Gardiner, a professor of developmental

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.760
and cell biology at the University of California-Irvine,
think that all animals might have the ability

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.510
to grow body parts of pluripotent cells.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.659
That some common ancestor that even we share
with something like the snail fur was able

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.180
to keep its stem cells well into adulthood.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.159
For some reason ours is just turned off, but
he thinks one day we’ll find the on switch.

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.790
Speaking of animals remarkable ability to
regenerate, there might an animal that can

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.790
live forever!!

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:50.569
