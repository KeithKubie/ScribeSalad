00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.800
The did it, that also will, depend on the project

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.736
&gt;&gt; Say that one more time.

00:00:05.736 --> 00:00:12.550
&gt;&gt; On average, over 50% of the time it's just kind of. Well, maybe be spent

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.890
like, combing through the data and like just,

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.420
figuring out maybe idiosyncrasies in it. And You know.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.380
You quickly apply an algorithm, you look at

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.750
it. You don't get the results you expect,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.250
so you dig in a little closer and

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.350
like see that there are these weird little kind

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.670
of edge cases that are, are ending up more

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.630
prominent in your data than you previously expected. So,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.090
you have to go back and scrape and comb

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.920
through it again, and it's just this iterative back-and-forth process.
