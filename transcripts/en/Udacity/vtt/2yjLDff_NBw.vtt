00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
When we zoom out we can start to see the curvature of the earth. Interesting.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now our experimenter, who is sort of gigantic in comparison to the earth now,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
when she drops her apple, same as before, it goes straight to the center of the earth,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but now when she throws the apple, it goes all the way over here.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Before when we were zoomed in and we were looking at a flat earth,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
the apple would have stopped right here--but it keeps going a little extra distance

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
due to the curvature of the earth. Let's zoom out one more time.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Here's our experimenter once again, and here's the center of the earth.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So, now she's really quite a giant.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Of course, if she drops the apple, it goes straight towards the center.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If she throws the apple, well, it all depends on what speed she throws it at.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If she doesn't throw it too fast, it'll follow some curved trajectory and strike the earth.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
If she throws it really, really fast, it'll leave the earth and be gone before the earth

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
has a chance to pull it back.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Now, somewhere in between these extremes

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
if she throws it at just the right speed,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
the ball will travel a certain distance and, of course, fall a little bit towards the center of the earth.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It will travel another certain distance, and of course fall again

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and keep up this process of traveling and falling and traveling and falling

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
in just such a way that the path it takes is a circular orbit around the earth,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and that's all due to an attractive force that wanted to pull the apple

00:01:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
towards the center of the earth.
