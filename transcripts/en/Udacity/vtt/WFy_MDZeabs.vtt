00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.790
1 5/8 is an example of a mixed number.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.390
Mixed numbers have both
whole numbers and fractions.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.660
In this case the whole number is the 1,
and the fraction is the 5/8.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:17.710
Any improper fraction like 13/8 can also
be written as a mixed number like 1 5/8.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.160
It works the other way around too.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.770
Any mixed number can also be
written as an improper fraction.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.430
For these numbers please indicate
whether each one is a proper fraction,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.950
an improper fraction, or a mixed number.
