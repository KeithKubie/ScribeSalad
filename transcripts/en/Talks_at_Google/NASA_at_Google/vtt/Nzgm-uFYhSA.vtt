NATALIE BATALHA: Good afternoon.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.440
The title of the talk, A
Planet for Goldilocks--

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.800
we're looking for planets
that could harbor life.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.900
In fact, government agencies
both here and abroad are

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.470
committed to finding
evidence of life beyond Earth

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.420
and are investing
a lot of resources

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.300
towards that objective.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.250
So I'm going to tell you
about one pathway-- one

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.120
possible pathway-- towards
that objective, which

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.710
is finding evidence of life on
exoplanets, planets orbiting

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.450
stars beyond Earth.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.880
And this is largely
borne out of the progress

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.240
that the Kepler Mission has
made over the last five years.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.420
Kepler is a space telescope
that was launched in 2009.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.370
It's still up there.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.960
It's still taking data.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.050
But its level one
science requirements

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.010
are almost completing.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.020
So I'll tell you
about that and how

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.075
it's changing the
landscape of this search.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.440
There are actually
three pathways

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.450
for finding evidence
of life beyond Earth.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.320
Two of them are symbolized
here through these images.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.300
So on the left, we've got an
image of the geysers erupting

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.750
from the subsurface
of Enceladus,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.080
one of the outer moons
in the solar system,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.780
and so it represents our search
for life in the solar system.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.910
Right now, we have no
indication that there

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.570
is other life in
the solar system,

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.850
but it could be lurking
in this subsurface ocean

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.690
on the satellites of
Enceladus and Europa.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.170
It could be lurking on
subsurface Mars someplace--

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.830
maybe in a subsurface cave,
or some niche on Mars.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.380
Maybe we will go to Mars and
we won't find life-- maybe

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.400
we'll find death in
the form of fossils.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.540
But that in and
of itself is going

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.920
to be very interesting,
because until now, we've

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.920
only got this one
unique tree of life

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.420
in all its particularities.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.430
And we want to know if
that kind of a tree of life

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.680
is ubiquitous in the
universe, or if it's diverse.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.410
The other image represents a
radio telescope and the idea

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.540
that you can listen for
signals in the universe,

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.900
perhaps signals that are not
astrophysical in origin--

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.680
that is, they cannot be
explained by any astrophysical

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.310
body that we know of in the
universe, and therefore,

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.520
perhaps, are an indication of
some kind of technology that

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.930
exists out in the galaxy.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.760
And this is the
famous SETI searches.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.120
SETI stands for Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.170
We have the SETI Institute
here as our neighbor

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.550
in Mountain View.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.850
But there are many different
SETI organizations.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.800
Said there's a SETI at
Berkeley, at Harvard-- they're

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.670
scattered all over the world.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.990
And this got a recent
boon by an investment

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.450
from the private sector.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.430
Yuri Milner up the hill
has invested-- or committed

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.690
to investing-- a
sizable amount of money

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.820
to rent the Green Bank Telescope
to do this kind of search

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.370
for life.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.530
But the third pathway for
finding evidence of life

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.740
emerged about 20 years ago.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.750
I was a graduate
student at the time,

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.100
and I happened to be invited to
go to a conference in Florence,

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.660
Italy, because my adviser
built this instrument that

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.890
was operating on the Keck
10-meter telescope in Hawaii.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.910
And it was there at
this conference in 1995

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.190
when a Swiss astronomer,
Michel Mayor,

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.050
announced the discovery of
the first planet orbiting

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.490
a normal star kind
of like our sun.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.920
And here's an artist's
rendering of it.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.320
It's not an actual image.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.750
Everything you see is going
to be an artist's rendering.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.660
We do not have-- well,
except for one exception,

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.140
two exceptions, which
I will show you.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.160
So this is an artist's rendering
of the planet 51 Pegasi b.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:08.550
It is a Jupiter-sized planet
orbiting tens of times closer

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.960
to its parent star than
Mercury is to our own sun.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.470
It only takes about three days
for it to orbit its star once.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.769
So it's a giant planet
orbiting very close.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.790
In our own solar system, we
have the rocky, small things

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.430
on the inside, and we've
got the giant things

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.280
on the outside, beyond
what we call the ice line.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.200
So we think of the giant
planets as occupying this space

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.700
in the cold regions
of a planetary system,

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.320
and the terrestrial planets
occupying the warm space,

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.800
and this very first example of
a planet we found completely

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.740
contradicted that paradigm.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.930
Huge surprise.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.910
Now, this is not the planet
we're looking for, right?

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.050
No solid surface, probably
doesn't have life.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.020
It's being blow-torched
by its parent star.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.610
So this is not a
planet for Goldilocks.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.750
Well, what is?

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.970
What is it that
we're looking for?

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.730
I'll talk about two things--
size and temperature.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.759
Or you could even think
of that as size and orbit.

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.550
And these are typically
the kinds of things

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.150
that we can measure when
we find an exoplanet.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.480
Size might be in the
form of maybe mass

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.240
if it's a dynamical
detection, maybe radius,

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.840
or brightness-- those are
all indications of how

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.710
big a planet is.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.855
Temperature is how
close the planet

00:05:29.855 --> 00:05:32.110
is orbiting to its parent star.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.380
So knowing something
about the planet's orbit

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.680
tells you something
about the energetics

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.870
and how much
life-enabling energy

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.440
that planet is receiving.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.690
So both of those are
important if we are

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.490
looking for life as we know it.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.130
Life here on Earth
is very diverse.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.900
But no matter how
diverse, how weird,

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.920
how lurking in some
extreme environment

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.885
it is, every single life form on
Earth has one thing in common,

00:06:04.885 --> 00:06:08.080
and that's that it's
carbon-based and uses

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.950
liquid water as the solvent
that facilitates the chemical

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.540
reactions important for life.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.000
And so this is why
there's so much

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.380
emphasis on going in
search of the water.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.910
So we're looking for
things-- for planets

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.830
that are at the
right temperature,

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.610
so that liquid water can pool
on the surface-- assuming

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.370
it has a surface-- and therein
comes the idea of size.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.830
We want planets
that are not so big

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.430
that the gravitational force
is so high that it starts

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.000
to really efficiently glob
on a bunch of hydrogen

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.360
and helium in the form
of molecules and ices

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.110
that are so common
in the universe--

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.360
hydrogen and helium being
the most common elements

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.930
in the universe.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.840
So that's what exactly
happened to the giant planets.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.430
You build up a
core, a rocky core,

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.000
and the idea is that it
gets to a certain size,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.190
and then it becomes very
efficient at accreting

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.060
on these hydrogen
and helium volatiles,

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.780
we call them, building
up an envelope

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.480
and creating a giant planet.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.210
No solid surface-- by
the time you get down

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.060
to the interesting
stuff, the stuff

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.790
that our cells are made out
of, the pressures are too high

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.640
and it's going to be difficult
to form complex molecules.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.190
OK?

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.430
That's the idea.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.160
So on the other
extreme, down here

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.060
in the bottom right corner,
is a little depiction of Mars.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.090
Probably too small.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.420
Well, why do I say that?

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:39.080
Well, if you have a very
low surface gravity,

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.640
then you could lose your
atmosphere much more easily.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.890
And in fact, that's probably
exactly what happened to Mars.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.782
Mars has evidence of
water in its past.

00:07:48.782 --> 00:07:50.240
This week, we
learned that it still

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.990
has something that's
kind of like water--

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.770
I can talk about that at the
end if you're interested.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.360
But what happens is the
sun bombards these planets

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.120
with radiation, part of which is
ultraviolet and x-ray radiation

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:10.270
that breaks up water molecules
at the top of the atmosphere.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.120
You break up those
water molecules,

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.450
and you've got hydrogen
and oxygen gas.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.030
And the hydrogen, being
the lightest element,

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.350
is very easy to escape.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.880
It escapes easily.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.280
And so you boil-- literally
boil-- away your hydrogen,

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.700
and you're left with the oxygen
that has no more hydrogen

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:30.104
to recombine with, and that's
how you lose water over time.

00:08:30.104 --> 00:08:32.270
So if the surface gravity
of a planet is really low,

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.530
that process is
really efficient.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.559
And so although Mars had water
probably three billion years

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:41.179
ago-- in fact, oceans of
water-- today, as you observe,

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:41.909
it doesn't.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:42.870
Right?

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.780
So we're looking for
that sweet spot--

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.710
again, for life as
we know it and life

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.340
that's remotely
detectable, not lurking

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.120
in some subsurface cave.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.850
So here's where the Kepler
Mission comes into play.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:00.190
Kepler, as I said,
is a space telescope.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:03.380
It's depicted here cartooned
in the bottom left-hand corner.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.230
It has a mirror about
1 meter in diameter.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.090
And it's just doing
something really,

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.480
really simple-- it's measuring
brightnesses of stars

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.180
with exquisite precision.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.160
And it has a wide
field camera that's

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.720
measuring about 190,000
stars simultaneously,

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.930
taking a brightness measurement
of every one of them

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.010
simultaneously once
every 30 minutes,

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:28.220
and it did so for four
years without stopping.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.270
And without blinking.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.310
And the idea is
when you build up

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.890
these brightness measurements
as a function of time--

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.760
and if you observe enough
stars-- the idea is

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.590
that some of those
planetary systems

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.600
are going to have orbits
that are aligned so

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.390
that the planet passes directly
between the disk of the star

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.000
and your telescope.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.830
The planet casts a shadow
out into the galaxy,

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.970
like all planets
orbiting a star-- [MUTE]

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.760
And if the alignment
is just right,

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.770
that shadow will sweep across
the face of your telescope,

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:05.930
and your telescope will
perceive it and measure it

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:10.010
as a momentary dimming of light.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.950
So that's what you see depicted
here with the green trace,

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:14.830
is this brightness dimming.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:19.150
How much it dims tells you the
size of the occulting disk,

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.870
or the planet.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.160
And then you keep measuring.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.570
And you wait, wait, wait,
wait for it to come around

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.020
and happen again.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.950
Now, you've got the
time between dimmings--

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.790
that's the orbital period.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.580
Johannes Kepler
taught us in the 1600s

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.200
that the orbital period
is directly related

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.990
to the distance between
the star and the planet.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.170
So now you know how
close to the campfire

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:45.170
you are-- that is, you know if
it's amenable for liquid water

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:50.050
to pool on the surface, or if
it's in this Goldilocks zone.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.400
Just to give you
some appreciation

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.230
for how technically
challenging this is,

00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:00.430
a dimming of light due to an
Earth-sized planet orbiting

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:05.155
a sun-like star is about
1 part per 10,000 change

00:11:05.155 --> 00:11:05.860
in brightness.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.360
OK?

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.220
So the analogy I like
to make is imagine

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.960
the very tallest skyscraper
in New York City-- it's, what,

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.550
like 80 stories
high or something?

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:15.790
Maybe it's taller by now.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:16.700
I don't know.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.380
Let's say 80 stories high.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.420
And you're staring at
this-- it's nighttime,

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.490
and just imagine that
every window is open

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:26.750
and every room has a light on.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:27.370
OK?

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.850
And one person in this
building goes to the window

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:34.580
and lowers the blinds
by about a centimeter.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.170
That's the change in
brightness we have to measure.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.090
So that means that we need
part per million precision,

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:41.950
exquisite stability
of our spacecraft

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:45.660
to move our instruments
in order to see this.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.170
That's the idea.

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:49.760
OK.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.470
So I want to give
you a bird's eye

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.180
view of what Kepler
has found so far,

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.630
and I'm doing it with
this animated plot that

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:01.410
shows the radius of the
planet on the y-axis

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:04.620
versus the orbital
period on the x-axis,

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.110
the two things that
Kepler can measure.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.170
So you see points
being added to this

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:12.971
over time, some blue points and
a smattering of pink points.

00:12:12.971 --> 00:12:14.470
These are all planets
that have been

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:19.740
discovered over the years
from missions or surveys

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.070
excepting Kepler.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:21.570
OK?

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.930
So this is the sum total of
all of our knowledge of planets

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.170
up to the present day.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:30.310
The blue points were
discovered with a method called

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:32.355
the Doppler wobble method.

00:12:32.355 --> 00:12:34.355
I can talk about that
more if you're interested.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.750
The pink points
that you see were

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:42.610
discovered with this methodology
like Kepler's that I told you

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:43.220
about.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.230
We call that transit
photometry, because the planet

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:50.890
is transiting across
the face of the star.

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.410
And so even with
ground-based telescopes,

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.890
we did start to discover
planets with this method

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.560
around the year-- it was 2000.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:04.020
The end of 1999, beginning
of 2000 was the first.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.260
So if you look at
this diagram, you

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
start to see patterns, right?

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.240
You see a little cluster
of pink points on the left,

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.580
and you see another big
swarm of blue points up

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.860
in the upper right, a
smattering of other points.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.160
There are some horizontal
lines for reference,

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.060
so you can see where planets
of different sizes would lie.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.800
And this gives you an
impression that in the galaxy,

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:33.070
small planets like Earth
are actually really rare.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:37.410
It also tells you that maybe
these very short-orbital-period

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:42.180
giant planets like 51 Peg b
might be really common, even

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.400
though we were very
surprised by their existence

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.530
when they were first discovered.

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.620
But now, I'm going to
add to this diagram

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.930
the planets that Kepler
has found over the last--

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:52.754
or in its four-year
prime mission.

00:13:52.754 --> 00:13:55.420
I'll do that with yellow points,
and this is what it looks like.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:02.390
You see the really
remarkable difference

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:05.990
that you can achieve
when you put out

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.810
a new piece of technology.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.970
We just looked at the
galaxy with new eyes,

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.830
and the veil that was
shrouding our eyes

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:19.500
to the existence of these
small planets was lifted.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.170
So what we saw before
was an observational bias

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.690
that came about because we
didn't have the sensitivity

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.140
to see them.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.180
Now, with this
detection method, we do.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.680
Yeah, that's a
really good question.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.570
Let me repeat it.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.960
He said, well, how long do
you have to observe before you

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.570
start to see planets?

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.470
And is the fact that
you have nothing

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.900
at orbital periods of
like 10,000 days because

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.700
of that finite observing window?

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.850
And the answer is absolutely.

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:48.880
Even now-- even though our
blinders have been lifted--

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:53.090
there are still observational
biases in this diagram.

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.750
All of the absence of planets
in this bottom right hand corner

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.290
is due to that
observational bias.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:02.820
Kepler observed a patch
of sky for four years.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:09.430
So in order to find an Earth
analog orbiting at 365.25 days,

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:12.430
you need to see it not
just once, but twice--

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:16.010
actually three times-- to
get a unique determination

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:17.364
of its orbital period.

00:15:17.364 --> 00:15:19.280
So that means you need
to observe for at least

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.300
three years in order to see it.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:22.800
Yes?

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:27.700
AUDIENCE: So your points were,
I guess, markedly thinner

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.170
above the Neptune line.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.635
Is that an observational bias
that you guys understand?

00:15:31.635 --> 00:15:32.510
NATALIE BATALHA: Yes.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.840
I'm going to show you-- hold
that thought, because I'm

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.585
going to show you
something that-- I'm

00:15:36.585 --> 00:15:38.440
going to try and
convince you that's not

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.665
an observational bias.

00:15:39.665 --> 00:15:40.206
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:15:40.206 --> 00:15:42.440
NATALIE BATALHA: OK?

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.310
All right.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:47.440
The other thing I guess I should
point out-- where does Earth

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.120
lie in this diagram?

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:53.790
Well, it would lie
right around here.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.740
So that's the sweet spot, right?

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.030
That's where we're headed.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.550
You can see that we do
have a smattering of points

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:04.720
down there-- those are the
hardest planets to find.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.860
In fact, if I drew a diagonal
that hugged this envelope right

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:14.080
here, these are the hardest
to find, below that diagonal.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.690
And so we're just now
reaching the nexus

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:18.850
where Earth would lie.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.628
You can see that NASA does
not over-engineer anything.

00:16:21.628 --> 00:16:23.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.960
We will have another catalog
coming out next year.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.270
And we might find a
smattering of new points

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.340
in that part of the
parameter space,

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:35.480
but I think this is
more or less what we're

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.400
going to have to work with.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.250
I should also mention that the
yellow points that you see here

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:44.300
represent over 4,000 planets.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.610
85% of them are
smaller than Neptune.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.810
In the previous sample from
the ground-based observations,

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:55.030
85% were larger than
Neptune, so very different.

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.820
OK.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:59.150
But Kepler was funded for one
very specific thing-- to answer

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:00.800
a very specific
question-- and that

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.240
is, what is the fraction
of stars in our galaxy

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.310
that host potentially
habitable Earth-sized planets?

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.000
The other way to
say that is, what

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:16.750
is the occurrence rate of small
planets in the Goldilocks zone?

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.339
So that's what we
have to quantify.

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:21.540
We will be a failure if we
don't calculate those numbers.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.420
So in that sense, Kepler
is a statistical mission.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.970
It's not about finding
the one Goldilocks planet.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.320
It's about understanding
the demographics of planets

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.530
in our galaxy, of all types.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:36.820
All right.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.270
So this is a histogram
of the same distribution.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.440
I want to talk a little
bit-- before I give you

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.810
the answer to that question
that Kepler is working to solve,

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:50.060
I want to talk a little bit
about the amazing diversity

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.435
of planets that
we've discovered.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.060
Here is a histogram of
planet size from that sample.

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.310
And what you see
in this diagram is

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:06.370
that the most common planet
right now known to humanity

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:07.870
is a kind of planet
we don't even

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.420
have in our own solar system.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:15.910
It's literally the
gray area in between.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:17.620
You've got the
rocky-- or what we

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:20.220
think is rocky stuff--
down here in brown,

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:23.090
you've got the giants
over here in blue,

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.110
and this gray area
in between is where

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:27.780
we have most of the
discoveries, and we don't

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.280
have any examples of them.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.690
What are they?

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.260
We don't know.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.580
And so we look at these.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.450
We have started to look
at these in some detail.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.290
We have followup
observations on many of them.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:44.090
Here's one example, a
planet called Kepler-10c.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:49.180
Kepler-10c is larger than
Earth by a factor of 2.35.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.710
We've actually also
measured its mass

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:53.930
with ground-based
telescopes, and we

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.440
find it's 17 times more
massive than Earth.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.760
As you would expect, right?

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.200
It's bigger, it's heavier.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.320
And then we get a
density of seven grams

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.260
per cubic centimeter.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.460
But we've looked at
another one, Kepler-138d.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.630
It's also bigger by
almost a factor of two,

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.950
but it has exactly the
same mass as Earth.

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:17.290
So what this is telling
us is that there

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:20.460
is a huge diversity
of compositions

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.170
amongst these planets.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.530
And by composition,
I mean the recipe

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.530
for making a planet-- how much
of the rocky stuff versus how

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:30.540
much of the hydrogen,
helium stuff you mix in

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.590
is very diverse.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:32.310
It ranges.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.210
It's got a huge range.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:35.860
So that's really
interesting to me.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:40.000
I want to know, is this
something I could stand on?

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.960
Is this like a big super Earth
with more real estate and lots

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.660
of water, maybe a water world?

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.330
What are the possibilities?

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.390
Maybe the water covers
the entire planet,

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.000
but it's not so deep,
so you can still

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.251
have interfaces between water
and those other elements that

00:19:56.251 --> 00:19:56.750
make life.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.220
I don't know.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.740
So this is just pointing
out that there's

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:04.050
a lot of possibility
to consider.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:09.230
Kepler has also found a class of
planets that's orbiting, also,

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:11.880
10 times closer to
its star than Mercury

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.270
is to our own solar system,
but planets that we know

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.310
are rocky, because
we've measured

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:21.300
their size-- their radius--
but also their mass.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.920
Mass divided by
volume is density.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.620
This planet, Kepler-10b,
we know is a rocky world.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.190
But it's being blow-torched
by its central star.

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:35.600
The star-facing side
has an ocean larger

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.750
than the Pacific Ocean.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:40.410
But it's an ocean of lava.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:42.700
Because the temperatures
on that star-facing side

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.630
are in excess of that
required to melt iron.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.370
Not just rock-- iron.

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:48.130
OK?

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.350
We call these lava worlds.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.470
How do we know that
it's a lava world?

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.140
Like I said, we
measure the dimming

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:58.250
of light as depicted here on the
left-- that's real Kepler data.

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:01.090
Every white point is a
brightness measurement

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:02.830
that tells us the radius.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.880
We go to our ground-based
telescopes, the Keck

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.660
10-meter telescope
in particular,

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.730
and we measured the
Doppler wobble--

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:10.480
that's what's being
depicted on the right.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.820
That gives us the mass.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.520
Mass divided by
volume is density.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:19.310
This cannot be anything else but
a rocky planet with pretty much

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:23.084
the same recipe as Earth.

00:21:23.084 --> 00:21:25.000
AUDIENCE: How do you
know it's tidally locked?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:25.958
NATALIE BATALHA: Sorry?

00:21:25.958 --> 00:21:27.875
AUDIENCE: How do you
know it's tidally locked?

00:21:27.875 --> 00:21:29.624
NATALIE BATALHA: The
question is, how do I

00:21:29.624 --> 00:21:31.100
know it's tidally locked?

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:40.150
Because in between transits-- in
between the dimmings of light--

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:44.550
we see the light output
from the whole system

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:47.980
change by about two
parts per million

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.550
and then come back down.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:56.820
What we're seeing is the day
side, night side, day side

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.380
of the planet in its orbit.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.210
So I know that there is a huge
temperature differential--

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:05.562
thousands of degrees-- between
the day and night side,

00:22:05.562 --> 00:22:06.395
and it's consistent.

00:22:06.395 --> 00:22:08.510
It doesn't change.

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:10.340
Yeah.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.820
That's a great question.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:12.800
OK.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.610
More extreme.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:16.420
There are planets-- Kepler-10b
was orbiting its star once

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.920
every 20 hours.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.300
This one, KIC blah blah blah
blah, is orbiting its star once

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.650
every like, eight hours.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:28.810
It's so hot that it's actually
disintegrating before our eyes.

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:29.310
OK?

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.350
The planet is blowing apart.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:33.810
How do we know that?

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:38.750
Well, because when we measure
the brightness very precisely

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.850
as this planet
transits the disk,

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:43.890
it doesn't have that nice
predictable shape, because

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:45.980
of that comet-like tail.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:49.580
So what you actually see
is something like this.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:50.080
Right?

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.520
It takes longer
for the brightness

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.050
to come back up on
the right-hand side,

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:58.710
because the planet has this
tail, this cometary tail.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.460
I think this is
astoundingly interesting.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.300
Because what this tells
me is I can actually

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.910
go to a telescope like Hubble or
the James Webb Space Telescope,

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:10.260
I can collect light
that's filtering

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.460
through that cometary
tail, and it's

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.000
going to leave fingerprints
of what that cometary tail is

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:15.790
made out of.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:18.530
That gives me a direct probe
into what these planets

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.020
are actually made out of.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:20.790
OK.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:24.610
Kepler proved that
George Lucas was right,

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:29.160
although he got the stars
wrong-- the wrong sizes.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:35.200
But planets do orbit
gravitationally bound stars.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.260
So this artist
rendering on the top

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:41.180
is the planet Kepler-16b
that's orbiting

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:44.180
a G-type and a K-type star.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.810
G-type stars are
these yellow stars.

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:49.030
K-type stars are
cooler and smaller,

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:52.610
and we depict them as
being more orange in color.

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:55.020
The G-type star would
be bigger, so we've

00:23:55.020 --> 00:24:01.970
got an incorrect size ratio
here for these Tatooine stars.

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:04.250
But what this tells you
is that the planet is

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:07.830
orbiting not just one of them--
it's orbiting both of them.

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:11.580
So you've got not just one
star rising in the east

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.360
and setting in the west,
but you've got two.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:18.850
Moreover, those stars
are orbiting one another,

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:22.530
gradually changing
position in the sky,

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:26.020
and they're eclipsing
one another.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:29.520
So what we actually observe
is very complex and full

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.570
of information.

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:37.110
On the upper swath are the
brightness measurements

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.850
that Kepler takes.

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:42.600
And there are some
arrows to help your eye.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.040
For example, we've
got blue-- if you

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.540
focus on the blue arrows, that's
a really huge dimming of light

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.290
that happens when
one star passes

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:53.270
in front of the other star.

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:55.355
And then, when that
star comes back around

00:24:55.355 --> 00:24:59.080
and passes in front or
behind the brighter star,

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.810
you get the yellow.

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:03.777
So you've got blue,
yellow, blue, yellow,

00:25:03.777 --> 00:25:05.360
you've got some blues
that are missing

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.880
because the spacecraft
went to sleep or something,

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.410
blue, yellow, blue,
yellow, blue, yellow, red.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:14.100
See, there's a red in there.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.370
Or a green.

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:19.570
The red and the green--
those are the planet

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:22.740
that's passing in front
of the bright star

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:26.320
or, alternatively, in
front of the green star.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.580
And it's complicated,
because these two stars

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:29.960
are moving, right?

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.910
So if you've got one star
coming around this way,

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:35.670
and the planet's coming
around this way too,

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:37.910
they're moving in tandem.

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:41.280
The dimming of light is going
to stretch out longer than

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.890
if the planet happens
to be moving around

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:45.710
while the other star
is moving behind

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.385
in the opposite direction.

00:25:47.385 --> 00:25:49.135
Now, they're going in
opposite directions,

00:25:49.135 --> 00:25:52.380
and that dimming of light
is going to be short.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.380
So that's a very rich
amount of information

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.770
from which we can ascertain
the masses of the planets

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:02.950
and also the masses
of the stars involved.

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:06.640
OK, these are Kepler orrerys.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.660
Many of the stars
that Kepler observes

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:16.760
have not just one sequence
of dimmings, of transits,

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:20.240
but multiple
sequences of transits.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.260
So these are multiple
planetary systems,

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.250
and what we have
learned is that there

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:30.470
is a class or an architecture
of planets whereby-- that's

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:35.400
a little bit different than the
solar system that we live in.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.000
You know that planets in our own
solar system orbit in a disk,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
right?

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.100
So you can think of
that disk as a pancake.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.220
These planets that are
plotted here for you

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:51.020
are dynamically compact systems.

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.090
These are planets
that are orbiting

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:55.910
pretty close to one
another, so that's

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:58.090
why we call them compact.

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:03.260
And in these scenarios,
the disk is so flat--

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:05.150
if our solar system
were a pancake,

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:07.230
this would be like a crepe.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:09.370
They're exquisitely flat.

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:12.300
So it's intrinsically a
different architecture

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.800
than we see in our
own solar system,

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.780
and that's a clue
telling us something

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:20.362
about how these systems
form, and how they evolve.

00:27:20.362 --> 00:27:21.820
How they interact
with one another.

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:27.270
Finally, the Goldilocks planets.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:29.530
I wanted to say something
about which planets--

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:31.340
how many of those
planets we find

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.300
are indeed in this
Goldilocks Zone.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.010
Here's another scatter plot.

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:40.220
On the y-axis, we have
the surface temperature

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.140
of the central star.

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:45.410
Remember, stars come in
different masses and sizes

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:48.120
and luminosities.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.630
On the top, we have
stars like our sun--

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:53.060
these are those K-type
stars-- and on the bottom,

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:57.480
we have the tiny M-type starts.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.780
And so the green band
is the Goldilocks Zone,

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.760
where the energy you receive
on the surface of the planet

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:06.470
is amenable for liquid water.

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.620
So you can see that we
have a few dozen that

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.500
have been discovered
so far that are smaller

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.390
than twice the size of Earth.

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:17.330
So that's the sample that
we're really focusing on.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:21.440
That's the sample that's
going to allow us to calculate

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.500
the fraction of
stars in our galaxy

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.215
that host small, potentially
habitable planets.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:31.830
OK.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:32.460
Let's see.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:36.020
I can show you a
couple of examples.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:39.180
This is one system-- one
of those Goldilock planets,

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.290
Kepler-186.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.950
So you've got a cartoon
of the solar system

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:47.160
on the bottom that shows the
green band where the Goldilocks

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.830
Zone is, right?

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:52.490
Kepler-186 is orbiting one of
these really low-mass stars,

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:54.870
what we call an M dwarf.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:57.930
So if you want to be in the
Goldilocks Zone for an M dwarf,

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:01.190
you've got to cozy
up next to that star.

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:03.850
So you see that the
green band is really

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:06.060
in a much tighter radius.

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:10.570
So the planet Kepler-186f,
which is the Goldilocks planet,

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:14.350
is orbiting with a much
shorter orbital period.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:16.780
And there are people
who argue that that

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.836
is going to be
difficult for life,

00:29:18.836 --> 00:29:20.210
because when you
get planets that

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:22.020
are orbiting so
close to their star,

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.400
they can become tidally locked.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.060
Right?

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:28.090
They're more susceptible to the
ultraviolet and x-ray emission

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:30.380
that's coming off
of stars, especially

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:36.150
like M stars that emit lots
of that kind of radiation.

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:40.410
But then in July, we had
another exciting announcement.

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:45.940
It's now touted as the exoplanet
most like Earth, Kepler-452b.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.560
Here's a split screen.

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.660
On the left represents
our Sun and Earth,

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:54.650
and on the right
represents Kepler-452b.

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:59.290
On the left side of
the star, or if you

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:02.050
compare these two
in the middle there,

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.810
you can see that
the stars themselves

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:05.830
are very similar in size.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:08.770
In fact, they are
the exact same mass.

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:11.720
But Kepler-452 is older.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.930
It's probably more like
six billion years old

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:17.450
compared to our Sun,
which is about 4 and 1/2

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:18.250
billion years old.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:21.570
So it's a little older,
but otherwise very similar.

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:27.620
And they orbit with very
similar periods, Earth at 365,

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:30.660
and Kepler-452b at 385.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.375
So they're receiving
very-- they've

00:30:32.375 --> 00:30:35.760
got very similar energetics.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:39.320
The strongest difference
is that Kepler-452b

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:43.540
is 1.6 times the
size of the Earth.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.200
Is that important for life?

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.340
I don't know.

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:48.700
1.6 is kind of the
dividing line, where

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:52.370
you start to get big enough
that you start to glob

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:54.440
on this hydrogen and helium.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.840
But the jury is still out.

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.740
It seems like that's kind
of a transition region.

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:02.870
So this could be an Earth
with more real estate.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:03.480
I don't know.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.680
Maybe an Earth with
even more water.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.570
Maybe it's even more amenable
to life than our own planet--

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:09.340
I don't know.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:12.520
OK.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.950
So now I want to say a
little bit about statistics.

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:17.800
What is this answer
that we're looking

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.940
for with regards to the fraction
of stars that host potentially

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.280
habitable planets?

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:28.530
This yellow cone shows
you Kepler's search space.

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:31.960
We're searching out about 3,000
light-years along the Orion

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:37.860
Spur, so along a spiral arm
centered on the sun there.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.730
And so I'm going to do a
little thought experiment.

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:45.100
Well, let me first show
you this histogram again.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.300
You saw this
histogram once before.

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.800
This is just the number of
planets, and each of these bars

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.230
represents a different size.

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:56.220
Now, what I'm going to do is
I'm going to try and correct

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.470
for all of my
observational biases

00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:02.550
in order to transform this
into the true fraction of stars

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:07.170
that are in the galaxy for
these same size [? bins. ?] OK?

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:10.920
And this will speak to that
question we got earlier-- who

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.780
was it that asked about-- Yeah.

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:16.550
Are these giant planets
really, truly rare?

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:18.540
So I do that correction,
and I'll just

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:19.970
toggle between the two.

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:26.380
See?

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.270
That's the bias correction.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:31.550
So the small planets that
are really hard to find,

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:35.260
I have less sensitivity, so the
correction is larger for them.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:37.760
The large planets, though,
hardly change at all.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.290
That's because I have
100% completeness.

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:41.870
My survey is complete for them.

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:43.740
The statistics don't change.

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:48.250
So this scale tells
you that the frequency

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:51.980
of giant planets like Jupiter
in these warm interiors

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:58.270
of planetary systems are
an order of magnitude

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:01.730
smaller than for the
Earth-sized planets.

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:04.310
So this tells us that small
planets-- at least orbiting

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:09.270
within an Earth-like orbit-- are
much more common than Neptunes

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:11.570
and giant planets.

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:12.070
OK.

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:13.730
So what does that translate to?

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:17.360
Well, I'm going to ask
the question-- given

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:22.190
these statistics, where
is the nearest potentially

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:24.555
habitable Earth-sized planet?

00:33:24.555 --> 00:33:28.360
How far out do I
have to go find one?

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:31.280
So here's the Milky Way
galaxy, a cartoon of it

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.819
depicted from the top down.

00:33:32.819 --> 00:33:34.360
And what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:38.500
to scale the continental
United States to that size.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.420
And here we are on the
shore of the Pacific,

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.330
and you're turning
east, and let's

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:46.130
look across the
continental United States

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:49.490
and ask ourselves, where is the
nearest potentially habitable

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:51.525
exoplanet likely to be?

00:33:51.525 --> 00:33:59.300
And the answer is right about
there at the tennis courts.

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.550
It's very close.

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:05.720
The answer is three parsecs,
or about 10 light-years,

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.070
with 95% confidence.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.300
So this makes the galaxy
seem like a smaller place,

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.830
don't you think?

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:18.320
This makes the idea of actually
going and visiting these places

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.219
a little more tangible.

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:21.270
Right?

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:26.980
It makes the search for life
seem all the more feasible.

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:29.480
And in fact, we
know how to do this.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.929
We know what to do.

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:32.790
We know what
technology milestones

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:36.299
have to be met in order to do
this within the next 30 years

00:34:36.299 --> 00:34:40.670
even-- to look at
these planets and look

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:43.830
for indications of life.

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:44.780
OK.

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:46.635
Another way just to
drive this point home--

00:34:46.635 --> 00:34:48.260
I don't know if you
can see it-- but in

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.130
this little yellow bullseye,
in the very center,

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:52.494
there's a red dot.

00:34:52.494 --> 00:34:54.831
Do you see it?

00:34:54.831 --> 00:34:55.330
All right.

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:57.880
That red dot is
about 10 parsecs,

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.740
or about 33
light-years in radius.

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.470
This is a 3D
animation of the stars

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:07.650
within that radius, 10 parsecs.

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:08.510
OK?

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:15.230
There are about 350 stars
and like 250 stellar systems,

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:16.580
250 plus.

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:19.350
240 of them are like
these M-type stars,

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:20.520
these cool M-type stars.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.910
About 20 are stars
like our own Sun.

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:25.480
Those are colored yellow.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.140
The M dwarfs are colored red.

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:34.440
Like I said, that's 10
parsecs, or 33 light-years.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.410
That's a factor of three larger
than the distance I just gave

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:39.630
you of 10 light-years, right?

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:42.100
So volume [? scales ?]
are acute.

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.900
That's a factor of 27 in volume.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:49.250
So if there's one planet, at
least, within 10 light-years,

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:52.280
there's 27 times that in
this tiny little volume

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.410
that was just that
little red dot.

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:57.720
So these are the stars
that we want to target.

00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.540
This is what we want to explore.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:02.360
I would argue we want to go out
about another factor of three

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:05.090
in diameter, because I
want more yellow points.

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:09.850
I want more stars like
our own Sun to probe.

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:15.690
And there is where we're going
to focus our search for life.

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:18.780
And let me just highlight.

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.337
We're done working
up to the present,

00:36:21.337 --> 00:36:22.920
and now for the
remainder of the talk,

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:27.370
I want to tell you a little bit
about my dream for the future.

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:29.170
But let's just reflect here.

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:32.200
All of this has come about,
and this search for life

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:38.600
has become within our grasp
just over the last 20 years.

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:43.260
Between 51 Peg b
and Kepler-452b,

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.620
we have grown
orders of magnitude

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:52.840
in orbital period, mass,
radius, radiation, energy,

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.730
all of these parameters.

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:58.380
We've gotten very close
to finding true Goldilocks

00:36:58.380 --> 00:36:59.760
planets.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:03.060
So now the task
at hand is to move

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:05.730
from finding planets
in the habitable zone

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:09.240
to finding habitable
environments-- to find

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.700
truly habitable environments.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:14.210
And that will occupy us
over this next 20 years.

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:17.970
So let me say a little bit
about that future search.

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:22.630
This is NASA's portfolio--
just one government agency's

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:24.650
portfolio.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:27.990
Kepler, you can see,
is here in the middle.

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:31.620
We've got two missions that
I'll talk about together-- TESS

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.870
and JWST, very briefly.

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:37.530
In the upper right
is a mission called

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:40.650
WFIRST, which I think I'll
skip over a little bit.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:43.390
It's another
demographics mission.

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:47.020
It's going to speak to the
demographics of planets

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:51.230
not within an Earth orbit,
but beyond an Earth orbit.

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:54.930
So after that mission, we
will have a complete census

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:59.580
of plants in the galaxy-- not
a census, but demographics.

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.490
A representative sample.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:04.370
And then I will end by talking
about what's listed here

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:07.730
as a notional mission and
we're calling the New Worlds

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:08.560
Telescope.

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:12.640
This is what is
being studied-- will

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.980
be studied over the
next five years--

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.430
as we develop mission concepts.

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.930
OK.

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:20.870
But first, TESS and JWST.

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:23.580
Just to remind you-- this
is Kepler's search space,

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.630
that yellow cone of
light that goes off

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:28.550
into the spiral
arm of the galaxy,

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:33.860
looking out 3,000 light-years
but at one patch of sky,

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:35.710
without blinking.

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:42.220
0.25% of the whole angular
area of the sky, right?

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.050
Just one swath.

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:46.190
TESS is a mission
very much like Kepler.

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:48.470
It's going to do
transit photometry.

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:51.860
But it's going to survey
the entire sky out

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.910
to like, 200 light-years.

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:55.810
So it's going to
look everywhere.

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:59.270
It's going to have to do that
with a step and stare approach.

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:02.600
It can't stay fixed
at one spot at a time.

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.410
It's going to have
to move around.

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:08.080
That means that it
will only catch planets

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:11.800
with orbital periods of
like, 80 days and less, so

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:15.210
short-period things,
but they'll be nearby.

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:16.810
And the reason
this is interesting

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:18.800
is because these
nearby stars will

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.170
be amenable to
characterization studies

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:26.310
afterwards with the James
Webb Space Telescope.

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:28.810
The James Webb Space
Telescope is the successor

00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:30.250
to the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:32.390
It launches in 2018.

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:34.390
And the James Webb
Space Telescope

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:37.940
will be capable of
determining what's

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:42.240
in the atmosphere of
some of these planets.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.130
So here's the idea.

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:47.910
This is the planet Venus,
transiting in front of our Sun.

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:57.050
If you look carefully, you can
see a very thin yellow line

00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:59.010
that hugs the planet.

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:00.800
Can you see that?

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.440
Especially where
you have contrast

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.550
in the upper left-hand corner
against the black background.

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:07.740
That's the atmosphere.

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:10.350
Very tiny thin atmosphere--
the scale height

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:12.390
is like, five kilometers.

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:15.500
The total area that that
atmosphere intercepts is like,

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:20.040
1/200th the area of the
disk of the planet itself.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.180
It's very, very thin.

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:26.350
So what James Webb will try to
do with the transiting planets

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:32.640
that TESS finds is it will
observe the planet when it's

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:37.110
in front of the star, it will
see the star light filtering

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:41.380
through that very thin
haze of an atmosphere,

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:44.800
that atmosphere will leave
a fingerprint upon the light

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.760
that the James Webb
Telescope will catch.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.530
It will spread that
light out into a spectrum

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:52.680
and look for the
chemical fingerprints

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:56.610
of what the atmosphere
is actually made out of.

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:58.400
And here's a
cartoon illustrating

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.730
an example of that.

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:04.100
The James Webb Space
Telescope will do this

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:09.830
in spades for the
sub-Neptune super-Earths,

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:11.760
those planets in the
gray area that we

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.170
don't know anything about.

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:14.947
It's going to knock
that out of the park.

00:41:14.947 --> 00:41:16.780
We're going to know all
about those planets.

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.238
We're going to know what their
atmospheres are made out of.

00:41:19.238 --> 00:41:20.420
It's going to be great.

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:22.650
I don't suspect
that James Webb is

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:25.110
going to be able to do this
without a huge investment

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:30.240
in resources for the Goldilocks
planets that are really tiny.

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.290
For that, we need a
different methodology.

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:35.090
The planets are just too
small, the atmospheres

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:39.170
are too thin-- we just don't
have enough photons to be

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:41.980
able to see the signatures.

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:44.760
So for that, we're going to
need something different.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:48.530
And imagine-- I mean just
think-- OK, here you're

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:51.210
getting fingerprint
from the photons that

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:53.996
happen to pass through this
tiny, little, narrow strip.

00:41:53.996 --> 00:41:56.370
What if I could get all the
photons that are bouncing off

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:58.130
the whole surface?

00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:01.050
Like reflecting off of
the whole entire surface.

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:03.440
That's a much
bigger area, right?

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.920
That just, in theory,
has to be easier.

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:11.750
And, indeed, it is-- if you
can take an image of a planet.

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.140
But you have to be able to
take a picture of a planet.

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:14.800
Right?

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:19.040
This is tremendously difficult.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:21.370
So now, let me talk about
the New Worlds Telescope,

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:24.510
because that is the objective
of the New Worlds Telescope.

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:27.830
And here's the technical issue.

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:30.900
Trying to find a planet
orbiting a star-- like taking

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:33.230
a picture of it-- is
like trying to see

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:37.530
a gnat next to a searchlight.

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:41.630
The glare of the searchlight--
or the star, in this case--

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:45.650
it's 10 billion times the
light that's coming off

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:47.310
the surface of the planet.

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:50.760
So these planets are
literally lost in the glare.

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:55.100
In order to accomplish
this, we have to block out

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.880
the glare of the star.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.860
It's analogous to going
outside on a starry night.

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:02.787
You walk out, you want
to look up at the sky--

00:43:02.787 --> 00:43:05.172
maybe when you guys saw the
eclipse the other night--

00:43:05.172 --> 00:43:07.915
and you look up in the
sky, and you see nothing.

00:43:07.915 --> 00:43:09.915
Because you've got all
these bright streetlights

00:43:09.915 --> 00:43:11.080
in front of you.

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:13.900
All you have to do is put your
hand in front of a streetlight.

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:17.080
Your pupils dilate out,
and you can see the stars.

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:19.150
So you just block
out the light source,

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:21.210
and then you can see
what's behind it.

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:22.970
That's what we're trying to do.

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:24.820
There are two ways
of doing this,

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:28.200
and we're doing technology
development on both right now,

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.790
and we've made a
lot of progress.

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:33.010
So I'm going to show
you two videos that

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:36.370
illustrate the technology.

00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:38.850
The first one has
audio, so I assume

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:40.994
that the audio is working.

00:43:40.994 --> 00:43:42.660
So I'm going to go
ahead and start that.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:48.350
If I can find the cursor.

00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:50.518
There it is.

00:43:50.518 --> 00:43:51.184
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:51.184 --> 00:43:53.108
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.320
-A distant star is
orbited by two planets.

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:14.450
One looks similar to the Earth--
the other is a gas giant.

00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:16.840
When viewed from a
distance, the two planets

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.620
disappear into the
glare of their sun.

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:22.080
How could we ever find
these planets all the way

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.470
from the Earth?

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:26.260
By using a space telescope
with a coronagraph

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:30.080
to separate starlight
from planet light.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.550
As the star's light passes
through the telescope's

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:36.030
large mirrors, it picks
up small distortions.

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:40.090
Diffraction adds concentric
rings to the image we see.

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:42.740
To reveal the planets,
first, the coronagraph

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:45.590
uses a mask to block
much of the star's light

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:49.350
and redirect the remaining
light to the outer edges.

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:51.420
A washer-shaped
device can now block

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:54.650
most of the rest of
the star's light.

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:57.580
Because the planet's light
comes in at an angle,

00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:00.480
it misses the mask and
passes through the center

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.410
of the washer.

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:03.960
But when we turn
up the image signal

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.150
by collecting more
light, we can see

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:08.750
that the planets are
still hidden under blobs

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:10.940
of leftover starlight.

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:13.070
To remove these
blobs, the coronagraph

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:15.470
has a special
deformable mirror that

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:19.100
can change shape by using
hundreds of tiny pistons.

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:22.460
This can correct distortions
in the light beam.

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:26.360
As the mirror deforms, the blobs
of light as seen in the monitor

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:30.120
slowly begin disappearing,
finally revealing the brighter

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.200
of the two planets.

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:36.810
Afterwards, the fainter
planet also comes into view.

00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:40.180
We can now see objects more
than a billion times fainter

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:42.270
than the star.

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:43.800
And if the light
from these planets

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:46.920
is passed through a prism,
we can spread it out

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:49.560
into rainbows of color.

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:51.390
But some colors are missing.

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:55.250
They were absorbed by gases
in each planet's atmosphere,

00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:58.810
giving us important clues
about their composition.

00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:00.760
The search for life
in the universe

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.740
has taken a new step forward.

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:07.927
[END PLAYBACK]

00:46:07.927 --> 00:46:10.010
NATALIE BATALHA: I never
get tired of seeing that.

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:10.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:12.430
It gives me goosebumps.

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:13.070
OK.

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:16.110
That's coronagraphy,
a coronagraph,

00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:18.750
where you put something
in the light path

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:22.050
to block out-- just like your
thumb-- block out the light.

00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:24.840
The problem is that stars
create this diffraction when

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.950
they come into your telescope,
and you saw that, right?

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:31.560
Now, there are technology
hurdles to accomplishing this.

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:34.770
One, for example--
during that process,

00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:36.460
where you've got the
pistons, and you're

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:37.950
adjusting the
shape of the mirror

00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:40.340
and making all of these
subtle corrections--

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:43.320
during that process, you
need pointing stability down

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:45.360
to like a picometer.

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.640
Really, really exceptional
pointing stability.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.950
So that's one technology hurdle.

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:53.160
Another technology hurdle
is that well, OK, fine--

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:56.051
but you still need to
collect enough photons.

00:46:56.051 --> 00:46:57.550
These things are
really, really dim.

00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:00.020
I need a huge
photon bucket, which

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:02.890
means a big, gigantic mirror.

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:05.770
The only way we're going to get
a big, gigantic 10-meter dish

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:09.320
mirror out into space is by
making it segmented and folding

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:11.070
it up into your rocket ferry.

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:11.880
Right?

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.470
The problem is that
when you do that,

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:15.130
when you make a
segmented mirror,

00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:18.710
all of that diffraction that
you saw that makes the rings

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:20.230
is different.

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:24.110
So we have to learn how to do
this with segmented mirrors.

00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:27.200
We have to learn how to
achieve that picometer

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.441
stability in the pointing, in
the thermal sensitivity, all

00:47:30.441 --> 00:47:30.940
of that.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.230
It's really going
to be challenging.

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:36.990
Now, you can simplify
that if you figure out

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:40.820
a way to hold a giant thumb out
into space instead of putting

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:43.400
it in your optical path.

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.470
If I can put a giant
thumb out in space,

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:47.180
it's going to make
it much more simple.

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:48.920
I'm taking it out
of the optical path,

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:51.870
and I don't have to worry
about that wavefront control.

00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:52.980
And we're trying that.

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:54.880
This is called
starshade technology,

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:58.050
and this is the next video.

00:47:58.050 --> 00:47:59.260
Here, there's no audio.

00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:03.340
What you're seeing is
a probe class starshade

00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:06.970
that is unfurling and
creating a shape that

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:08.990
looks like a sunflower.

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:12.760
It has that special sunflower
shape because of the way

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.180
that we want it to
control diffraction.

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:17.000
But the idea is
that you're going

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.130
to fly this thing independently
some tens of thousands

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:23.290
of kilometers away, so
that it gets really tiny

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:26.020
and perfectly blocks
out the starlight.

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:28.360
You're going to have
another space telescope that

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:32.010
is doing telemetry or
metrology to communicate

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:35.420
with the starshade and get it
perfectly pointed and aligned,

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:39.420
and hold it there, steady--
like a giant thumb up in space--

00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:43.284
so that you can see the
planets it lost in the glare.

00:48:43.284 --> 00:48:45.700
Two different technologies
that each have their advantages

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:47.410
and disadvantages.

00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:49.300
The disadvantage of
this one, although it

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:52.730
made the optics really
simple-- much more simple--

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:56.250
the problem is that it's tens
of thousands of kilometers away,

00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:58.360
and now you want to
point over there and look

00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:00.180
for a planet over
there, and you've

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:05.520
got to sit there and wait while
the starshade makes the journey

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:07.120
from one place to another.

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:09.920
So you lose a lot of time.

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:13.940
But if the telescope can stay
observing something else--

00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:17.090
making other astrophysics
contributions

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:19.490
while you're waiting
for that slew time--

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:21.680
maybe that's
something worth doing.

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.340
So those are the
two technologies.

00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:26.740
I wanted to show you that,
indeed, we've already done this

00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:30.250
from the ground, albeit not
for small, Earth-sized planets

00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:32.027
in the Goldilocks Zone.

00:49:32.027 --> 00:49:34.110
There was an announcement
just about a month ago--

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:36.930
the first planet
discovered by an instrument

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:41.350
called the Gemini
Planet Imager, GPI.

00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:43.240
The Gemini Planet Imager.

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:46.000
Here is the image
from that telescope.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.820
You see the concentric rings.

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:52.640
That's the Eri pattern due
to the diffraction-- just

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.640
the remnant Eri pattern.

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:58.720
But here's the planet, 51 Eri b.

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:02.460
This was another
system-- I can't remember

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:04.230
which instrument discovered it.

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:09.140
I think Keck-- and here, you
see one, two, three planets.

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:11.570
But what you also see, because
we've been observing this

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:14.970
for so long, is you see
the planets actually moving

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:16.320
in their orbits.

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:18.410
Now, you've got some
dynamical information

00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:21.920
to tell you something about
the masses of these planets.

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.070
So this is really
promising, right?

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:25.900
This looks great.

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:28.250
But just one caveat
that what you're seeing

00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:31.289
there are planets larger than
Jupiter, younger than Jupiter,

00:50:31.289 --> 00:50:33.080
so they're hotter than
Jupiter, and they're

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:36.390
orbiting tens of times
further out than Jupiter.

00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:39.000
So here is what our own
solar system would look

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.310
like with such an instrument.

00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:43.120
Actually, a better instrument.

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:47.820
And Jupiter and Saturn,
OK, we can do that.

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:51.010
What we want to achieve,
though, is find the Earths there

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:53.420
in this annulus.

00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:56.740
So that's why it requires
a space-based telescope

00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:58.580
to get above the atmosphere.

00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:01.390
It also requires a very
large light bucket,

00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:03.930
because these things
are going to be faint.

00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:07.350
And so this is what
we're talking about.

00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:11.340
We've got the Hubble down here--
dwarfed in the lower left-hand

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:15.470
corner-- the Hubble 2.4-meter
telescope next to Goldilocks

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:16.260
there.

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:20.490
James Webb, its successor,
at 6.5 meters in diameter.

00:51:20.490 --> 00:51:25.020
But what we are proposing--
our moonshot right now--

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:29.590
is a 10- to 12-meter
class telescope that

00:51:29.590 --> 00:51:34.870
will have the capability
of seeing this tiny annulus

00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:37.240
and collecting enough
photons so that we

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.686
can search for biomarkers.

00:51:39.686 --> 00:51:41.604
AUDIENCE: How cheaply
can you actually build

00:51:41.604 --> 00:51:42.520
a telescope like that?

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:43.010
NATALIE BATALHA: What's that?

00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:44.843
AUDIENCE: How cheaply
can you actually build

00:51:44.843 --> 00:51:45.860
a telescope like that?

00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:48.680
NATALIE BATALHA: How
cheaply can you build it?

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:53.250
The good news is the cost
per unit collecting area

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:56.570
of telescopes is going down.

00:51:56.570 --> 00:51:59.050
So they do get cheaper
as you learn more

00:51:59.050 --> 00:52:00.740
and as you build them.

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:03.170
But they're still
extraordinarily expensive.

00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:07.412
So if I were to project out a
couple of decades as to when

00:52:07.412 --> 00:52:08.870
we would start to
build this thing,

00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:12.180
I would guess-- I could posit a
guess that it would cost about

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:14.440
the same as the
James Webb Telescope

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:19.250
does now, something on the
order of $5 to $10 billion.

00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:21.720
Yeah.

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.797
I'm sorry, did I
shock you there?

00:52:23.797 --> 00:52:24.611
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:24.611 --> 00:52:28.120
Come on, this is Google.

00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:29.290
OK.

00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:29.900
Let's see.

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:32.200
Why such a large telescope?

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.930
I can answer those questions
if you're interested.

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:37.160
Just to say that what
we really want to do,

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:39.700
as you saw in the video,
is take a spectrum

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:43.045
and look for the presence
of all of those gases

00:52:43.045 --> 00:52:47.050
that are emitted by complex
life forms on planet Earth

00:52:47.050 --> 00:52:51.590
as they metabolize food into
energy-- things like methane,

00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:55.270
oxygen, respiration
processes, all of those things

00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:57.700
that are indication
not just of a planet

00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:00.370
but of an actual living world.

00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:01.920
Again, this is possible.

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.080
It's not limited
by what we know,

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:08.230
it's not limited by technology--
it's just simply limited

00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:09.010
by resources.

00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:11.980
So with enough time, we
will accomplish this.

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:13.920
Could be maybe not
in my lifetime,

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:16.940
but certainly in my children
or grandchildren's lifetime,

00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:19.060
I think that this is
going to happen-- where

00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:23.390
one day, soon, we will know for
certain that life does or does

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:26.200
not exist beyond Earth.

00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:28.280
So that's where we're headed.

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:33.380
And I'll end with the
beautiful retro travel posters

00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:38.000
that JPL created for these
worlds of our imagination

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:44.300
that actually do exist, just
with quite not so much color.

00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:45.379
Yet.

00:53:45.379 --> 00:53:46.670
All right, thank you very much.

00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:47.961
I'd be happy to take questions.

00:53:47.961 --> 00:53:50.145
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:54.992
AUDIENCE: I recently
read that you

00:53:54.992 --> 00:53:59.910
should be able to detect the
glare of a water-covered planet

00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:04.310
going in front of the star
that they orbit around.

00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:07.980
Would Kepler be able to see
this, or any of the satellites

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:10.340
that are proposed?

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:13.030
NATALIE BATALHA: So
to detect the glare--

00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:15.770
so when you say glare,
to me you're implying

00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:17.160
reflected light.

00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.840
So light that's
coming from the star

00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:21.710
is bouncing off of a
shiny surface right?

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:23.280
And we see that.

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:27.690
And so the question is, is
that possible with Kepler?

00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:34.970
We do see some phase functions
as planets are orbiting around.

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:38.500
The kind of specular reflection
that you're talking about

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:41.920
would happen at precise moments.

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:45.090
We see these kinds
of phase functions

00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:48.390
for mostly giant planets
that are heated on one side

00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:53.160
compared to the other,
so I don't know.

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:58.200
I'm not aware of any
such a detection.

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:00.020
We will do this in the future.

00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:03.260
I think that our best bet
is to do the transmission

00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:06.500
spectroscopy between
TESS and JWST,

00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:08.301
see the light come
through the atmosphere--

00:55:08.301 --> 00:55:09.800
so you're not talking
about a glare,

00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:12.130
you're talking
about transmission--

00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:16.790
and hopefully see
evidence of water vapor.

00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:19.370
Whether or not we'll have
the kind of situation--

00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:22.830
I'm not even sure water
worlds exist in entirety,

00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:27.076
but certainly oceans-- the
kind of specular reflection

00:55:27.076 --> 00:55:29.450
that happens quickly when
you're just at the right angle,

00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:32.310
I think, is going to be
very difficult to find.

00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:32.890
Yeah.

00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:34.870
Just thinking out loud here.

00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:36.980
AUDIENCE: Direct
imaging-- is it easier

00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:40.010
to just do the reflected
light from the star,

00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:42.340
or the transmission
from the planet

00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:43.477
based on its temperature?

00:55:43.477 --> 00:55:44.310
NATALIE BATALHA: OK.

00:55:44.310 --> 00:55:47.167
So the direct image emissions
are reflected light off

00:55:47.167 --> 00:55:48.750
of the surface, but
they can also be--

00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:49.680
and this is where
I thought you were

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:52.520
going with that question-- they
can also be thermal emission.

00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:54.600
That is, the warmth
of the planet

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:58.300
itself-- like in the case
of the multi-planet system

00:55:58.300 --> 00:55:59.730
from direct imaging
that you saw--

00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:02.080
that was enabled by the
fact that the planets are

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:04.710
young and hot, so they're
emitting thermal radiation

00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:06.470
and you're seeing
that emission as well.

00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:08.350
AUDIENCE: Well, and the contrast
between the star and the planet

00:56:08.350 --> 00:56:10.410
would vary based on which
wavelength you're looking at--

00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:10.560
NATALIE BATALHA: Absolutely.

00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:10.905
That's right.

00:56:10.905 --> 00:56:12.090
AUDIENCE: --and based
on the temperature, too.

00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:12.670
NATALIE BATALHA: That's correct.

00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:14.086
AUDIENCE: So if
it would be easier

00:56:14.086 --> 00:56:16.480
to look for really hot
planets close in because--

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:16.648
NATALIE BATALHA: Ah.

00:56:16.648 --> 00:56:16.760
I see.

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:18.634
AUDIENCE: They're emitting
a radiation length

00:56:18.634 --> 00:56:20.960
that the star doesn't emit
at as much as it normally--

00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:23.340
NATALIE BATALHA: Yeah, but
see, when they're close in,

00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:25.510
you have a resolution problem.

00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:28.017
One of the other reasons why
you need a big telescope even

00:56:28.017 --> 00:56:29.850
to see the Goldilocks
Zone is because you're

00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:32.490
trying to separate-- you're
trying to be able to resolve

00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:34.580
a planet next to a star, right?

00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:37.730
And so resolution is
proportional to the diameter

00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:38.870
of the telescope.

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:41.470
So the closer in
you want to see,

00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:43.620
the higher resolution
you're going to need,

00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:45.810
and we're already really
hard-pressed to do that

00:56:45.810 --> 00:56:48.670
for an Earth out at 365 days.

00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:51.150
So if you want to do something
for planets that are even

00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:53.210
closer, you have two choices.

00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:55.064
Either you do
transmission spectroscopy

00:56:55.064 --> 00:56:56.480
in the way that
you've mentioned--

00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:59.830
but that, of course, only works
if you have the right geometry.

00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:02.020
Or the other
alternative-- and I think

00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:06.200
this is going to
happen-- on the ground,

00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:09.450
we are already building
30-meter telescopes, so

00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:12.860
telescopes that are three
times bigger in diameter,

00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:17.140
27 times more collecting area,
and you get the same benefit

00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:18.300
with resolution.

00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:20.860
So now you have the
possibility of seeing

00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:25.090
the habitable zone of the M-type
stars, which are closer in.

00:57:25.090 --> 00:57:27.370
You can't do that with a
10-meter class telescope

00:57:27.370 --> 00:57:29.807
even in space, because you
just don't have the resolution.

00:57:29.807 --> 00:57:31.890
But with the 30-meter
telescopes from the ground--

00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:34.306
if we can work out the rest
of the technology challenges--

00:57:34.306 --> 00:57:36.750
we might be able to do it.

00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:39.400
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
the orientation.

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:41.150
Do you find that it's
typically consistent

00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:43.810
that we tend to be with
the disk of the galaxy,

00:57:43.810 --> 00:57:45.670
or are they pretty
randomly oriented?

00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:47.878
NATALIE BATALHA: Yeah, that's
a really good question.

00:57:47.878 --> 00:57:50.350
The question is, do we have
any preferential geometry

00:57:50.350 --> 00:57:54.010
in the galaxy with
these orbital planes?

00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:58.220
And the answer's no-- that
they're all cattywampus,

00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:00.850
randomly distributed.

00:58:00.850 --> 00:58:03.940
AUDIENCE: Would there be any
disadvantage, or advantage

00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:07.660
or disadvantage, to something,
a telescope based on the moon,

00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:09.670
so you have something
solid to put it on

00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:11.257
and still no atmosphere?

00:58:11.257 --> 00:58:12.840
NATALIE BATALHA: Is
there an advantage

00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:14.871
to building a
telescope on the moon?

00:58:14.871 --> 00:58:16.370
AUDIENCE: I'm
thinking like, instead

00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:19.390
of having to put a
satellite out far away,

00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:21.240
you might be able
to put a relatively

00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:24.580
small thing on a mountain
a few kilometers away.

00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:26.080
NATALIE BATALHA:
Yeah, which is kind

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:28.663
of what we're doing on the Earth
to test the technology, where

00:58:28.663 --> 00:58:30.700
we're going out into the
desert and setting up

00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:32.899
systems like that.

00:58:32.899 --> 00:58:33.440
I don't know.

00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:34.820
That's a really good question.

00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:36.280
There are other
challenges you have

00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:38.270
to think about when you
go to the moon-- first

00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:40.176
of all, getting supplies there,
of course, because you're going

00:58:40.176 --> 00:58:41.870
to have to make multiple trips.

00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:44.530
But also the dynamics
on the moon--

00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:46.450
you've got a lot of dust, right?

00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:50.110
And so I know that one of the
biggest technological hurdles

00:58:50.110 --> 00:58:51.600
to building
telescopes on the moon

00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:53.490
is just the amount of dust.

00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:56.110
And we've got the regolith,
which has this very fine dust.

00:58:56.110 --> 00:58:58.850
In fact, if you do hiking
in California, because

00:58:58.850 --> 00:59:00.592
of the drought,
the ground-- God,

00:59:00.592 --> 00:59:02.550
I'd hiked up the
[? Ridge Lane ?] the other day

00:59:02.550 --> 00:59:05.090
for the eclipse, and it was
like I was walking on the moon.

00:59:05.090 --> 00:59:06.090
It was like, poof!

00:59:06.090 --> 00:59:07.090
Poof!

00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:08.940
So if you have even
lower surface gravity,

00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:10.570
that dust is going to loft.

00:59:10.570 --> 00:59:12.236
It's going to get
into your electronics.

00:59:12.236 --> 00:59:14.284
It's going to be a mess.

00:59:14.284 --> 00:59:15.570
So, yeah.

00:59:15.570 --> 00:59:17.710
Nobody seems to be thinking
seriously about that,

00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:19.520
but that doesn't
mean that it's--

00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:21.476
AUDIENCE: What's the
status of Kepler today?

00:59:21.476 --> 00:59:23.350
I know that with its
reaction wheels failing,

00:59:23.350 --> 00:59:24.415
but there was some
back up plan in mind.

00:59:24.415 --> 00:59:24.690
NATALIE BATALHA: Yeah.

00:59:24.690 --> 00:59:25.670
Thanks for asking that.

00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:29.470
Maybe I'll go ahead and
back up a little bit.

00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:31.890
So the question is, what is
the status of Kepler today?

00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:42.790
A few years ago-- sorry.

00:59:42.790 --> 00:59:44.256
This is not very
efficient, is it?

00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:48.750
Well, several years
ago, Kepler lost

00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:49.982
one of its reaction wheels.

00:59:49.982 --> 00:59:52.440
And so the reaction wheels are
these like gyroscope things,

00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:55.790
that-- there are three of
them, one for each axis--

00:59:55.790 --> 00:59:59.890
and they keep the telescope
pointing very stably.

00:59:59.890 --> 01:00:02.630
So there was some redundancy
built into the spacecraft--

01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:03.540
there were four.

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:05.040
You only need three,
because there's

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.650
three axes you can rotate about.

01:00:07.650 --> 01:00:09.580
And so we had four, we
had some redundancy.

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:10.950
We lost one.

01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:12.597
No problem, we've got three.

01:00:12.597 --> 01:00:14.346
But then, a couple
years ago-- in fact, it

01:00:14.346 --> 01:00:16.846
was on my birthday-- I was just
about sitting at my birthday

01:00:16.846 --> 01:00:18.660
lunch, and I got
the phone call-- we

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:21.030
lost a second reaction wheel.

01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:22.555
So now, we were
down to two-- that

01:00:22.555 --> 01:00:24.610
meant Kepler was
spinning about one axis.

01:00:24.610 --> 01:00:25.860
We had no control.

01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:26.800
OK?

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.955
So for me, I was like,
well, OK, we already

01:00:29.955 --> 01:00:31.830
completed our baseline
mission-- we'd already

01:00:31.830 --> 01:00:33.430
collected four years
of data, and that

01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:36.450
was our baseline
mission, so I'm good--

01:00:36.450 --> 01:00:39.060
but it was a disappointment.

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:43.060
But the engineers at Ball
Aerospace were very clever.

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:45.430
And what they did
was they recognized

01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:47.520
that there is an axis
of symmetry built

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:50.410
into the spacecraft itself.

01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:53.030
And so-- well, let me
back up for a second.

01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:58.270
What is it out in space that
make the telescope spin?

01:00:58.270 --> 01:01:01.310
The answer is radiation
pressure from the Sun.

01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:04.550
So you're literally
being pushed on by light.

01:01:04.550 --> 01:01:08.260
It's very small,
but it accumulates.

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:10.340
So they recognized
that they could

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:14.280
utilize this axis of
symmetry if they lined it

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.160
up with the vector pointing
towards the radiation

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:20.210
pressure towards the Sun,
and they did that perfectly.

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:23.650
It would be like pointing
a boat directly upstream.

01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:26.760
If you balanced it, you would
neither yaw to the right

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.530
nor to the left-- you
would stay the course.

01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:31.530
And that's what they did.

01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:37.370
So that axis of symmetry happens
to be in an orientation that

01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:41.240
puts the telescope observing
along the ecliptic plane

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:43.540
of the solar system.

01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:45.750
So it limited the
amount of places

01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:47.690
where we could
point and observe.

01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:50.110
It also meant that we could
not point the telescope

01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:54.780
to the baseline patch of
sky that we were observing,

01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:57.230
but it actually opened
up the possibility

01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:59.700
of this whole entire
new thing called

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:02.280
K2, which is Kepler's
second mission

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:05.880
but actually named
after the mountain, K2.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:10.150
And so K2 is looking
at these patches of sky

01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:12.250
along the ecliptic,
and you see it there

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:15.680
traced out as this
sine wave with regards

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:18.340
to the plane of the
galaxy, which you see there

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:21.150
as a flat image
across the screen.

01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:24.210
So it's going to observe each
of these patches of sky--

01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:27.830
it's been doing that
already for over a year now

01:02:27.830 --> 01:02:30.150
with great success.

01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:34.390
So it's kind of like a step and
stare approach, more like TESS.

01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:37.260
And we're finding lots of
planets in these patches,

01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:41.530
including some planets that
are-- oh, that pink part just

01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:43.940
shows you where
in the sky we get

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:47.050
to look relative to the
Kepler field of view

01:02:47.050 --> 01:02:48.700
during the baseline mission.

01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:51.580
When you add up all the fields
that we will observe over

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:56.540
a few years, maybe four years,
that adds up to about 4%

01:02:56.540 --> 01:03:00.400
of the sky instead of 0.25%.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:03.080
So it's great, and we're finding
planets that are actually

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:06.210
really close by, like this
three-planet system that's

01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:08.290
just 100 light-years away.

01:03:08.290 --> 01:03:09.450
So it's doing good stuff.

01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:11.074
And I think it's
actually going to find

01:03:11.074 --> 01:03:14.410
some really good candidates for
the James Webb Space Telescope

01:03:14.410 --> 01:03:17.799
to observe when it
launches in 2018.

01:03:17.799 --> 01:03:20.090
AUDIENCE: How long is the
mission expected to continue?

01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:23.510
NATALIE BATALHA: How long
is it expected to last?

01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:28.030
So there is a hard constraint,
and that's the fuel.

01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:30.890
There's a fuel on board
the spacecraft that

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:35.020
does some thruster firings to
change position, and that does

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:36.970
have a finite lifetime.

01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:40.190
But I think it'll
easily last four

01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:43.030
years in this configuration.

01:03:43.030 --> 01:03:45.255
AUDIENCE: So this is
obviously a lot of data

01:03:45.255 --> 01:03:46.260
you guys are collecting.

01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:46.660
How much [INAUDIBLE]?

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:48.910
NATALIE BATALHA: How much
data is left to be analyzed?

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.170
We're still actually
even working

01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:55.500
on the data from the baseline
mission-- that first four

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:59.460
years between 2009 and
2013-- because we're

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:02.300
improving the pipeline
that does the analysis.

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:06.240
So we'll get some more
discoveries from that data.

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.760
But we're wrapping that up.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.640
That's due to finish
by September of 2017.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:13.400
So we've got about a
little less than two years

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:15.490
to finish up the
analysis of that data.

01:04:15.490 --> 01:04:16.180
That's sad.

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:18.070
The data sits in
the public archives,

01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:21.650
and scientists will be analyzing
that data for decades to come,

01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:23.900
because it's such
a rich data set.

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:25.719
Kepler's level one
science requirement

01:04:25.719 --> 01:04:27.385
is just to compute
the fraction of stars

01:04:27.385 --> 01:04:29.490
with planets of
certain properties,

01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:31.170
but there's a lot
of other things

01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:34.030
you can do with this data to
characterize planets and learn

01:04:34.030 --> 01:04:38.440
about different architectures
and oddball cases,

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:39.857
and all kinds of things.

01:04:39.857 --> 01:04:41.690
AUDIENCE: What is the
process for scientists

01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:43.150
to get access to that data?

01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:43.520
NATALIE BATALHA: I'm sorry?

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.580
AUDIENCE: What is the process
by which scientists get access

01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:46.010
to that data?

01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:46.940
NATALIE BATALHA: Oh, you
could do it right now

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:48.040
with your phone.

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.240
It's there.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:54.410
The NASA Exoplanet
Archive is one repository,

01:04:54.410 --> 01:04:56.100
and then the
Multimission Archive

01:04:56.100 --> 01:05:00.010
at the Space Telescope Science
Institute is another archive.

01:05:00.010 --> 01:05:01.580
So yeah, it's all
publicly available.

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:03.260
Anybody could play with it.

01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:04.960
Well, thank you very
much for your time.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:05.793
Any other questions?

01:05:05.793 --> 01:05:08.010
[APPLAUSE]
