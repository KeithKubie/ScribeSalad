00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.700
I love,
you know,
like I have certain favorite fighters of course a Donald Serani.

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.700
I love Nick Diaz for them.
Um,
but uh,

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.640
Jorge Mazda though he's a beast.
I just love,

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.470
I love like just a true fighter and he's so good.

5
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.250
So good.
He's so fucking good and so smart.
Oh,

6
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.950
you're so smart man.
Clever changes it up.

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.530
Does things like you can't see what he's doing.
Subtle.

8
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.060
He lives for fighting to Ah,
really does.
Oh,
he's a fucking smart man.

9
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:32.320
Like there are men and then there's hearts hand outs.

10
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.000
Mosquito just shows on another level for sure.
He's on another level.
He's,

11
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.830
I think he's such a contender for,
I mean he just chewed here.

12
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:44.310
The a hundred percent of the content was less than a cowboy and it takes two

13
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:47.370
years out of the octagon.
I don't know what,
he must have had an injury.

14
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.560
Darren till knocked out Darren till,
I mean knocked him the fuck out.

15
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.960
I mean he hit him with that left hand a couple of times early in the fight too.

16
00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:00.780
He was doing some sneaky shit.
He was switching stances.

17
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.730
He was switching stances and throwing that left hand.
Yeah,

18
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.850
he was throwing the right hand switching stances,

19
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:09.090
throwing the left hand and I think he started to read till pulling back like

20
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:12.570
that and then faked.
He finally through that right and then,
oh,
he left.

21
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:14.880
He'd caught him with that left hand several times,

22
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.800
caught him in the first round and then caught him in the second round.
He's a,

23
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.830
he's a bad motherfucker man.
He really is.

24
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.250
He's coming on to and I'm going to have mom with Joey d is Mom's all is going to

25
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:24.480
come up with show ideas and get a little bit,

26
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.230
you may also be able to get knocked down like that by Darren.

27
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.370
Tell who hits like it,
you know,
and come back and just regain his composure.

28
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.990
Never tell them the first punch of the fight.

29
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.320
It was the first punch of the fight now and smile to any ads.
All right,

30
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.060
let's see what you did first.
Move the fight.

31
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:43.800
He charges towards till and tries to side kick him in the thigh and hits him in

32
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:48.720
the Dick.
Yeah,
like right away.
First shot right to the SAC.
Yep.
Yeah.

33
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.620
I love that guy.
I love,
I love watching him fight.
Well,
he's very crafty.

34
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.810
He's a real veteran.
You know,
I remember him knocking out,
uh,

35
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.940
Eve Edwards in Bodog fight.
