00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:07.830
Nagging is the dispiriting, unpleasant, counter-productive
but wholly understandable and poignant version

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.730
of a hugely noble ambition: the desire to
change other people. There is so much we might

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.910
fairly want to change about them. We’re
an entirely imperfect lot. And so we want

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.519
them to be more self-aware, punctual, generous,
reliable, introspective, resilient, communicative,

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:34.360
profound… At home, we want them to focus
more on the sink, the children, the bins,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.280
the money and the need to put the phone down
and look up. At a macro dimension, we want

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.070
them to think more about the suffering of
encaged animals, the destruction of our habitat

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.460
and the iniquities of capitalism. We are,
most of us, very far from our ideal selves

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.530
– and at the level of the species, come
close to an evolutionary error. The desire

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:06.620
to change people is no pathology; it’s a
clear-sighted recognition of human wickedness.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.740
Nagging is, in its essence, an attempt at
teaching, at getting an idea for improvement

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.000
from one mind into another. But it is also
a version of teaching that has given up hope.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.090
It has descended into an attempt to insist
rather than invite, to coerce rather than

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.360
charm. One has grown too tired, and humiliated
by constant rebuffs to have the energy to

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.980
seduce. One is too panicked by the thought
that the unteachable ‘student’ is ruining

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.590
one’s life to find the inner resources to
see it a little more from their point of view.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.580
It’s one’s own suffering that dominates
all the available imaginative capacity. And

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.500
so one gets straight to the point, gets rid
of the garlands, omits the honey and says

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.390
it in plain terms. The bins need attention
now. Get to the table immediately. You’re

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:02.860
a selfish layabout. Not there, here… One
isn’t wrong. One is very right, but also

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:10.951
very tired and, deep down, sad. Lamentably,
also, it doesn’t work. By the time one has

00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:19.230
started humiliating the student, the lesson
is over. Nagging breeds its evil twin, shirking.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.590
The other pretends to read the paper, goes
upstairs and feels righteous. The shrillness

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.200
of one’s tone gives them all the excuse
they need to trust that we have nothing kind

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.210
or true to tell them. One changes others only
when the desire that they evolve has not reached

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.090
an insistent pitch, when we can still bear
that they remain as they are. All of us improve

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.840
only when we have not been badgered or made
to feel guilty; only when we have a sense

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.290
that we are loved and deeply understood for
the many reasons why change is so hard for

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.240
us. We know, of course, that the bins need
our attention, that we should strive to get

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.380
to bed earlier and that we have been a disappointment
in the couple. But we can’t bear to hear

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.840
these lessons in an unsympathetic tone; we
want – tricky children that we are – to

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.660
be indulged for our ambivalence about becoming
better people. The same obtuse dynamic is

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.989
at play at the political level. We know we
shouldn’t abuse the planet, bend rules or

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.349
close our hearts to the unfortunate. But we
won’t do any of the good things if a dour

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:33.120
figure wags their finger and delivers stern
lectures. We want to be charmed, not dragged,

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.500
into goodness. The tragedy of nagging is that
its causes are usually so noble – and yet

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.770
that it doesn’t work. We nag because we
feel that our possession of the truth lets

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.770
us off having to convey it elegantly. It never
does. The solution to nagging isn’t to give

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.690
up trying to get others to do what we want.
Rather, it is to recognise that persuasion

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:02.480
always needs to occur in terms that make sense
to those who so badly need to be altered.
