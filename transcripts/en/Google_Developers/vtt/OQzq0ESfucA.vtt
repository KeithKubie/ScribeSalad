00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.090
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Well, yet
again, another Google TV

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.510
Office Hours Hangout.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.780
And I'm Kristan Uccello,
and this is Christian.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.820
And we're joined right now by
Leon, who's going to give us a

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.230
demo in a short bit.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.129
It's been a little while since
we've done a Hangout.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.610
There's a good reason for that,
mostly to do with all of

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.220
us traveling at the same time.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.080
So two weeks ago, I was
traveling, you were traveling,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.420
Les was traveling, Paul
was traveling,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.520
and Osama was traveling.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.040
So there was literally
no one to really be

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.140
around to do the Hangout.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.660
Not that we need to do it here,
but I think the problem

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.110
was, we were just scattered
and busy.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.480
So hopefully that won't
happen again.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.760
We're going to do one more
Hangout in two weeks time

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.370
before we stop them for the
year, and wait till 2013 rolls

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.870
around, and start
them up again.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.200
So--

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.380
CHRISTIAN: That is, if the world
doesn't end in December.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.170
KRISTAN UCCELLO: That's true.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.570
The Mayan calendar does
predict our doom and

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.590
destruction on, I think,
December 22.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.250
CHRISTIAN: Something
like that.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.440
KRISTAN UCCELLO: So we're
guaranteed to have at least

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.070
one more of Google TV Office
Hours Hangout before the end

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.420
of the world--

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.120
these being the end
times and all.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.966
So with that, we've actually
got a lot of--

00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.670
CHRISTIAN: I think we got
v3 right before the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.480
world ended, so--

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.080
KRISTAN UCCELLO: We did.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.167
Actually, that's the first
news item I was

00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:18.590
going to bring up.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.467
So version 3 of Google TV, the
platform, has launched on the

00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:26.000
LG devices that are out there.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.980
So this is a pretty big and
significant milestone.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:36.850
Those of you with Sonys, and
Visios, and Logitech--

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.410
I don't know if the Logitechs--

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.920
are they being updated?

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.740
CHRISTIAN: Well, we pushed, I
think, some new YouTube app,

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.430
and the new TV Movies app, but
not the full capabilities of

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.820
the app on the v3.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.470
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Right,
OK so there's--

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.410
pardon me--

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.840
there is a partial that's
going out to the earlier

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.610
generation devices, the [? RM ?]
generation devices,

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.390
it'll be rolling out in the
next little while overall.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.570
But it's kind of big
and exciting.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.450
We've got a lot of
UI improvements.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.180
We've got all the things that
we kind of talked about at

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.650
I/O. To recap, I think some
of the big ones are--

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.690
CHRISTIAN: I think, for users,
if you just use it in your

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.530
living room, it has to become
a little bit more, I want to

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.210
say, user friendly.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.770
The TV and movies application
is a little

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.100
bit easier to browse.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.830
We keep talking, always,
about things how to

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.620
optimize for D-pad.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.200
And so we tried to experiment
around with the UI layout.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.260
So if you notice right now,
the shelves actually, are

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.950
scrolling left and right.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.370
Before, when you go out to
the right, you would

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.490
open up a new window.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.690
The other thing that I
personally like a lot is the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.970
little mini guide that comes up
when you just watch TV, and

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.610
you press the guide button.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.090
You get an instant overlay with
all the channel guides,

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.880
and movies, and everything.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.750
And from a developer's point of
view, so I've just, again,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.280
on Google+, replied to somebody
who was, let's just

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.610
say, discontent with the
performance of transitions and

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.750
animations on Google TV.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.310
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Well, you know,
it's not unreasonable to

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.900
expect infinite gigateraflop
performance on a

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.750
device that's sub-$100.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.460
But go on.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.580
CHRISTIAN: So if you take a look
at the mini guide on TV,

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.800
you'll notice, it scrolls
really smooth.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.610
And we have really nice
transitions in there.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.410
It's not using native code.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.920
So I just want to stress that.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.200
It's actually all implemented in
Android using the same APIs

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.680
that are available for third
party developers.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.580
The only a small trick, I want
to call it, is, we're using,

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.150
actually, OpenGL.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.560
So what this shows is there is
some performance behind the

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.080
graphics chip, you just
have to get into it.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.930
KRISTAN UCCELLO: You've got to
understand how to tap into it.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.940
It's not going to be the
boilerplate, cut and paste

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.770
code that makes your
app wonderful.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:06.590
You've got to dig in.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.270
You've got to geek out a little
bit on this hardware.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.700
CHRISTIAN: I think it's a great
opportunity for people

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.060
to actually differentiate
and do some really

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.110
cool transition effects.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.589
Honestly, you're not going to
do that for every screen in

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:22.160
your app, but having one or two
real focus point screens--

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.920
like, in the YouTube
application, we have the

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.430
little media carousel in the
bottom where you can scroll

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.730
through YouTube videos.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.780
That's also done in OpenGL.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:33.990
It's really worth it.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.140
If you want to spend a little
bit of time just playing

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.420
around with OpenGL, you can
do some amazing stuff.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.560
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Now, do you
know if it's OpenGL 1.0, 1.1,

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.440
2.0, because there's
a big difference

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.610
between 1.1 and 2.0.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.750
CHRISTIAN: Yeah, so I think
it's OpenGL ES, I

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:50.950
believe, it's 2.0.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:51.430
KRISTAN UCCELLO: It's 2.0.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.150
So it's all the vector shaders
and fragment shaders, which

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.280
is, that's a whole world
onto itself.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.230
That requires really digging in
to the graphic stacks and

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.930
understanding things.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.010
You're not going to get
boilerplate performance.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.770
CHRISTIAN: It's exciting.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.650
I mean, I have not played
with shaders.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.430
That's on my to-do list for sure
the Christmas holidays.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.385
While other people eat good
foods and visit families, I'll

00:05:16.385 --> 00:05:18.310
be playing with shaders.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.130
But I've played around
a little bit

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.730
with just basic OpenGL.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.360
And just simple stuff, like
drawing a bunch of triangles

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.770
on the screen.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.000
It's actually pretty cool.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.790
So I'm going to, actually,
talk about this

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.040
next week at AnDevCon.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.150
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Yeah, Christian
and I are both going

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.820
to be there.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.150
Believe me, we're cooking up
something really interesting.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.370
If you are lucky enough to
have an AnDevCon ticket,

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.143
you're really going to want to
come and see what we're going

00:05:46.143 --> 00:05:48.160
to be doing on stage.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.410
It's our hope that this will be
talked about it, let's say,

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.630
in wide circles.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.944
CHRISTIAN: There will be
Google+ posts about it.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.016
KRISTAN UCCELLO: There'll
be hardware porn, too.

00:06:03.016 --> 00:06:04.640
CHRISTIAN: Yeah, well
that's Chris' piece.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.840
He wants to take
[? them coming and going ?].

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.080
KRISTAN UCCELLO: So I think
you've actually

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.900
already hit on this one.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.130
So, YouTube Google TV pairing,
this is the next--

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.960
CHRISTIAN: That's cool, yeah.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.130
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Yeah,
so, there was an

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.020
update that went out.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.150
Is it all devices?

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.620
I can't remember.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.350
Or is it coming, or--?

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.040
CHRISTIAN: It's all a blur.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.910
It's definitely on the LG
devices, I have it at home.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.045
KRISTAN UCCELLO: So you can
essentially use your phone or

00:06:31.045 --> 00:06:34.860
your tablet to hunt for videos
and throw them to your screen

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.585
or your TV, and it just plays.

00:06:38.585 --> 00:06:40.660
I guess it would be
fun at parties--

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.080
and, hey, look at
this cat video.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.570
Or look at this Google TV
Office Hours video.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.970
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Completely
unrelated, but still

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:51.900
newsworthy--

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.910
Hisense Google TVs are
now showing up,

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.550
actually, in Amazon.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.110
So yet another device that
we've already alluded to,

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.710
talked about before, Hisense
is joining us.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:03.830
Hey, Les.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:04.700
LES: Aloha.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.760
CHRISTIAN: Aloha.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.790
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Just in the
middle of the news, but we can

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:09.310
pause here.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.756
How's Hawaii?

00:07:10.756 --> 00:07:12.878
LES: It's nice, actually.

00:07:12.878 --> 00:07:13.080
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Nice?

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.550
It's raining here today
in Mountain View.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.056
LES: We get rain here.

00:07:18.056 --> 00:07:18.870
KRISTAN UCCELLO: All
right, so yes.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.030
Hisense is available.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.020
Well, I should say, it's
showing up in Amazon.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.340
It says temporarily out of
stock, so I don't know whether

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.180
there was actually a batch that
they sold out, or if it's

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.310
just sort of like you get your

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.010
pre-orders in or get notified--

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:37.770
but I know Amazon has it, so
it must be coming soon.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:38.920
Voice search.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.650
This is one of the new things
that got rolled out.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:48.580
You can now control your LG TV
with voice control off your

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.940
remote, which is pretty awesome,
especially for those

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.480
who have thick fat fingers,
like me, who have trouble

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.480
typing on small keyboards.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.412
This is a boon for finding all
those episodes of "Glee" I

00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:00.850
want to watch.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.040
CHRISTIAN: It works, actually,
surprisingly well.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.910
I was a little bit skeptical
at first.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.030
I don't like to talk to my TV.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.950
But once I used it a few
times, I prefer it over

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.830
typing, even on the back
of this little

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.080
keyboard thing here.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.070
KRISTAN UCCELLO: So it'll
be exciting to see

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.830
how this gets used.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.200
There were some questions, I
believe, about our remote

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.040
control app getting updated
to include a voice feature

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.820
because people want this on the
Google TVs that have yet

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.620
to be updated.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.640
LES: Leon has it in his.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.480
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Yeah,
so I was actually

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.690
going to use this--

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:40.299
LES: You were going to
segue there, cool.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:43.059
KRISTAN UCCELLO: The segue But
thanks for [INAUDIBLE], Les.

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:46.630
Yeah, so Leon, since we have you
on the line, I'm going to

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.510
ask you this directly.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:52.300
Do you have voice search already
in your remote control

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.790
implementation for Android?

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.690
LEON: Yeah, I do.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:59.050
KRISTAN UCCELLO: And so where
can people go and get that?

00:08:59.050 --> 00:08:59.925
It's open source, right?

00:08:59.925 --> 00:09:01.890
You've open sourced your code?

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:02.290
LEON: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:04.505
So they can get that
in the Play Store.

00:09:04.505 --> 00:09:06.770
But we've had the voice feature
for quite a while, and

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.575
it's one of the most popular
features, actually.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.010
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Cool, so I
suspect that answers the

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.085
question to the people who were,
I believe, asking it on

00:09:17.085 --> 00:09:19.552
the Google TV plus page.

00:09:19.552 --> 00:09:23.380
There's a Hangout tomorrow at
around 3:30 to talk about

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.690
voice control and
voice features.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.030
So if you're interested in the
user end side of that, you

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.720
want to check out the Hangout
that's going on tomorrow.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.780
Last two quick pieces of news--
actually, we've already

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.580
talked about AnDevCon.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.070
So--

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.750
CHRISTIAN: Let's talk a
little more about it.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:39.630
KRISTAN UCCELLO: We should.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.490
CHRISTIAN: It's local
in the Bay Area.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.960
It's up in Burlingham, right
by the airport Hyatt.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.410
I think, today, you still
can get tickets.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.350
Let us know if you really
want to come.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.160
KRISTAN UCCELLO: If you're going
to buy tickets, yeah

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.150
speaker codes.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.480
So--

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.200
you don't care.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.580
OK, so if you use my last name,
U-C-C-E-L-L-O, you might

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.680
still be able to utilize the
coupon code, and it should get

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.630
you $200 off the ticket.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:07.520
So yeah.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.090
That's there.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:11.310
And you and I are talking for
two sessions straight.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.960
Yeah, Wednesday afternoon
is all about Google TV.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:14.600
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Yes.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.450
From, what was it?

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.680
CHRISTIAN: I think 1:30
to 5:00 or something.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.920
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Something
like that.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.830
Yeah, we've got a significant
amount of time.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.850
And we've got a good
show planned.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.630
CHRISTIAN: We'll be cooking
something up.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:26.250
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Yeah.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.500
CHRISTIAN: It's all about
the holiday season.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.220
KRISTAN UCCELLO: It is.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.410
We should just rename it
the Home Cooking Show.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:32.360
Maybe I've said too much.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.566
[LAUGH]

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:35.160
All right, lastly--
what's that Les?

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.290
LES: If I may.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.250
Christian and I were
there last year.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:44.970
And it is really got some of
the best, most focused

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:49.230
developers that I've
seen in a while.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.550
KRISTAN UCCELLO: We're
going to eat this up.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.850
LES: It's very technical.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:58.010
Lots of folks who are
really smart there.

00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.920
CHRISTIAN: I mean, I'm
always impressed.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.580
Mostly everyone I talk with at
the conference is either a

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:08.750
Android expert and author or is
a, I want to say, respected

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.180
Stack Overflow personality.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.620
So it it's really very
technical, very deep dive

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.060
Android expertise.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.390
So if you are an Android
developer, and you are

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:22.880
somewhere local, I like it.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.480
I mean it's, to me, this is
really a great event.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.380
It's one of the highlights
of the year.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:27.930
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Cool.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:31.550
It comes almost directly
opposite I/O.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:33.195
CHRISTIAN: Yeah well,
they also--

00:11:33.195 --> 00:11:35.170
I don't know if it's a good
thing or a bad thing, but they

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:38.390
have two AnDevCon conferences
per year.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:39.800
So there's a spring
and a fall.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.940
As I said, I think it's a
great gathering to bring

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:45.900
people together.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:46.600
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Cool.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.200
All right, last item
on the news.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.830
Just sort of to bring us full
circle, I alluded there was

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:53.980
some traveling going on.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.360
I was in Mexico, doing
Esto Es Google,

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.340
which is This Is Google.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.360
Very, very big audience
showed up.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.010
I think there was almost 3,000
developers that showed up to

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:04.980
this free event in Mexico.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.890
And we showcased and highlighted
Google TV, got a

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:09.660
prominent spot.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.370
I ended up giving two
one-hour lectures

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.510
there to packed rooms.

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:17.430
I think the capacity of the
rooms was like 380 people.

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.510
Very receptive, very warm,
welcoming people.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:24.990
I actually got into a drinking
game on Google TV trivia

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.710
afterwards.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.260
But that's for another time.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.200
And Les, that you were in
Colorado, I think, at this

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.540
time, too, weren't you?

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:33.430
LES: Yeah.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:38.890
Paul Karth and I were
in Colorado.

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:42.920
We did Boulder Droids.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:48.100
And we also held a day-long
session there.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:53.790
And we had about 40-someodd
people for Boulder Droids and

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.850
20-someodd for the day longs.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:13:00.540
And it was a really
good session.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.270
I think we'll get a
lot of developers

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.596
developing apps from that.

00:13:05.596 --> 00:13:08.236
It was a very exciting thing.

00:13:08.236 --> 00:13:10.130
KRISTAN UCCELLO: You sound
a little worn out.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.280
Are you still recovering
from all the activity?

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:19.780
LES: No I, just actually,
I read in the morning.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.065
And so I just happened
to be vertical.

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:26.720
And I signed on and it
said, oh, you've been

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.900
invited to a Hangout.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.440
And I'm like, oh, I didn't
realize that.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.050
But OK, I'll join in.

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:34.820
KRISTAN UCCELLO: All
right, cool, cool.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.880
All right, so actually,
there weren't many

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.140
questions that I saw today.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.000
I guess everyone's kind of
busy working on their

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.990
television apps for Christmas,
trying to

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.080
get it in the market.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:43.620
CHRISTIAN: It's the season.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.880
KRISTAN UCCELLO: It's
the season.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.930
Actually there was an app
that came up recently

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:50.490
that got some buzz.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:51.955
Maybe we'll talk about
that later.

00:13:51.955 --> 00:13:53.090
CHRISTIAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:56.020
KRISTAN UCCELLO: So I guess,
without further ado, let's go

00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:00.260
to this really cool demo that
Leon has put together.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.690
I saw this, and I was like,
that's --expletive--

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:04.940
awesome.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.250
So Leon, I'm going to
hand it over to you.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.720
Why don't you just sort of
explain what you did, why you

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.740
did it, and how it works.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.624
And let's see it in action.

00:14:15.624 --> 00:14:19.280
LEON: OK, so I've created a
program that allows you to use

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:25.630
your Microsoft Kinect sensor
to control your Google TV.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:29.920
And you use gestures it instead
of a physical remote.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.720
So I think the best way
to show it off is

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.100
just to play the video.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.350
So we can give this a try.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.204
LEON (IN VIDEO): I've written
a program that allows you to

00:14:40.204 --> 00:14:42.535
use your Microsoft
Kinect Sensor to

00:14:42.535 --> 00:14:45.037
control your Google TV.

00:14:45.037 --> 00:14:46.287
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:51.715 --> 00:14:52.782
KRISTAN UCCELLO: So do you want
to describe what's going

00:14:52.782 --> 00:14:53.820
on while this is happening?

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.070
LEON (IN VIDEO): [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:57.225 --> 00:14:59.885
LEON: Yeah, basically, it's just
Google TV showing off.

00:14:59.885 --> 00:15:04.350
In the corner there is just
the app from the device.

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:05.600
LEON (IN VIDEO): [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:11.150
KRISTAN UCCELLO: And so I see
your gestures are moving the

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:12.670
pointer on the screen.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.710
LEON: Yeah.

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:15.960
LEON (IN VIDEO): [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.970
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Now, did you
write that screen software, or

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:23.860
is that a package
or something?

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.280
LEON: So it's a combination of
some of some open source

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.000
drivers and some software.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.097
But the gesture stuff and
talking to Google TV is all

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:35.840
done in my program.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.090
LEON (IN VIDEO): [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.380
CHRISTIAN: And so, how do you
communicate with Google TV in

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.040
this example?

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:51.780
So you effectively send any mode
cursor position to the

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:55.240
Google TV, or how do you control
the cursor there?

00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:00.385
LEON: Yeah, so I've written a
library for any mode in Java

00:16:00.385 --> 00:16:02.240
that I'm using there.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:09.480
And so yeah, I am continuing to
be, basically, the mouse.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.460
[INAUDIBLE]

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:16.380
Google TV as though I'm moving
my finger on a touch control

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:17.460
on a physical remote.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:18.710
LEON (IN VIDEO): [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.475
KRISTAN UCCELLO: So how do you
find the usability, I guess,

00:16:25.475 --> 00:16:27.660
of gesture control.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:28.940
LEON: Yeah, so that
gets interesting.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.970
Let me get out of the video.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:38.470
So that's quite interesting
because the easy part is doing

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:42.251
the gestures with your hand,
which seem to be a point.

00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:46.630
But now, when you start
navigating Google TV, there's

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.245
more things you need
to do, like, for

00:16:48.245 --> 00:16:49.380
example, selecting things.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:52.580
So I made a gesture where you
kind of hold up your hand and

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.610
push it forward.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:54.970
It's like clicking
on something.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.580
It gets more complicated,
though.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.850
Now that you're, let's say, in
an app, and maybe there's a

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:05.089
list of things you need to
scroll through, well, now you

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:07.690
need another gesture for that,
too, because just moving your

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:09.010
hand is just going to
move the pointer.

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.329
It's not actually scrolling.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:14.780
So now you need to keep on
coming up with gestures that

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.489
will map to things that
you would do on

00:17:16.489 --> 00:17:17.609
the physical remote.

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:21.990
Like, even the D-pad stuff, how
would you do left, right,

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.854
up, and down.

00:17:22.854 --> 00:17:26.329
And you think about this is a
very different way, because,

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:28.990
again, moving your hand is just
going to move a pointer.

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:30.640
It's not going to get
[INAUDIBLE] up and down like

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.930
on the physical keys.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.850
So I put some hooks
in the code.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.650
And the program is really just
kind of a thing for somebody

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:40.790
to play with because there are
many ways, many directions you

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:44.640
could go to solve
that problem.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.320
One gesture I put in the
code is to go back.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.395
And the solution I came
up with that was to

00:17:52.395 --> 00:17:54.030
hold up both hands.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.720
And then you go like that.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.250
And that's a gesture
for going back.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:02.090
But you can imagine coming
up with your own

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:03.240
ways of doing that.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.500
It's just, now, you don't want
to confuse moving this hand

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.110
with moving the pointer.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.750
So you can see, I'm already
getting awkward,

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:13.890
[? here ?], aren't I?

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:17.060
Just being able to do
the gesture stuff.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.260
To really pull this off, I
think you really need to

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:25.860
rethink the Google TV UI to be
much more gesture-based.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:31.060
There's simple things like,
things need to be bigger to be

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:31.890
able to target it.

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:32.955
So, like a button.

00:18:32.955 --> 00:18:35.980
If it's a small button, for me
to kind of move my hand and

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.130
just getting the aim right
is kind of tricky.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:40.910
Especially clicking on things.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:44.440
Now, if the button was much
bigger, which is what LG did

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.310
with their UI because they
support a gesture-based UI, so

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:52.410
their buttons on their main
launcher screen are huge.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:56.900
So it makes it very easy to
point and click at things.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.910
But as you get into other
types of navigation like

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:04.070
scrolling and other things, you
need to think about how

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:07.350
you would do that in the
gesture-based UI because it's

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:10.770
not just simply mapping the
current way to gestures.

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.600
It can get complicated.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.660
KRISTAN UCCELLO: So, is your
next project going to be

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:20.210
writing a new home screen
application to make gesture

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:21.090
control a lot easier?

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:24.230
LEON: Yes, but it's
not for gestures.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:25.640
It's something else
I'm working.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.720
But yeah, I mean, I open
sourced the code.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.980
So anybody can go and play.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.990
The code should work
on any platform.

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:34.990
The real issue at the moment
is that you still need a

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:39.340
computer because the gesture
recognition and communication

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.650
is actually kind
of heavyweight.

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.400
This sensor doesn't actually
do gesture recognition.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.260
It just gives you raw data.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.295
So you need a beefy
CPU to do that.

00:19:50.295 --> 00:19:52.200
Originally, I wanted to do
this all of my little

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.320
Raspberry Pie, but I that
little thing just

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.640
can't handle it.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:01.470
You're basically looking at
raw video at 30 frames a

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:04.620
second, and you need to figure
out the gestures within that.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:08.580
That's a lot of heavy
CPU load.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.570
So you need a laptop, and then
you need the Kinect sensor,

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:14.810
obviously, and then the code.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:15.990
You can just download it.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.822
Even if you don't understand
the code, it's easy to

00:20:18.822 --> 00:20:21.570
download, and set it up,
and just run it.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.250
And then hopefully, some
developers will start digging

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:28.120
into the code and start seeing,
well, what gestures

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.955
make sense for the TV?

00:20:29.955 --> 00:20:32.980
It's something to play with.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:35.300
It's not quite practical
at this stage.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:40.270
There are some orientation
issues and navigation issues,

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.170
in terms of making sure
the point is always

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:42.900
in the right place.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.244
But again, that's something that
developers can play with

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:48.010
and see what makes sense.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.810
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Yeah, I think
a lot of this is still--

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.610
this is uncharted territory,
in a lot of ways.

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:58.150
I know how the Kinect with
Microsoft's play in the living

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.730
room to get in gesture mode.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:03.840
Nintendo had their Wiimotes
and the cameras built into

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.733
their little Bluetooth
devices.

00:21:05.733 --> 00:21:11.910
And Sony has their glowing
wands, which are pretty cool.

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:14.190
But, I mean, all of them have
different strengths and

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:18.330
weaknesses, as do all
gesture-based controls.

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:22.340
I'm hoping that the future, with
whatever new technologies

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:26.620
are coming out, maybe we'll see
some blended integration

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.342
all these things,
and LIDAR, and--

00:21:30.342 --> 00:21:33.276
I want to live in the
future again.

00:21:33.276 --> 00:21:36.670
LEON: I thnk one promising
combination might be gestures

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.190
with voice.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:40.480
That could be an interesting
combination.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.900
KRISTAN UCCELLO: You mean,
like grunts and growls?

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.660
LEON: That you could point at
easily, rather than saying,

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.980
right-- you can say that,
and point at it.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.530
So I think that might be a
natural way of doing it,

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:53.640
rather than something else,
some other combination of

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.890
technologies.

00:21:56.507 --> 00:21:59.750
CHRISTIAN: I personally wonder
if it's actually physically

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:02.180
possible that we could do eye
tracking or something.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:07.130
Because with screens getting
bigger, I can definitely look

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:08.600
at sections of the screen.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:13.140
I could find like six or so
sections of the screen that I

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:14.770
can focus on with my eyes.

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:18.313
And I don't need any control
device at that point.

00:22:18.313 --> 00:22:20.920
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Well, as humans
we tend to use our eyes

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.320
and see where other people are
looking anyway-- and gesture,

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:27.090
and give verbal sort of, action,
to those gestures.

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:31.780
So I think, yeah, maybe there is
some combination here that

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:32.940
could work.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.860
LEON: So we have started
this project.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.340
That's exactly what
I want to do.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.210
Figuring out where your
eyes are looking at.

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:44.910
That is very complicated.

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:47.860
So there are solutions for
things that are close, like

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.190
your screen.

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:51.570
But when you get to some
distance, like sitting in

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:55.320
front of a TV, actually, there
isn't any commercial solution

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.770
at the moment because it's so
difficult, then, to pick up

00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:01.040
your eyes and to do
that accurately.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.480
So originally, yeah, I was
looking for an eye sensor.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.320
And I thought I maybe could
hack that with Kinect, but

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.850
it's not quite there.

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:09.837
The resolution you get
is not good enough to

00:23:09.837 --> 00:23:11.850
pick up your eyes.

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:13.830
So there's a company that's
working on a solution.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:17.160
But even though they claim they
have something for TVs,

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.940
you still need to sit quite
close to the TV.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.300
But yes, that was what
I was trying to do.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.770
I didn't want to do
the gestures.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:28.550
So the Kinect thing was kind
of a fall back because the

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:31.930
technology isn't there yet.

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:33.710
KRISTAN UCCELLO: We'll see what
the future brings with

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:36.580
glass and all that
other stuff.

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.920
Yeah.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:44.180
LES: I would think, for an eye
tracker, for a TV at 3.3

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:52.940
meters, the movement of the eye
is so subtle that it'd be

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.631
very difficult to pick up.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:01.880
Even with a tracker mounted
on your glasses.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.050
CHRISTIAN: It's just amazing
to me, always--

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:09.780
I mean, when we try to do stuff
like this, and we look

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:16.110
at how easy it is for actual
human beings to do that--

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:19.450
when I speak with somebody
from like five feet, or,

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:23.770
whatever, two meters away, I can
tell if they look at me or

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:25.800
the person standing next
to me, maybe less

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.510
than a meter away.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:32.910
But yeah, for a camera, or for
a TV device, this is really

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:35.230
still almost undoable.

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:39.320
LES: Right, but it's difficult
to tell if somebody's looking

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:44.725
at your nose, or your
mouth, or your ears.

00:24:44.725 --> 00:24:47.630
That's a bit more challenging.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:49.510
Yeah.

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.240
We're probably many
decades out from a

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.540
full solution to that.

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.750
But who knows, maybe in the
future, everyone will be

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.700
walking around with
helmets on.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.410
That could make things
a whole lot easier.

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:03.085
Just a target right
over the head.

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:07.060
Or like, how the Sims
have it, glowing

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:09.360
diamonds, it's your companion.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:09.940
I don't know.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.030
I'm going into the deep
sci-fi realm there.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:14.494
LES: Do we have any
questions today?

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:18.800
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Nobody asked
anything in the [? Dori ?].

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:25.240
But James Power did ask one in
the Plus page, which I'm going

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.206
to bring up here because we
talked about it a little bit

00:25:27.206 --> 00:25:28.140
at the beginning.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.710
James asked, I'd like to hear
a bit more about the OpenGL

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:33.710
widget system Primetime
is using.

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:34.960
Is any of that open source?

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:35.900
Could it be?

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:40.490
My current animation woes
are specific to fragment

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:41.790
transitions.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:45.050
I'm not sure how to implement
things in OpenGL.

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:49.710
Well, that actually might speak
to the first part of it.

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:50.100
Let's see.

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.160
It seems like it would require
quite a large rewrite.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.470
Maybe I'm mistaken.

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:56.400
Also the feedback is pretty
terrible at the moment.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.540
It sounds like it's coming
from Mountain View.

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.750
It probably is.

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.810
I apologize for that.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:07.540
The space that we're in now has
been torn down, I think,

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:11.360
six times in the last three days
to do various activities.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.130
We've had a photo shoot here.

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:14.530
We've had usability testing.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:20.710
We've had another Hangout
earlier, there was a meeting.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:22.940
Things got moved around.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.160
Things will be getting better.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.765
There's a new studio
in the works.

00:26:27.765 --> 00:26:30.820
I've nothing official to
announce, but the quality of

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.110
these Hangouts will be improving
as we go forward.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:35.870
So keep tuning in.

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:36.970
Provide us with feedback.

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:39.110
That would be great.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:44.380
So let's go back to James
question here and see what we

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:47.400
can do to answer that.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.910
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Well,
Les could maybe talk

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:54.132
to that from Hawaii.

00:26:54.132 --> 00:26:57.050
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:01.860
LES: [? Kristy ?] was going to
answer that instead of me.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.450
I tried.

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:08.670
I'm still trying to open source
an OpenGL library.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.900
We were trying for
one idea and got

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.920
blocked on internal stuff.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:26.240
So yeah, we feel your pain.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.390
We understand it.

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:29.780
We'd really like to fix it.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:36.630
Any we've got support of
Google TV engineering.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:37.880
It's just--

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:46.920
I'll check in with the team that
blocked us and see if we

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.520
could do something else.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:52.530
KRISTAN UCCELLO: I have
something to add here.

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:56.810
So OpenGL is definitely
something I'm extremely

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:57.670
interested in.

00:27:57.670 --> 00:28:01.790
And I have a long background
of graphics programming.

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:05.430
I mean, this is why I got into
programming was games, and

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:09.035
we're talking like old
school Sinclair Z81.

00:28:09.035 --> 00:28:10.900
This is the kind of stuff
I was doing--

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.200
CHRISTIAN: They had
a OpenGL Z81?

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:12.645
KRISTAN UCCELLO: No, no.

00:28:12.645 --> 00:28:16.050
If we had OpenGL back then,
I would be doing something

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:16.980
completely different by now.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.805
But the point is, I'm
digging into this.

00:28:19.805 --> 00:28:22.330
And one of the things that
I think is probably worth

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:28.190
mentioning, especially if you're
new to OpenGL, is that

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:29.790
there are two distinct
flavors.

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:33.880
There's the ES 1.0
flavor, and 1.1.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.090
Those are very similar.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:38.840
And then you've got OpenGL 2.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.400
I'm just going to
call it ES 1.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.700
That encompasses both versions
of 1 and 1.1.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:48.380
In ES 1, there's a lot of
convenience methods that sort

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.380
of do of the some heavy lifting
for you in setting up

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:54.540
your graphics pipeline and
program compilation.

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:57.090
There is a lot of convenience
in what goes on there.

00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:01.330
And you can, oftentimes, you can
write very functional code

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:05.490
in your application to
make your frames

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:07.610
render the way you want.

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:12.820
If you start looking at the way
OpenGL ES 2 works, it's

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.410
actually more complicated
to set up.

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:17.190
And there are less convenience
functions.

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:21.080
Everything's been sort of pushed
into vector shaders and

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.830
fragment shaders, which, if
you have no idea what I'm

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:27.065
talking about with regards to
shaders, that means you need

00:29:27.065 --> 00:29:28.540
to do some reading and
some experimenting.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.850
And it's worth the investment
because these things translate

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:33.490
into regular OpenGL.

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:37.730
But the point I'm trying to
make is, you need to use a

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:40.720
library framework on top of
OpenGL ES 2 to use it

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.610
effectively.

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:46.470
You're not going to write some
huge game just in shaders.

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:49.810
So there are books that there.

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:52.070
There are several good ones.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:55.090
Some of the critiques of these
books has been, oh, the

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:57.775
author's just pushing their
library or their framework

00:29:57.775 --> 00:29:58.860
with their book.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:29:59.590
These are good things.

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:01.885
These help you get
things done.

00:30:01.885 --> 00:30:06.100
Either write your own-- and
what programs [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.690
falling into writing
frameworks.

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:12.630
Or just pick one that's out
there that's being used and

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:13.570
kind of invest in it.

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:15.910
I mean, it's still early days
for a lot of this stuff.

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.740
And we could go a long
distance with it.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:21.570
LES: I'll just throw
one more point.

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:24.650
Leon did some experimentation
with OpenGL recently.

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:28.750
Do you want to talk about
any of that stuff?

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:29.710
LEON: Sure, yeah.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:33.450
So I did a little experiment, in
fact, I released as an app,

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:37.812
or overlay, which is
is the Play Store.

00:30:37.812 --> 00:30:40.780
What I wanted to do was just
simple graphics where I

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:41.690
animate sprites--

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:44.600
little images that move
across the street.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.430
And I did some testing
on that.

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:50.120
And this might be unique for the
kind of style of app that

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:54.360
I did, but I actually found
that the Android canvas

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:58.270
animation was better
than OpenGL.

00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:00.840
So again, just, it's not
a general thing.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.500
It's a very particular
type of animation.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:08.270
But just moving images across
the screen and animating them

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.510
was significantly faster,
at least on

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:12.230
the Google TV devices.

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:16.560
When I did the same test on my
Nexus phone or tablet, they

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.440
were very similar.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.290
Or the OpenGL worked a
little bit better.

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:23.040
So there's something, at least
with that kind of animation,

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:26.480
that you might just want to
consider this using standard

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.610
Android canvas.

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:29.045
The performance is very good.

00:31:29.045 --> 00:31:34.050
I could get up to about 60
frames a second, which is very

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:36.630
good for the Google
TV platform.

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:39.640
CHRISTIAN: So Leon, which
hardware did you use when you

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.440
tried that out?

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:44.190
Was that on the Intel-phased
review or was it the new

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:45.280
arm-based devices?

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.480
So I've tried it on
all my devices.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:50.800
I've tried it on the Logitech,
on Visio, on the Sony--

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.150
they're all very similar
numbers.

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:56.000
The Sony was a little bit better
on the OpenGL, but

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.410
still OpenGL was about half
the speed of the Android

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:03.540
canvas that I mentioned.

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:06.620
KRISTAN UCCELLO: So I've got
some followup questions.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:09.960
I haven't looked at your code
yet, but I guess what I want

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.310
to know is, what kind
of movement was it?

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:14.010
Was this 2D?

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:16.550
What kind of polygons
were you using?

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:20.810
What sort of parameters did you
put the GL state machine

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:23.250
in when you were doing
this animation?

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:25.250
LEON: So the code I
used for testing

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:26.310
was released by Google.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:29.420
So you can go try it yourself.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:32.010
It's called Sprite
Method Test.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.390
There's a bunch of these
Android apps

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:38.225
that were open source.

00:32:38.225 --> 00:32:39.760
And it's one of the
standard ones.

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.565
So it's not my code.

00:32:41.565 --> 00:32:43.530
It's Google's code.

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:45.100
And so you can take
a look at that.

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.810
And so part of that code, when
you run it, it actually gives

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:50.320
you some data.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.365
It gives you the frame rate.

00:32:51.365 --> 00:32:53.940
It gives you various other
parameters in terms of how

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:58.420
quick the writes get done
to the screen and so on.

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:00.796
For me, it was more important
about the frame rate because I

00:33:00.796 --> 00:33:03.120
want to be as soon
as possible.

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.560
So yeah, if you want to dig into
it, it's your own code.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:10.817
[LAUGH]

00:33:10.817 --> 00:33:12.620
KRISTAN UCCELLO: I was going
to say-- awkward.

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:15.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.900
CHRISTIAN: Like, somebody else
in the company that you don't

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.280
know must've written that.

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.246
KRISTAN UCCELLO: There's
somebody in the company you

00:33:21.246 --> 00:33:21.870
don't know?

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:22.930
CHRISTIAN: Yeah, there's
one or two people.

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:24.240
Must be new ones.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:24.880
KRISTAN UCCELLO: There's
a lot of us here.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.760
But ironic, that we'd find
out about it this way.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.000
But such is life.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.524
LEON: So also open sourced my
code, so if you want to look

00:33:32.524 --> 00:33:34.506
at it, you can do that too.

00:33:34.506 --> 00:33:36.110
KRISTAN UCCELLO: OK, no,
that would be cool.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:37.130
I think that might
be, actually, a

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:39.570
good discussion point.

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:42.700
Since we have Daniel on the
line, Daniel, did you have any

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:43.950
questions for us?

00:33:49.181 --> 00:33:50.958
Daniel's video feed
[INAUDIBLE].

00:33:50.958 --> 00:33:52.350
DANIEL: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:58.980
find it difficult to activate my
Google Hangout on my tablet

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:04.210
is kind of mute.

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:09.798
So I'm trying to find a
way to address that.

00:34:09.798 --> 00:34:12.870
Just a second.

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:15.719
KRISTAN UCCELLO: If you have a
question, maybe then, if you

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:19.100
can't hear or you don't feel
comfortable speaking it, you

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:21.130
could always type it out, and
we can answer it that way.

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:25.565
Otherwise--

00:34:25.565 --> 00:34:27.460
LEON: I've got a questions
for you guys.

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:28.719
KRISTAN UCCELLO: OK.

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:32.370
LEON: So recently the YouTube
feature was released that

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:37.420
allows you to fling content to
Google TV, which is an awesome

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:40.090
feature, just really
excellent.

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:43.179
One problem, though, is that
when you select the device to

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:46.070
send it to, it actually gives
you the list of all your

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:48.820
Google TV devices
on your network.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:53.480
But at the moment, it's labeling
them all Google TV,

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.465
so you don't know which
one it's going to.

00:34:56.465 --> 00:34:58.260
And in fact, [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.250
it's not even in
the same order.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:05.720
So you can't rely on position
to know where it's going.

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:10.024
So you kind of go through the
list in a hit and miss--

00:35:10.024 --> 00:35:10.730
KRISTAN UCCELLO: You've
discovered

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:12.190
the Easter egg game.

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:17.615
LES: Crispy, could you write
that up as a bug.

00:35:21.988 --> 00:35:24.870
CHRISTIAN: I think somebody,
actually, already mentioned

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:26.840
that they would like to give
a friendly name to

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.620
their Google TV.

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:30.200
LES: Oh right, we're
trying to fix that.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.575
LEON: Yeah, that would be one
way because then the user can

00:35:32.575 --> 00:35:34.695
actually put something in,
if that's possible.

00:35:34.695 --> 00:35:36.250
But at the moment, it's just--

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:38.360
even though it's a great
feature, it's great for people

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.610
with one device.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:42.730
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Cool.

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:46.707
All right, if there's no more
questions, which I'm just

00:35:46.707 --> 00:35:51.015
going to quickly check
the post list here.

00:35:51.015 --> 00:35:54.150
LES: And see if Eduardo
has any questions.

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:55.550
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Sorry?

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:57.450
LES: Eduardo just joined us.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:59.440
Maybe he has a question.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.850
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Yes, Eduardo.

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:04.550
Are you auditory?

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:05.530
No?

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:06.210
LES: Maybe not.

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:07.170
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Maybe not.

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:08.805
Oh, he's typing.

00:36:08.805 --> 00:36:11.160
"Hey guys," he says.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.410
And--

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:16.901
more typing is happening.

00:36:16.901 --> 00:36:18.280
LES: Ah, OK.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.210
CHRISTIAN: No question.

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:23.250
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Oh,
OK, well then.

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:24.530
LEON: Can I jump in again?

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:25.420
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Sorry?

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:26.760
LEON: Can I jump in again?

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.400
LES: Sure.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:32.340
LEON: Just one question, so
are there any new APIs or

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.470
things that developers need to
know about as part of this

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:38.512
version three rollout?

00:36:38.512 --> 00:36:39.762
LES: Yes.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:44.360
We're going to be really
slow at releasing them.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:51.965
But there are some new API is
for dealing with media.

00:36:55.890 --> 00:37:00.490
Part of v3 included the
ability to play MPEG-.

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:03.940
That was written entirely
in the new APIs.

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:11.540
Also includes PlayReady
and Smooth Streaming.

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.550
And so--

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:16.280
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Closed
captioning, QoS--

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.840
LES: Yeah.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.640
So all those will
be coming out.

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:24.290
If you need something in that
list, specifically, you're

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:31.240
welcome to write one of us at
the group at Google, or at our

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.570
email addresses.

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:37.710
LesV @ Google, Crispy @
Google, CGK @ Google.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:40.950
And we'll get you some
information.

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:47.100
But otherwise, we'll probably
publish something, my guess

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:51.960
is, it'll be the beginning
of the new year.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:57.865
But if you need something
now, let us now.

00:37:57.865 --> 00:37:59.115
LEON: OK, thanks.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.370
KRISTAN UCCELLO: You're
sighing, Christian,

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:05.640
CHRISTIAN: Yeah, well.

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.100
LES: I gave his email address
out publicly.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.560
CHRISTIAN: Yeah,
no that's fine.

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.070
I mean, I always like
more email.

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.920
LES: [LAUGH]

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.270
CHRISTIAN: Just joking.

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:19.330
No, I think some of the APIs
are interesting for

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:20.010
developers.

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:24.250
But the challenge is, for
example, with PlayReady--

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:27.745
effectively, it's the standard
Android DRM framework APIs.

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.150
The feature of Android DRM
framework is, it's so generic.

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:36.340
You can pass so many
things to it.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.670
KRISTAN UCCELLO: It's a
framework of frameworks for

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:38.550
frameworks.

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:42.700
CHRISTIAN: Yes, so, especially
with PlayReady DRM, there is

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.730
also a lot of different
configurations for

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:46.530
servers and so on.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:51.980
So you need to be effectively
a PlayReady licensee to have

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.800
access to all of the information
that you actually

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:58.580
need to use the framework
successfully.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:02.030
So if you are a PlayReady
licensee, and you have all the

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:05.720
information, we can help you
plug it into the DRM framework

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:08.080
and make it work.

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:11.324
LES: Yeah, if you weren't
a licensee, you probably

00:39:11.324 --> 00:39:14.770
wouldn't have PlayReady
content.

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:16.140
KRISTAN UCCELLO: I think one of
the more interesting wider

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:18.630
APIs, though, is still the
quality of service, and being

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:21.800
able to track your video and
media playback capabilities,

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.170
and what have you.

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:27.470
And like one of my other
favorite APIs, which--

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:32.250
I don't know, it's no
v3-specific, the USB host?

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:33.010
CHRISTIAN: No, it's not.

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:33.850
KRISTAN UCCELLO: No, OK.

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:35.575
I just really like that API.

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:40.744
So--

00:39:40.744 --> 00:39:44.710
LES: We've have a lot of people
join, though we're

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:47.250
trying to wind up.

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:49.430
KRISTAN UCCELLO: We always tend
to get the most people

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:51.510
joining right when we're
wrapping it up.

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:55.620
But let's see, so Eduardo, you
don't have a question.

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:58.900
And Marcello, do you, by chance,
have a question?

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.260
I mean, we're literally just
about to wrap this up here.

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.330
OK, Eduardo has one.

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:03.580
He's typing.

00:40:09.604 --> 00:40:12.056
LES: OK.

00:40:12.056 --> 00:40:13.306
[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:17.300
CHRISTIAN: Building
up the suspense.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.772
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Daniel,
was that you speaking?

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:24.310
DANIEL: That's me.

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:28.660
I'm on a Zoom tablet.

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:32.220
KRISTAN UCCELLO: You're
on a Zoom tablet.

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.470
DANIEL: Yes.

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:39.260
So good that you can hear me.

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:40.510
[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:00.440
KRISTAN UCCELLO:
You know what?

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.360
It's too choppy.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.610
I really can't make out
what you're saying.

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:08.760
If you type it in the chat,
we can go from there.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:11.580
So I'm going to answer Eduardo's
question here. "I

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:13.960
would like to know about the
emulator for Windows if you

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:17.400
guys have any news." Ahh!

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:20.580
My frustration is not
at you, Eduardo.

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:22.230
LES: I'll answer instead.

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:23.720
KRISTAN UCCELLO: All right,
Les, why don't you do that

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:24.910
before I blow a casket.

00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:29.460
LES: OK, so we have been within
days of releasing the

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:36.920
emulator for Windows and Mac
for about a month, which is

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:40.790
why Crispy is somewhat
frustrated.

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:43.140
We're waiting for one
bug to get fixed.

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:47.160
As soon as it's fixed,
it'll get released.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:55.220
It will be the final release
in the 2x series since it

00:41:55.220 --> 00:42:01.790
doesn't make sense to release it
for v3, which is basically

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:08.020
all media features, which
wouldn't work on an emulator.

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.740
So it's coming.

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:12.120
We apologize.

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.740
We understand the importance
of getting this out.

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:21.230
And we are close, is
all I can say.

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:25.640
And Crispy vents his
frustrations regularly in the

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:28.860
internal emails, so there's
no need for him to do it

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:30.110
externally.

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:35.010
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Yes, yes,
you're probably right.

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:38.230
I've actually had to write a few
apology emails to people

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:39.810
because I get so--

00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:40.956
I don't now, I just.

00:42:40.956 --> 00:42:41.810
CHRISTIAN: Passionate
about things.

00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:42.450
KRISTAN UCCELLO: I'm
very passionate.

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:46.120
And it's like, ahh.

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.250
It's--

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:50.880
I'm a very expressive person.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:54.140
LES: Coming soon.

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:59.110
I'm reminded of the movie
"Buckaroo Banzai," where one

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:01.210
of the main characters
is asked, when are we

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:03.000
going to Planet 10.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.210
And his response is, "real
soon." Or, "soon." And they

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:13.020
ask, "how soon?" And he says
"real soon." So I stepped on

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:17.512
my own punchline, OK.

00:43:17.512 --> 00:43:19.760
KRISTAN UCCELLO: All right, so
Eduardo, you said you had one

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:23.900
other question about
picture in picture?

00:43:27.052 --> 00:43:30.830
LES: Eduardo's got the
good questions today.

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:31.670
All right, go ahead.

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:34.630
Get I will remain calm.

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:36.340
I will drink.

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:37.160
Christian can answer.

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:38.220
CHRISTIAN: I need to drink more

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:39.595
heavily, too, before those.

00:43:39.595 --> 00:43:39.850
KRISTAN UCCELLO: No, I don't--

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.440
I kid, of course.

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:43.256
Let's hear your question?

00:43:43.256 --> 00:43:48.595
LES: "If maybe, no."

00:43:48.595 --> 00:43:51.260
KRISTAN UCCELLO: So yeah,
picture in picture--

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:52.890
it's not going to be--

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:54.030
there's no plan.

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:54.750
There's no road map.

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:58.070
There's nothing to announce of
any capabilities where a

00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:01.850
developer's going to be able to
use picture in picture in

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:04.910
the way that, I think, everybody
wants to use it.

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:08.320
The why of it, it's
clouded and murky.

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.970
And I'm not going to rehash.

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:12.850
But yeah, the quick answer,
as Les said, is

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:14.330
kind of, no, sorry.

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:15.170
LES: No.

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:18.560
I mean, I can answer
the why, actually.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:20.710
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Oh, OK.

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:23.010
LES: Even though Leon
has open sourced a

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:25.590
picture in picture thing.

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:27.265
Basically--

00:44:27.265 --> 00:44:28.630
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Thanks, Leon.

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:34.270
LES: The road map for Google TV
devices is, how can we make

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:36.150
them less expensive.

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:39.100
I mean, that's the fundamental
question.

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:40.880
That doesn't mean there
won't be really

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.410
high-end Google TV devices.

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:44.720
There will be.

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:50.330
But we want to make the minimum
Google TV devices as

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:52.530
inexpensive as possible.

00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:57.450
So some of the hardware
capabilities that would be

00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:02.830
needed to bring picture in
picture to developers might

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:07.140
not be on some devices.

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:15.600
And so, it's kind of just
the way it goes.

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:18.540
That said, shit, take a look
at what Leon just posted in

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:22.388
the chat links.

00:45:22.388 --> 00:45:24.640
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Yeah, I've
got to take a look and see

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.596
what can be done there.

00:45:27.596 --> 00:45:32.820
All right, so I think we've had
a pretty good Hangout this

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:33.120
time around.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.070
So we've gone on for
about 45 minutes.

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:37.590
I'm going to wrap it up here,
mainly because Christian and I

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:41.926
have a lot of work we have
to do on our slides.

00:45:41.926 --> 00:45:43.490
And time is quickly
running out.

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:45.150
And we have other interruptions
constantly.

00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:49.120
So thank you all
for joining us.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:52.000
I hope everyone's enjoying,
sort of, the way we're

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.260
organically formatting
the show.

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:56.895
I guess, if you could
call it a show.

00:45:56.895 --> 00:45:59.985
We have news, demos, and then
open discussion questions.

00:45:59.985 --> 00:46:00.950
CHRISTIAN: On our weekly
comedy show.

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:02.360
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Is
turning into that.

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.700
I think we're going to have to
get suits from the '70s next

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:07.990
time and have a big
game show board.

00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:11.552
Maybe we'll get someone who
can point at things.

00:46:11.552 --> 00:46:14.760
LES: No, we can just back to the
Mexican wrestling masks.

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.660
KRISTAN UCCELLO: Yeah, I should
bring those back in.

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:20.490
Actually, I considered
wearing my sombrero.

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:22.490
So I bought a sombrero last
time I was in Mexico.

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:24.640
I haven't brought it in to
wear it yet, but it was

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:25.590
raining this morning.

00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:26.670
And I didn't want
to get it wet.

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:28.826
Now it's sunny, ironically.

00:46:28.826 --> 00:46:32.360
But maybe-- ah, we'll see what
the New Year brings.

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:36.810
So just to recap, there will be
one more Hangout this year.

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:39.900
We're going to do that
in two weeks time.

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.010
And that will be the last
one for the year.

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:46.790
And then we'll pick it back up
in the new year, possibly,

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:48.980
with a weekly approach.

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:52.810
But I think the biweekly
is working out well.

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:54.520
So I think we're to probably
stay with that put for a bit.

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.180
But send us your feedback
if you have any.

00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:00.110
Thank you all again for joining
us, and keep on

00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:01.610
developing.

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:02.510
Ciao.

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:03.760
LES: Aloha.
