00:00:00.611 --> 00:00:03.450
(rock music)

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.949
- The Jeselnik &amp; Rosenthal Vanity Project.

00:00:05.949 --> 00:00:06.782
- [Both] JRVP.

00:00:06.782 --> 00:00:08.070
- [Erika] Junior vice president.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.340
- We're gonna start the news with

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.880
my favorite story to
come across the NFL wires

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.440
in a long time, and that
was Bills cornerback

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.910
Vontae Davis deciding
to retire at halftime.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.370
He pulled himself out of the game;

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.370
just went up to the coaches.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.370
He started the game.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.780
Played 29 snaps in the first half.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.820
And according to Bills
coach Sean McDermott,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.160
just told them he was done,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
put on his street clothes, got in his car,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.670
and left the stadium right away.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.030
He said he meant no disrespect

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.430
to his coaches and teammates.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.630
He just thought it was time
to end his career at halftime.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.670
- How do you feel about that?

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.700
I saw a lot of players saying

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.370
it was the most disrespectful
thing they've ever seen.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.203
How did you,

00:00:48.203 --> 00:00:50.190
how do sports journalists feel about it?

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.470
Are they kind of laughing at it?

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.140
Or are they upset with him?

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.080
They think it's a weak move.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.530
- It's one of those
stories that's annoying

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.440
'cause everyone has the exact same take,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.033
which is just, how could he do that?

00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:03.740
That's the worst thing
that you could possibly do.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.280
It's so disrespectful to your teammates.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.350
And I understand that.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.430
But I kind of almost just felt bad,

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.120
'cause to be in the mental
space that he had to be in

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.900
to quit at halftime,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.920
probably was not a fun thing.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.180
There's a reason why no
one quits during a game.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.690
- Sure.
- That's a pretty almost

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.347
difficult thing to do,
to have to just say,

00:01:22.347 --> 00:01:23.270
"Bye, see ya."

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.340
- Absolutely.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.420
My only problem with it,

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.830
I mean, I've seen all these takes of like,

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.050
it's disrespectful, it's awful.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.740
You gotta be with your team, whatever.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.600
The team doesn't care about the player.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.767
And if he had handled it
differently, been like,

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:33.880
"Coach, I'm hurt."

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.270
And then after the game done it,

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.190
no one would have cared.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.930
- Or just half-assed the
second half of the game,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.440
which plenty of people would have done.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.750
- Yeah.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.610
My only problem is that he
changed into street clothes

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.490
before he left.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.380
I think you want to walk
out of there full uniform

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.650
with the pads, 'cause they're
not gonna get 'em back.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.230
They're not gonna send
somebody to your house.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.080
And again, my dream would
be to quit and just leave

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.280
in the middle of a show.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.883
- Anthony?

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.470
Anthony?

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.303
- I'm still here.

00:02:04.303 --> 00:02:07.970
See, that was me wanting to show you

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.050
what a terrible actor Greg is.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.320
Because Greg could not pull that off.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.182
It'd be like, you would think like,

00:02:13.182 --> 00:02:14.015
oh, is Anthony still there?

00:02:14.015 --> 00:02:15.670
And then as soon as Greg opens his mouth,

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.900
like let's do it with you.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.120
Tell me you want to

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.750
quit the show.
- It has always been my dream

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.533
to quit at the halftime of a podcast.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.185
- Greg?

00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:31.932
(mumbling) Greg?

00:02:31.932 --> 00:02:34.660
(Greg laughing)
Greg, where are you?

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.820
- Antonio Brown has been
in the news all week.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.370
First he got into a sideline altercation,

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.540
or just argument with his coaches.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.500
And then on Monday, a
former Steelers PR guy

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.710
sent a Tweet out saying that Antonio Brown

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.560
needs to thank his lucky
stars because he was drafted

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.700
by a team that had Ben.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.020
And Ben got AB paid.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.690
And Antonio Brown quote retweeted that

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.850
and just responded, "Trade
me; let's find out."

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.420
And of course, everyone
went a little nuts.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.640
Antonio Brown also didn't
show up to work on Monday,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.720
which is the day they get
treatment, they have meetings.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.600
Wasn't there; it's unclear
whether it was excused or not.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.690
His agent says he does
not want to be traded.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.950
But he put that out there on social media.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.700
Trade me; let's find out.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.580
What do you think of
your team falling apart

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.313
so early in the season?

00:03:28.313 --> 00:03:31.070
- I mean, it's actually kind of,

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.150
I wouldn't say it's a joy.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.830
I expect us to fully rebound

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.610
and win the Super Bowl.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.260
But it does kind of take the pressure off

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.570
of being a fan of seeing
Le'Veon kind of hold out,

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.000
and Antonio getting upset.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.810
And I think Antonio'd be
getting a lot more touches

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.910
if Le'Veon was out there.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.010
So I understand his frustration.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.640
- I mean, he was targeted
17 times in the game.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.150
How many more times can
they throw the ball at him?

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.470
- 18, Greg.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.090
18 and higher.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.778
In fact, any number higher than 17.

00:03:57.778 --> 00:03:58.613
- [Greg] 17's an extraordinary amount.

00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:00.260
- That the answer to your question.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.920
Oh yeah, but wide receivers are all nuts.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.530
Remember when Jerry Rice said he wasn't

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.060
getting enough respect
after the Super Bowl

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.860
when they named him MVP?

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.010
He's like that.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.140
And Antonio Brown can
do whatever he wants.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.970
He cuts his hair like he's
daring you to say something.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.930
He smiles like he's
never had anything stuck

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.050
in his teeth before.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.430
The man runs routes like it's the only way

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.400
to get into heaven.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.320
And if the Steelers ever
traded him over a Tweet,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.040
I'd jump off the tallest
cliff in Los Angeles.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.770
And right before I hit the ground,

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.778
I'd scream, "Free skydiving lessons!"

00:04:29.778 --> 00:04:34.040
- (chuckling) Why would
that be it that you said?

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.400
- Why would what would be what?

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.730
- Why would that be what you said?

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.800
- Free skydiving lessons?

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.460
That is the funniest thing you can yell

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.010
if you jump to your death
around other people.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.843
If you were standing there,

00:04:44.843 --> 00:04:46.780
and someone fell to death
right in front of you,

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.687
and right before they fell, they yelled,

00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:50.050
"Free skydiving lessons!"

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.859
You would not be able to stop laughing.

00:04:51.859 --> 00:04:52.692
(Greg chuckling)

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:54.390
That is the absolute
funniest thing you could yell

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.720
jumping to your death.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.440
- I think it would
confuse a lot of people.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.400
- Yeah.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.233
But in a funny way.

00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:00.170
Erika, back me up.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.547
- [Erika] That'd be pretty funny.

00:05:01.547 --> 00:05:02.380
- But you would never know.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.130
You would never know would you?

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.963
- What do you mean?

00:05:04.963 --> 00:05:06.730
- I mean, you would never
know the reaction that it got.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.053
- No, but it wouldn't matter.

00:05:08.053 --> 00:05:09.480
- If it landed.
- You would know.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.031
- You would hear about it in heaven.

00:05:11.031 --> 00:05:11.864
(Greg chuckling)

00:05:11.864 --> 00:05:13.220
But again if you think if anyone,

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.930
if any of the viewers or listeners

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.070
can think of something funnier to yell

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.740
when you jump to your death
than free skydiving lessons,

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.220
then please, please let me know.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.210
But I've thought about
this a lot for years,

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.290
and I've finally gotten to use it

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.831
with this Antonio Brown story.

00:05:27.831 --> 00:05:30.248
(rock music)
