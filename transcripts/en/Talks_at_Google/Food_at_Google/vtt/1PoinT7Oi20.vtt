&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: All right.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.379
Well, good afternoon everyone.

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.129
Thanks for coming out to see Chef Christina
here.

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:13.170
The format today will be--just to give you
the rules of the game --we'll have an awesome

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.370
talk by Chef Christina in just a moment.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.750
And it will be followed by some Q&amp;A.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.490
So, if you have a question, please go to the
mic because we are recording this on YouTube.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.670
So, they need to be able to hear you in the
virtual world as well as the real world.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.320
But with that, I'm sure you guys all know
why you're here today.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.000
Chef Christina is here from Momofuku Milk
Bar from New York City.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.930
You know her for her Compost Cookies, her
Crack Pie, her Blueberry Cookies and many,

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.880
many other fun and delicious, magically satisfying
treats.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.750
So, I'm sure you guys do not wanna hear any
more of me.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.180
So with that, Chef Christina from Momofuku
Milk Bar.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.520
[applause and cheering]

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.640
&gt;&gt;Christina Tosi: Hi everybody.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.569
Can everyone hear me OK?

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:07.609
Awesome.

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:09.689
This is an insane turnout.

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.289
[laughing] Thank you to everybody for coming.

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:15.591
I usually--.

00:01:15.591 --> 00:01:18.719
We've been doing talks like this.

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:22.920
The book came out on October 25th, so we've
been doing this for about two and a half weeks

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.920
on tour.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.569
And it's usually a much smaller group.

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:29.649
And my first question is always like, "OK,
who's ever been to Momofuku?"

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.740
Or, "Who owns the Momofuku cookbook?"

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.869
Or, "Who's been to Milk Bar?"

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.569
And every once in a while, you get a hand
or two raised and it's fun and it's fun to

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.029
know that people came just out of curiosity.

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:45.759
But it's pretty amazing [laughing] to see
how many of you came because you know exactly

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:46.829
why you're here.

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.849
So, I will spare you with those silly questions.

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:53.709
So, Momofuku Milk Bar.

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:59.579
Momofuku is this tiny little restaurant group
that started in the East Village about seven

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.969
years ago by Dave Chang, the chef/owner of
the Momofuku restaurants.

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:10.310
There was Momofuku Noodle Bar, Momofuku Ssäm
Bar, Momofuku Ko, which is like a tasting

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.030
menu only restaurant.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.330
You have to get your reservation online only.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.760
Compete for your seats.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.730
Momofuku Milk Bar opened next about three
years ago in November.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.570
And we also have Má Pêche, which is in Midtown
outside of the East Village.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.310
And Dave recently opened a Momofuku restaurant
in Sydney, Australia in the Star City Casino.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.140
And it's going really well.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.200
We now have four little bakeries, or four
little retail Milk Bar locations in New York.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.040
We have our original East Village location.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.930
We have a little location that is part of
Má Pêche in Midtown.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.100
We just opened a spot on the Upper West Side--87th
and Columbus near Central Park.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.650
And we have our kitchen in Williamsburg, Brooklyn
where we also have a little store.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.220
So, hopefully many of you already own the
Momofuku cookbook and you know the history

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.070
of the Momofuku restaurants and you know a
little bit about Dave and the mentality and

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.510
the attitude and the passion behind what we
do at Momofuku in general.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.310
I started working at Momofuku about six years
ago.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.130
I was, I am still, but I was a home baker
growing up.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.200
I grew up with a bunch of grandmas and aunts
and a mom that really loved baking.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.490
And I also have a very sweet tooth.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:44.660
So, I loved mixing cookie dough and eating
it more so than baking it.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:52.220
But I started there with my love for baking
and all things sweet-- cake batters and frostings

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.120
and all of those sorts of things.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.990
And I went to college and I studied Applied
Mathematics [laughter] and the Italian language

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.760
because I loved doing those things.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.900
I love learning and being stimulated and discovering
these things.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.370
My mom's an accountant, so I think that's
where the mathematics comes into play, but

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.480
I ended up graduating from school mostly to
appease my parents.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:25.499
And I thought to myself that none of those
things would really fit for me as a profession

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:29.900
and that I wanted something more active and
creative and stimulating in this way.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.380
And I feel like you all have figured out a
great way to have that in your lives, but

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.569
for me, I thought, "I want to work in a kitchen.

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:40.849
I want to be a pastry chef.

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:45.610
I want to make what my real passion is into
my profession.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.199
So, I moved to New York to, sort of, sight-unseen--.

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.490
I had only ever been to New York City for
three hours once when I was a teenager.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.509
And I just felt this draw to New York.

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:01.240
And I thought, "I'm just gonna move to New
York and I'm gonna go to pastry school and

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.639
I'm gonna be a pastry chef and that's what
I'm gonna do."

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.080
And it just made sense in my head.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.160
So, I just told my parents one day like, "Hey
Mom, this is what I'm gonna do."

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.319
And without ever really speaking about it
more, like any further beyond that, I just

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:15.319
had it set in my head.

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:16.560
So, I did it.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.919
And I went to the French Culinary Institute
and I studied pastry arts and I ended up working

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:28.740
in a bunch of fine-dining restaurants in the
city.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:36.139
Six-day work weeks, sixteen-, eighteen-hour
days, paid almost nothing because I just loved

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:37.139
it so much.

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:38.139
I loved the challenge.

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:39.139
I loved learning.

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:44.830
I loved that I was making a life for myself
and doing what I really loved to do and that

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.240
there was no end.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.139
Exhaustion was never really came into mind.

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:56.620
But as I was working in these fine-dining
restaurants and working my way up the ranks

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:05.669
of pastry kitchens and pastry departments,
I got jumbled up because these fine-dining

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:14.669
restaurants usually are very detail-oriented
and they're very precise and they're very--.

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:19.339
I can only ever use the adjective "finicky"
because for me in my head, I see it as finicky.

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:25.259
I see these delicate touilles that top a chocolate
soufflé as finicky.

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:29.560
And six different sauces and picking herbs
and putting them on plate, for my personality,

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.530
was like I loved the challenge of it and I
loved learning, but for me, it was far too

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:33.530
finicky for me.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:39.120
And so, I started to worry that I would never
really actually become a pastry chef and I

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:46.409
would never make it to the top because it
wouldn't really be honest to me and it wouldn't

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:54.009
meet my need and my desire for being creative
and being in a creative profession that had

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:55.009
my voice.

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:56.751
And so, I stepped out.

00:06:56.751 --> 00:07:03.349
I ended up stepping out of the kitchen in
New York and trying to figure out what I wanted

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:04.349
to do.

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:11.580
And I met Dave through Wylie Dufresne, who's
the chef and owner at wd~50 in the Lower East

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.580
Side.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.069
And it was actually the last kitchen that
I worked in as a pastry cook.

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:21.559
And if you're not familiar with it, it's very
high-technique, very high, forward-thinking

00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:27.110
in terms of food and the presentation of food
and pushing boundaries with what you can do

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.839
with flavors and techniques and food.

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:38.919
And Wylie ended up introducing me to Dave
to help him with this thing called a HACCP

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:45.419
plan, which is a Hazard Analysis plan for
sous-vide cooking.

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:51.870
If you're not familiar, it's like a large-scale
food saver machine called a Cryovac machine

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.289
that creates an oxygen-free environment that
you can cook in.

00:07:55.289 --> 00:07:59.110
And the Health Department in New York City
had all of these brand new, very stringent

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.949
regulations and Dave needed help.

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:09.909
So, I had taught myself how to write these
plans in working at wd~50 as a pastry cook.

00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:12.889
And Wylie was just like, "Can you help my
friend out?"

00:08:12.889 --> 00:08:15.539
So, I went and helped Dave out.

00:08:15.539 --> 00:08:16.849
And he just offered me a job.

00:08:16.849 --> 00:08:22.969
He just said, "OK, you know how to do this
sort of silly, dorky, overextended, HACCP

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:23.969
planning.

00:08:23.969 --> 00:08:27.809
You taught yourself so why don't you just
come work for me?"

00:08:27.809 --> 00:08:30.629
He had Noodle Bar and Ssäm Bar at the time.

00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:39.470
He was just starting to break out in terms
of his presence in food and in the food world

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.470
in New York.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:44.790
And he had a very, very small team of people.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:45.940
And I just said, "OK.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:46.940
I'll do it."

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.430
Because for me, I really didn't think I was
gonna make it as this pastry chef.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:57.500
And not because I wouldn't be able to get
there with hard work and determination, but

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:03.370
because I just thought maybe I have it all
wrong and I'm just not creative enough or

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:08.600
I don't have that fine-tuned, precisioned
attention to detail enough to be this fancy

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.600
pastry chef.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.530
So, I took the job with Dave because--and
I just said, "Yeah.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:13.530
I'll do it.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.530
Let's do it.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:15.530
I'll work for you."

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:16.530
And there was no job role.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:17.530
It was very un-kitchen related.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.750
It was like, "OK, well you know how to type
on a computer, so how about you do payroll."

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:28.480
[laughter] "And you type faster than me so
how about you type some recipes or the bathroom's

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.480
clogged.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.480
Call the plumber.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.480
Figure out how to do it and."

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.490
And so, I loved that.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:33.560
I loved that challenge.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:38.860
I loved not knowing what I was doing and figuring
it out and I loved knowing that there was

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:43.940
this huge outlet of things for me to learn
how to do and to figure how to do it.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:48.070
And I loved that sort of uphill battle challenge
that every day was gonna be different and

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:49.580
every day I was gonna be on my feet.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.570
And every day, I was gonna have to find a
creative solution.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:53.880
And that, for me, was--.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:59.140
It met enough of that need of what I wanted
to do in a day.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.100
So, I did it.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.380
But the thing was, I'd go to work every day
and do that and then I'd end up coming home

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:11.020
and baking in my kitchen, home late at night
because that was my routine.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.100
It's what I love to do.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:17.040
It was like, no matter how many hours I spent
at work doing God knows what, all I really

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.790
wanted to do was go home and bake.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.500
And it was my peace and my happiness in my
day.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.600
So, I would do it and I would go home.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.600
I'd bake.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.590
I'd bake one or two or three things and I'd
end up just bringing them in the next day

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:33.120
to work, to Dave, and two or three other people
that worked at Momofuku at the time, and feeding

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.450
them because I couldn't leave it in my kitchen.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:39.600
Then I couldn't go home and bake again 'cause
I wouldn't have an empty pan to bake something

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.850
into.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.130
And Dave would just gobble it all up.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:48.990
[laughter] And he would always, after a few
days or a few weeks of it, he would joke that,

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:53.700
"We should put this brownie or this cookie
or whatever it was that I threw together,

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.700
on the menu."

00:10:54.700 --> 00:11:03.130
Because at the time, Noodle Bar and Ssäm
Bar were very, very masculine, driven with

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:09.250
masculinity in loud, loud music, loud flavors
environment, but there was absolutely no value

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:10.250
placed on dessert.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:15.230
There wasn't even dessert on the menu, which,
even in New York City, it's strange to have

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:18.650
a restaurant where there's no coffee, there's
no tea, there's no dessert.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:19.650
You sit down.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.200
The music's playing loud.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.680
You order your food.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.680
You get it.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:24.680
It comes out warm.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.690
You eat it real fast because it's delicious.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:27.070
You pay your bill and you leave.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:30.570
And so, I always thought he was joking about--.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:35.350
OK, I did, I just threw together these brownies
at home of like whatever was in my cupboard.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:41.320
It was more just an exercise of peace at home
to bake than it was intentional.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:47.090
And one day I showed up and halfway through
the day, he was gobbling down whatever I had

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.400
eaten and he was just like, "Go.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.400
Go.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.170
Get into the kitchen and make something for
dessert tonight because I don't wanna talk

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.170
about it anymore.

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:55.170
I'm over it.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.160
This is clearly what you love to do.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.731
Finish payroll and then go and bake something
[laughter] and we're gonna put it on the menu

00:12:00.731 --> 00:12:02.630
tonight because I'm over this.

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.100
I don't want to talk about it anymore."

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.100
[laughter]

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.820
And so, I freaked out.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:07.820
A lot.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:13.840
And silently, because there was a show-no-mercy
attitude.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.440
That's kitchen mentality in any city.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:22.310
That was sort of how I was raised, too, with
the stubbornness.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.310
And I did it.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:24.310
I made a dessert.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:28.620
It was a strawberry shortcake with my own
twist on it.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.370
It's in the Momofuku cookbook.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:32.370
And it was fine.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:33.370
No one died.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:34.460
A few people ordered it.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.920
A few people ate it.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.130
It was good.

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:42.580
So, I came back the next day and did my normal
job of whatever it was that came up.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.840
And then I made it again.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.840
And again.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.580
And eventually, I ended up putting desserts
on the menus at the Momofuku Restaurants.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.330
Little by little, I had my fingerprints on
the menus at those restaurants.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:13:00.460
And it was one of those "What do you put on
the menu at a restaurant that doesn't serve

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.460
dessert?"

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:06.880
There's not really any value placed on dessert,
but these guys clearly love sweets because

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.270
when I bring in these platters of things,
they're gone in minutes.

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:18.980
And it's that Momofuku means Lucky Peach in
Japanese, but Dave is a Korean-American chef,

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.031
but we use local ingredients, but we use French
technique.

00:13:22.031 --> 00:13:23.800
And sometimes, we put a pasta on the menu.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.090
And what in the world do you make for dessert
in those terms?

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:33.740
And it's just like, well, all I know about
working here is that it's faced-paced, the

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.410
flavors are big, they're bold.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:36.670
They're in your face.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:37.780
Everything always tastes delicious.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:42.480
It's so delicious that you wanna eat it so
quickly and then get up and leave.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:49.930
[chuckles] And so, I would do whatever I could
to make a delicious, flavorful, seasonal thing

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:56.090
with a twist and a personality because that
was the only anchor that I had in knowing

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:59.540
Momofuku and in knowing the food of Momofuku
and the personalities of Momofuku.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.250
So, I did that for about a year.

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:07.030
And it was just me and I would just find whatever
space I had on a prep table in one of the

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.550
restaurants and just throw as many things
together as I could.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:19.400
And one day, there was a vacant Laundromat
next to Ssäm Bar on 2nd Avenue and 13th Street.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.060
And they lost their lease.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.860
They were taking all the washers and dryers
out.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:31.010
And Dave found whatever little corner I was
occupying on a prep table and ran up to me

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:35.380
and said, "The Laundromat is going out of
business.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:39.160
Somebody's gonna move in and take over the
space and run Momofuku out of--.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.440
They're gonna destroy us.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.920
They're gonna crumble our empire."

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.830
Which, of course, is not gonna happen.

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:44.830
[laughter]

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:49.391
But he's has this paranoia about him and this
energy about him because of it.

00:14:49.391 --> 00:14:52.080
And it was just like, "We gotta get in there.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.000
Let's open a bakery.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Do you wanna do it?"

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Like, let's open this bakery.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.880
And this is like, bringing up a concept that
had never been spoken about between the two

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.030
of us.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:08.360
I'm sure it was clear that I loved cookies
[giggles] and I loved baking cookies.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:13.290
There was never a cookie on the menu at Ssäm
Bar, at Noodle Bar, at Ko, because that just

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.720
wasn't the vibe of those restaurants.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.250
And I was just like, "Sure.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.740
Yeah, sure, I'll do it."

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.850
In my head, like every little girl dreams
about having a bakery.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:23.850
[laughter]

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:24.850
So, "Sure, I'll do it."

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:25.960
And I was like, "I'm serious.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:26.960
Do you wanna do it?

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.360
If you say yes, we have to do it right now."

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.360
And it was like, "Yeah, OK.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.360
I said yes.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.360
Let's do it."

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.360
[laughter]

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.360
And so, we just did it.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.870
And it was like one of those phone calls home
to my mom, or was similar to, "Hey, so Mom.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:42.670
I'm gonna move to New York City and go pastry
school and become a pastry chef and I'm gonna

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:43.850
get on a train tomorrow."

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:48.070
And it was the same sort of thing where it
was like, "Hey Mom, I'm gonna open this bakery

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:52.530
and it's gonna open in like a month and I'll
tell you when that is" sort of thing.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:55.250
And then you just do it.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:16:03.960
And it's being a person of your word and suppressing
all of the fear and doubt and all of those

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:08.060
things in your head and just pushing through.

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:13.630
And I like to say we opened the bakery overnight,
though it took a little while to renovate

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.210
this laundromat into a bakery.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:22.910
But it ended up being this bakery that, in
my head, it makes sense to the way Momofuku

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:29.150
and the Momofuku restaurants and the menus
are in terms of food and flavors and curiosities.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.550
But we ended up opening this bakery.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:39.170
And I like to describe it as this quirky bakery
with an American baked goods sensibility,

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:43.210
but with a little bit of a twist, or with
a little more personality, because instead

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:46.960
of chocolate chip cookies, we sell cornflake
chocolate chip marshmallow cookies.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.670
Or, instead of chocolate chip cookies, we
sell compost cookies that have chocolate chips

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:56.660
in them, but they also have butterscotch chips
and pretzels and potato chips and coffee grounds

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.020
and stuff like that.

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:05.800
And making the menu was just making a bunch
of stuff that I knew I loved baking at home

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:11.050
or making this cookie dough and then throwing
whatever I had in my cupboard into this cookie

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.380
dough.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.620
And it made sense in my head.

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:17.780
And I was too busy to worry about it not making
sense in anyone else's head.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:24.959
And I sort of got tricked into being this
pastry chef that I didn't know that I was,

00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:32.050
or that I could be, and I ended up making
this menu that I thought, "I'm just gonna

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:37.040
make what makes sense in my head and what's
honest to what I love to bake and what I know

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:42.560
how to bake and what I know how to bake for
somebody or for a family meal or what have

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.560
you."

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:47.410
And it's honest and it feels right and then
I'm not gonna worry about anything else.

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:53.730
And so, everything that we sell I think makes
sense in our head, though most people ask

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.920
how we come up with it or how it came to be.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:03.410
And so, we brought a lot of stuff for you
guys to taste so that you could understand

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:08.760
our food beyond--.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.850
Strip it down for you beyond just a cookie.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:20.780
So for me, making this menu for a bakery was
like, "OK, I've been training to be a pastry

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.170
chef for many years.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:27.120
What do pastry chefs, where do you start?

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.250
Do you start with flavor?

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.660
Do you start with texture?

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.660
Do you start with technique?"

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:37.360
And for me, I would strip it down to my favorite
things that I loved making as a pastry cook

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.540
in other people's pastry kitchens.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.030
And I'm a real creature of texture.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.770
I love crunch.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:51.180
Even if it's not crunch as a texture, it's
silky smooth or it's sandy or it's crumby

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.809
or what have you.

00:18:52.809 --> 00:18:59.330
And so, we started playing around with these
crumbs and crunches, which makes sense in

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:06.270
my head, but there are these pops of color
and flavor and texture.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:11.540
The cook book is laid out with these basic
techniques and ingredients that we love to

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:19.410
use in our kitchen when we start to bake,
when we start to develop our menu and a new

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:20.410
recipe.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:25.770
One of the things that we love making is a
crunch and we brought cornflake crunch today.

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:29.750
And it's made with Corn Flakes, so that always
makes people smile.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:33.690
And it's a flavor that most people know and
can relate to.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:40.450
And we toss it with some sugar and some salt
and some melted butter and some milk powder.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:46.020
And we just spread it out on a sheet pan and
toast it off in the oven so you get an idealized

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:50.970
version of Corn Flakes or maybe an idealized
version of Frosted Flakes, or something like

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:54.059
that.

00:19:54.059 --> 00:20:01.130
In most pastry kitchens you'll use something
like this that has this flavor and texture

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:05.530
and broken down organic nature and you'll
use it to just put on the bottom of a plate

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:09.470
to hold a scoop of ice cream so it doesn't
slide around on the plate when it goes to

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.190
the table.

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:17.360
But for me, I thought, "Well, I wanna make
this crunch or this crumb, and what else can

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.520
I do with it?"

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:24.340
And so, we would just play around with flavors
until we got a lot of fun, different crunches.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.080
We make one with Ritz Crackers.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.650
We make one with Fruity Pebbles.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:30.220
We make one with pretzels.

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:37.100
It's basically anything that already has a
flavor and a texture that you just crumble

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.720
up with your hands, butter, sugar, salt, maybe
some milk powder.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.780
You bake it off.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:46.790
And then, we'll take these little things,
these little snacky items and we'll see how

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:50.780
many places we can put them--on restaurant
menus and on our bakery menu.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:54.670
And we make a Corn Flake, chocolate chip,
marshmallow cookie.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:59.490
And it's a chocolate chip cookie, but we fold
this Corn Flake crunch into it and we put

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:01.280
these mini marshmallows in it.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:06.970
And all of a sudden, we have this amped up
version of a chocolate chip cookie.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:10.090
And we'll take this Corn Flake crunch and
we'll use it as an ice cream topping.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:14.090
Or, we'll take it and we'll crunch it down
a little bit more and we'll press it into

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:22.960
a pie tin and use it as a pie crust instead
of your average pie crust because why not?

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.340
And I don't wanna make a pie crust.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.940
I have this great snacky thing.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.010
I mean, I personally will just--.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.540
We have little cups to pass around for you
guys to taste.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:35.770
But it's good to just throw back or make it
into a trail mix or make it into a granola.

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:41.110
And instead of starting off with something
like a pie crust or instead of starting off

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:48.090
with just looking at flour, sugar, and butter
as a dough, how can I start from a more creative

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:49.090
standpoint?

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:54.830
And then that's my staple ingredient that
I use and I see how far I can push it.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:22:01.280
You can layer it in a cake for flavor and
texture and a visual appeal.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.670
And you can play with the flavor of Corn Flakes.

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:05.430
You can play with the flavor of cereal.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:07.340
And you can substitute it in and out.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.860
And so, we start with these--.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:13.820
Instead of starting with just butter and sugar,
instead of starting with just a cake recipe,

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:20.270
we'll start with these crumbs and these crunches
because you're starting from like a platform

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:22.530
of something a little bit more creative or
a little different.

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:27.990
Or, you're starting with something that doesn't
already exist in everybody else's kitchen.

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:29.870
We make this thing called a Milk Crumb.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.880
And it's like a sandy burst of flavor.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.730
And in a lot of pastry kitchens, in savory
kitchens, they make them.

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:39.179
Sometimes they call them crumbs.

00:22:39.179 --> 00:22:40.210
Sometimes they call them sand.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:43.950
It was a very 90s thing with the Adria Brothers.

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:49.150
And even at wd~50, we would make red onion
sand and soil.

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:51.970
We would make coffee soil.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:56.640
And it's just this sandy burst of flavor.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:03.370
But when I started menu developing for Milk
Bar, I thought, "I love this technique."

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:09.390
I would stand in the kitchen when no one was
looking and just eat these crumbs as my snack.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:10.390
[laughter]

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:12.690
And I would pour milk over them and eat them
as cereal.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:16.880
And so I thought, "Well I'm gonna take that
technique and see what I can with it in terms

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:20.420
of flavor that pushes it beyond what I already
know."

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:26.770
And again, we would use this and we would
drape it over a plate of foie gras at wd~50

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:28.610
for flavor and for texture.

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:32.690
We'd sprinkle a little down on a plate and
put a scoop of ice cream or a quenelle of

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:33.930
sorbet on it.

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.920
But for me, I thought, "Well, what else can
we do with this?"

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.510
And it's milk powder.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:40.510
It's milk powder.

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:45.110
I don't know if anyone's mom or dad ever used
milk powder and hydrated it with water and

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:46.490
made them drink milk as a kid.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:47.490
I did.

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:52.410
[laughs] And it was gross back then, but I
thought, "Let's use this milk powder."

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:57.400
Which is a staple in any pastry chef's kitchen
because you typically put it in ice cream

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.330
to give it more body and flavor.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:04.830
"Let's make an idealized version of what milk
should taste like."

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:12.170
Like, in my head, milk should be sweet and
milky and a little savory, but to have this

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:14.740
balance that regular milk doesn't really have.

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:18.500
My mom used to make me drink skim milk as
a kid and I hated it.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:23.660
So, I want to take what I think milk should
taste like and then make that into a crumb.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.130
So, it's flour.

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.130
It's butter.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:27.630
It's sugar.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:31.679
It's milk powder as the dried flavored ingredient
that goes into it.

00:24:31.679 --> 00:24:34.520
And we put a little white chocolate in here.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:39.540
And then we take this crumb and we fold it
into a cookie dough and we have a cookie called

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:43.200
the Blueberry Cream cookie.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.140
I think about milk crumbs and I go, "OK.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.140
It's milky.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.140
It's creamy."

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.460
So then I think about peaches and cream.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.690
And then I think about blueberries and cream.

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:53.760
And then I think about blueberry muffin.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:58.730
And then I think about the best part of a
blueberry muffin, which is the tippy top of

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:02.430
the muffin where it's a little fudgy and a
little crunchy.

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:03.640
And we make it into a cookie.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:10.710
So, we take these milk crumbs and we fold
them into a cookie dough with dried blueberries.

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:15.350
We'll also take it and we'll use it in a plated
dessert for one of the restaurants and we'll

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:19.630
make a peach sorbet because peaches and cream
makes sense to everybody.

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:26.010
And then we take some graham crackers and
we'll blend them down into a puree that we

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:32.100
like to call a ganache 'cause it represents
a little bit more texture and body in the

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:35.070
world of cooking and pastry chef-dom.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:40.210
And all of a sudden, you have milk crumbs
and peaches for a peaches and cream element.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:45.820
And then you have this peach sorbet and this
graham cracker ganache and it gives you this

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.170
peach cobbler effect.

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:52.470
And all of a sudden we're just using the same
crumb we use in so many different things,

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:56.980
but we're figuring out how many different
places we can re-purpose it and how creative

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.240
we can get with it.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:04.250
We layer it in a pistachio cake that has layers
of pistachio cake and lemon curd and these

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:06.350
milk crumbs and pistachio frosting.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:12.290
And it gives a nuttiness and a floralness
and this sweet, milkiness that brings out

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:13.731
both and enhances it.

00:26:13.731 --> 00:26:16.820
It gives it texture and it gives it a visual
pop.

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:20.320
And it makes sense and it's fun and it tastes
good.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:26.410
And all of a sudden, we've created five or
six desserts out of two things that we really

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:28.350
just like snacking on in our kitchen.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:32.130
[giggles] We also have a birthday crumb that's
sort of like--.

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:38.630
Did anybody's mom or dad or sister or aunt
or uncle ever make them a boxed Funfetti cake

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:39.630
for your birthday?

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:40.630
[chuckles]

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:44.010
For me, that's the best birthday cake ever.

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.820
And we thought, "OK, we're gonna be this quirky
bakery with baked goods.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:50.670
It's personal to us.

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:54.429
We want it to have personality and we want
it to--.

00:26:54.429 --> 00:26:57.690
All baked goods should feel like home and
should be made with love."

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:03.380
And for me, it's like that funny dichotomy
of well, this box cake mix that you just add

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:09.940
eggs and oil to, it tastes like home because
that's what you make for your kid when you're

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:12.960
trying to raise a family and you wanna make
a birthday cake.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:19.400
So, we took our love for that Funfetti box
cake mix and we totally deconstructed it to,

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.730
"So many people make this box cake mix from
a box.

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:25.280
How about if we figure out how to make it
from scratch?"

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:31.130
Because those flavors are the flavors of home
and the flavors that you relate to and that

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:34.530
you remember and that send this signal or
this eye--.

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:37.810
They make your eyes get wider.

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:39.500
And how do we make that flavor from scratch?"

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:43.990
And so, we would take the back of a box of--.

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:47.280
We take the Funfetti cake mix home and we
look at the back of the box and just start

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.280
deconstructing.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.870
Like, how are we gonna recreate these flavors
in our kitchen?

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.670
And we figured out how to remake the cake
from scratch.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:59.840
We figured out how to make frosting that tastes
just like it's that shelf-stable canned frosting

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.630
[laughter] that you eat through your childhood
and through college.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:05.790
And we ended up making these crumbs out of
it as well.

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:10.710
And it's the same ingredients that are in
a cake, but instead of making it into a cake

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:15.760
with butter and eggs and oil, we make it into
a little crumb with just a little bit of melted

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.760
butter.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:20.040
And we'll take it and we'll fold it into a
cookie to make a confetti cookie.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:24.070
And we'll layer it into that birthday cake
that we make from scratch for more texture

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:27.480
and more flavor.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.480
And we go.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.760
That's how we go from there.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.490
We start with these crumbs or these crunches.

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:36.490
We make this milk called Cereal Milk and it's
meant to taste like what's left in your bowl

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:41.309
after you eat all the cereal out of it, which
is a flavor that everybody knows whether it's

00:28:41.309 --> 00:28:46.440
made with Lucky Charms or made with Capn Crunch
or made with Golden Grahams.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.300
Everybody knows that flavor of milk.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:52.630
Like, everyone's done that before and so,
that's a recipe that we'll start with in our

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:56.190
kitchen and we'll see how many places we can
put it.

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:57.480
We make it into drinking milk.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.260
We make it into ice cream.

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:03.160
We set it with a little bit of gelatin and
we make into a panna cotta.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:08.780
And all of a sudden, we have one simple approach
and one simple flavor and we have three or

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:11.120
four new menu items.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:15.450
We'll take this Corn Flake crunch and press
it into a crust and then fill it with Cereal

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:20.000
Milk ice cream because it just makes sense.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.610
And we're just using things that are already
in our kitchen.

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:26.480
We're using these recipes that are already
in our kitchen.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:31.929
So when we went to write the cook book and
tell the story of Milk Bar and how it came

00:29:31.929 --> 00:29:39.290
to be and the attitude and the mentality behind
it and the sense of humor behind it, we broke

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:46.580
it down based on these recipes which we jokingly
refer to as "mother recipes."

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:49.059
And we relate it back to French cooking.

00:29:49.059 --> 00:29:56.820
And in French cooking you have mother sauces
and it's this well-known principle that if

00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:01.490
you know how to make these mother sauces,
if you can master these mother sauces in French

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:07.770
cooking, they gateway towards mastering French
cooking as a whole is yours.

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:14.840
And these mother sauces are the gateway to
mastering everything else in French cooking.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:21.830
And so, we approach Milk Bar with the same
mentality, where it's like, if you know--.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:23.169
There's Cereal Milk.

00:30:23.169 --> 00:30:28.280
If you know how to make Cereal Milk, you have
this gateway into what we do at Milk Bar.

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:33.030
Once you get the Corn Flake Crunch down or
the Milk Crumb down, you have this world of

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:35.600
desserts opened up to you.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.260
And that's how we do it in our kitchen.

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:43.570
We get creative by starting with really creative,
staple, pantry ingredients.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:52.200
We make thing called Liquid Cheesecake because
if I were gonna be a fancy pastry chef, I

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:57.840
might make blue cheese cheesecake and serve
it with figs or poached pears or something

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:58.840
like that.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:30:59.840
But I'm not.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:04.090
[laughter] I want under baked cheesecake because
that's the best part of cheesecake for me.

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:07.420
It's that little ring in the center when somebody
doesn't bake it all the way and I just wanna

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.130
spoon that out.

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:15.940
So, if I'm gonna be a pastry chef, I know
that cheesecake is a staple thing to pastry

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:21.770
chefs, but my cheesecake's gonna be liquid
cheesecake because that's the best part of

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:22.770
cheesecake for me.

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:24.451
And I'm not afraid to say it.

00:31:24.451 --> 00:31:28.980
And it might be a little low brow, but it
gets a laugh and you get it because that's

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.160
like everyone's dirty little secret.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:37.700
[chuckles] And that's what we have in our
kitchen and that's what we use as our jumping-off

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:38.700
point.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.590
And that's how the cookbook is laid out.

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:42.230
It's like, we make this liquid cheesecake.

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:47.240
We layer it on this bread dough and make a
cinnamon bun pie because if you think about

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:52.670
cinnamon buns, it's bread dough and it's cinnamon
and sugar and light brown sugar.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:55.720
And then you roll it up and then you lather
it in cream cheese frosting.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:32:01.250
So, I'm gonna take this liquid cheesecake
I have and I'm gonna use it to get towards

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:06.120
this idea of a cinnamon bun in a different
shape and a different vehicle.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:10.200
But the flavors are there and they make sense
and everyone knows the flavor of a cinnamon

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.200
bun.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.920
But we make it into a pie with liquid cheesecake.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:22.049
[giggles] And I think that personality and
that sort of honesty about baking and baked

00:32:22.049 --> 00:32:28.179
goods and pastries is very much the path that
we take when we made Milk Bar at the very

00:32:28.179 --> 00:32:32.350
beginning and when we're coming up with new
menu items every day.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:36.110
And that is really important to us.

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:44.290
And I think the underlying thing for us is
I started making these desserts at this restaurant

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:47.970
where everything's loud and masculine and
in your face.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:50.130
And dessert didn't exist before.

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:58.160
And in order for it to be worth my time, it's
not like I want dessert to be the shining

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:03.190
star, but damnit, I came to work today and
I worked really hard and I want everything

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:05.820
that we serve as a dessert to stand out.

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:11.590
But at a tasting-menu only restaurant when
you're already getting stuffed with twelve

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:18.370
courses and the last two courses are dessert,
it's like, how do you make your dessert memorable

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:20.340
and how do you make it poignant?

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:23.049
And how do you make it stand out?

00:33:23.049 --> 00:33:27.400
Or, how do you make people want to remember
their 13th and their 14th course when they've

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:30.910
been sitting down and eating for two hours
already?

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:40.289
And I think that's always the underlying motivation,
the underlying, "check" this is it, we're

00:33:40.289 --> 00:33:41.289
done.

00:33:41.289 --> 00:33:42.830
We're done recipe testing.

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:47.220
This is making it to the menu and well, it
still needs some work.

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.370
And some of our recipes are immediately--.

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:50.660
[snaps fingers] They hit you.

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:51.660
You have it.

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:52.660
You know you've got it.

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:58.420
And other ones are like, we're constantly
tasting and testing because it has to pass

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:04.030
that taste test where, even in our kitchen
full of cookie dough and cake batter, you

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:10.240
just want to keep going back and eating and
munching and almost making yourself sick because

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.070
it's got to hit home like that.

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:17.940
And it doesn't have to be a childhood memory
and it doesn't have to be a breakfast memory,

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:23.320
but those are things that help strike a chord
with people.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.320
It makes your eyes open.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.600
It makes you wanna come back for more.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:30.220
It makes you want to beg your friend before
they get on their flight to go the bakery

00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:34.340
and pick up a bunch of cookies because somehow
you have a relationship with it.

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:35.940
And that's what baked goods are.

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:37.750
That's what they are for me.

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:42.879
I have a relationship with oatmeal raisin
cookies because my grandma used to make them

00:34:42.879 --> 00:34:45.270
for me all the time when I was a kid.

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:48.320
And I don't want anybody else's oatmeal raisin
cookie.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:54.869
But if there's something about a dessert that
taps in to that cinnamony, sugary, oatmealy,

00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:56.970
raisony flavors on any level,

00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:57.970
I'm sold.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:04.020
I will never forget it because that's how
I was raised with baked goods.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:10.340
And that's for me, what feels like home and
what impresses me the most and those are the

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:12.780
home run dishes and those are the things I
remember.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:16.740
And it's the same thing with savory food,
but we're in the dessert world and so we're

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:23.100
constantly looking at it as a competition
on a level where it's like, how do we tap

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.280
into that as well?

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:27.920
And it has to be the most delicious thing
that anyone's ever ate.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:32.730
Otherwise, it doesn't make it onto the menu
because that takes extra time and it takes

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:39.880
extra effort, but that's how you make a bakery
like this and a restaurant group like Momofuku

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:42.670
and a dessert program like we have.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:50.130
And that is the essence of what we do at Momofuku
and what we do at Milk Bar and what you get

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:52.700
in the cook book beyond just the recipes of--.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.690
OK, you get the Compost Cookie recipe.

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:55.690
I promise.

00:35:55.690 --> 00:36:03.870
But you get this personality and this approach
and this realness about it where you understand

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:05.370
where it comes from.

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:07.031
And you're one of us.

00:36:07.031 --> 00:36:11.760
I mean, we let you into our kitchen and our
mentality and our point of view.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.700
We tell bad jokes in the book.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.880
[giggles] And we break it all down.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:22.349
So, that's what you're taking home.

00:36:22.349 --> 00:36:27.790
But I wanna see what kind of questions you
guys have because that's personally--.

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:31.450
I get a little itchy when it's time to talk,
but my favorite part is answering questions

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:35.940
because the dialogue of it I think is really
important.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.320
So, who has questions?

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.500
Come on.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:40.500
Yes.

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:44.250
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: Hi, my name is Julie.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:47.870
I love Milk Bar.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:49.930
I went there like, three years ago.

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:51.609
&gt;&gt;Christina Tosi: Oh, at the very beginning.

00:36:51.609 --> 00:36:55.370
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: I got engaged near there with
my husband and his brother.

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:57.910
So, I'm really connected to the food and everything.

00:36:57.910 --> 00:37:03.390
So, when I went back recently, your cookies
changed a little bit.

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:05.080
So, they were packaged.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.080
They tasted different.

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.690
The shapes were different.

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:14.790
So I wanted to hear you speak a little bit
about how growing and expanding has changed

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:17.640
your recipe and if you think it's still--.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:22.090
I mean, it's still really delicious, but it's
different.

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:26.250
So we had a different experience going back
recently than we did three years ago.

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:27.250
&gt;&gt;Christina Tosi: Yeah.

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:31.900
So, we opened Milk Bar in the East Village
three years ago.

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.190
And we did all of our baking on site.

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:38.869
And it was actually just me and two other
people that opened the bakery and we worked

00:37:38.869 --> 00:37:39.869
day and night.

00:37:39.869 --> 00:37:41.060
We had no clue what we were doing.

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:45.130
We just knew that we had a delicious product
that we stood behind.

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:48.190
And we had very little resources and very
little equipment.

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:56.480
And we ended up working from 6AM until two
or three o'clock in the morning for days and

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.060
days and days and months.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:01.369
And it ended up being such a huge--.

00:38:01.369 --> 00:38:03.320
We baked, we mixed everything on site.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.460
We baked everything on site.

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:07.050
We sold everything ourselves.

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:12.840
And it ended up being this crazy success,
line out the door, from open till close, from

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.220
8AM till midnight we would have a line out
the door.

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:18.520
And we would kill ourselves just--.

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:19.520
The Compost Cookie.

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.580
This is everyone's favorite.

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:26.700
We would end up mixing this dough so many
times over the course of the day, and scooping

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:33.100
it and trying to find room in our small refrigerators
to find a place to chill it before we baked

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.100
it.

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:41.290
And then we would scoop them into paper bags
on the fly while they were still kind of warm

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:43.020
in hopes that people were gonna eat them right
away.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:47.540
And if they didn't, they were gonna grease
their bags and break down because we were

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:49.860
so overwhelmed with it.

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:57.220
And I think that's what made it such a success
at first because it felt so personal and human.

00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:04.100
And it's still very personal to us, but the
thing that people forget sometimes with bakeries,

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:10.550
we've had a crash course on not only how to
open a bakery, but how to be a business person

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:17.420
on this really weird level that was completely
unslated is that you can sell a lot of cookies

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:25.690
to pay your rent in New York City, to pay
hardworking people a wage that is not poverty,

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:30.750
where they're not living with six people in
bunk beds with bed bugs.

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:36.220
In order to pay people that believe in what
you do and what they do an honest wage, you

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.400
have to sell a lot of cookies.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:42.869
And we were put in this space because we thought
we would just be this cute little bakery that

00:39:42.869 --> 00:39:45.690
sold breads and flavored butters and cookies.

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:56.349
And the demand of the business and the cookie
sales was so huge that we were all of a sudden

00:39:56.349 --> 00:40:03.480
in this small space with this dedicated team
that was getting paid next to nothing and

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.480
working day in and day out.

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.910
And it was like, we're never gonna be able
to sustain this.

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:12.240
We're gonna kill ourselves trying to make
enough cakes and layer them all on this 250

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:15.000
or 300 square foot kitchen space.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:22.080
And we got to the point that we were taking
refrigerators and illegally putting them in

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:28.010
portions of where our customers would stand
in line and wait or try and eat and lock them.

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:33.470
And illegally do it through the Health Department
because it was like, you're gonna get mad

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:35.440
if I don't have a Compost Cookie.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:40.270
And I'm gonna get mad if I don't have a Compost
Cookie for you, but I don't know how else

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:41.270
to do it.

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:45.060
And it got to the point that we were shipping
cookies because people want to have cookies

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:47.660
on the West Coast if they can't make it to
visit us.

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:52.690
And we got to the point where we just started
taking tables out of the bakery for patrons

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:56.790
and we would just start stacking boxes of
tins and stuff like that.

00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:59.810
We had no shipping area, so we would just
be like, "You can't have this table.

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:04.310
You cannot eat Crack Pie at this table because
I'm gonna put an ugly tablecloth on it and

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:06.160
I'm gonna pack stuff and send it up."

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:11.200
And all of a sudden, we were affronted with
what do we do?

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.400
And what's important?

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.470
And what's our vision?

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:16.360
And we ended up being like, "We need a bigger
boat.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.690
If we're gonna do this, we need a bigger boat."

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:22.020
And we're getting to the point that we're
almost selling enough cookies that we can

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:26.550
start to pay people a wage that's just somewhere
near honest.

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:30.599
It's not even close to it, but we're to the
point where we can provide health insurance

00:41:30.599 --> 00:41:34.430
for our employees, which is unheard of in
the restaurant industry, especially in New

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:35.430
York.

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:41.770
And we have to keep going because we're almost
to the point where we can do it all.

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:44.990
We can have it all and we can have lives and
we can do what we love.

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:49.080
And we ended up getting a bigger kitchen in
Williamsburg.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.119
And believe it or not, our cookie recipes
haven't changed at all.

00:41:53.119 --> 00:41:57.170
We use the exact same ingredients, but the
things that have changed are we make them

00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:58.170
off site.

00:41:58.170 --> 00:42:03.280
And we used to scoop every single cookie by
hand, but all of a sudden, we were affronted

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:10.550
with, "Nobody scoops fast enough for me."

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:15.240
The test of our kitchen used to be like, "OK,
you can get hired if you can scoop cookies

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:20.190
almost as fast as me because I'm gonna love
it more than anyone and I'm gonna be faster

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:22.151
than anyone, so I'm gonna scoop scoop scoop."

00:42:22.151 --> 00:42:25.869
And then all of a sudden, it was like, "We're
gonna need to hire 12 people just to scoop

00:42:25.869 --> 00:42:27.540
enough cookies."

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:30.810
And so, we had to be smart about our strategy
in how we do it.

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:36.710
We package everything, honestly because in
New York City, you are not allowed to bake

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:41.690
product off site and send it to another location--.

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:45.680
You're not allowed to bake something on site
and send it to another location to sell retail

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:50.500
unless it's packaged and it's labeled with
every ingredient and every potential allergy.

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:56.160
And all of a sudden, it's like we love what
we do on the same level, but we have to figure

00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:01.830
out a way to make a concession here or there
so that we can, so everyone can know what

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:03.250
a Compost Cookie is.

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:07.981
And you don't get as big of a bit of a pretzel
in it now, but if we write a cook book, then

00:43:07.981 --> 00:43:12.840
people can still make it at home and it's
still special to us even though it's not.

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:13.840
We're not.

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:19.500
We used to be in this 250 square foot space
with this small group of five or six people

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:23.990
that would just kill each other, like lifting
things up and over and under.

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:28.000
And now, we're in this huge kitchen and it's
like, how do we maintain our sense of family

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.781
and our passion for it and our love for it?

00:43:29.781 --> 00:43:31.980
And we still do it every day.

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:40.260
And we sometimes joke that we do not miss
that space at all because it was so hard.

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:48.730
But we miss it so much because we know exactly
what the places that we had to make the concessions

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:51.589
and that we had to say, "You wanna know what?

00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:56.430
I am not gonna be here every day to scoop
cookies and to be the only one to scoop cookies."

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:57.960
If I could, I would.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.350
But I can't.

00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:02.760
And we still stand behind what we do.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:06.730
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: Well, thank you for scooping
the cookie the day that I was there.

00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:08.010
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: Hey, Christina.

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:09.369
Thanks so much for coming.

00:44:09.369 --> 00:44:12.090
Your passion is so obvious to all of us.

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:15.290
You've already actually started talking about
this, but I remember I went to the Noodle

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:21.369
Bar the first time and now, every time I hear
about you guys, you have an uptown location

00:44:21.369 --> 00:44:22.369
and there's a bakery.

00:44:22.369 --> 00:44:23.369
You're going to Sydney.

00:44:23.369 --> 00:44:27.640
And you were already going along those lines,
but how do you maintain this kind of Momofuku

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.290
sense, like in the passion and all that.

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:30.460
'Cause you guys have grown.

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.050
'Cause you guys seem like interminable, right?

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:33.310
It's like every time--.

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:34.859
There's nothing gonna stop you guys, right?

00:44:34.859 --> 00:44:35.859
[laughter]

00:44:35.859 --> 00:44:39.830
I mean, the passion is so obvious and the
innovativeness is so cool.

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:41.619
How do you maintain that?

00:44:41.619 --> 00:44:44.170
What is it that keeps you guys special?

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:46.590
&gt;&gt;Christina Tosi: It's really hard.

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:52.310
I mean, I think that having a personality
and maintaining your love for it is so important

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:55.050
and it's one of those things that no one talks
about.

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:59.490
And I want my cookie or I want my bowl of
Ramen and I want it now.

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:10.000
And the attitude and the personality behind
it is what makes it and what drives it and

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.480
what keeps it going.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:16.820
And it's something that we probably spend
hours talking about in our kitchen.

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:21.280
In Milk Bar, we spent hours talking about
each one of our cooks and each one of our

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:26.000
employees and where they're at and how can
we get everyone to contribute and know that

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.030
they're part of this family.

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:32.930
And we'll do everything from like, "OK, we're
recipe testing or we're menu developing for

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:35.890
the next Momofuku Noodle Bar soft serve flavors.

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:36.890
Who has an idea?

00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:38.140
Fall is coming up.

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:39.980
I don't care if you're a dishwasher.

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:45.280
I don't care if you are the one that puts
the stickers on the backs of the bags of cookies.

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:50.700
You're here for a reason and you have and
you know Momofuku and you know Milk Bar at

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:51.700
a level.

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:52.700
And I'm like, what's next?

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:54.060
You tell me.

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:56.960
How are we gonna do this together and how
are we gonna drive it together?"

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:01.440
And I think creating that sense of family
and care and being like, if I have to put

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:05.780
a cookie in a bag with a label on it to make
sure that you're here and you can make a living

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:09.450
and you can be a part of it, then that's what
we're gonna do.

00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:10.650
How are we gonna do this?

00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:16.109
And so, I think it's about hiring good people
and banding together and figuring out a way

00:46:16.109 --> 00:46:21.540
to continue to perpetuate the message and
the passion.

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:23.599
And the rest of it comes organically.

00:46:23.599 --> 00:46:28.260
I mean, the rest of it like, gut checking
and it's like, "I don't know if I wanna open

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:29.510
a Milk Bar in Australia."

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:34.540
It would be awesome to live in Australia,
but is that the consensus?

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:39.170
For Milk Bar, it's like we have this team
and we're a team and if we move to Australia,

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:43.330
that means part of our team and our family's
gonna move away and is that what we wanna

00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:44.850
do?

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:46.300
Can we sustain it?

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:47.780
Can we maintain it?

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:51.990
And that's the question that happens every
time we open a new Momofuku, whether it's

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:53.260
a savory restaurant or it's a Milk Bar.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:54.630
It’s like, why are we doing it?

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:55.630
How are we doing it?

00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:56.960
Is this what we wanna do?

00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:01.210
And it becomes this very cerebral thing where
you think like, "You're cooks.

00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:02.210
You're chefs.

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:05.660
You come up with new menu things and you put
them on the menu and they're great."

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:12.960
And it ends up being this much more business
savvy, cerebral family meeting time sort of

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.250
thing about it.

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:17.960
And I think that's the part of having a restaurant
group and running restaurants and running

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:23.780
a bakery that people forget and miss, but
it actually is a huge portion of our day and

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:24.780
our week.

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:26.349
And figuring out, how do you do it?

00:47:26.349 --> 00:47:27.619
You have to constantly change.

00:47:27.619 --> 00:47:29.090
You have to constantly learn.

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:30.090
You have to eat out.

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:32.920
You have to take in.

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.369
You have to do all those things.

00:47:34.369 --> 00:47:36.201
And how do you keep with it?

00:47:36.201 --> 00:47:37.250
And how do you keep fresh?

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:39.270
And how do you keep a personality?

00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:42.849
And how do you keep your stuff trendy, but
not trendy?

00:47:42.849 --> 00:47:43.849
You know what I mean?

00:47:43.849 --> 00:47:44.849
Trendy, but not trendy.

00:47:44.849 --> 00:47:47.280
How do you stand on your own island and do
it with a group of people?

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.380
And I don't know what the answer is.

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:55.680
All I can tell you is that it's something
that we spend a huge amount of time on, figuring

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.260
out and talking about.

00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:58.369
And every--.

00:47:58.369 --> 00:47:59.369
We change.

00:47:59.369 --> 00:48:01.530
We change every, every, every, every single
day.

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:03.660
Like, "OK, we think this was a great idea.

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:04.660
Let's do it today."

00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:06.710
And then three days later, it's like, "That's
a terrible idea.

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:08.089
Let's not do it at all."

00:48:08.089 --> 00:48:13.320
Or, "I'm gonna paint the floor over here 'cause
it's gonna make everyone feel great about

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:15.369
working this station."

00:48:15.369 --> 00:48:18.750
And we just constantly change and that's how
we stay.

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:20.260
We're never stagnant.

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:21.260
We constantly--.

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:25.980
Whether it's something big or something small,
or something that goes on the menu or how

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:29.770
we tray up cookies before they get baked off
in the oven or whatever it is, and we just

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:32.850
constantly stay in over our head, always.

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:33.850
[laughs]

00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:34.850
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: Cool.

00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:35.850
You haven't stumbled yet.

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:36.850
I didn't hear anything I didn't like.

00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:37.850
So, thanks.

00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:38.850
&gt;&gt;Christina Tosi: Thank you.

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:43.210
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: I just had a quick question about
what would be the one thing that you could

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:47.270
bake literally all day and not get tired of?

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:50.290
&gt;&gt;Christina Tosi: That's a great question.

00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:57.119
I mean, for me, I feel like the answer is
always cookie dough [giggles] because mixing

00:48:57.119 --> 00:48:59.490
it, eating it, baking it.

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:05.070
Honestly, we were doing a book talk yesterday
night at Omnivore and someone was like, "I

00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:09.099
currently work in a bakery, but I think I
wanna work in a restaurant and don't you miss

00:49:09.099 --> 00:49:11.220
like working service and plating desserts?"

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:13.480
And I was like, "No, I don't miss it at all."

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:20.630
And the reason that I knew I wanted a bakery
and love what I do is because I could do any

00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:22.570
of those things all day every day.

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:26.280
If I had to stand there and put cookies in
a bag all day every day, I would happily do

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.710
it and it would be my favorite activity.

00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:34.200
'Cause it would mean that somebody's, that
many people are eating the blueberry and cream

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:35.200
cookie.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.359
And that for me is like, I'll do whatever
it takes and it never gets old.

00:49:38.359 --> 00:49:39.359
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: Thank you.

00:49:39.359 --> 00:49:42.530
And will you be making them for the holidays
there?

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:47.100
&gt;&gt;Christina Tosi: Making the blueberry and
cream cookies for the holidays?

00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:50.640
For the holidays, we have planned to take
the corn flake chocolate chip marshmallow

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:55.480
cookie and crush up candy canes and peppermints
and fold them in.

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.500
The recipe is also in the cook book.

00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:00.570
It's one of our favorite things to do over
the holidays.

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:04.770
One, because no one wants to say good bye
to any of the cookies out here.

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:09.369
So, you have to make a holiday cookie within
the realm of the current offerings because

00:50:09.369 --> 00:50:14.090
if you take the Compost Cookie away or the
Corn Cookie away, I'll tell you what.

00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:15.880
There's gonna be hell to pay.

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:16.880
[laughter]

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:17.880
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: Thank you.

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:18.880
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #3: Hey Christina.

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:22.000
Thank you so much for coming today on behalf
of everyone at Google.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.079
I think that's it for questions.

00:50:23.079 --> 00:50:26.440
I know a lot of people still wanna get their
books and they're available back there.

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:29.160
And I know she also brought a lot of treats.

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:30.160
&gt;&gt;Christina Tosi: Yeah.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:35.430
We brought a ton of cookies and crumbs and
crunches.

00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:38.020
So, come up.

00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:38.880
[applause]
