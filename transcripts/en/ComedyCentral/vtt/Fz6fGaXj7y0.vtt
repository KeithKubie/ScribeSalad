00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:05.072
- WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME,
YOU PROBABLY SEE A GUY

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:06.773
WHO HAS IT ALL.

00:00:06.807 --> 00:00:09.510
BUT REALLY, THERE'S A LARGE
PART OF ME THAT'S IMMATURE

00:00:09.543 --> 00:00:11.111
AND UNDER-DEVELOPED.

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:14.448
ESPECIALLY WHEN
IT COMES TO WOMEN.

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:17.117
EVERY GIRL I LIKED GROWING UP
REJECTED ME.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.219
AND BECAUSE OF THAT,
I'VE GROWN INTO A MAN

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:22.122
WHO'S CHRONICALLY
NERVOUS AROUND WOMEN.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:24.291
I'M AN EMOTIONAL MIDGET.

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:26.293
NOW, IF SOMEONE CAME TO ME
WITH THIS PROBLEM,

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:29.496
I'D SUGGEST IMMERSION THERAPY,
WHERE YOU OVERWHELM YOURSELF

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.933
WITH YOUR FEAR IN ORDER
TO OVERCOME IT.

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.835
SO TONIGHT,
TO INSPIRE YOU,

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:38.405
I'M GOING TO ATTEMPT TO OVERCOME
MY FEAR OF THE OPPOSITE SEX

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:42.943
BY DATING NOT ONE,
BUT TEN WOMEN AT THE SAME TIME.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:45.946
WISH ME LUCK.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.849 line:0%
 
I NEEDED TO GET TEN WOMEN
TO AGREE TO DATE ME,

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.384 line:0%
 
SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASY
TO START WITH SOMEONE

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.752 line:0%
 
I WORK WITH.

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:53.053
SO...

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:55.455
YOU KNOW HOW I'M DOING
THE THING ON THE SHOW

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.092
WHERE I'M DATING, LIKE,
TEN WOMEN AT THE SAME TIME?

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:00.227
- YEAH.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.862
- ARE YOU IN A RELATIONSHIP
RIGHT NOW?

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.497
- YES.
- OKAY.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.631
- UM...

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:07.334
- SO--SORRY, NEVER MIND.
I WAS STUPID TO ASK.

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:09.603
IT DIDN'T WORK,
AND I KNEW FROM EXPERIENCE

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:11.605
THAT WOMEN JUST WOULDN'T
STOP AND TALK TO ME

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:13.140
WITHOUT AN EXCUSE.

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:14.975
SO I FOUND ONE.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.144 line:0%
 
EXCUSE ME, WOULD YOU
LIKE TO TRY OUR NEW

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:19.746 line:0%
 
BLUEBERRY-RASPBERRY SMOOTHIE?

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.148 line:0%
 
COME ON, JUST ONE?

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:22.182 line:0%
 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY
ONE OF OUR NEW

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:25.252 line:0%
 
RASPBERRY-BLUEBERRY SMOOTHIES?

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:26.553 line:0%
 
UH, I'M JUST
KIDDING, ACTUALLY.

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:29.690 line:0%
 
I DON'T WORK HERE.
MY NAME'S NATHAN.

00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:31.992 line:0%
 
I'M JUST DOING THIS
AS A WAY TO BREAK THE ICE

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:33.360 line:0%
 
AND SHOW MY PERSONALITY.

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:34.561 line:0%
 
- OH.

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:36.997 line:0%
 
- I'M JUST TRYING
TO MEET PEOPLE AND--

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.832 line:0%
 
NO.

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:43.136 line:0%
 
I'M JUST DRINKING
MY OWN SMOOTHIE

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.273 line:0%
 
THAT I BOUGHT FROM HERE.

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:49.576 line:0%
 
BUT I LIKE DRINKING MY SMOOTHIE
OUT OF LITTLE CUPS ON A TRAY.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.780 line:0%
 
THAT'S HOW I LIKE
TO DRINK MY SMOOTHIE.

00:01:53.814 --> 00:01:55.816 line:0%
 
OKAY, WELL I THINK I'M ALLOWED
TO DRINK MY SMOOTHIE

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:56.817 line:0%
 
WHEREVER I WANT.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.820
- YOU NEED TO MOVE THIS.

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:01.054
- HEY!
- YOU NEED TO MOVE THIS.

00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:03.657
- YOU CANNOT TOUCH MY TRAY,
THAT IS CRAZY.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.226
THE SMOOTHIE THING
WAS TOO GIMMICKY ANYWAYS,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.529
AND IT FELT THE SAME WAY
WHEN I USED A CUTE DOG.

00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:10.697
DO YOU LIKE MY DOG?
- YEAH.

00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:13.200
- SAY HI.
- HI.

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:14.768
- BUT JUST WHEN
I WAS READY TO QUIT,

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:15.903
IT HIT ME.

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:18.071 line:0%
 
I HAD A MAJOR GIRL MAGNET
AT MY DISPOSAL

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:21.074 line:0%
 
THAT I WAS TOTALLY IGNORING.

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:23.544
A TELEVISION CREW.

00:02:23.577 --> 00:02:25.679
IT WAS A CRAZY IDEA,
BUT MAYBE WOMEN WOULD DATE ME

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:28.415
JUST FOR THE OPPORTUNITY
TO BE ON TV.

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:30.083
I HAD MY SOLUTION.

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:32.352
I WAS GOING TO CREATE
A FAKE REALITY SHOW

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:35.756
IN WHICH TEN WOMEN WOULD VIE
FOR THE HEART OF ONE MAN.

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:36.757
ME.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.259
IT WOULD BE CALLED
<i>THE HUNK.</i>

00:02:39.293 --> 00:02:41.395
IT TOOK WEEKS TO PREPARE
AS WE SORTED THROUGH

00:02:41.428 --> 00:02:44.431
THE COUNTLESS SUBMISSIONS
FROM WOMEN TO MY ONLINE AD.

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:45.832
OH, I LIKE HER.

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:49.136
BUT PRETTY SOON WE SELECTED
THE TEN WOMEN I WOULD NEED,

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:52.339
HIRED A HOST,
AND RENTED A MANSION.

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:55.108
NO ONE KNEW MY SHOW
WAS FAKE, NOT EVEN THE HOST.

00:02:55.142 --> 00:02:58.612
AND IT WAS
ABOUT TO BEGIN.

00:02:58.645 --> 00:02:59.813
- I'M ANTHONY NAPOLI.

00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:02.850
TONIGHT, TEN WOMEN
WILL GATHER IN THIS HOUSE

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:05.252
TO VIE FOR THE HEART
OF ONE MAN.

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:08.722
WILL THEY FIND LOVE?
WILL THEY FIND THEIR SOUL MATE?

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:12.359
I'M ANTHONY NAPOLI.
THIS IS <i>THE HUNK.</i>

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:15.362
[romantic music]

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:23.403
â™ª

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:37.584 line:0%
 
- HI.
- YOU READY, NATHAN?

00:03:37.618 --> 00:03:40.354
- UH, YEAH.
YEAH, I THINK SO.

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:43.891
- A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS?
- UM, KINDA, YEAH.

00:03:43.924 --> 00:03:45.659
- WELL, IT'S TIME
TO MEET THE WOMEN.

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:47.261
- WHERE--WHAT
ARE YOU GONNA DO?

00:03:47.294 --> 00:03:48.729
- I'M GONNA STAND HERE,
AND I'M GONNA INTRODUCE YOU

00:03:48.762 --> 00:03:50.364
TO ALL THE WOMEN.

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:53.934
- COULD YOU MAYBE,
UM, BE INSIDE FOR THAT?

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:55.369
- I'LL HAVE--

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:56.770
- JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
VERY HANDSOME COMPARED TO ME.

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:58.272
- I UNDERSTAND THAT, NATHAN--
- COULD YOU BE INSIDE?

00:03:58.305 --> 00:03:59.706
- I'LL HAVE TO BE HERE.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.074
- IF YOU'RE NEXT TO ME,

00:04:01.108 --> 00:04:02.442
THEY'RE GONNA
LOVE YOU MORE THAN--

00:04:02.476 --> 00:04:04.411
- NATHAN, YOU'RE THE HUNK,
I'M THE HOST.

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:07.147
- WOMEN MUST LOVE YOU, RIGHT?
- EH...

00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:08.515
- YES?
- I GUESS THEY DO.

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.150
- HOW MANY WOMEN
HAVE YOU SLEPT WITH?

00:04:10.184 --> 00:04:11.518
- EH...

00:04:11.552 --> 00:04:12.686
NOT THAT MANY.

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.755
- HAVE YOU EVER HAD A THREESOME?
- I HAVE, YES.

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:17.424
- OKAY, SO--YEAH,
GO INSIDE, PLEASE.

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:19.159
- WOULD YOU--YOU WOULD
LIKE ME TO STEP INSIDE?

00:04:19.193 --> 00:04:21.094
- YEAH. YOU CAN'T
BE OUT HERE AT ALL.

00:04:21.128 --> 00:04:22.362
- NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY, CAN YOU GO INSIDE?

00:04:22.396 --> 00:04:24.464
- SURE.
- OKAY. THANK YOU.

00:04:24.498 --> 00:04:27.067
I REALIZED TOO LATE
THAT HIRING A HANDSOME HOST

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:28.735
WAS A BAD IDEA.

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:31.271
BUT EVEN WITH TONY IN THE HOUSE,
WHEN THE WOMEN ARRIVED,
