00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.630
You remember back in the days right after
the Permian-Triassic Extinction Event,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.610
when that giant flaming asteroid and those methane explosions killed almost all the organisms on the planet?

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.760
No, of course you don't, because that happened 250 million years ago when mammals weren't a thing yet.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.480
But that's kind of the point of this episode: that asteroid was a disturbance to the ecology of the planet.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.260
The flora and fauna and soils were largely wiped out, leaving a blank canvas for the organisms that survived

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.420
-- and there weren't really all that many
of them -- to fill in as they could.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.700
What happened after the Permian-Triassic "disturbance"
is a dramatic example of ecological succession,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.960
how the makeup of a community changes over time, starting from, like, the day after a disturbance.

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.370
Just, usually the disturbance is a little
less...disturbing.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.209
The study of how ecological communities change
doesn't just look at huge, long periods of time

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:52.799
or the effects of some apocalypse, succession
can easily happen over a season in a park

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:56.170
or in just a few days in a patch of land as
small as your garden.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.940
And this might come as a surprise, but disturbances
that shake up that status quo within a community

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.929
actually serve to make that community better
in the long run.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.759
Because much like life and the entire universe,
succession is all about change

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.460
and change is how a universe full of nothing but hydrogen came to include a planet full of life.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:22.080
[Theme Music]

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.579
Disturbances happen in ecosystems all the
time, every day, a fire, a flood, a windstorm.

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.079
After these unpredictable events, ecologists kept seeing predictable, even orderly, changes in the ecosystem.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.000
How life deals with these disturbances is
an important key to understanding ecosystems.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.340
First, let's note that a tree falling in the
forest and a comet falling in the forest,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.440
while both disturbances, are different levels
of disturbance.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.780
Likewise, there are a couple of different
types of succession.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.800
The first type, the one that happens after the asteroid hits, or the glacier plows over the landscape,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.640
or the forest fire/volcano burns the verdant
ecosystem into pure desolation --

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.920
that's called a primary succession, when organisms
populate an area for the first time.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.440
The jumping off point for primary succession is your basic, lifeless, post-apocalyptic wasteland.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.780
You're probably thinking, "That place sounds
terrible, who would ever want to live there?"

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.459
Well actually, there is one tremendous advantage
to desolate wastelands: no competition.

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.999
A lot of organisms don't mind settling down in the more inhospitable nooks and crannies of the planet;

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.620
these pioneer species are often prokaryotes
or protists,

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.040
followed by non-vascular plants, then maybe
some extra-super-hardy vascular plants.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.580
There are tons of organisms that make their
living colonizing dead places; it's their thing.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.239
Like before the Permian-Triassic extinction,
there were these dense forests of gymnosperms,

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.639
probably full of species a lot like the conifers
and ginkgos and cycads we still have today.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.220
But after the asteroid hit, the big forests
died and were replaced by lycophytes,

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.659
simpler vascular plants like the now-extinct
scale trees and today's club mosses.

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.599
While they might have had a hard time competing with the more complicated plants during the good times,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.600
the rest of the Paleozoic flora barely survived
extinction.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.819
Of all the dozens of species of ginkgo that
were around back then,

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.310
only one still exists, completely genetically
isolated -- a living fossil.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.689
It's important to remember that when we talk
about primary ecological succession,

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.019
we're talking about plants pretty much exclusively.

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.019
Because plants rule the world, remember?

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.920
Without plants, the animals in a community
don't stand a chance,

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.260
and primary successional species are almost often plants that have wind-borne seeds, like lycophytes,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.840
or mosses and lichens that have spores that
blow in and colonize the area.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.980
And the outcome of a primary successional
landscape is to build or rebuild soils,

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.820
which develop over time as the mosses, grasses,
and tiny little plants grow, die, and decompose.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.400
Once the soils are ready, slightly bigger
plants can move in,

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:39.569
at which point we move on to secondary succession,
and then it's game on;

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.099
a whole redwood forest could develop out of
that!

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:47.759
But primary succession takes a long, long time, like hundreds, maybe thousands of years in some places.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.299
In fact, the recovery of these big gymnosperm
forests after the Permian-Triassic Extinction

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.969
Event took about 4 or 5 million years.

00:03:54.969 --> 00:04:01.329
Dirt may seem unglamorous to you, but it is alive and beautiful and complicated, and making good soil takes time.

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:06.900
Now secondary succession isn't just the next act after primary succession has made a place livable after some disaster,

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.200
it's usually the first response after a smaller
disturbance

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.429
like a flood or a little fire has knocked back the plants that have been ruling the roost for a while.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.820
Even a disturbance as small as a tree crashing
down in the woods can make a tiny patch of

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.250
forest more like it was 50 years ago,

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.920
before that one tree got so huge and shady.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.920
In that tiny area, there will suddenly be a different microclimate than in the rest of the forest,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.360
which might have more sunlight, slightly higher temperatures, less protection from weather, etc.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.390
And just like every other ecosystem on Earth,
this tiny patch of forest will be affected

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.550
by temperature and precipitation the most, which will be different in different parts of the forest.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.060
So as a result of the fallen tree, the soils will become different, the mix of plants will become different,

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.940
and different animals will want to do business
there because that little niche suits their

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.030
needs better than other little niches.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.270
So the question becomes, when does succession
stop and things get back to normal?

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.740
NEVER. Because change doesn't end. Change is the only constant, people! You know who said that?

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:08.000
Heraclitus, in 500 BC, so it's been true since
at least then. Consider it a lesson in life.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.340
And as ideas in ecology go, it's actually
a pretty new way of looking at things.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.140
See, back in the early 20th century, ecologists noticed a tendency of communities to morph over time,

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.460
but they also saw succession in terms of a
community changing until it ultimately ended

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.590
in what they called a climax community,

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.600
which would have a predictable assemblage of species that would remain stable until the next big disturbance.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.640
Well, maybe that's what seemed to be happening, but ecological succession is actually a lot more complicated than that.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.170
For starters, there's a little thing called
stochasticity, or randomness,

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.170
which prevents us from ever knowing exactly what a community is going to look like 100 years after a disturbance.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.140
Stochasticity is basically your element of
unpredictable variability in anything.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.170
So you can predict with some accuracy what plants are going to take over a glacial moraine after the ice has receded

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.830
because the seeds of some colonizer species
typically make it there first.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.450
But unpredictable things, like weather conditions during early stages of succession, can end up favoring another species.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.490
The point is, scientists' attempt to predict
what a community ends up looking like in 100

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.070
years should always be thought as probabilities,
not certainties.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.720
Another difficult with the whole model of
a climax community has to do with the idea

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.590
of an ecosystem eventually stabilizing.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.370
That word "stable," whenever it's used in
a sentence that also includes the word "ecology,"

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.160
you can pretty much be sure it's being used
wrong, because stability never happens.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.450
There are always disturbances happening all
the time in every ecosystem.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.430
A small portion of the forest might burn,
a windstorm might take out a bunch of trees,

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.940
some yee-haw might rent himself a backhoe one weekend and clear himself a little patch of heaven

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.780
on the mountain beside his house because he's
got nothing better to do.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.460
Who knows?
Stuff happens!

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.500
So instead of ending in some fixed, stable
climax community,

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.810
we now know that an ecosystem is in later
successional stages if it has high biodiversity

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.730
-- lots and lots of biodiversity.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:55.930
And the only way biodiversity could be high is if there are tons of little niches for all those species to fit into.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.860
And the only way there could be that many
niches is if, instead of a single community,

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.320
an ecosystem is actually made up of thousands
of tiny communities --

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.800
a mosaic of habitats where specific communities
of different organisms lived.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:13.580
Such mosaics of niches are created by disturbances over time, with everything always changing here and there,

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.970
but it's important that these disturbances
be of the right kind and the right scale.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.980
Because it turns out that the kind of disturbances
that have the greatest effect on biodiversity

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.910
are the most moderate disturbances.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:28.350
When ecologists figured this out, they decided
to call it the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis,

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:33.220
because it hypothesizes that intermediate disturbances -- not too big and not too little -- are ideal.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.760
See, just a little disturbance, like a falling tree or something, isn't really enough to change the game.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.080
On the other hand, a really severe disturbance
like getting covered with lava would take

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.700
the community all the way back to asteroid-wipeout
level primary succession.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:51.180
But every nice mid-level disturbance creates its own habitat at its own stage of succession with its own unique niches.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:56.060
More niches means more biodiversity, and more biodiversity means more stability and healthier ecosystems.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:00.620
Even if two disturbances happen in two different areas with roughly the same climate at the same time,

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:05.760
the stochastic nature of ecosystems mean that the two areas might recover in completely different ways,

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.280
leading to even more niches and more biodiversity.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.720
Now, this does not mean that you should go rent a backhoe tomorrow and cut a swath into the wilderness.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.720
It's just suggesting that a medium level of disturbance is natural and normal and good for an ecosystem;

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.340
it keeps everybody on their toes.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:24.580
And like I said, disturbance happens, and
by and large we should let it happen.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.300
This too is a relatively new idea in ecology.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.830
In fact, for most of the history of public
land management in the US, great swaths of

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.750
forest were not allowed to burn.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.750
People considered the purpose of forests to
be wood production,

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.819
and you don't want to burn down some trees
that are going to make you a bunch of money.

00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:43.689
But because of the lack of intermediate disturbances
over a long period of time,

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:48.620
we ended up with catastrophic fires like the one that torched Yellowstone National Park back in 1988.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:54.140
A single lightning strike totally annihilated
almost 800,000 acres of public forest

00:08:54.149 --> 00:08:59.600
because the ecosystem hadn't been allowed to indulge in a nice, leisurely burn every now and then.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.100
But now, those forests have undergone more
than 20 years of succession,

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.910
and some parts have even re-burned at a more
intermediate level,

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.270
creating a nice, high-biodiversity mosaic
of habitats.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.981
And it's gorgeous, you should come visit it
sometime.

00:09:11.981 --> 00:09:17.600
And that is ecological succession for you. How destruction and disturbance lead to beauty and diversity.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.160
Just remember what my main man Heraclitus said and you'll be good: the only constant is change.
