00:00:07.842 --> 00:00:11.345
Since their emergence 
over 200,000 years ago,

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:15.805
modern humans have established 
homes and communities all over the planet.

00:00:15.805 --> 00:00:17.495
But they didn’t do it alone.

00:00:17.495 --> 00:00:21.145
Whatever corner of the globe you find 
homo sapiens in today,

00:00:21.145 --> 00:00:24.235
you’re likely to find another 
species nearby:

00:00:24.235 --> 00:00:26.695
Canis lupus familiaris.

00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:30.615
Whether they’re herding, hunting, 
sledding, or slouching

00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:34.365
the sheer variety of domestic 
dogs is staggering.

00:00:34.365 --> 00:00:38.225
But what makes the story of man’s 
best friend so surprising

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:40.325
is that they all evolved from a creature

00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:43.435
often seen as one of our oldest rivals:

00:00:43.435 --> 00:00:47.105
Canis lupus, or the gray wolf.

00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:52.785
When our Paleolithic ancestors first 
settled Eurasia roughly 100,000 years ago,

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:56.554
wolves were one of their main rivals 
at the top of the food chain.

00:00:56.554 --> 00:01:01.564
Able to exert over 300 lbs. of pressure 
in one bone-crushing bite

00:01:01.564 --> 00:01:04.500
and sniff out prey more than a mile away,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.100
these formidable predators didn’t have 
much competition.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.940
Much like human hunter-gatherers,

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.550
they lived and hunted 
in complex social groups

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.880
consisting of a few nuclear families,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.620
and used their social skills to 
cooperatively take down larger creatures.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.292
Using these group tactics,

00:01:21.292 --> 00:01:24.462
they operated as effective 
persistence hunters,

00:01:24.462 --> 00:01:26.802
relying not on outrunning their prey,

00:01:26.802 --> 00:01:29.712
but pursuing it to the point 
of exhaustion.

00:01:29.712 --> 00:01:33.922
But when pitted against the similar
strengths of their invasive new neighbors,

00:01:33.922 --> 00:01:36.731
wolves found themselves at a crossroads.

00:01:36.731 --> 00:01:37.941
For most packs,

00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:42.881
these bourgeoning bipeds represented 
a serious threat to their territory.

00:01:42.881 --> 00:01:44.121
But for some wolves,

00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:46.181
especially those without a pack,

00:01:46.181 --> 00:01:49.111
human camps offered new opportunities.

00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:51.941
Wolves that showed less aggression
towards humans

00:01:51.941 --> 00:01:53.951
could come closer to their encampments,

00:01:53.951 --> 00:01:55.531
feeding on leftovers.

00:01:55.531 --> 00:01:59.911
And as these more docile scavengers 
outlasted their aggressive brethren,

00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:02.161
their genetic traits were passed on,

00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:06.991
gradually breeding tamer wolves
in areas near human populations.

00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:11.283
Over time humans found a multitude of uses
for these docile wolves.

00:02:11.283 --> 00:02:13.433
They helped to track and hunt prey,

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:16.173
and might have served as sentinels
to guard camps

00:02:16.173 --> 00:02:18.163
and warn of approaching enemies.

00:02:18.163 --> 00:02:22.173
Their similar social structure made
it easy to integrate with human families

00:02:22.173 --> 00:02:24.721
and learn to understand their commands.

00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:28.721
Eventually they moved from the fringes 
of our communities into our homes,

00:02:28.721 --> 00:02:32.769
becoming humanity’s 
first domesticated animal.

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.959
The earliest of these Proto-Dogs
or Wolf-Dogs,

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.299
seem to have appeared around 
33,000 years ago,

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.819
and would not have looked all that 
different from their wild cousins.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.769
They were primarily distinguished 
by their smaller size

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.579
and a shorter snout full of 
comparatively smaller teeth.

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.959
But as human cultures and occupations 
became more diverse and specialized,

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.724
so did our friends.

00:02:55.724 --> 00:02:59.664
Short stocky dogs to herd livestock 
by nipping their heels;

00:02:59.664 --> 00:03:03.984
elongated dogs to flush badgers 
and foxes out of burrows;

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:06.530
thin and sleek dogs for racing;

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.630
and large, muscular dogs for guard duty.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.570
With the emergence of kennel clubs and 
dog shows during England’s Victorian era,

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.494
these dog types were standardized 
into breeds,

00:03:17.494 --> 00:03:20.744
with many new ones bred 
purely for appearance.

00:03:20.744 --> 00:03:24.894
Sadly, while all dog breeds are the 
product of artificial selection,

00:03:24.894 --> 00:03:27.244
some are healthier than others.

00:03:27.244 --> 00:03:31.884
Many of these aesthetic characteristics 
come with congenital health problems,

00:03:31.884 --> 00:03:36.920
such as difficulty breathing 
or being prone to spinal injuries.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.271
Humanity’s longest experiment 
in controlled evolution

00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:42.241
has had other side effects as well.

00:03:42.241 --> 00:03:44.711
Generations of selection for tameness

00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:47.591
have favored more juvenile 
and submissive traits

00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:49.631
that were pleasing to humans.

00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:54.611
This phenomenon of selecting traits 
associated with youth is known as neoteny,

00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:57.441
and can be seen in many domestic animals.

00:03:57.441 --> 00:04:01.911
Thousands of years of co-evolution 
may even have bonded us chemically.

00:04:01.911 --> 00:04:05.801
Not only can canines understand 
our emotions and body language,

00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:08.181
but when dogs and humans interact,

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:10.711
both our bodies release oxytocin;

00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:15.861
a hormone commonly associated with 
feelings of love and protectiveness.

00:04:15.861 --> 00:04:20.795
It might be difficult to fathom how every
Pomeranian, Chihuahua, and Poodle

00:04:20.795 --> 00:04:22.945
are descended from fierce wolves.

00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:26.575
But the diversity of breeds today 
is the result of a relationship

00:04:26.575 --> 00:04:29.005
that precedes cities, agriculture,

00:04:29.005 --> 00:04:32.465
and even the disappearance 
of our Neanderthal cousins.

00:04:32.465 --> 00:04:33.795
And it’s heartening to know

00:04:33.795 --> 00:04:35.315
that given enough time,

00:04:35.315 --> 00:04:39.765
even our most dangerous rivals 
can become our fiercest friends.
